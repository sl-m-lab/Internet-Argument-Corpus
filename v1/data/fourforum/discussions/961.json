   "Of course I don't read them! I just randomly select them off the net...\n \n \n \n What a silly question!\n \n What I'm interested in is two things... one of which you touched upon\n \n 'more accurate' is the phrase you used.\n \n A scientist was happy to declare, using measurments, what he had found... that the stars were aged 'x'. Until it was pointed out that this was older than the universe. So, he re-measured until his measurements fit within existing theory.\n \n Now instead of being 'accurate' (or 'wrong') they are 'more accurate' thus science has not erred, just become 'more accurate'.\n \n Thus the two things, in case you missed...\n 1) a scientist who publishes his work, based on his own calculations\n He is then told to re-calculate until he fits with accepted knowledge - which itself is just speculation\n 2) terminology of authority...\n wrong = accurate\n right = more accurate\n Thus we can keep our faith in science.",

   "When it was discovered that some cosmological theories and observations by astrophysicists gave an age for the universe, and theories of stellar evolution and observations by astronomers gave an older age for the universe, this was a mystery. And it was acknowledged that there were problems in the theories.\n \n But, all the evidence points to stellar evolution pretty much in the way that the theories predict. All the evidence points to a universe that expanded from a hot, dense state, although here there are several competing theories for the earliest stages. That the universe was old has not been in question, not for over a hundred years. The theories made predictions that have been born out in observation.\n \n It was always known that the theories were not yet complete, that they could, and would have to be modified, as new data came in. This is the nature of science. As the theories became more detailed, it became possible to be more precise in the calculations of the age of the universe -- and it was no surprise when discrepencies between various calculations arose -- science is never a completed enterprise -- the assumption, as always, is that there is more to be learned. Sure enough, as the article you provided demonstrates, there was more to be learned, and then some of the discrepencies were corrected.\n \n This is how science works in general. Do you believe in the sun-centered universe? Did you know that the initial theory presented by Copernicus was less accurate than the \"state-of-the-art\" earth-centered models? By most cartoon versions of science, heliocentrism should have died in its infancy.",

   "How could they be 'accurate' and be wrong? There is nothing 'less accurate' about that, it is wrong!\n\n Really? So suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. You measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. In ten years you make actual measurements. The predictions of the first model for Mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. The second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (For comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- I may be wrong about this). So, are you saying the first model is wrong? The error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). What about the second?",

   "Actually Copenricus and Galileo got rid of the old system because it didn't explain all the movements of planets etc, in relation to earth.\n\n They got rid of it because of conceptual complications -- to get better accuracies, more and more \"additions\" (epicycles, quadrants, and the like) had to be arbitrarily added. And the sizes of the epicycles and rotational speeds had to be arbitrarily adjusted to account for the actual observations. The simplest heliocentric model of Copernicus was already extremely accurate without any adjustments. There was a bit of \"aesthetics\" involved -- because a very simple model was very accurate, it, well, felt right.\n \n \n \nWhy do you think Copernicus' system was taken up? When do you propose that it became 'more accurate' than the geocentric system?\n\n It became more accurate when Kepler, who already accepted the heliocentric model, discovered his three laws of planetary motion:\n planets actually travel in ellipses about the sun, with the sun at one of the foci;\n a given planet \"sweeps equal areas in equal times\" in its orbit;\n and the ratio of the square of the semimajor axis to the cube of the planets period (or is it the cube of the semimajor axis to the square of the period) is the same constant for all planets.\n \n Once these laws became understood, it was possible to very accurately calculate the orbits of the planets. And, once Newton, who already accepted Kepler's model despite some small inaccuracies, discovered universal gravitation and could calculate the perturbations on the orbits by the other planets, these small inaccuracies were accounted for.\n \n And when, no matter how hard people tried, the observations of the orbit of Uranus could not be reconciled with the calculations, Newton's laws were not abandoned -- instead a new planet was hypothesized and eventually Neptune was discovered.\n \n And when the calculations of the orbits of the moons of Jupiter could not be reconciled with the observations, Newton's laws were not abandoned. Instead, it was hypothesized that the speed of light was finite, and allowance was made for this fact.\n \n The point is, there are almost always some discrepencies to any scientific theory. You do not usually just throw out a theory just because of discrepencies. You try to resolve them, either by making more accurate observations, or by making adjustments to the theory.\n Edited Sept 14 17:30 GMT to add: \n It is when the discrepencies become too numerous, too large, or recalcitrant to resolution that the theory gets into trouble.",
