All the hellfire or autoburst trigger activators do is reset the trigger. They are essentially slamfire mechanisms. They certainly do NOT turn anything into a machine gun (or they would be illegal). When you \"slamfire\" what you do is hold the gun loosely and allow the recoil to drive it backwards so your finger is no longer holding the trigger, then you force it back forward again so it depresses the trigger again and fires. \n \n Personally, I would rather have somebody slam fire an Ar-15 at me than have somebody take a shot at me with a single shot .22. Slamfiring is incredibly inaccurate. Most ranges prohibit it because people generally cannot even manage to hit the bullet stop. \n \n \nI think much of the problem could be solved by extending the Brady background check to all gun sales. It doesn't make sense not to. It's kind of like the law requiring people to get a doctor's prescription to purchase certain kinds of drugs but then having a \"drug show\" where people can purchase any kind of prescription drug without a doctor's prescription.\n\n \n Is there something that suggests to you that Brady checks are doing anything at all to stem the flow of weapons to inappropriate people? Everything I have ever seen shows that gun shows and gun dealers are generally not where criminals are getting thier guns. The recent DC circuit court ruling addressed this in a somewhat entertaining manner when they stated that handguns were illegal in Washington DC, but are also commonly available on the streets. \n \n This is one place where the anti gunners are so far out in lala land it is not even funny. Did you know that illegal weapons are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than legally purchased ones? I had the opportunity to purchase a glock for $125 a while back and passed it up because there is NO WAY you could touch a glock for $125 unless it is hot. I know for a fact that you can get a Sig or a Baretta in Kansas city for $150, including a spare magazine. That is an $800 gun. \n \n The Brady bill is more expensive legislative trash. You really think that the guy selling a hot Glock for $125 is going to run a background check on a perspective buyer because we expand the brady bill?? You cannot legislate away criminal behavior. Criminals do not obey the law, that is what makes them criminals. All you would do by expanding the brady bill is annoy law abiding citizens. it has no crime control element AT ALL.\n \n If you want to do something good wiht the brady bill, support its repeal and we can use the funds for something USEFUL that actually has a chance of combating crime.",

   "I thought you meant something different and apologize for overreacting.\n\n \n Most likely due to not reading the prior posts. It was on the subject of the blackmarket and how it is possibly fed from improper storage of weapons. I made a point to Mutz about the difficulty of getting into a good rifle storage case without the aide of a professional lock pick or explosives. If many people were storing their weapons like that it would require theives to get a forklift to lift the safe out to a pickup truck and drive it away. Very unlikely as they'd have crash through a wall and attract huge amounts of attention. IMO having proper safes would cut down on the avaliability of weapons for the blackmarket tremendously as well as massively increasing prices. This of course ignores border control. But that's a seperate issue. \n \n \nI do agree that firearms should be secured, but not to the extent where the owner is helpless in the event of a robbery/assault.\n\n \n There's a difference between keeping a pistol in your underwear draw for defense and leaving your entire inventory unlocked. \n \n \nI also agree that pointless deaths are a trajedy and prevention steps be taken, but I personally believe that is the family/persons responsibility, not the governments.\n\n \n At some point if people cannot do this, then there leaves little choice. Of course having people taking responsibility would be the best choice, but in my experiences, alot of gun owners are incompetent to the point of negligence. This scares me. On the other hand I know some gun owners that have multiple several thousand pound safes that would require at least a few ounce of plastic explosives at key areas to get open. The average two bit criminal does not have access to that.\n \n \nMost robberies do occur while residents are away, but many do not.\n\n \n Actually no robberies occur when residents are away. Robbery requires assaulting someone and forcibly taking their property from them. Buglary is the term you're looking for. It also depends on your location as well.

Even I know where to get marajuana and I am an old guy who is absolutly not into that kind of thing. How would such a measure when it comes to guns be any different from measures meant to control or ban marajuana? By the logic you have exhibited above, ending marajuana use should be simple. We just have to keep drug users from having easy access. You make it sound pretty simple. We will all brainstorm on monday and by friday should have the problem licked. \n \n It does not seem like it has been quite tha simple. Instead we have bettled it for decades ad tried hundreds of different strategies and have not managed to curtail the problem at all. If I know where to get marajuana, it seems likely that anybody who is actually into that kind of thing would have no problem at all.\n \n What we have in the US is not a gun problem, it is a violence problem. Frankly, to try to push the blame off on manufactured goods is a cop out. The deeper social issue is certainly a difficult one to address, but by focusing on the object as opposed to the action you will certainly waste a lot of time with zero results.\n \n Before we even consider trying to do something about the \"gun problem\", it would seem logical to examine whether or not we even HAVE a gun problem. You are more likely to be beat to death or stabbed than shot. If you look at the number of people who are shot as a percentage of the population, you are talking a pretty small number....somewhere in the order of .000003%. Does that really constitute a problem? I don't know about you, but when I was in statistics we were generally told to zero out numbers that small. I have trouble seeing something that kills that small a percentage of your population as a problem. While it is certainly tragic that ANYBODY has to die, it happens. People have been killing each others for millions of years. We are not going to stop now. \n \n Gun deaths...especialy accidental ones...are tragic. So are bathtub deaths. So are electrocutions.

Not one post previous I addressed this thus:\n \n \n I am not talking about a person who leaves a pistol on their front porch with a trail of crack leading to the street, I am talking about a firearm that is inside of a locked house. I have already secured that firearm with a lock. I would not suggest that there is a burden upon the firearm owner to lock all firearms in a safe. It is a matter of risk assessment, and to me, the small risk of a criminal breaking into my home and dashing off with a firearm does not justify the cost of the protections ye advocate.\n \n \n \n It is about risk tolerance my good man. And the first step of risk assessment is risk identification. In this case, the risk is someone burglarizing my house. \n But don't take my word for it, let us look at the statistics. Go find the population of your county, then search and find how many homes and apartments are in your county. Ye can generally get this information readily from the chamber of commerce or other feel-good corporate body that wants your money. Next, go to the State crime registry (FBI affiliated or otherwise). Ye may then look up how many burglaries occurred in your county. Simple statistics will give ye the probability of being burglarized. It's fun! \n \n Let's take my own example: In 2000, there were approximately 141,000 homes and apartments in the county in which I live according to the county website. That same year there were 459 burglaries in my county. If one looks simply at the numbers, I have a mere 1/3 of 1 percent chance of being burglarized to begin with. \n \n But wait, there's more! Simple burglary does not guarantee that my firearms will be stolen, so if we assume a high 50% success rate among burglars, my risk falls to less than two-tenths-of-one-percent. \n \n And yet we are not finished: Not all burglars are going to go about causing wide spread destruction with their purloined firearms. Even if we assume a generous 50% of all burglars immediately leave my house and go on a shooting spree, we are still only talking about an event that may occur less than one tenth of one percent of the time. \n \n The burden of due diligence does not compel me to purchase special equipment to protect against an event that occurs less than one tenth of one percent of the time. If ye feel differently, you should probably stop playing the lottery right now, purchase sky falling insurance, and build a bomb shelter to protect ye from lightning. You have a better chance of successfully navigating an asteroid field with Han and a Wookie than one of my firearms has of being involved in a shooting. No jury in this nation is going to find differently.",

Otherwise, any storage space, including table tops is adequate.\n \n I have a friend with a large handgun collection (over 100 Lugers) and his home is well secured with locks and alarm systems. Once you get into his house (negotiate either of two sallyports), you are in his 'gun room' as they are displayed in almost every room.

Do we need 'edge-guard locks' on all knives?...just the ones over a certain blade lenght?...Are we to be expected to lock them away when not in use?...Do we cease to sell knives at department stores?\n \n The problem we have is with our culture, not our choice of weapons. Tracing the operable gun back to it's roots, we should first chastise the Chinese for inventing gunpowder. We can also lay it on the Chinese (Song Dynasty) for the first use of gunpowder as a delivery tool to spray clay pellets out the end of a bamboo stick.\n \n We can blame the Spanish for slaughtering the Maya with their blunderbusses. (The Mayans, thought for a long while to have been a very peaceful civilization had previously been slaying each other with blades. I suppose knife-control didn't work for them either.)\n \n We can blame Samuel Colt for inventing the revolver. We can blame Winchester for the repeating rifle, Sam Gatling for that famous, war-winning Gatling Gun, GE for developing the Phalynx...on and on, 'til we get to the 6000 round-per-minute M134.\n \n The evolution of weapons is inevitable.

The more laws/rules that come about, the worse it gets for the general citizen. A criminal is non law-abiding.
