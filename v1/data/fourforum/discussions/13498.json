   "Trevor Keezer didn't start working at The Home Depot to make a religious statement. He just wanted to earn money for college.\n \n \"I want to go to school to become a nurse,\" said the 20-year-old Okeechobee resident.\n \n Keezer says for 19 months, ever since he started working as a cashier at The Home Depot in Okeechobee, he's worn a button with an American flag on it that reads: \"One nation under God, indivisible.\"\n \n Keezer sees the quotation, taken from the pledge of allegiance, as his way of supporting American troops at war, and of expressing his Christian faith.\n \n In December, his older brother Army Spc. Steven Keezer Jr., is scheduled to deploy to Iraq for his second tour of duty.\n \n For more than a year, Keezer says none of his managers mentioned the button on his Home Depot apron, except one supervisor who commented she liked it.\n \n \"She actually wanted to wear it,\" Keezer said.\n \n Then, last month, when he started bringing his Bible to work, Keezer says his manager confronted him about the button.\n \n \"That's when I was told it had to come off, or I would be sent home. So they sent me home for six straight days without pay. And then today they terminated me,\" he said.\n \n Craig Fishel, a spokesman for The Home Depot, said he could not comment on specific personnel issues, but added, \"The company's dress code policy states that we do not allow noncompany buttons, regardless of their message or content.\"\n \n Fishel says Home Depot has a \"proud history\" of supporting the military, and that it sanctions several of its own buttons for employees to wear, including one that reads: \"United We Stand.\"\n \n Keezer said he preferred to wear his button because \"you can't have country without God. Every pin they showed me had no 'God' on it or anything.\"\n \n Fishel says the company gives employees several warnings when they violate the dress policy before terminating them.\n\n Home Depot worker wears 'under God' button more than year, then gets fired TCPalm.com\n \n There are several things about this article that just plain crack me up.\n It's a repetitive problem whereby Christians proclaim that they are \"discriminated against\" when the actual issue has nothing to do with \"Christianity\" at all...\n \n Here, Home Depot has a policy of people wearing a specific dress code.\n This employee was refusing to follow the dress code.\n If an employee came in wearing a button saying \"There is no God\", does anybody think that would have gone one year before being changed?\n Does anybody think that people would have insisted on trying to support their situation.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n And then there is the \"when he started bringing his Bible to work\" line... emoticon_rolleyes\n Absolutely NO correlation to the actual issue...\n No claim that the manager objected to the bible, or that the bible actually had any real relevance to the rule being applied...\n But that gets thrown in there anyways like it is supposed to be important.\n The author wants you to THINK it's important, even though there is absolutely no justification for the insinuation... :xbanghead\n \n People talk about \"special rights\"?\n Insisting that this kid should be able to violate the company policy with a religious pin would be an example of a \"special right\".",
