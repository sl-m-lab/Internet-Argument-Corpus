   "Hey, did you know there's a dating website with over 3 million members that's just for heterosexuals looking to redefine the definition of marriage? AshleyMadison.com's slogan: \"Life is short. Have an affair.\" The company tried to run an ad during the Super Bowl, but were turned down by NBC and the NFL. However a local station in Texas (which is apparently a seething sweaty hotbed of infidelity) was happy to run the commercial, which was not received very well by some.\n Football fans are used to outrageous ads on Super Bowl Sunday, but a 30-second pitch for adultery had Monday-morning quarterbacks buzzing. &#8220;Infidelity is a form of betrayal, and the idea of portraying betrayal as an answer to relationship problems is mind-boggling,&#8221; said family therapist Tim Louis in Houston. He was referring to the $250,000 spot for AshleyMadison.com, an online dating service for married folk. The ad, deemed inappropriate by NFL and NBC officials, ran only in Texas. It showed a couple celebrating their anniversary at a white tablecloth restaurant. The man blew his nose, answered his cell phone, then stood up to leave in the middle of dessert. &#8220;Happy anniversary, honey,&#8221; he said on his way out. Then came the voice-over, speaking to women: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time for AshleyMadison.com?&#8221;\n \n Louis was emphatic that the answer is no. &#8220;The reality is many people do have affairs, but they only create additional problems between husbands and wives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like a big old secret &#8212; and guilt and fear &#8212; that further isolates you from your partner.&#8221; AshleyMadison.com CEO Noel Biderman said he started the service in 2001, after reading that 30 percent of the people signing up for singles dating services were actually married. &#8220;I thought, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to be honest about your status?&#8221; he said. &#8220;About 3.3 million members and tens of millions of dollars later, I think I was right.&#8221; Today, the Toronto-based company is focusing on Texas because Houston, Dallas and San Antonio represent its fastest-growing markets. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had close to a quarter-million members join in the past few months,&#8221; Biderman said.Joe. My. God.: Sanctity Of Marriage, Vol. XLIII\n \n Now I have no doubt people will object to this \"service\". I acknowledge that.\n The really interesting thing is how this web-site has 3 MILLION users.\n The claim that gays (and/or gay marriage) is somehow a \"threat to marriage\" is one that is bandied around quite freely, although ridiculously false.\n This web-site would have somewhere inbetween 3 million and 1.5 million marriages that it is facilitating adultery on.\n A REAL threat to marriage...\n \n Quite frankly, if gays were treated IDENTICALLY to \"adulterers\" or \"divorcees\", the actual items of concern would be greatly reduced.\n Do you see people running around committing \"hate crimes\" against adulterers? (beyond possibly spouses that are being cheated upon)\n When was the last time you heard of a divorcee being fired for being divorced?\n Can divorcees remarry? (and remarry, and remarry, and remarry...)\n \n Yet the focus is on GAYS and not divorcees, for exactly the reasons I stated above (at least from our side).\n The question as to why those opposed to gays fixate so much on gays, and things like this go by and large unaddressed, is a bizarre conundrum...\n \n (unless one were to admit that the disproportionate fixation was just due to plain ol' prejudice. Which could include \"religious convictions\" or non-\"religious convictions\"...\n But the defining factor, common regardless of the presence or absence of religion, would be prejudice.)",

   "\"I recently spent a week in Gran Canaria with my wife and daughter.\n There are lots of gay people there ( I mean lots) some on holiday but most seem to work in the bars and restaurants.\n Ive always been a bit ambivalent about the rights of gay people in the past and thought that the idea of gay marriage was ridiculous but now from a secular point of view and being amongst them for a while the idea of denying them marriage seems ridiculous!\n I started to compare them with swingers( I had a lot of time lying in the sun) who have a sexual preference that defines them just as much as gay people but if you take your wife to a gang bang every other Saturday she is still your wife!\n Am I becoming a dangerous leftie!\"\n \n This was the start of a thread that I started soon after a holiday in Playas de inglis, Gran canaria last year.\n \n Slightly different point but near enough.",
