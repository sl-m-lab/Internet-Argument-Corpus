   "Is this a fad or signs of neglect by the parents? I have seen many signs over the past few years where most were attributed to lazy or indifferent parents. The lack of discipline was horrendous. The only attention these kids got were when they \"messed up\" something that would take a parent to \"fix\". Shouting and name-calling were the tools the parents used for their brand of correction.\n All too often I see young children being treated with disdain by the parents, who, themselves, could use a huge dose of discipline.\n \n Are children now more into this for attention or a way out of committing suicide?\n \n See the link below for details. It looks like \"cutting\" is on the rise.\n \n http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/mental_health/cutting.html\n \n http://www.thestepfamilylife.com/Column23.htm\n \n http://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20050223.shtml\n \n http://parents.berkeley.edu/advice/teens/cutting.html",
