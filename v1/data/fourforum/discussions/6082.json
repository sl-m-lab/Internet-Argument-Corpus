   "Poland and Lithuania claim the role of main \"democratizators\" of Belarus. And they're doing it not for nothing. I've heard with half an ear that EU officials pressed by USA have decided to fund about 10 million dollars for that purpose. In Brussels they prefer to keep silence about that, while USA is declaring about allotment of much less sum for Belarusian \"velvet revolution\" and crying all around about their fabulous generosity. But that's another matter.\n Also we could particularly discuss advisability of funding such a vast sum of money from scanty EU budget. Especially taking in account that most likely it'll sink into oblivion (judging by results of previous sponsorship of Belarusian opposition leaders, who've already provided themselves with expensive cars and realty owing to EU funding). For example Belarusian-language radio Racja broadcasted into Belarus from Poland in 1999-2002 and hitherto hadn't paid off its debts. And these are hundreds thousand euro.\n And now they're suggesting us here in Europe to finance a new shady project: to resume broadcasting of this station and to create one more in Lithuania! It is quite clear that it would be Poland and Lithuania who'll get our money. Apparently their officials have lack of cars and reality too.",

This is where they do good and eventually lead to greater prosperity for me. Not in the hands of some archaic french or italian farmer. The newcomers didn`t force themselves upon us. Far from it. We greeted them with open arms. \n \n You are just angry that EU is eating up the russian sphere of influence. Face it, you guys lost the cold war and you did hell of a job turning the rest of eastern europe against you. Nobody wants to be Russias friend once they have the choice.",
