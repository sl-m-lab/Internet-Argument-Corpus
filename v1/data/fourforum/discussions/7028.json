   "what exactly did we arrest saddam for? im sure there's somebody in this forum that knows...\n\n MSNBC News Services\n Updated: 8:05 a.m. ET June 6, 2005\n BAGHDAD, Iraq - Former dictator Saddam Hussein will stand trial for a range of charges - from gassing thousands of Kurds to executing political and religious leaders, according to a list of the cases against him obtained from the special tribunal Monday.\n \n Saddam could face up to 500 charges at the tribunal, but he will be tried on only 12 well documented counts because prosecuting him on all would be a \"waste of time,\" the prime minister's spokesman said Sunday.\n \n Laith Kuba also said Saddam was likely to be tried within the next two months on a range of charges, including alleged crimes committed in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n \n \"There should be no objection that a trial should take place within that time,\" Kuba said during a press conference. \"It is the government's view that the trial of Saddam should take place as soon as possible.\"\n \n Focus high-profile cases\n A list obtained by The Associated Press early Monday from the special tribunal, which will hear the case against Saddam and 11 of his henchmen, showed that prosecutors seem to be concentrating on 14 cases concerning his alleged crimes. Many received international attention during Saddam's three decades in power.\n \n The list contained few details, but among the crimes the tribunal says Saddam committed were:\n \n Executing at least 50 Iraqis in 1982 in the Shiite town of Dujail, 50 miles north of Baghdad, in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt against Saddam.\n Killing and deporting 8,000 members of the powerful Kurdish Barzani tribe, of which the current Kurdistan Democratic Party leader, Massoud Barzani, belongs.\n The 1988 chemical weapons attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja that killed an estimated 5,000 people.\n Executing prominent religious and political figures.\n Ordering the seven-month occupation of Kuwait that was ended by the 1991 U.S.-led Gulf War.\n The 1991 suppression of a Shiite uprising in southern Iraq.\n \n Click for related story \n U.S. steps up insurgent hunt in Iraq\n \n \n \n Iraqi authorities believe the trial against Saddam will have a major effect on curbing the violent insurgency, which has killed at least 844 people since the new Shiite Muslim-led government was announced April 28, according to an Associated Press count.\n \n No date has been set for the trial of Saddam, who has been held in a U.S.-run detention facility in Baghdad since being captured in December 2003.\n \n He was arraigned July 1 in Baghdad on broad charges including killing rival politicians over 30 years, gassing Kurds in the northern town of Halabja in 1988, invading Kuwait in 1990 and suppressing the Kurdish and Shiite uprising.\n \n The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8103488\n \n Hope this helps a little.",

   "jo, i dont know if you know this, but very often when a muslim fundamentalist family is planning a terrorist attack, the women and children are usually involved. nevertheless, this bbc article says it was about 140 men\n \n i'm still a bit baffled as to why executing people for trying to kill you is a crime\n \n as for the kurds that were killed, from what i understand, the kurds were a displaced sect after kurdistan was no longer recognized as an independent state. the entire nation had to be disipated, and about 3.5 million of them settled in iraq, and more in greater numbers in iran and turkey. \n \n because saddam ran a dictatorship, his political style included no tolerance for opposition. the kurdish iraqis formed a political force called the kurdish democratic party (mmmm.... democracy...) that often opposed saddam and rallied against him on different levels, from lobbying to the UN, to conspiring terrorist and assassinations against saddam's government. of course, this would be a big problem for saddam, so he decided to neutralize the kurdish uprising, which meant killing off many of them and causing the survivors to flee the country\n \n interestingly enough, america never made it an issue to aid the kurds in their attempt to make iraq democratic\n \n the fact is, all dictators take these kinds of actions, and some on even bigger scales. my question is, why was it necessary to declare war on iraq, if all we wanted to do was try saddam for \"crimes\" he commited years ago, and what does this have to do with the war on terror?",

We're talking about what happens after the fact.\n\n the fact: a group of people tried to assassinate saddam, failed do do so, and were arrested\n after the fact: saddam had them interogated and executed\n \n if you teach children to kill saddam because he is your enemy, then the children will believe this and seek to kill saddam. this happens all the time in the middle east. as you correctly pointed out it also is common in west african countries. \n \n basically, i think saddam should get the death sentence for killing children, if thats the case. what is appalling, and missing from the media, is that all other dictators do the same things or worse, yet we have no problem with this. also, these events took place 15-20 years ago, and its only now we seem to care. but most appalling is the fact that americans continue to sink themselves deeper into the saddam distraction and totally forget about osama bin whatshisname",
