You pay premiums and the benefits go to those who are in need of benefits.\n \n The only difference is that you support all the clones and drones in the health care \"industry\" who come between the physician and the delivery of services.\n \n Like so many on the so-called libertarian right, you have made a fetish of the market.\n \n Keep on drinking the Kool-Aid that Alyssa Rosenblum dispenses in trash like The Fountainhead",

   "Every single study ever done demonstrates that the most efficiently run health care system is Medicare. It functions with a 2% overhead.\nOh Chester, this is like the thing with athletics salaries; you look at the face value but fail to see the entire picture. Understandable since \"overhead\" is not something you learn unless you are an accountant or business manager. \n \n In any event there are about three problems with the 2% overhead rate. One, the rate doesn't account for the average cost of a patient. Lets says company x has 1 patient who costs $3,000 and medicare has 1 patient who costs 5,000. if admin costs are $300 at both places it looks like company x has a higher overhead cost. In reality this is not a good reflection of what is happening as overhead in this case doesn't matter on the level patient care.\n \n second, the calculation people use don't take into account costs for having company x provide services in place of medicare...like contracting it out. \n \n third, medicare has a huge amount of fraud and is bankrupt...much more than private. In fact, some fraud is just accepted. I know in my state we misappropriate medicare money all the time and we just say \"well we will stop when the feds tell us to stop\". To make things worse, medicare is a bankrupt system according to the GAO which will suck up huge amounts of a revenue if we maintain it as is now.",
