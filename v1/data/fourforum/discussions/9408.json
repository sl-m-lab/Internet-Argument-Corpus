It has come down about four cents where I live to $2.13 a gallon from $2.17. If we don't have disruptions it should be below $2.00 in 2-3 weeks. But frankly, I don't want it to come down. I'd much rather see $10 a gallon gasoline so we will get busy and free us from unreliable sources. We're already paying about $20 a gallon when one factors in the cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. So $10 a gallon would be a bargain. Let the Europeans settle the problems over there. It's in their own backyard. We don't have to be the world's police force anyway.",

   "**\n \n Nevertheless, the price at the pump where I live still holds rock-steady right where it's been for a month.\n\n \n This is largely because the price decrease we are seeing right now is based on the spot market. Gasoline producers do not buy their oil on the spot merket. They contract for it ahead of time (sometimes as much as a year ahead of time). Additionally, the gas they are selling today was not made with todays oil at todays price, it was made weeks ago at that oil price.\n \n Sometimes when we see a reduction in oil price they will drop gas prices immediatly based on an expectation of reduced contract prices in the future. Currently, nobody with any brains at all expects the lower price to stay there for long. We typically see an 11.6% increase between the first week of Jan and the first week of Feb. Even if that fails to materialize, Opec is still in the process of implementing their Nov cuts (should be done by the end of the month) and there is a further 500,000 per day cut due for the beginning of Feb.\n \n Given these facts, there is virtually no chance that oil will remain at current levels, so decreasing gas prices woudl be foolish. Nobody is offering large scale delivery contracts for current spot prices, which means that gas producers could not sell cheaper based on cheaper oil if they wanted to.",
