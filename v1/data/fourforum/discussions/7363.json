   "The other day I came to sobering conclusion. We must keep a watchful eye on Baltics for them to mature up to real democracies and for us to stay safe. I've always suspected the Baltics are dubious partners both in politics and business. Latvians' embrace of fishy Chechens linked to international terrorists in most profitable businesses and Nazi marches in Estonia were my first bitter tasting revelations. But the latest news surpasses all those \"oddities\" of new democracies.\n Bad storing of radioactive waste near Estonian city of Sillamae now threatens to develop into huge ecological disaster in the region! Poor storage and the criminal inaction of the local authorities may well result (and according to some data has already resulted) in the leakage of toxic waste into underground water first and then into the Gulf of Finland. At least some locals are feeling hesitant to go fishing at present time and ecologists are giving the alarm.\n What makes the story a scandal is that Estonian officials don't want the truth out. In the most outrageous manner Estonian side is keeping the EU Working Group ignorant of real state of things. It's because they need badly this group's sanction to further investments into deepwater port now under construction in Sillamae. It's beyond my words! A fine not investments would suit better the situation with this big lie!! Tough punitive measures must follow immediately imo.",
