   " The Mormon church has revealed in a campaign filing that the church spent nearly $190,000 to help pass Proposition 8, the November ballot measure that banned gay marriage in California.\n \n The disclosure comes amid an investigation by the state's campaign watchdog agency into whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints violated state laws by not fully disclosing its involvement during the campaign.\n \n While many church members had donated directly to the Yes on 8 campaign - some estimates of Mormon giving range as high as $20 million - the church itself had previously reported little direct campaign activity.\n \n But in the filing made Friday, the Mormon church reported thousands in travel expenses, such as airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals for the campaign. The church also reported $96,849.31 worth of \"compensated staff time\" - hours that church employees spent working to pass the same-sex marriage ban.\n \n \"As I read this report, it seems to raise more questions than it answers,\" said Fred Karger, who filed the initial complaint against the church with the Fair Political Practices Commission in November.\n \n Karger, the founder of Californians Against Hate, a group that opposed the measure, said he believes the church was involved financially long before the first expenditure it listed in September.\n \n \"I think there is still a lot of missing parts of the report because we know they've been active since June,\" Karger said.\n \n Mormon church officials could not be reached Saturday for comment.\n \n Roman Porter, executive director of the FPPC, confirmed that the agency was investigating the complaint against the church but declined comment on specifics.\n \n The Yes on 8 campaign filed its own expenditure reports over the weekend revealing that the main arm of the campaign spent more than $39.2 million. Total spending among the various proponents topped $41 million.Mormon church reveals deeper involvement in Proposition 8 - Sacramento Politics - California Politics | Sacramento Bee\n \n This is a pretty astounding violation of separation of church and state.\n \n Perhaps the state of California could spend $190,000 in a campaign for who the next Mormon leader is?\n Oh wait!

We have all gotten calls from phone banks for various causes and we all know that first they qualify our interest in the cause, and secondly they ask for a donation to support the continuation of the work they are doing.\n\n So you're saying that because a phone bank has called you in the past, for a SEPARATE issue, asking for money...\n That must mean that THIS phone bank must have asked for money...\n \n If anybody needs to talk about \"stupid\" conclusions...\n \n The items you quoted EXPLICITLY state that they are calling to try to change people's minds.\n There is NO MENTION of asking for money.\n Is there ANY mention ANYWHERE on that web-site of raising money??? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nAnd these are churches mind you foundit, loosely speaking of course since their link comes up \"Glad Alliance\". But they are registered with the Council of Churches as a church none the less. You will go around in circles with your denials and excuses for pages and I'm just not going to play that game with you.\n\n You can't play that game ARchie, cause you HAVE NO EVIDENCE of your claim.\n What this boils down to is that you want people TO ASSUME that money was asked for, cause you have NO evidence to show that it was. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI will post the link to post#4 and ask the objective readers to notice the dozens of affiliates this church aligns itself with the * in front of them.\n\n Just because they work together doesn't make the \"affiliate\" governed by the \"separation of church and state\" that governs the church.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nThe fact that these so called churches are tax free fronts for the propagation of the gay agenda becomes painfully obvious.\n\n Are you serious? :xbanghead\n Archie, \"tax exempt\" status is something that churches enjoy, typically REGARDLESS of how they ignore the tax exempt laws.\n That happens on the \"pro-gay\" and \"anti-gay\" side.\n If I were to give odds, I would say that if you looked at the percentage of Catholic priests who molested kids who ACTUALLY saw jail time, that the chances for the law to be enforced here is slightly less than that.\n \n Churches have typically enjoyed a status where they can ignore the laws. Getting away with behavior that would be illegal for other reasons, but they flash the \"but it's religion\" excuse and the issue gets ignored.\n \n \n \nAnd one more question which you will totally ignore but will prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that what these churches represent is a total fraud, spiritually speaking. (One example from the list on post #4)What kind of church which is promoting a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ would align themselves with [B]The American Humanist Association? Found here: American Humanist Association And that is only one of dozens of group affiliations which exist for the sole purpose of endorsing, supporting and promoting anti-christian secular agendas. Yet you dare deny what these gay churches represent in reality? Lie to yourself foundit, but don't even try to lie to me or the objective observers who will read this thread.\n\n What kind of church? Is this a trick question?\n You answered your own question. DJAN.\n And if you're looking for attributes as an answer to \"what type of church...\", we can look how DJAN describes themselves...\n \"To many socially concerned members of the Disciples Church, it appeared that the denomination was being seriously tempted to practice corporate irresponsibility and public issue irrelevancy. Seventy five persons at a General Assembly in Pittsburgh in 1995 called for a federation of existing peace and justice groups and political activists to make the case for prophetic witness. The next year, 1996, at Park Manor Christian Church in Chicago, 100 persons formally began the Disciples Justice Action Network.\n What began as a protest against an apparent religious withdrawal has grown to be a corporate force of its own.\"\n \n I know. That sounds absolutely hideous and evil, doesn't it... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I guess the bigger question is why you have a problem with \"associating\" with humanists in the first place.\n Is this an example of your philosophical anti-tolerance? Anti-working together for a common goal, even though you may not share EVERY goal in common?",

How can anyone argue that $5000 is a substantial portion of the LDS church's activities, as is required by the section?\n\n Find somebody who wants to argue that and ask them.\n I have already stated that we disagree on \"what is required by the section\", so I'm not going to presume your misconception to answer your question.\n \n You might as well be asking \"Since the blue elephant is standing in front of the blue background, how can you figure out where the elephant is?\"\n To which I would reply \"Since I see a gray elephant, I can tell you it's right there!\" emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nI think this just boils down to a badly written piece of legislation, one thing we both agree on.\n\n Whereas my solution is to make the legislation explicit, with specific boundaries, and I suspect your solution is to dissolve the legislation or apply it in a way that is meaningless when examining the intent.\n \n \n \nWhile not to the extent you do, I also believe religion holds a shielded status from gov't. Although I disagree that it is in any way limited to Christianity, in my opinion its easier to claim religious discrimination if your not Christian.\n\n I don't think it is \"limited to Christianity\".\n I believe Christianity gets extra privileges that other religions can't really dream of. It pops up in a variety of ways, like atheists who have incredible resistance in getting elected, to acknowledging holidays by which some Christians argue are for Christian purposes (e.g. Christmas) and other religion's holidays are ignored, or like Mount Soledad's continued presence thumbing their nose at clear court rulings...\n \n And as for \"easier to claim religious discrimination if your not Christian\", I suspect your confusing the cause.\n Religious discrimination against non-Christians is much more prominent. You're begging the real issue.\n Kind of like claiming that female rape victims have it \"easier to claim they were raped\"...\n \n \n \nA bigger/ better question would be why is any group, religious or otherwise, tax exempt?\n\n That's simple enough.Normally a tax exemption is provided to an individual or organization which falls within a class which the government wishes to promote economically, such as charitable organizations. Tax exemptions are usually meant to either reduce the tax burden on a particular segment of society in the interests of fairness or to promote some type of economic activity through reducing the tax burden on those organizations or individuals who are involved in that activity.Tax exemption - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nThe next would be: why should tax exempt status in anyway effect freedom of speech?\n\n Again, it doesn't.\n They have free speech either way.\n Can you explain to me how their FREE SPEECH is restricted?\n Don't answer in terms of taxes, cause you're supposedly talking about \"free speech\".\n \n What the REAL issue is \"Why should a freedom of speech affect tax exempt status?\"\n As previously noted, this issue steps beyond just \"tax exempt\".\n It has first amendment \"separation of church and state\" applications.\n \n Secondly, it's to ensure that the organization sticks to the reasons for it being tax exempt in the first place.\n It shouldn't become a front for political activity. It should stick to the purposes that warrant it being \"tax exempt\" in the first place.\n \n \n \nConsider this: the first ammendment, as well as the rest of the BOR, was written to limit government not religion.\n\n Again, where is the limitation?\n Am I limited in my \"free speech\" capabilities cause I pay taxes? No.\n It's rather skewed to pretend that removing the religion's special privilege status is somehow a \"limit\" on free speech, when the rest of the population endures taxation without such monetary windfalls.\n \n We're just saying that they don't deserve \"tax exempt\" status if they are going to stray from the real reason that they are supposed to be \"tax exempt\" in the first place.\n \n Another way to look at it is that the government is essentially subsidizing their political activism.\n Why should the government subsidize these groups' political activism?",

   "Personally, I find the whole hangup argument over tax-exempt churches in the context of church and state separation to be pretty specious. Opponents of tax-exempt status for politically active churches will sometimes argue that churches should have tax exemption status removed, but how does doing so really fix the problem of infringement of church and state (if that's really a problem)?

   "Personally, I find the whole hangup argument over tax-exempt churches in the context of church and state separation to be pretty specious. Opponents of tax-exempt status for politically active churches will sometimes argue that churches should have tax exemption status removed, but how does doing so really fix the problem of infringement of church and state (if that's really a problem)? A TAXED political church is still a religious entity that's being political. It's STILL a case of religion profoundly affecting government. If church and state separation is truly a problem, then it's a problem regardless of whether or not a church is paying taxes or not.\n\n The mormon church is estimated to bring in a whopping $4 billion dollars.\n Figure out the tax for that, and tell me if it's an arbitrary number that won't make somebody think twice... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nSo I can't help but wonder--if suddenly all churches started paying taxes--would all these critics suddenly stop demanding churches stop being political? I seriously doubt it.\n\n No. You're right.\n It wouldn't satisfy separation of church and state.\n \n In reality, you're giving yet another way that religion has \"special privilege\".\n The government would never be able to \"buy\" it's way out of ignoring separation of church and state.\n But quite frankly, would the government truly be interested (in application) in taking \"a next step\" into enforcing separation of church and state?\n Of course not.\n \n Religion has it a lot easier. They are able to sleaze their way out of honoring the constitutional concept.\n \n \n \nThere may indeed be merit to the issue of churches needing to stay out of politics, but the first amendment is the first amendment regardless of the tax issue. So if you have a beef with churches being political, call it what it is. This tax-exemption thing is, IMO, more of an crutch to criticize these churches, more than anything. \n\n ROFLMAO!\n What your argument really boils down to is that because people don't advocate being MORE AGGRESSIVE in enforcing separation of church and state, that you think our position lacks merit?\n That it's just a \"crutch\"?\n \n If I talked about throwing pastors in jail if they paid their taxes and still violated separation of church and state, would that satisfy you? emoticon_wow\n \n \n \nPersonally, I think the demands for religious churches to not dare touch politics is too unreasonable, myself--taxed or not.\n\n Of course you would...\n You have repeatedly shown that you want separation of church and state to be one way. You want the state to be forbidden from touching the church, but on the flip side you want the church to have a LOT of freedom in affecting the state.\n \n I think the situation should be a mirror.\n As much influence as the church exerts on the state, the state should be able to do likewise for the church.\n Can you imagine the hypocritical stink that people would throw out there if the government were to exert influence to try to specify which evangelical leader they wanted in the pulpit? emoticon_wow",

These are cases where the political process as it's set up in the U.S. is still engaged in according to the rules.\n \n But then you try to use the tax-exemption issue to argue for separation of church and state. The problem with that (as I was pointing out) is that making churches pay taxes doesn't really address the issue of whether or not the first amendment is being adhered to. Let's assume, for a moment, the premise that churches taking part in the political process IS wrong. It's like you have someone who's staying at a hotel for free, but that person likes to steal things from the hotel. Then the manager tell them, stealing is not right, so you need to pay for the room. So that gives the person the option of paying for the room, but they STILL get to steal all they want. Do you not see the problem there, with the basis of your argument? So the whole mindset of your argument is completely wrong-headed, regardless. Separation of Church and State is a valid doctrine taxed or not.",

Whether it's over global warming, gays, gun control, reproductive choice, etc. etc. That's what the process DOES.\n\n It's really funny to see you try to describe this situation.\n Over and OVER and OVER again, it has been explicitly pointed out that it is RELIGION's role in this which is the item of concern.\n But in reading your analysis, you either don't get that (which would be really amazing) ...\n ... or you want to obfuscate that point by ignoring it.\n \n I won't waste time by asking you which it is...\n I think most people who read your \"work\" have already formulated their own opinions...\n \n \n \nAnd this canard that \"religion\" is what's being imposed on and not \"people\" is, frankly, silly.\n\n Oh wow.\n THERE IT IS!\n You actually mentioned religion!\n < end sarcasm <\n \n It is religion which is imposed.\n Your religion tells YOU how to live YOUR life, and you want that situation to extend to your religion telling OTHER PEOPLE how to live their lives.\n Classic \"Lemon Test\" situation. If you have a secular reason for your efforts, then give them.\n Otherwise, at least call it for what it is...\n \n \n \nIt's like saying \"I oppose a company from being able to do so-and-so ..... what? No, not the people in the company, just the COMPANY. What? you mean people control the company? It's made up of people??? No, by golly, I mean the COMPANY ....!!\"  emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Jyoshu?\n Earth to Jyoshu?\n It was THE CHURCH (and by analogy, it was THE COMPANY) which donated that $190,000.\n It was THE CHURCH (and by analogy, it was THE COMPANY) which organized the anti-gay marriage effort.\n \n Regarding people in \"the company\" who went out on their own time, independent of church resources, and fought against gay marriage?\n This isn't about that.\n I have never even hinted that was an aspect of that.\n \n Hopefully, now that I've cleared that up, we can put your misconception behind you?",

   "There are so many problems with this point ...\n Why should participation in politics necessitate control by the government?\n\n Yup. There it is.\n Jyoshu DOES want this to be a one-way relationship...\n \n The issue, as repeatedly explained to you, is honoring the separation of church and state.\n That is a two-way street.\n \n Why should we set up a speed limit and road blocks for one direction, but then allow unrestricted access for the other direction?\n Makes no sense.\n \n \n \nWhy are churches the ONLY thing we put that unreasonable expectation on, anyway?\n\n Why are churches the item that we put the \"unreasonable expectation\" on the government that the government cannot legislate them?\n \n But to answer your question, let me state one major reason.\n IT'S THE FIRST AMENDMENT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE...\n The constitution seems like a pretty major reason...\n \n As for others, let me give you some opinions on the subject...\n \n James Madison: The experience of the United States is a happy disproof of the error so long rooted in the unenlightened minds of well-meaning Christians, as well as in the corrupt hearts of persecuting usurpers, that without a legal incorporation of religious and civil polity, neither could be supported. A mutual independence is found most friendly to practical Religion, to social harmony, and to political prosperity (Letter to F.L. Schaeffer, Dec 3, 1821). \n \n Thomas Jefferson: \n The clergy, by getting themselves established by law and ingrafted into the machine of government, have been a very formidable engine against the civil and religious rights of man (Letter to J. Moor, 1800).\n The clergy...believe that any portion of power confided to me [as President] will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly: for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. But this is all they have to fear from me: and enough, too, in their opinion (Letter to Benjamin Rush, 1800).\n \n The history of the world includes many examples of the dangers of religious entanglement into government.\n \n \n \nIt's like asking PETA, 'are you willing to allow the government to control PETA (a good example, by the way, CUNxTime) just so you can have the right to lobby?\n\n And there it is.\n Another attempt at hyperbole and obfuscation.\n I am not talking about absolute \"control\", but EXERTING control via legislation.\n \n Like if PETA discriminated in hiring against homosexuals, the government could conceivably get involved.\n But for the church, it is seen as a \"religious right\" for the church to discriminate in hiring against homosexuals.\n \n \n \nThe government ALREADY regulates religion by its everyday laws. It's no more legal for religious people to break the law than anyone else, yet some here DO obviously support the idea of restricting them from politics if it happens under the auspices of a \"church\".\n\n You seriously think I'm just talking about applying existing legislation, which APPLIES TO EVERYONE, when I am talking about \"exerting control\" over the church?\n \n That's rather baffling, considering my examples to date have been pretty explicit.\n I have mentioned the government trying to lobby and campaign for specific desired religious leaders to take control in the religion.\n But of course, you ignore that example.\n \n I have talked about religious RULES and how the government could affect them. The government, in some states, forbids the company from discriminating against gays.\n Religion is given a free pass on the issue. Maybe it's time for that to end, if it's also time for the religious prohibition of exerting control over government is to end...\n But again, you ignored THAT example as well...\n \n \n \nRemember, we're not talking about a state church here.\n\n We're also not talking about a generic problem with any \"people play up taking part in the political process as something to be opposed\".\n \n Glad we could clear that up!\n \n \n \nWe're talking about churches even being able to get behind a political intitiative or GOAL. That's not the church as some evil all-controlling magisterium here. It's rather the government singling out ONE group and saying 'nope, everyone else can participate in democracy, but not you.'\n\n By the same token, the government has singled out the \"group\" of religious entities and said \"you're exempt from legislation on hiring discrimination practices\".\n Can we end both practices?\n \n Can we move to \"religion can lobby for political action, but at the same time the religion is now susceptible to governmental legislation\"?",

Course it would be better if the church minded its business and the govt. was left to build roads and stuff that it was intended for.\n\n Let's elaborate on some special ways that the government leaves churches alone.\n \n Churches are typically tax exempt.\n Churches are typically exempt from explicit legislation which forbids hiring discrimination.

There is no precedent to say that the church is supposed to be reciprocal in that sense. If the church is not GOVERNING, it IS doing its part to maintain SoC&S. The DEGREE you're demanding is unreasonable. On what do you base the SPECIFIC degree you're asserting that churches can't back specific legislation?

The church is made up of PEOPLE, after all.\n\n Wow dude.\n Do you think I don't get that?\n \n Again, I have already told you that the issue is not with the \"people\", as individuals or separately organized EXTERNAL to the church, but rather the CHURCH ORGANIZATION acting politically which brings about the violation.\n \n Forest for the trees...\n \n \n \nNo, it should not.\n\n And like I have repeatedly pointed out, this practice of giving religion FAVORED POSITION, while at the same time refusing to acknowledge the OVERALL POINT of that favored position, only demonstrates an unwillingness to abide by separation of church and state.\n \n \n \nThe idea that it is supposed to be an EVEN \"two-way street\" is fallacious. There is no precedent to say that the church is supposed to be reciprocal in that sense. If the church is not GOVERNING, it IS doing its part to maintain SoC&S.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Dude. Just stop.\n Stop trying to make up things, cause you're just going to run into a brick wall that you should have known was there.\n Prayer in school. Prayer on the football field.\n Religious monuments on church property.\n Lemon test.\n \n Is ANY of this ringing ANY bells in your head?\n \n Separation of church and state involves a LOT MORE than just \"the church is not governing\".\n \n \n \nThe DEGREE you're demanding is unreasonable.\n\n The degree I am talking about is the STATUS QUO.\n \n \n \nThat's a silly way of looking at it, frankly. By that logic anyone who donates to a cause that supports legislation is \"CONTROLLING\" others.\n\n The actual statement was \"exerting control\".\n And whether or not that exertion is successful is another issue.\n \n \n \nI suppose we could say going to a voting booth PERIOD is controlling others, but it's a poor way of referring to it. \n\n And you can stop with the \"others\" misrepresentation as well...\n The exerted control is upon the government...\n \n \n \nemoticon_rolleyes I suppose if you send $ to a pro-gay organization, you're forcing your views about gays on the country. \n\n Quit trying to rephrase what I said.\n And your claim is absurd.\n Suppose I were to donate $1 million to HRC.\n Do you think that would \"force\" anybody's \"view\" to change?\n No. :xbanghead\n \n Cause the governmental action IS NOT ABOUT changing views.\n \n \n \nYou conveniently left out a key word there that I used: conflicting. These groups aren't expected to hire people who's views CONFLICT with the group's tenets. Again, Planned Parenthood doesn't have to hire pro-lifers.\n\n Jyoshu, you are either ignoring the big significant aspect of my argument, or you don't get it.\n If the majority wanted to, tomorrow they could pass a law that states \"no hiring discrimination based on abortion opinion\".\n And with that law in effect, Planned Parenthood could not discriminate against pro-lifers.\n \n The point is that there IS NO SUCH LAW.\n And please get it through your head that the PASSING of the law is not just to upset groups like \"Christians\".\n The point is because people RECOGNIZE a wide-scale social injustice, and they want to correct that injustice.\n \n So your \"keyword conflicting\" is meaningless, cause you aren't grasping the REAL REASON the scenario exists in the first place.\n \n \n \nSigh. That's because it's a case of the prospective employee CONFLICTING with the groups' tenets, Foundit. \n\n NO.\n That is NOT \"because\" of that.\n It's because people just haven't seen it as needed or desirable to pass laws for \"abortion opinion\" discrimination or \"animal lover / hater\" opinions.\n \n We could pass BOTH those laws tomorrow, if the support existed.\n And then, those EXACT scenarios would exist.\n \n \n \nPlanned Parenthood gets the SAME \"perk\" by not being required to hire pro-lifers.\n\n There is no such \"perk\".\n \n You can't grasp the difference between the law NOT EXISTING, but it could exist and it WOULD APPLY...\n ... and the law DOES EXIST, but it can't apply to churches.\n \n THAT is the real issue here...",

It had nothing to do with 'trivializing' anything. It was not intended as any sort of value judgment.\n \n \nMy point was not that you were implying that, but rather that you were FAILING TO ACKNOWLEDGE the significance of SoC&S in your statements.\n \n In which case, you can explain what false accusation I supposedly made against you...\n Please quote me... Nah. Didn't think so... \n\n \n I make an argument geared toward the nuances of C&S. Your comment back was \"...They DO see separation of church and state as a pretty significant issue\", when in fact no one here thinks SoC&S is not significant. It's like accusing someone in a blanket way that they don't think women's rights is important just because they disagree on the issue of DEGREE where choice should be a factor in the abortion debate. Or it's like saying \"well, you just hate guns\" if a person argues for gun control to a certain DEGREE. I seriously suspect that EVERYONE here believes SoC&S is important. The debate comes into play in regards to HOW it applies, not whether people think it's significant. And franly, it's a typical tactic that people like yourself tend to use. But you're not going to take that into any consideration, are you? emoticon_xdonno\n \n Nah. Didn't think so... \n \n \nThen why are you so insistent in violating it? \n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Analogy time ....\n \n If someone argues that gun control needs to be relaxed, does that mean they are VIOLATING gun laws by arguing that? I swear. You're arguing as if you just flat out don't GET the gist of this discussion. It's never about whether we should HAVE SoC&S/gun-control/gay-rights/environmental regulation/insert-controversial-issue-here. If these issues weren't ones of nuances and degree, they wouldn't be constroversial issues to begin with. Geez, talk about trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater ....\n \n \nROFLMAO!\n Jyoshu, do you really need me to supply you with a list of things whereby it demonstrates what I am talking about? There was an article a little while back about how several churches violated separation of church and state in taking political positions, as a specific point to test the law. The law is plain. I have QUOTED it to you.\n\n \n Did I SAY the law wasn't plain? Where did I make that claim, Foundit? The law can be WRONG--it can go TOO far. Sodomy laws were once in place. It doesn't mean they were right.\n \n \nWow dude.\n Do you think I don't get that?\n\n \n I think you probably DO, but your arguments never seem to take it into account. You argue against the \"Church\" in the sense that it's some monolithic institution ONLY, when in fact your arguments become problematic when the reality that these are PEOPLE behind these actions that is really the issue. Impose upon \"the Church\" and you ARE imposing on people. That's the way it works. \n \n \nAgain, I have already told you that the issue is not with the \"people\", as individuals or separately organized EXTERNAL to the church, but rather the CHURCH ORGANIZATION acting politically which brings about the violation.\n\n \n And I'm telling you that distinction isn't REAL, when it comes to the real world. The \"CHURCH ORGANIZATION\" IS people, Foundit. \n \n \nPrayer in school. Prayer on the football field.\n Religious monuments on church property.\n Lemon test.\n\n \n Tell me, do you often argue on the basis of unjust laws? Because by the approach you're using, one could say gay marriage in CA should continue to be disallowed just on the basis that Prop 8 EXISTS. You're using the very cases of law going too far in the way it's applied as argument against the idea that goes too far. Circular reasoning.\n \n I also note that these examples demonstrate clearly that religion often DOESN'T get things OVER and ABOVE what anyone else would get if they wanted to. These are things that have been taken away--people aren't allowed to pray in school, yet they are allowed many other activities that are just as benign. Discrimination/imposition due to religion, but people wanting to do similarly benign activities are NOT discriminated against. If anything, that demonstrates further IMPOSITION on religion, not special treatment. \n \n \nAnd you can stop with the \"others\" misrepresentation as well...\n The exerted control is upon the government...\n\n \n Oh how quickly you try to move the goalposts to the other side of the field when you want ... By exerting \"control\" on the government, it IS controlling people, Foundit. That's what EVERYONE essentially does, whether it's working to keep a group of people from donating money to a political cause if they're called a \"church\", or working to keep gays from being able to have legal marriage status. \n \n \nIf the majority wanted to, tomorrow they could pass a law that states \"no hiring discrimination based on abortion opinion\".\n And with that law in effect, Planned Parenthood could not discriminate against pro-lifers. The point is that there IS NO SUCH LAW.\n\n \n Foundit, do you not realize the Church IS bound by \"such laws\" all the time??? \n \n Do you think churches are, say, exempt from lawsuits if they refuse to hire a person because of, for example, gender, or skin color?? There's a long-standing pending lawsuit right now against the RCC over their discrimination toward women priests.\n \n a.) There's no law AGAINST Planned Parenthood being able to discriminate against pro-lifers in their hiring.\n \n b.) There's no law AGAINST churches being able to discriminate against atheists in their hiring. \n \n BOTH are examples that could be restricted \"TOMORROW\" if society wanted to. SoC&S doesn't prevent society from being able to impose upon churches in this way at all. I'm VERY curious as to where are you getting the idea that it does .... (And even if there were such a law that defines SoC&S that way--which I doubt you'll link to or even cite--society could easily get around it by applying the law differently.) You're arguing on the basis of what society COULD do, but it certainly COULD restrict churches too--it already does in certain areas after all. They are BOTH cases of being, essentially, \"perks\". You want your cake and to eat it too here, by basically trying to elevate churches above these other cases in terms of claiming they get special treatment. And that dog just won't hunt.\n \n And on a related point, again, you're still using a law as the basis of an argument when the issue is whether \n said law is unjust or applied unjustly to begin with. \n \n Do we use the existence of that law to argue that the position is a just one? I seriously doubt you'd go for someone doing that, yet you have no problem using the current application SoC&S laws as a basis here. Double standards ...\n \n If the example of Planned Parenthood being able to discriminate against pro-lifers is not a \"perk\" in the sense that you are using the concept here, then it needs to be pointed out the \"perk\" doesn't any more exist on the side of the Church, either. Therefore your whole point about the church getting special treatment in the context of being able to discriminate in hiring is moot.",

Anybody could fire a lawsuit cause they don't think I should \"discriminate\" against women by not dating them.\n Doesn't mean the lawsuit has any merit. Doesn't mean a judge will give the lawsuit the time of day.\n Doesn't mean I'm bound to not \"discriminate\" in who I seek for a life partner.\n \n Even the Boy Scouts got sued for keeping out gays, AND THE BSA WON.\n \n \n \na.) There's no law AGAINST Planned Parenthood being able to discriminate against pro-lifers in their hiring.\n\n But if we passed a law tomorrow that said you couldn't discriminate against \"pro-lifers\" or \"pro-choicers\", IT WOULD APPLY.\n \n \n \nb.)

It's not based on use of the 1st commandment, like religious anti-semitism has been in the past.\n John just doesn't like Jews, and he's got friends who have a club (non-religious) of not liking Jews.\n Neither John, nor his club, get any of the protections that \"religion\" gets under the law.\n Do you understand why your reasoning doesn't apply to John?\n \n \n \nI still say that if that's a \"privilege\", it's a privilege we allow other groups too in principle all the time, such as the Planned Parenthood example.\n\n Yeah. \n You \"still say\" that, ignoring the fact that we could pass a law tomorrow restricting discrimination based on opinion of abortion, and Planned Parenthood would have to comply.\n \n \n \nAnother is that we wouldn't demand an atheist organization drop discrimination against religious people in their hiring.\n\n The religion exemption is applied unilaterally.\n Not sure if there is a reason we should start listing \"Jews, Buddhist, Hindus, ...\"\n \n \n \nAnd again, none of this speaks to the issue of tax-exemption (my original point) and churches being able to engage in politics even to a degree of support.\n\n :xbanghead\n Yes. It does.\n It's all interrelated, as previously explained.\n You didn't realize the hiring \"flip side\" to the issue, and now you are failing to realize that the hiring \"flip side\" is related to the tax-exemption.\n It all goes hand in hand.\n \n \n \nIOW, what is the legal basis of this so-called \"two-way street\" being defined exactly as some here would define it? (And please, no blanket references to the constitution or first Amendment--we all know what the Amendment says. This pertains to degree and application of the constitution, not whether or not it says something to begin with.)\n\n From the same article:\n \"Never forget that the exercise of religion is a constitutionally protected activity,\" said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Michigan who has written and testified in support of greater legislative protection for religious liberty. \"Regulation imposes burdens on the free exercise of religion. Exemptions lift those burdens.\" He added, \"That is constitutionally a good thing.\"\n \n This is all part of the \"establishment\" clause. BOTH parts are part and parcel to the constitution, and the co-existence is what brings up the \"separation of church and state\" in the first place.\n Otherwise, the phrase would be \"separation of state from church\", which is apparently how you want to apply it...",

   "But obviously, in this thread with the mormons and as a sign of your objection, religion doesn't cut us the return favor.\n\n \n You've done fine here in showing how religion is given latitude due to the Free Exercise clause.\n \n What you haven't very well with is showing why the Establishment clause should mean religion is supposed to not dare touch even politics--your \"return favor\", so to speak. Remember, we're talking about merely SUPPORTING a political stance or initiative. What is your LEGAL basis for this idea that the establishment clause means churches can't even do that? (And remember, the controversial \"Lemon Test\"--something you tend to try and rely on a lot--refers to constitutionality on a given LAW, not actions a given church can do. Heck, if law is not what the Lemon Test is directed toward, the Declaration of Independence would fail it!)\n \n \nMaybe we should remove both sides of the equation.\n We require churches to hire gays, and allow churches political activism.\n What do you think?\n\n \n So you really think that ..\n Side A = tax exemption\n Side B = No degree of political support allowed on ANYTHING\n Ergo, you're fine with a church being able to put its full weight of political support on something as long as it just pays taxes? (So far, you've mostly avoided this question.) \n \n Again, that's the 900 lb elephant problem with your argument--you rely on the tax-exemption thing, but are we really to believe that if the federal government one day decides to start making churches pay taxes that you would suddenly be just fine with churches being able to support things like Prop 8? \"Just pay your taxes, and you can be as political as you want?\" Get real. Again, if SoC&S applies or not here, it is so applicable or not with OR WITHOUT the tax issue. There's no \"this-is-about-taxes\" clause in the First Amendment. What you don't get here is the REASON churches don't pay taxes. They don't pay them because they fall under the IRS category of \"Charitable organization\".  This is possible because they can fall under one of several categories: a non-profit, an un-incorporated assn, or a charitable trust.\n \n The Ronald mcDonald foundation doesn't pay taxes. Why? Because it's considered a charitable organization. Churches don't pay taxes. How do they do this? They do so because they are considered a charitable organization.\n \n By making tax-exemption and the first amendment issues, you are conflating two different things here. The tax exemption issue doesn't SOLVE OR SPEAK TO the issue of whether SoC&S are violated. Giving up tax-exemption does not serve as \"doing their part\" or the other side of a two way street in this case. If it DID, then basically religion would have a pretty darn easy way to in effect NULLIFY the 1st Amendment and therefore influence government all they want: pay taxes.",

No.\n If we establish a situation where the state enacts church policies, just cause the church has them, but does not LABEL a \"church\" as a \"state church\", isn't that like quacking like a duck and walking like a duck but insisting it's not a duck?\n The first amendment doesn't even have the words \"state church\". It doesn't say establishment of A religion.\n It talks about establishment OF religion, and if religious policies exist in law you HAVE ESTABLISHED RELIGION.\n \n As a freedom of religion, if I am held to a religious law FOR THE SAKE of the religion, how am I \"free\" religiously?\n I'm not.\n \n \n \nRemember, we're talking about merely SUPPORTING a political stance or initiative.

You insist that I should have no problem with this new triangle, since you just satisfied \"it has three sides\".\n But \"three sides\" isn't the WHOLE definition. I never claimed it was.

   "Recently, you dropped the entire post sequence discussing the \"Establishment\" clause, and its specific application to the Mormon church.\n\n \n What is there to seriously discuss? I don't really see that there is anything left to be said here, but what is it pertaining to that clause that you are wanting to talk about? \n \n \nWhat I haven't achieved is persuading you that the establishment clause should mean religion ...\n THAT is what hasn't been done. \n \n I have pointed out that what I am talking about is the STATUS QUO. \n\n \n The 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#8221; \n \n \"There is general agreement that the establishment clause prohibits an official religion endorsed by the government or preferential support by the government of some religions over others. There have been continuous arguments, however, about whether the establishment clause strictly prohibits all involvement by the government in support of religious activity as long as the involvement is conducted nonpreferentially.\" (Establishment Clause of the First Amendment: Definition from Answers.com )\n \n So obviously the point of controversy IS over the issues you argue; that's what it is that the jury is still out. Your particular view seems to be that it prohibits ALL involvement, period. It's not the status quo, however--I would argue there is no status quo on this--it's a point of ENORMOUS controversy.\n \n \n\"The Alliance Defense Fund, an Arizona-based conservative legal group, orchestrated the pulpit protest to invite IRS scrutiny and a legal fight it hopes will lead to the restrictions being found unconstitutional.\"\n To spell it out, the CHURCH group orchestrated this violation, in order to RAISE THE ISSUE in the courts.\n\n \n So what? I fully confess here I don't know what your point is with this. No one has said the church wasn't trying to raise some issue in the courts.\n \n It's no an issue of whether it IS law or not. It's an issue of whether it SHOULD be. Sodomy was against the law at one time. If the fact it was against the law was something that should speak to its moral value as a restriction, it may have NEVER been overturned.\n \n \nFurthermore, the \"why\" has been broached repeatedly. For one, the fairness attribute. Both church and state are similarly restricted, instead of having the law just give \"religion\" benefit after benefit after benefit, while the \"restriction\" side is found waning \n\n Again, you still haven't shown where you get this idea of such a reciprocal tit-for-tat relationship. The church isn't equal to government or the other way around. \n \n \nFor another, what is the point of \"Establishment\" in the first place? Do you think our founding fathers were just concerned with the phrase \"state church\"? No.\n\n \n The point is that there is nothing in the constitution that indicates they meant religion can't INFLUENCE government. A lot more is being restricted than what the constitution says, and in other matters we typically avoid that sort of thing--religion is given much less latitude in this regard than other things. I'd argue that when the constitution says \"congress shall make no law\" re. the \"establishment of religion\", churches are getting a pretty \"bum rap\" to be restricted in even being able to have any influence whatsoever. That's restriction OVER and ABOVE what the CoUS says. Not to mention that the establishement clause was meant to restrict CONGRESS, not churches. So I really don't think you want to go there, in terms of appealing to strictly the constitution here. Because you and I both know you will lose on that one. The wording is quite clear, and we've taken it way farther than what it ever said. \n \n \nIf we establish a situation where the state enacts church policies, just cause the church has them, but does not LABEL a \"church\" as a \"state church\", isn't that like quacking like a duck and walking like a duck but insisting it's not a duck?\n\n \n You know, the funny thing about your outrage here on all this is that if you were really concerned about enforcing the est. clause rather than just targeting churches (revenge for Prop8?), your focus would be on restricting the GOVERNMENT from doing this and you'd leave the church alone. The restriction on the GOVERNMENT would be your focus, with perhaps the GOAL of keeping churches where you want them. After all, it's the goverment that the est. clause targets, not churches. Actually, its only the LEGISLATIVE branch of government, if we really care what the amendment actually SAYS.\n \n \nThe first amendment doesn't even have the words \"state church\". It doesn't say establishment of A religion.\n\n \n It doesn't have the words 'no politics allowed by churches' either, but you approach the amendment that way and therefore take it farther than what it says to that extent. So your complaint here is hollow, frankly.\n \n \nHere, the \"Lemon Test\" is not the only rule of constitutionality when it comes to Separation of Church and State.\n\n \n Well by all means, what else do you put forth as basis? I've already asked once and you ignored it, choosing instead to quibble about the Lemon test (even complaining we were ONLY talking about that when in fact I asked for evidence OTHER than the Lemon Test!! emoticon_wow).\n \n \nTo answer your question, AGAIN, the answer is no.But LEGALLY as to what would be applied, the full weight of the situation would need to be evaluated.\n\n \n And what the heck is that supposed to MEAN, exactly? \n \n Foundit, you're long on generalities and outrage, but woefully short on specifics. WHAT would your 'evaluation' entail? WHAT would your standards be? Because THAT'S really where the crux of the issues come in, here. This IS where the rubber meets the road in all this. \n \n \nCause in reality, THINK about it.\n What you are REALLY saying is that a church can have a say in what the government does IN MY LIFE, but I cannot have a say regarding what the government does IN THE CHURCH...\n That's rather messed up!\n\n \n And to that I say tough noogies. emoticon_angry\n \n Welcome to democracy, where one group's lobbying may another group's effect be. If there are issues you feel are against you, then join in the fight, rather than trying to take everyone else out of the ring. If you want the est. clause enforced, then enforce it on the GOVERNMENT, where it was intended. Don't impose on churches.\n \n That's what's kind of funny about people such as yourself who get all outraged at churches. If you really meant what you say--and it was all just about the establishment clause (ha!)--you'd be trying to effect GOVERNMENT on this; your focus would be trying to do away with things like ballot initiatives that can take away the rights of people. But noooo ... all you really want to do is whine about churches. Your focus is misplaced when you invoke the first amendment and don't even go by what the amendment ACTUALLY SAYS. It's not like you focus on government here and let the effects of that INDIRECTLY prevent churches from effecting law. You instead point fingers at CHURCHES, all the while ignoring the gist of the real problem here and who is REALLY at fault in this. Churches are just doing what EVERYONE does in this country. If you don't want them to be able to influence government, then focus on the government letting them DO so. After all, the amendment is intended to restrict the GOVERNMENT. Not individuals OR churches.\n \n \nAnd what's \"charitable\" about imposing your religious beliefs upon me?\n\n \n Irrelevant. Their charitable 'status' isn't dependent on that. If they're charitable in other ways, then they're charitable.",

For the LAY-person, there is controversy. In the scientific community, the scientific acknowledgement is that \"evolution\" is a legitimate theory, and \"creationism\" is the religious attempt to procede into science.\n \n Likewise, here the \"controversy\" exists in the NON-legal world.

I fully confess here I don't know what your point is with this. No one has said the church wasn't trying to raise some issue in the courts.\n\n Sigh...\n Jyoshu, the point being that the CHURCHES REALIZE that there is a \"status quo\" which you claim doesn't exist.\n \n It's like you claiming that there is no segregation status quo. I point to Rosa Parks being arrested, and her purposeful demonstration, and you say \"so what\" completely failing to recognize that this DOES PROVE that a segregation status quo exists.\n \n \n \nIt's no an issue of whether it IS law or not.\n\n And just a few lines ago you were claiming there was no \"status quo\"...\n You are so erratic you don't even know what you're trying to argue...\n \n \n \nIt's an issue of whether it SHOULD be.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n And later in my post when I start pointing out WHY it \"SHOULD be\", you reply with \"tough noogies\"...\n You obviously don't even want to argue over whether it \"should be\" or not!\n \n Figure out what you want this to be about, then get back to me.\n Until then, you're just going to keep bouncing back and forth inbetween pretending it doesn't exist, and pretending you want to argue about the justification for the situation...\n \n \n \nSodomy was against the law at one time. If the fact it was against the law was something that should speak to its moral value as a restriction, it may have NEVER been overturned.\n\n Are you confusing two issues?\n There is a difference between SECULAR and RELIGIOUS morality.\n SECULAR morality is allowed in law. (Although there are restrictions on that as well.)\n Religious morality is not.\n \n \n \nAgain, you still haven't shown where you get this idea of such a reciprocal tit-for-tat relationship. The church isn't equal to government or the other way around. \n\n I give you an explanation as to why it \"SHOULD be\" and you obfuscate what you get, refusing to address it...\n This is part of the reason I asked you if you were serious about discussing the Establishment clause. You continually move the goal-posts. \n \n \n \nThe point is that there is nothing in the constitution that indicates they meant religion can't INFLUENCE government.\n\n On the contrary, it is the accepted and PRECEDENTED interpretation of the constitution that the \"establishment clause\" clearly establishes a barrier against religious influence upon the government.\n I have pointed out these barriers in action. The effort of the pastors to preach politics from the pulpit is an example.\n \n \n \nA lot more is being restricted than what the constitution says, and in other matters we typically avoid that sort of thing--religion is given much less latitude in this regard than other things.\n\n And the reason why has been explained to you.\n You enjoy the benefits of separation of church and state, but refuse to accept the restrictions that apply to religion.\n Tough Noogies...\n \n \n \nI'd argue that when the constitution says \"congress shall make no law\" re. the \"establishment of religion\", churches are getting a pretty \"bum rap\" to be restricted in even being able to have any influence whatsoever.

If the people put the legislation on the ballot, and Congress acts to enforce it when passed, that is violating the first amendment.\n \n \n \nYou know, the funny thing about your outrage here on all this is that if you were really concerned about enforcing the est. clause rather than just targeting churches (revenge for Prop8?), your focus would be on restricting the GOVERNMENT from doing this and you'd leave the church alone.\n\n Jyoshu, there is currently a review of Prop 8 before the California Supreme Court.\n MULTIPLE avenues are being pursued.\n We can multi-task...\n \n \n \nIt doesn't have the words 'no politics allowed by churches' either, but you approach the amendment that way and therefore take it farther than what it says to that extent. So your complaint here is hollow, frankly.\n\n The amendment also doesn't have the words \"government cannot prevent churches from getting involved in politics\" either, so any pretense that there is a first amendment violation would also be hollow, by your argument...\n \n \n \nWell by all means, what else do you put forth as basis?

I didn't \"ignore\" anything.\n \n I threw the Lemon Test out there as an example of what exists in the \"status quo\".\n \n \n \nAnd what the heck is that supposed to MEAN, exactly? \n\n Well, the \"no\" is pretty decisive, so I don't think that could be the source of your confusion as to what my opinion is.\n As for the LEGAL situation, and what LAW is applied, circumstances matter.\n \n \n \nFoundit, you're long on generalities and outrage, but woefully short on specifics. WHAT would your 'evaluation' entail? WHAT would your standards be? Because THAT'S really where the crux of the issues come in, here. This IS where the rubber meets the road in all this. \n\n LOL.\n THIS CASE is a specific.\n We have been discussing the \"evaluation\".\n \n If you don't understand something, ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.\n It's getting to the stage where I just want to go back and requote what I've already said to demonstrate definitively it isn't me that isn't having \"rubber meet the road\" here...\n \n \n \nAnd to that I say tough noogies. emoticon_angry\n\n And here is what I was referencing earlier.\n I gave an argument as to why Separation of Church and State \"SHOULD be\" as it is, and jyoshu's response is \"tough noogies\".\n \n \n \nWelcome to democracy...\n\n You aren't \"welcoming\" me to anything Jyoshu.\n Status quo IS functioning. It is working.\n You have qualms and complaints about how things are playing out.\n \n YOU complain about \"prayer in school\" policy.\n YOU complain about \"Lemon Test\" philosophy.\n YOU complain about churches possibly losing their tax exempt status.\n \n YOU are the one who needs to \"welcome\" yourself to the status quo.\n \n \n \nIf there are issues you feel are against you, then join in the fight, rather than trying to take everyone else out of the ring.\n\n Don't obfuscate the issue.\n This isn't about \"gay marriage\".\n This is about separation of church and state.\n I am interested in taking the drug doping person out of the ring, cause the EXISTING rules say that person cannot compete.\n \n \n \nThat's what's kind of funny about people such as yourself who get all outraged at churches. If you really meant what you say--and it was all just about the establishment clause (ha!)--you'd be trying to effect GOVERNMENT on this; your focus would be trying to do away with things like ballot initiatives that can take away the rights of people.\n\n We are trying to effect government.\n It's the government's status of \"tax exemption\" we're trying to change.\n And when the Lemon Test is violated, we challenge the GOVERNMENT on the issue.\n \n \n \nIrrelevant. Their charitable 'status' isn't dependent on that. If they're charitable in other ways, then they're charitable.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I give specifics, and Jyoshu claims \"irrelevant\".\n You claim \"tax exemption isn't about SoC&S\", and I point out the TAX EXEMPTION reason for revoking church's tax exempt status, and you claim \"irrelevant\".\n To repeat the obvious, even if we go by YOUR interpretation of \"tax exempt\" status being irrelevant to SoC&S, the church STILL gets their tax exempt status revoked.",
