   "\"BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) - Southern Baptist pastor Wiley Drake said Wednesday that he is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service for his endorsement of GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee in a press release written on church stationery.\n \n Under federal tax law, church officials may legally discuss politics, but they cannot endorse candidates or parties without putting their tax-exempt status at risk. Most who do so receive only a warning.\n \n Drake, a prominent pastor in the Southern Baptist Convention, said he received a 14-page letter from the IRS on Feb. 7.\n \n IRS spokesman Rafael Tulino said Wednesday that he could not comment.\n \n On Aug. 11, Drake wrote a press release on letterhead from the First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park that announced his personal endorsement of Huckabee, who also is an ordained Baptist minister.\n \n \"After very serious prayer and consideration, I announce today that I am going to personally endorse Mike Huckabee,\" the release said. \"I ask all of my Southern Baptist brothers and sister to consider getting behind Mike and helping him all you can.\"\n \n He added: \"I believe God has chosen Mike for such an hour, and I believe of all those running Mike Huckabee will listen to God.\"\n \n Two days later, Wiley repeated his endorsement on his church-based Internet show, \"The Wiley Drake Show.\"\n \n A complaint was filed with the IRS by Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.\n \n \"I commend the IRS for investigating Pastor Drake's flagrant abuse of church resources,\" Barry Lynn, executive director for Americans United, said in a statement.\n \n Drake defended his news release and comments on the talk show, saying that he was only offering his personal endorsement of Huckabee-not the church's.\n \n \"I think I'm perfectly within my rights and I am upset,\" he said in an interview.\n \n His attorney, Eric Stanley, said Drake and other pastors have a right to free speech, even in politics.\n \n \"They can feel free to personally endorse candidates. It was not a church endorsement and he made that very clear,\" said Stanley, who is representing Drake on behalf of the Alliance Defense Fund.\"\n \n http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8UPKU000&show_article=1",

Actually, the 501c3 won't because it is illegal but what happens is a 501c3 will have a subsidiary organization with a different tax status who will make the endorsement. This subsidiary is then taxed on the two dollars they make and it looks like the main organization endorses the candidate. Sneaky sneaky.",

It really isn't that big of a deal and for the IRS to investigate wastes more time than what it is worth. The only real problem is when churches and 501c3's give money to campaigns. I think that is a little over the top.",
