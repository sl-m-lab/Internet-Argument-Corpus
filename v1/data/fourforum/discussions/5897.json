   "On 16 March, 2005, in the Black Sea neutral waters Georgian speedboats seized Turkish ship loaded with flour on her way to Abkhazia - official Tbilisi in a way cuts its disobedient autonomies off their supplies and won't allow any foodstuffs in as though wants them die out of starvation.\n \n Meanwhile, Georgian ports of Poti and Batumi can hardly cope with a heavy flow of military-oriented cargo - including heavy equipment - from Bulgaria and Ukraine. Why Europe is so irresponsive? Absolutely no one cares? Or merely afraid of United States? This or that day Georgia might resort to war and what then? Europe will have to leave out Caspian oil, doesn't she? Taking into account high oil prices, I'm sure this will only redouble negative trends in European Union and can be one of major reasons for EU break-up.",

Doesn't Abkhazia border Russia? Why would they rely on \"flour\" from Turkey to feed people, rather than requesting aid from Russia?\n \n \nMeanwhile, Georgian ports of Poti and Batumi can hardly cope with a heavy flow of military-oriented cargo - including heavy equipment - from Bulgaria and Ukraine. Why Europe is so irresponsive?\nWhat are we supposed to respond to? Isn't Georgia allowed to import military equipment suddenly? They have a huge near-dictatorship to their north called Russia. Russia tried to interfere with both the Georgian and Abkhazian presidential elections to keep them under Russia's control. Russia has thousands of troops stationed in Georgia. The interference failed and Russia has been told to get it's troops out. Perhaps that is what you are really moaning about<b></b>: another European state seeking to align itself with NATO and the EU rather than Russia?",
