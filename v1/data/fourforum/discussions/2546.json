The American public is so into being right that few even comprehend the military by law and oath does zero outside SOP without civilian direction. And few, forgetting the strong direction of our forefathers to always question our government's actions, will care. \n \n When I read of people saying the mis-treatment we've given Iraqi prisoners 'isn't all that bad' it's just another reminder of how little Americans respect other people and of our supreme arrogance. It makes me wonder if they're aware that psychological damage is always more debilitating than any form of physical torture.",

   "Sadly, it seems that the full impact of some of these decisions are escaping public attention.\n \n Several years ago, our governemnt decided that our constitution only provided guidance for direct dealings with the American public and had no bearing on foreign policy. They forgot that the rights set forth in the constituion were meant to be merely offical recognition of pre-existing rights which ALL people are supposed to posess.\n \n As a result, they felt free to deal with any tyrant, and oppressive, totalitarian jerk that they felt they could exploit for economic gain. Not only did our government feel free to deal with these people, they felt free to install their OWN tyrant should it prove more profitable.\n \n What we are seeing today in the form of terrorist attacks and a pervasive world wide anti-US sentiment is backlash from these many years poor forign policy driven only by the needs of special interests and corporate expansion and put into effect by a government which has freed itself from any type of humanitarian controls. \n \n So, you end up with foreign nationals being held at US naval bases without charges or trial. From there, it is only a very small step to imprisoning US citizens without trial, charges, or access to the courts. And, true to the nature of governments throughout history (the consolidation of power) we took that little tiny step and nobody really noticed. After all, for months we had heard about foreign \"detainees\", and had been assured that this was all perfectly legal, if viewed from a certian angle.\n \n Years ago, there was a system put in place to monitor international phone calls wihtout warrant or court order. When the news broke (and we found to our surprise that the conspiracy nuts were actually right about that one), we were assured that, when viewed from a certian angle, this was all perfectly legal. No rights were being infringed upon. From there, it is only a very tiny step to allowing \"sneak and peek\" warrants without any evidence or even the \"stringent\" requirements formerly needed to meet the burden of \"probable cause\". \n \n It is also not a big step to a massive data mining operation that collects sensitive data about every American to be pulled up at will by the US government. We took both of these tiny, insignificant steps, and with a relatively low level of protest. \n \n It is a slippery slope indeed.",
