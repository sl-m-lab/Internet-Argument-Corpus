   "I was reading this today: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF LAO TAN\n \n 'The writings and the philosophy of Huai Nan Tz\u00fb, are deeply rooted in the ideas of Lao Tan, the reputed founder of Taoism. In order, therefore, to have a better understanding of the teaching of Huai Nan Tz\u00fb, it is necessary to be acquainted with the learning of Lao Tan.\n \n It is well to remember that there were two influences in the training of Lao Tan, one being his vocation, the other his environment. His vocation was that of Royal Historiographer. He had, thus, the means of knowledge and of intercourse denied to most. His environment, undoubtedly, coloured his views and modified all his ideas. It, in many respects, directed his thoughts, as he surveyed his surroundings, to a consideration of the true and lasting foundation of social and political life. It was the conditions of Eastern Chou that formed his environment. The laws of the State were in decay and human relationships in ruins. Loyalty and filial piety, which are the pillars of society, were rotten; and truth and justice were languishing. Ministers murdered their princes and sons their fathers. There was anarchy and disloyalty. Lao Tan, being the historian, knew well the history of the country from ancient times, and could trace the causes that had produced the lamentable anarchy of his times. This explains a passage in the Han work, Records of the Arts and Literature of the Han ### which says that the Taoist stream of ideas issued from the Ministry of History. The Minister had studied and knew the successive periods of the rise and fall, the vitality and dissolution of kingdoms, through the ages, and, therefore, appreciated important principles and grasped the essentials of the success and failures of government. The principles of success, he judged, depended on purity, spirituality, humility and yieldingness.\"\n \n If I understand this correctly, Taoism was started by a man who desired to improve the condition of his society by abolishing the harsh teaching of Confucius and replacing them with a more passive way of life.\n \n Isn't this how and why Christianity was started?\n Weren't the harsh laws of Moses set aside for the more compassionate teaching of Jesus?",

And it will try to convince you not to commit to any belief about our existence that cannot be proven beyond doubt.'\n \n Chapter 15: Politics and Religion\n\n \n Some might call it chaos.\n \n \nThe Blessings of Chaos\n \n How does our DNA inspire such indeterminacy? After all, Middlemarch had an author; she deliberately crafted an ambiguous ending. But real life doesn't have an intelligent designer. In order to create the wiggle room necessary for individual freedom, natural selection came up with an ingenious, if unnerving, solution. Although we like to imagine life as a perfectly engineered creation (our cells like little Swiss clocks), the truth is that our parts aren't predictable. Bob Dylan once said, \"I accept chaos, I'm not sure whether it accepts me.\" Molecular biology, confronted with the unruliness of life, is also forced to accept chaos. Just as physics discovered the indeterminate quantum world - a discovery that erased classical notions about the fixed reality of time & space - so biology is uncovering the unknowable mess at its core. Life is built on an edifice of randomness.\n \n One of the first insights into the natural disorder of life arrived in 1968, when Motoo Kimura, the great Japanese geneticist, introduced evolutionary biology to his \"neutral theory of molecular evolution.\" This is a staid name for what many scientists consider the most interesting revision of evolutionary theory since Darwin. Kimura's discovery began with a paradox. Starting in the early 1960's, biologists could finally measure the rate of genetic change in species undergoing natural selection. As expected, the engine of evolution was random mutation: double helices suffered from a constant barrage of editing errors. Buried in this data, however, was an uncomfortable new fact: DNA changes way too much. According to Kimura's calculations, the average genome was changing at a hundred times the rate predicted by the equation of evolution. In fact, DNA was changing so much that there was no possible way natural selection could account for all of these so-called adaptations.\n \n But if natural selection wasn't driving the evolution of our genes, then what was? Kimura's answer was simple: chaos. Pure chance. The dice of mutation & the poker of genetic drift. At the level of our DNA, evolution works mostly by accident. Your genome is a record of random mistakes.\n \n But perhaps that randomness is confined to our DNA. The clock-like cell must restore some sense of order, right? Certainly the translation of our genome - the expression of our actual genes - is a perfectly regulated process, with no hint of disarray. How else could we function? Although molecular biology used to assume that was the case, it isn't. Life is slipshod. Inside our cells, shards & scraps of nucleic acid & protein float around aimlessly, waiting to interact. There is no guiding hand, no guarantee of exactness.\n \n In a 2002 Science paper entitled, \"Stochastic Gene Expression is a Single Cell[/i], Michael Elowitz of Caltech demonstrated that biological \"noise\" (a scientific synonym for chaos) is inherent in gene expression. ...\" \n - Jonah Lehrer, Proust was a Neuroscientist \n\n \n There are (way) more things in Heaven & Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your (or anyone else's) philosophy (or whatever). \n \n What about all of the things that exist beyond the frame? Of any framework? Unruliness rules! This way of thinking also blows apart the Cartesian ideas (life as clockwork). Granted, the Cartesian ideas have brought Humanity many wonderful gifts, especially in the areas of the sciences & the technologies. Motoo Kimura's evolutionary theory (like any good hypothesis) began with a paradox. He sought to explain the evidence. Does his theory explain/interpret the evidence any better than the current theories in play? That is science. It doesn't stop looking. \n \n It is what it is. Isn't that a type of joy? Hoping I never lose my 'holy' or 'unholy' curiosity & desire in thinking about these things.",

   "Among the southern fundamentalists the concept of the 'rapture' was brought to a new level of stupidity and ignorence.\n\n \n I went to a Catholic grammar school & a Catholic high school. I never heard of the 'rapture' until I lived in the Southern USA for a time.\n \n \nWhat is the rapture?\n The Rapture is a future event expected by many -- perhaps most -- born-again Protestants. They are certain that they, alone, will engage in a mass migration in the near future. They believe that those born-again Christians who have died will have their bodies reconstituted and will ascend through the air, and meet Jesus Christ in the sky. This will be followed by a second mass migration of the born-again who are currently alive. \n \n The word \"Rapture\" comes from the Latin word \"Rapare\" which means to take away or to snatch out. This would be a remarkable event. As it is described in Evangelical literature, pilots would disappear from planes, truck drivers from their trucks; people from automobiles, etc. Some born-again Christians believe that a family will be eating dinner, when some of the members will float upwards from their seats, pass through the roof and keep rising through the air towards Jesus.\n \n An associated event is Christ's imminent return (also known as the \"second coming\" and \"parousia\"). This has been expected by many Christians for almost 2 millennia. It was described by the Greek word \"parousia\" (coming, arrival, presence) during the 1st century CE. Justin Martyr introduced the term \"second coming\" in the 2nd century.\n \n Ever since Christ's death, many Christians have been expecting the second coming in their immediate future. Most Fundamentalist and other conservative Christians believe that The Rapture will occur when Christ first returns towards earth. Most believe that Christ will not actually land or stay on earth at this time; the \"real\" second coming will occur later, when he returns on a horse leading an army on horseback who will exterminate one third of the earth's population in a massive, bloody genocide. It will be numerically the largest mass extermination of humans in history. In terms of the percentage of humans to be killed in a genocide, it will be second only to the flood of Noah, which resulted in the deaths of every adult, child, infant and newborn on earth, with the exception of Noah and seven members of his immediate family.\n \n The rapture concept is a relatively new belief. It is essentially ignored by most other Christian faith groups. It does not form a part of any other religion. It is dismissed by essentially all liberal Christian theologians. Many mainline and liberal Bible handbooks, commentaries, dictionaries and encyclopedia do not even list \"rapture\" in their indices.\n Introduction to the Rapture\n \n\n \n Call me crazy but I still find it hard to comprehend how a person can reconcile the concept of a God who will \" return on a horse leading an army on horseback & who will exterminate one third of the earth's population in a massive, bloody genocide\" with the concept of a Loving God.",

   "The words of a great man:\n \n I believe in one God, I believe in the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy. But I do not believe in the creed professed by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. \n \n I have thought it exceedingly probable that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The connection between church and state has so effectively prohibited every discussion on the principles of religion, that until the system of government is changed, religious principles cannot be discussed openly before the world. But whenever change is done, then a revolution in the system of religion will follow. \n \n Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God, which was communicated to certain individuals. And they each have certain books, which are supposed to reveal the word of God. And they each accuse the other of not believing the truth, and for my own part, I disbelieve them all. All national churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me to be nothing more than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\n I couldn't have said it better myself. emoticon_xgood",

Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. \n \n We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members.

History supports evil as being a part of every generation.\n\n \n Why does it seem that we create the Gods in our own image? & why does the end-result so very often seem to be that God is a petty tyrannical maniac rather than the embodiment of the best of Humanity? \n \n As to what Jesus may have been getting at? This may come from left field but I think Jesus just may have been trying to say that we are all the sons & daughters of Gods. \n \n Here are some of the reasons why I think he just might've been going there: \n \n \nScripture says, No one knows the Father but the Son.\" Therefore, if you want to know God, you must not only be like the Son, you must be the Son. \n -Meister Eckhart \n \n You have heard that it was said, \"You shall love your neighbor & hate your enemy.\" But I say to you, Love your enemies & pray for those who persecute you so that you may be children of your Father in Heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil & on the good, & sends rain on the righteous & on the unrighteous. \n \n At that time the disciples came to Jesus & asked, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" He called a child, whom he put among them, & said, \"Truly I tell you, unless you change & become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\" \n \n \"When you know yourselves, then you will be known, & you will understand that you are children of the living father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you dwell in poverty, and you are poverty.\" \n \n His followers said to him, \"When will the kingdom come?\" \"It will not come by watching for it, It will not be said, 'Look here it is,\" or 'Look, there it is.' Rather, the father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, & people do not see it.\"\n\n \n I also happen to like the parts where Jesus attempts to address the hypocrites of his day. (Unfortunately, some things never seem to change.) As Desmond Tutu said, \"People with power have an incredible capacity for wanting to be able to retain that power & don't like scrutiny.\" \n \n \nOnce Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, and he answered, \"The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.\" \n \n Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? \n \n Do not give what is holy to dogs; & do not throw your pearls before swine. \n \n Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. \n \n Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there; and he said, \"It is written, \n 'My house shall be a house of prayer'; \n but you have made it a den of robbers.\" \n \n Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, & have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice & mercy & faith. It is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel! \n \n Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\"\n\n \n Love has to be lived for its own sake.

And he took it, and did eat before them.\" (Luke 24:36-43)\n \n What was Jesus trying to prove by all his demonstrations of wanting his hands and feet to be handled and chewing and masticating broiled fish and honeycomb? Was all this a pretense, make-belief, an act or drama? \"No!\" Said Schleliermacher in 1819, a hundred years before I was born. Albert Schweizer records him saying: \"If Christ had only eaten to show that he could eat, while he really had no need of nourishment, if would have been a pretense, something docetic.\"( In Quest of the Historical Jesus, page 64).\n\n \n The thing is, Luke was writing from stories that were told from 'before', possibly as late as the early 2nd century.Since the writing is so far removed from any potential events that might or might not have happened, anything Luke said about it could be artistic license or rumor",

It is in black and white in the bible: the disciples were not trustworthy and they were slackers - not to mention supposedly full of a sinful nature (which your god supposedly gave them at birth). Your witnesses have ZERO credibility.\n If I tell someone that I fell into a sink hole but, there is no sink hole and I am lying, and the person I tell it to thinks it is some kind of miracle that I survived this imaginary ordeal and this person tells 1,000,000,000 other people...it is still a lie.\n \n \nIt's much more involved than that.
