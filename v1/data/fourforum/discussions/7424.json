Do you believe (and maybe I should have said in the US society) that if you break a law then you should be punished in some manner...I'm not saying what the punishment would be. If you can make judgements on whether or not a rapist should get punished for his crime then surely you can make a judgement in these 3 cases.",

If my actions were reasonable, but still illegal, rather than (or perhaps in addition to) punishment, steps should be taken to change the circumstances that led to the breaking of the law. Abortions should be legalised, tax rorts minimised, and more public transport and anti drink-driving advertisements initiated.",

It many states that is probably true for abortion.\n \n \n Why is it unrighteous anyway? Only because you disagree with it :)",
