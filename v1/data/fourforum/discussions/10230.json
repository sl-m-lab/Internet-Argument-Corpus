Attempted suicide is not illegal either, that is why they are not treated like law breakers. They are not sent to a mental institution for mandatory observation. If this person is taken to a medical facility they may possibly be held against their will. In most states, there is something called a two-person hold, where if two doctors deem this person is mentally incapacitated to the point where they feel the patient is a danger to themselves or others they may be held for three days until seen by a judge who then determines what to do. Almost never are they held after that. In most cases, the situation can be calmed down so it never gets to a court. In the case of the attempted suicide, one must determine if they are \"actively suicidal\", or likely to attempt it again soon. Most often, if there is some support system, they can be discharged to someone else's care. It is now uncommon for folks to be admitted to the psych unit. One reality is that there simply are not that many psych beds any more do to lack of funding. \n \n You are right. Morality and legality are different. There are many immoral things that are not illegal. You say they are two sides of the same issue. What issue is that?\n \n Suicide is frown upon because we don't want to see a life wasted. This has nothing to do with spiritual foundation. Human lives are considered by most to have great value. The depressed person is not thinking rationally. Death seems preferably to life in the distorted thought processes of depression. Most depression can be treated. \n \n Again, what are you trying to get at? \n If you are trying to imply the lack of spirituality means we should not care about human life, you are mistaken.",

   "A good example of a clouded Moral Judgment would be with Jesus himself. Where the Jews justified in seeking Jesus death?\n \n Even today the Jewish state is the Religion. They are one in the same. Israel is a church state. When Jesus attacked the money lenders and church leaders right in the temple, he attacked something like lobbyists and Senators here at home. Jesus spoke against the holding back of taxes to Rome which was being used to suppress his state and her people. Jesus aided a Roman General (healing his servant) who was clearly there to maintain the bondage the Jews where under. This was clearly giving aid and comfort to an enemy combatant. \n \n In the United States; It's against the law to give aid and comfort to the enemy. If Michael Moore where to give Osama Ben Laden a band aid, who seek his death? When Jane Fonda spoke against The U.S. military operations in Vietnam wasn't her sin on par with Jesus?\n \n Now personally, I would not have been one of the Jews screaming for Jesus Death and my life is living proof I would not have been one. I don't seek any punishment for Michael Moore playing around in Cuba and though I think Jane Fonda was way out of bounds doing what she did, I'm not seeking any prison term for her.",

Its clear to me that religion seems to cloud moral judgment, which is one of its many negative side effects.\n\n \n The only point I'm making regarding Sauls Kingship is that he lost Gods support who placed him as King when he sought the council of a Pagan Seer rather than Gods council through Gods Prophet to Israel. That was Sauls sin that cost Him Yahweh's support and led to his defeat by Israels enemy. And if memory serves, Saul didn't kill himself to protect the Jews from suffering from his capture but to prevent his own suffering at the hands of his captors who surely would have tortured him slowly and painfully before allowing him to die.\n \n But my feelings on suicide and why it's wrong scripturally is because murder is wrong in Gods sight as ALL life is a gift that we have no right to take because we can't return it once taken. For me to murder another is to steal their life and I have no right to take that which I can't return without just cause. So it is with suicide. My life is a gift from God so I have no right to murder myself either since my life is valuable to God even if I no longer value it. That is why suicide is murder in Gods sight.\n \n Now, is that to say that suicide is an unforgivable sin ? Heaven forbid. Just as murder isn't an unforgivable sin. If it was then the Apostle Paul could never have been saved as he was personally responsible for the stoning death of Stephen, the Saint who was stoned to death for preaching about Jesus in the Temple. Paul also captured many other Christians and led them to death as the Pharisee Saul before being blinded by Jesus and converted on the road to Damascus.\n \n I found your reference to Samson compelling and rational based on the biblical account and it reminded me of Masada when, I believe, 900 Jews committed mass suicide rather than be captured by the Roman Army.",
