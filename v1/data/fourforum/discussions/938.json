   "http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34388\n \n \nThe Center for the Study of Popular Culture, which examined the political views of commencement speakers at the nation's elite colleges and universities, found those with liberal ideas outnumbered conservative speakers 226-15 over a 10-year period. Overall, the ratio of commencement speakers on the left to those on the right is more than 15-to-1 \n\n \n \nIt's not news that college professors are lopsidedly drawn from the political left,\" writes syndicated columnist John Leo. \"But American Enterprise magazine offers some numbers on how heavy the tilt has become. In eight academic departments surveyed at Cornell University, 166 professors were registered in the Democratic Party or another party of the left, with just 6 registered with Republicans or another party of the right.\"\n\n \n \nAt the University of Colorado-Boulder, the numbers were 116 to 5. It was 151-17 at Stanford, 54-3 at Brown, 99-6 at the University of California-San Diego, and 59-7 at Berkeley, the flagship of the University of California system,\" Leo wrote in his Sept. 17, 2002, column. \"At Williams College, a poll turned up only four registered Republicans among the more than 200 professors on campus.\"\n\n \n Interesting indeed. Now who said that Liberals are stupid?",

Anyways, I'd be willing to bet that teachers are better supported by liberal leaders than conservative leaders and therefore more of them are liberal than conservative.",

Now who said that Liberals are stupid?\n\n \n First of all, I do not believe that liberals are stupid.\n \n However, you made a comment on this board that liberals are much more educated, and when I asked for proof, you said to compare a university to the area that it was in.\n \n This makes the assumption that all educated people are in universities. That is not true. There are many educated people outside of universities.",
