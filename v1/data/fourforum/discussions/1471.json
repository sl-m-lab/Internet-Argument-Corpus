Williams, Los Angeles Times\n \n \n BAGHDAD -- Iraqi officials on Sunday blamed loyalists of the recently captured Saddam Hussein for sabotaging a vital stretch of oil pipeline and blowing up a huge gasoline storage tank in Baghdad.\n \n The attacks that set the north-south oil pipeline ablaze in at least four places threatened to worsen an already dire shortage of gasoline that has angered Iraqi drivers and fomented criticism that the U.S.-led coalition is mismanaging postwar reconstruction.\n \n Coalition troops continued raids Sunday at insurgent strongholds along the border with Syria and in the Sunni Triangle, arresting hundreds of Iraqis accused of attacking U.S.-led forces. An Iraqi woman was killed in one of the raids, and two others were injured when troops used explosives to blow in the door of a house in Rawah, along the western border of Iraq, coalition officials reported....\n \n Oil Ministry spokesman Assim Jihad said the fires resulted from \"acts of sabotage\" but denied that the lost fuel and pipeline disruptions would seriously worsen the nearly monthlong gas crisis that has motorists lining up for as long as 12 hours to fill their tanks.\n \n The latest sabotage of the oil infrastructure -- the 83rd attack of its kind since April,\n ",

   "Unfortunately not. In some places the allied forces are making some progress in winning the hearts of Iraqis. If you can gain their trust than you will win their hearts and support. I think the anti-American sentiment might be growing with every new attack that the terrorists do. The troops need to take special time in talking with the Iraqis and playing games with them for trust to be present and for friendship to form.",
