   "H5N1 Wild Bird Flu is in the Ukrainian Crimea killing both birds and people. \n The worst thing about it is that they are having all this for 2 months or so keeping rest of Europe ignorant. To put it simply, Ukrainians lied and are keeping to lie now. My Bulgarian friends had to leave Yalta, a touristy place in the Crimea, a month ago 'cause local hospitals were already overcrowded with patients treated for unknown type of pneumonia. A familiar doc advised them to leave a.s.a.p. And he said there had been dozens deaths 'due to unidentified pneumonia virus'. Still city authorities wouldn't comment on it. Fancy - not a word from them! What' going on there now? I'm scary to think about it. What if it is some other deadly virus and not just Bird Flu?\n Locals said it was politics involved in it. The EU gathering or what was to take place in the Ukraine. So those Ukrainians don't care a sh-t about their own people and foreigners on their soil and infection spreading to other parts of Europe. Nothing to wonder about! It's the habitual way of thinking for all those newcomers to EU. These are only benefits of EU membership they want. How about responsibility? \n Luckily, my friends are OK. What about other foreign tourists in the Crimea? Actually there's no info on them. Is there any independent observers' team keeping an eye on the dramatic events in the Crimea?",
