If you take the Bible literally that is. Hard to preach if you're not supposed to talk. :) \n \n As for the issues with the female bishop, I really don't get it. Episcepalians (sp?) have had female bishops before. And the presiding bishop has no real extra power; she's first among equals. I suspect that the real issue is that the first female presiding bishop came soon after the first openly gay bishop; too many changes too fast.

The church hates women because women create life, and thats what they clame god to do! thus, the church claims that women are subordinant receviers of life - this is such an important point, that they parallel it in a metaphore about the church itself - claiming that the chuch is a woman, where people go to be subordinant reciveres of god as well, on their knees in prayer.\n \n women in the bible are refered to as objects, like in this gem of a quote from Deuteronomy:\n \n \"If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.\"\n \n the rapist compensates teh father with money, because the woman is considerted to be a commodity of mointary value that belongs to her father - but only as long as she is a virgin. Also, A woman who is somebodys wife is also considerted to belong to that man by the bible, consider the following, also from Deuteronomy:\n \n \"If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.\"\n \n see, the woman is killed because she wasent able to avoid the rape - and the man is killed - not because he did the woman wrong, shes just an obect - but rather becasue she was her husbands proporty and thus he violated her husband.\n \n or consider this quote from Book of Zechariah, i think it speaks for itself\n \n Lo, a day shall come for the Lord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. And I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken, houses plundered, women ravished; half of the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city.",

This is the purpose of a wife submitting herself to her husband.\n \n Ephesians 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; \n \n 21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. \n \n 22Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n \n 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. \n \n 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. \n \n The Bible pretty much has declared men to lead. Not for their own egos sake, but for the women as well. Let me give you a few verses further about how men should treat their wives.\n \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \n \n 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n \n 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. \n \n 28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. \n \n 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: \n \n 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. \n \n 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. \n \n 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. \n \n 33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.\n \n That seems to put wives in a very high position from a men's perspective. Particularly if he has a wife. Even if church leaders don't emulate this, they ought to. And that is a message that has been brought out in my church, so yes, some churches do speak of this.\n \n \nand as for his \"father,\" God - there is no purpose for defining God's sex as male other than to define him as not a woman, to alienate women from him. \n\n \n God looked on his creation and saw that it was good. \n \n -- except for the women.???\n \n Then why on earth did he make a woman out of Adam's rib? To put it more bluntly, why did he make women at all?! Why didn't he make Man like certain animals that can change their sex in order to reproduce? Hm?\n \n He made women because he didn't want man to be alone. And I can tell you one thing, I am 101% glad he did.\n \n \nI'll believe that. The church is a sexist institution because they adheres to sexist rules they find in the bible. \n\n \n You must have been a very persecuted soul, GodIsDead.\n \n The church does not go to the scriptures in order to undermine women! Why should they do that? Because they like just degrading women because they have some missing brains or something? There are many churches that live by those scriptures, GodIsDead.

This is the purpose of a wife submitting herself to her husband.\n \n Ephesians 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; \n \n 21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. \n \n 22Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n \n 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. \n \n 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. \n \n The Bible pretty much has declared men to lead. Not for their own egos sake, but for the women as well. Let me give you a few verses further about how men should treat their wives.\n \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \n \n 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n \n 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. \n \n 28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. \n \n 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: \n \n 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. \n \n 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. \n \n 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. \n \n 33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.\n \n That seems to put wives in a very high position from a men's perspective. Particularly if he has a wife. Even if church leaders don't emulate this, they ought to. And that is a message that has been brought out in my church, so yes, some churches do speak of this.\n \n \n \n God looked on his creation and saw that it was good. \n \n -- except for the women.???\n \n Then why on earth did he make a woman out of Adam's rib? To put it more bluntly, why did he make women at all?! Why didn't he make Man like certain animals that can change their sex in order to reproduce? Hm?\n \n He made women because he didn't want man to be alone. And I can tell you one thing, I am 101% glad he did.\n \n \n \n You must have been a very persecuted soul, GodIsDead.\n \n The church does not go to the scriptures in order to undermine women! Why should they do that? Because they like just degrading women because they have some missing brains or something? There are many churches that live by those scriptures, GodIsDead. You have a very misguided view on the church and the scriptures. I would pull up another load of verses that honor women in many ways, but I don't have the time right now. Maybe next time.\n\n \n \n \n Dosent it bother you at all that everything you belive in comes from some athority totaly outiside of yourself?\n \n you and i dont seem to be disagreeing on what the bible says - it says that women should be submissive to men. I see this as an anti-woman position, intended to keep women down. You on the other hand seem to see it as enterly justifyed in that it is in the bible.\n \n dont you undersrtand that dispite what the bible says there is nothing just or right about a system that mandates the submission of women to men? What about women who dont want to be submisve to me - i wont get into how this is anit gay - but what about women who want to be equals in their relationships with men? or men who want to equality as well?",

   "Except, of course, if you read the entire story IN CONTEXT with the surroudnings.

It is not even two different perspectives, it is two entirely different stories that is assocating judas dying with the 'Field of BLood'. \n \n If you want to distort what was written so much to reconcile it, you can.

   "women tend to be submissive because of social conditioning, it is not their \"nature.\" In the times before the oppression of male gods, there were many cultures where there was equality, and nobody had to be the submissive one. In fact, there was a Native American civilization who had 4 genders in their language - the closest way to translate it would be as - the masculine man, the masculine women the feminine woman and the feminine man. In that civilization marriage was aloud between any pairing of masculine to feminine.\n \n But at any rate - the excuse that the submissive women is greatly honored, or greatly loved dose not make the system just. I don't deny that some relationships work better if one person leads and the other person follows. However, not all relationships work that way, and more importantly, in the cases of relationships that do work that way who leads and who follows is not justly determined by sex, that's sexist. Because women are not submissive by nature, and even if they tended to be, not all of them are.",

   "women tend to be submissive because of social conditioning, it is not their \"nature.\" \n\n \n You're right in one aspect, GodIsDead. But you're turning the fact around and making it punch itself in the back of the head. Neither can exist that way as both would disappear without the other. Those two things play key roles in forming each other. Saying one exists without the other in this case is contradictory.\n \n The social conditioning is created by the general culture of the land, the culture is mainly derived from the religion and how deeply it affects the believers of it. The Bible has taught women how to and how to not act and America was generally a Christian nation when it was born, so it was born with a Christian nature. The nature created the sociality in America, and both affected men and women. I would bet that that is why they are more naturally submissive here than in those ares with 4 genders. emoticon_wow \n \n \nBut at any rate - the excuse that the submissive women is greatly honored, or greatly loved dose not make the system just. \n\n \n Hold it right there. First of all, you began this rant of Christianity being sexist because of it's degredation of women. You have been shown how women are honored, valued, is loved and how she is so wonderful that man should sacrifice himself for her. You now (or should have) a very clear picture on what women truly are in the biblical view, and that sexism is non-existant in the woman's role in Christianity.\n \n Now you have started a complaint that the system is not just. I get the idea that you just don't like the Bible, not that it has anything to do with sex discrimination.\n \n \n I don't deny that some relationships work better if one person leads and the other person follows. \n\n \n Thank you.\n \n \n However, not all relationships work that way, and more importantly, in the cases of relationships that do work that way who leads and who follows is not justly determined by sex, that's sexist. \n\n \n That's a pretty shaky idea to stand on, for me, it has mostly been the man who is the leader, not the woman. And the choice was not made based on how lowly the woman looked in the man's eyes.emoticon_mad \n \n But then how are they determined? You've got to show me that at least, GodIsDead.

I have pointed out that societies temporally and geographically remote from the bible had and have perfectly functional moral codes. There is a difference between 'shouldn't focus on' and 'shouldn't give disproportionate credit to'.\n\n \n I agree other societies had functional moral codes--moral codes were and still are necessary for the survival of any society. However, my view is that the final moral code from the New Testament is superior to any other. It is a moral code that is completely about compassion, forgiveness, self-sacrifice, going farther to help people than one has to, etc.--not just to people one would be expected to do so, but to strangers and enemies. I've never seen a moral 'code' like that anywhere else, from history. And for certain, no other moral code has had as much influence on history as that espoused by Christ.\n \n To that point, have you ever read the essay by 17th cent. social philosopher John Locke titled The Reasonableness of Christianity? If not, I'd highly recommend it. (The democratic and pro-equality views of Locke, by the way, had enormous influence on enlightenment thinking and particularly the formation of democracy in the U.S.)\n \n \nSo why are the Deuteronomic laws still part of christian scripture?\n\n \n Because for the Christian, understanding the role of the NT law is important to understanding what Christian atonement is all about.

Does this mean disobedient children still deserve to be killed, but now god will do it instead of men? Or was the D author simply in error all along in representing childish disobedience as a capital crime? \n\n \n Let me tell you something about Jesus's way of enforcing the law.\n \n O.T. -Killing was wrong.\n \n J. -Anybody who so much as hates his brother without a cause is a murderer.\n \n O.T. -Fornication is wrong.\n \n J. -Any man who so much as lusts after a woman has commited adultery already in his heart.\n \n I'd hate to have to go further than this. This is how the Israelites had to live; as a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. The author of D was writing down the basic law. In the O.T. the Israelites had to live in fear because he commited the most atrocious sins right in the presence of the Lord, and whatever law he laid down in an attempt to purify them for himself, they had to follow. Exodus and so on were a time period where God as shaping and molding his nation for the future, before his son would come. \n \n I believe that was the purpose behind the (what seem to us) strict rules. And if rebellion was as the sin of witchcraft, (and it should be considered likewise today, in some cases) then there was no whining. God made more of those punishements death because he did not want rebellious, sexually immoral people among the Israelites. See what that sort of people have done to America?\n \n Once Jesus came and died, his message of peace encouraged love, faith and care for one another. Killing is a sin, and unless God commisions a man to kill (which he never does) man has no business. That's the way the Israelites had to live before Christ, but that didn't need to be that way anymore.

   "So you think it's a myth to show compassion on people? How about to love one's enemies, or to forgive? Or husbands and wives giving up what they want for the good of the other?\n \n For the purposes of this discussion, whether or not the narratives of the Bible are factual is irrelevant. We're talking about the Bible in the context of relationships, and what it teaches about husbands and wives. And female clergy (if we get back on the original topic). I don't see how the whole debate about whether the narratives are myth or not has anything to do with this, since we're dealing with the Bible from the persepective of the principles it teaches.\n \n I also find the whole idea that the Bible can't be used to defend itself to be absurd. It's like telling someone they can't quote Plato in a discussion about Plato.\nShowing compassion was a value held by much of humanity well before an obscure tribe of sheepherders in the Middle East decided that they were special to God, that they were God's chosen people. Husbands and wives being devoted to each other and willing to sacrifice for each other was also widely embraced by a multitude of cultures prior to the inception of the Judeo-Christian religion.\n \n These human values were not created by Judeo/Christianity, no matter how much you wish to believe that.",

   "Sorry, that still doesn't cut it for me. As soon as one person in a relationship is defined in terms of her 'value' to the other, or how 'honoured' she is to hold that position, the relationship is an unequal one.\n \n You are too thoughtful and civil a poster to fly off on the 'you're a bible-hating christian-basher' route that others here have taken. In fact, of course, the judaeochristian bible isn't the only scripture to offer sanctification of the de facto inequality between the sexes that has existed in almost all human societies. That's one of the things religion is for - to justify a society's intrinsic mores and practices and protect them from being questioned.\n \n It seems to me that we might have reached a point in history where we can move on from taken-for-granted sexual inequality; religion (not just christianity) is a positive impedance in that regard.\n\n \n I see what you mean and culturally speaking I agree. Religion does have a problem with that. My beliefs do not support. Some folks have a problem with the word \"submit\". But the truth is that none of us get out of this life without submitting to others. It is a fact of life. You submit to a boss parents and even husbands and wives. \n \n Submitting to another's strengths as they submit to yours allows you to protect their weaknesses (lets face it we are all weak somewhere). My wife and I submit to each other. Not perfectly and not always. Submission as I use it and as Jyoshu is using it is not a word that means \"subservience\". Instead it is a love word. My wife submits to my role as spiritual leader in our home. NOt because I am better at it than she is but because she knows that I trust god. It is an act of trust in me not servant hood. I honor that trust greatly. the fact that she trusts me, humbles me. It would be wrong for me to demand such trust. I will not and do not do that. I submit to her in many many things.\n \n The value of I spoke of is not a value that I declare but one that I recognize as already given to her. The fact that she is a gift to me and one I do not deserve. In fact I tend to look at my wife as MORE valuable that I. (this is not a good thing). The truth is that we are actually both children of God. To us, there is no greater statement of value. She could not be worth more and she can not be worth less. She is the most. AND so am I. To God that is.\n \n EF",

Rast and R. Thomas Schaub \n \n http://www.nd.edu/~edsp/numeira.html\n \n Ever heard of the Ebla tablets:\n http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterFour/Ebla.htm\n \n \"From The Alpha and the Omega, Volume II -- by Jim A. Cornwell -- Chapter Five, page 39 which comments on the subject of Ebla and Abram dating.\n Until recently it was commonly felt that Abraham lived in the Middle Bronze Period (c. 2000-1500 B.C.), but an electrifying new discovery in northern Syria in 1974 at Tell Mardikh (Ebla) has caused Noel Freedman to place him in the Early Bronze Period (2950-2000 B.C.) at a time when Ebla was at its height of power and influence. A royal library was found here consisting of 20,000 clay tablets, 80 percent of which were written in Sumerian and the rest in an unknown Semitic language akin to Hebrew that is now called Eblaite. Located halfway between modern Aleppo and Hama, at the top of the Fertile Crescent, the city was in the heart of Abraham's ancestral home territory of Haran and flourished in c. 2200 B.C. Names like David, Micah, Jerusalem, Sodom, Gomorrah, Haran, and Ur appear in the texts. The Ebla tablets as seen in Chapter Four of this book are a geographic Atlas of the area identifying the ruins of Bub edh-Dhra as Sodom and the ruins of Numeria as Gomorrah. The city of Ebla was destroyed around 2250 B.C.\n If you have been grasping what this book is stating about Abram and Abraham, you can see the dilemma of recent scholars and archaeologists in that they are in conflict with dates. Abraham seems to be dated in the Early Bronze period and is also around in the Middle Bronze Period even though he was reported biblically to have only lived for 175 years, \"...and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years...\" \n \n \n NOw I am certain that you will try to say that these are not really evidence and spend your time trying to discredit the sources for the documentation. However, even giving YOU the benefit of the doubt that the sources are \"debatable\" (of which the Ebla tablets are not really) this still goes a far cry from your statement of \"archeological trace whatsoever\".\n \n EF",

   "It's funny that it seems to be only Christianity that some like yourself are determined to judge present people by those who lived hundreds or thousands of years ago. For instance, I never hear people condemning the current U.S. govt. NOW over the fact they forced native Americans onto reservations in the 19th century. Even though in both cases the people and leaders involved are long gone. And the native American issue is a MUCH more recent one, compared to the inquisition and crusades.\n\n I suggest this with some trepidation, not being (DG?) an American. Perhaps it's because the authority of the current US government is derived from the votes of living people, rather than on the disputed authority of a 2000-year-old text. Today's voters are free to reject the racist ideology of the reservations; the instigators of the inquisition and the crusades could draw their justifications from their 2000-year-old text as convincingly as you can.\n \nThose AIDS dollars going to Africa cover a LOT more than just abstinence initiatives.

And the ones that proclaim themselves to be 'fundamentlists'.\n \n Although, the current heirarchy of the RCC isn't blameless either.\n\n \n I have to disagree. \n I think the problem is indeed all of Christianity. At least the believing in fairy tales part, specifically God, heaven and hell. The problem with the things that fundamentalists \"proclaim\" is that they are based on a delusional belief system. When you create an absolute authority and profess to know exactly what that ultimate authority demands, it is a set up for a corrupt abuse of power. Moreover, when this life here on earth is relatively meaningless compared to the eternity of heaven/hell, you create an incentive for irrational behavior. If I am primarily concerned about my eternal soul, and the ultimate sin is not believing in the commands of the big guy, why the worst thing that could happen to anyone is a lack of faith. Heresy is an ultimate crime, because it damns you for eternity. The non-believer is therefore the worst kind of evil. If I care about my soul and that of my family, the non-believer is to be shunned at least and to be eliminated at the worst. In this day of designer suicide jackets, that mentality is extremely dangerous. In a less heinous form, the mentality expects us to pass laws to prevent \"sins\".\n \n In any event, you may counter that this is just the behavior of the fundamentalists and other assorted nutjobs. I think the moderate Christian is equally to blame. While they may ignore the more barbarous parts of the bible as it suits them, they still hang to the believing in the supernatural part, and as such give tacit approval to the crazies. By venerating the \"sacred\" books in general, they then are powerless to meaningfully attack the belief system of the fundamentalists. And because moderates tend to ignore the most lunatic parts of scripture, they lose touch with how dangerous these books are when taken literally. In fact, they have trouble believing that anyone does still take these books literally, and so they tend not to recognize the role that faith plays in inspiring human tragedy. Religious moderates are blinded by their own moderation.",

   "Believers tend to assume a symmetry between a believer's conviction that god exists and an atheist's lack of such conviction - 'they are both acts of faith'. I may just be repeating thelmoose's point here, but this is not the case. Believing in the existence of an invisible, intangible and unknowable entity in the absence of any objective evidence is an act of faith. Simply not opting into that belief is not an act at all: it is the absence of an act.\n \n Thank you for your Sodom/Gomorrah references: I'll respond when I've had time to read them.\n\n \n You use the term \"simply not opting into that belief\" as if that means that you are willing to believe but you don't know.

It is a belief that God does not exist.\n \n If you want to bandy about terms then you get into the agnostic as well. It is from two greek words. \"A\" meaning without, and \"gnosis\" meaning knowledge. In other words the I don't know category.\n \n However, that being said, if you say you do not know if there is a god or not and you are choosing not to make up your mind, you have actually made up your mind. Either you believe in him or you don't. To say \"I don't know if he exists or not\" is the same as saying you don't believe he does. A cheesy analogy is a lottery ticket. If I give you a winning lottery ticket and tell you it is a winning lottery ticket and then you say \"well, i don't know if it is or isn't, I am just not going to do anything about it\", guess what, you don't get any money.\n \n The same is true for God. If you choose to say, I don't know and I am not going to do anything about it, then you never find out. The only way to test the lottery ticket is to say, I believe it might be and then test it out.

   "I beg to differ, and I think sinjin's rather blunt example proves the point.\n \n \n \n OK.\n \n Let's break this down to something really simple to illustrate my point, and what I believe is your error.\n \n Hypothesis - chemical A combined with chemical B will result in precipitate C\n \n Test/result - combine the chemicals, there is no precipitate C\n \n Conclusion - chemical A and chemical B do not result in the formation of precipitate C, the hypothesis is invalid\n \n The abscence of the precipitate, \"negative data\" as you refer to it, proves the hypothesis is incorrect.\n \n \n \n This is the problem with your assertion, you set it up and continually refine it until it fits the desired conclusion. That is NOT how science works.\n \n \n \n It is not a proper test at all. The answer is assumed, without being able to be falsified or rejected, regardless of the test/data, due to the nature of the hypothesis. \n \n If you had lost contact with the child and they had disappeared, or worse, your conclusion would be the same - that God has done the best for you regardless of what you wanted. It is impossible to determine whether what's best for you has actually been done, and therefore impossible for the test to prove anything regarding God.\n \n The whole scenario is completely unscientific. There is no method by which to determine cause and effect, and it is therefore invalid, you've admitted as much. Your opinion, even if based on more than one event, does not constitute proof in any way, as it is completely subjective.\n \n Your strength could also have been coming from a leprechaun, and you simply didn't know it. Better yet IMHO, maybe you're simply stronger than you think you are, and it did it all on your own, you didn't need help and none was given.\n \n Perhaps circular isn't the best definition, the problem lies in the construction of both your premise and the test itself. There is only one predetermined conclusion available to you regardless of the test/data. You've structured your test in the form of the scientific method, but that does not make it scientific, or valid.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n using your chemical example your hypothesis may not be wrong simply incomplete. That is how science functions. When was the last time you ran an experiment (actual, in a lab). I have done it recently and continually since college. Hypothesis are usually far more complicated than precipitates and therefore you have to revise what you think to be correct. If you think it will form a precipitate because someone has told you for instance. Then it doesn't, perhaps you have to then add a catalyst and then it forms a precipitate. To say that \"it does not form a precipitate\" is incorrect because it does but in the presence of a catalyst. You simply had incomplete information.\n \n That is what I am saying. In your previous example you cannot say \"it does not form a precipitate\". To be correct you must say that chemical A in the presence of Chemical B, the two in isolation do not form a precipitate. You leave out the modifier and call it correct science. It is not.\n \n EF",
