   "That is interesting. As far as the mammals that look like prehistoric dogs, what was the size of the dinosaurs that they fed on? I may have missed something. That would almost be weird if the dinos were about 5-10 times larger than them. However, if they are the ancestors of dogs, that might explain some dogs like my own who tries to go up against dogs larger and taller than him but gets scared away by dogs smaller than him. But besides that, could it also be that they were scavengers? I was just wondering if that was a possibility.\n Also, anyone else notice that both of those mammals (the dog-like one and the beaver) were both found in China? Is there any more to this or just a coincidence?",
