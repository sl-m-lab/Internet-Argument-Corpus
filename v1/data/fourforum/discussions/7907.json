That figure represents nearly one in five of the city's males above the age of 15.\n \n 0ne out of every four gay males -- 25.8 percent -- is infected with the HIV virus, giving San Francisco an estimated total of 16,401 HIV-positive men, said McFarland, an epidemiologist who has also worked on studies in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Egypt.\n \n Scary. Seems like the HIV problem among gay men just gets worse. This is why I think the gay lobby's usual take about never wanting to talk about this subject is such a bad idea. It's a case where the one discussion that NEEDS to take place in society is the non-politically-correct one right now.\n \n One would think that what is often billed as the most \"progressive\" city would be the least likely group to fail to listen to education. But education just isn't working here.\n \n I predict now that people in the gay lobby will go through all kinds of fuzzy-math gymnastics trying to say the statistics don't really mean what they say, or that the results were skewered, or that it was a bad study somehow.

This, of course, is a counter-productive response. The topic needs to be discussed whenever possible.\n\n \n I don't know who you talk to, but in my experience at times its all anyone talks about. (Less now, as patients are living longer and healthier.) It surely is the kind of thing you talk about in hospitals and at funerals of best friends. I have never once, ever felt that anyone considered HIV an out of bounds topic, except for uncaring heterosexuals. \n \n You couldn't be more off base here. I still don't understand why you would say such a thing. What constructive point were you hoping to convey?",

   "correct me if I am wrong, but I thought it was harder to gets AIDS if you were heterosexual engaging in vaginal intercourse.\n \n Before you answer, dont' get bent outta shape or anything...It is just an honest question that I thought I read in a pamphlet or something.\n\n \n Is unprotected anal sex more risky than unprotected vaginal sex? Yes, somewhat. Enough to make a difference? Clearly not. In America HIV is spreading through the straight community at a rate comprable to the gay community, given the unequal initial infection rate. And of course AIDS is running rampant through Africa, where it's mainly being passed on through straight sex. Simply put, unprotected sex is risky. The exact type doesn't make that much difference.",

   "That is entirely untrue. Were you around in the 80's when this started?\n\n \n I was around a lot earlier than that.\n \n \nThe gay community was screaming about this and in 8 years the Reagan administration was utterly silent on the subject. We were demanding recognition of the problem, and it seemed the rest of the nation didn't care because it was only homos and druggies who were sick and dying.\n\n \n The gay community didn't start \"screaming\" about this until it got waaaay out of control. Look, STDs have been around since humans have been around. It's not like the need to use protection in non-monogamous relationships was a foreign concept even before HIV. It's not like ignorance could be used for an excuse; they weren't ignorant of the need for protection in sexual relationships. Gay people should have already been using protection.\n \n Yes, society didn't step in and lend a helping hand early enough. But every time I discuss this with someone in your movement, they tend to do what you're doing here: push the blame off on everyone but gay people. It's not Reagan's fault that you all wanted to bareback knowing that there were STDs out there. HIV specifically may not have been known about, but that's no excuse. \n \n \nEvery major US city has HIV support, outreach and education organizations. I have volunteered for such an agency for 10 years. They do tireless work in supporting people with HIV and the prevention of transmission.\n\n \n Yeah but a lot of them aren't gay-based initiatives. No doubt that gay people have done better in recent years though, it's just that they got themselves in such a mess they still have a long ways to go. A 25-26% infection rate among gay males in SF makes that clear. Barebacking is still an all-too-common thing among gay men from what I've seen in my research.\n \n \nI have never once, ever felt that anyone considered HIV an out of bounds topic, except for uncaring heterosexuals.\n\n \n And let me guess: any heterosexual that takes takes any critical stance of the way gay people have handled the situation is \"uncaring\" in your book, right? emoticon_rolleyes",

The issue was that you maintained that the gay community was lax and silent about HIV awareness. I stated that the Reagan administration was silent to constrast the extreme outpouring of alerts and concerns of the gay community. I am not blaming someone for causing AIDS, but public health monies and basic research investments could have started earlier. But that wasn't the thrust of my post anyway.\n \n \"Gay people should have been using protection\"??? Who the *&#@ are you, the STD cop? No one was using protection back then when STD were curable with antobiotics. Does reckless behavior continue even with our much better understanding, of course it does. Does infection occur with much more circumspect behavior. That happens also.

But most times I've seen that analogy made it was to simply show how in terms of LAW the two could be defended on the practically the same grounds, or to raise the possibility of a slippery slope. So when gay people turn around and essentially change the subject by reacting as if the analogy is some value statement about gay relationships, they disingenuously wreck the discussion, which in my opinion is their real intention anyway. It's not too much to ask people to simply judge an analogy based on the context of the discussion, rather than give knee-jerk reactions.",

That figure represents nearly one in five of the city's males above the age of 15.\n \n 0ne out of every four gay males -- 25.8 percent -- is infected with the HIV virus, giving San Francisco an estimated total of 16,401 HIV-positive men, said McFarland, an epidemiologist who has also worked on studies in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Egypt.\n\n \n Does anybody stop to THINK and COMPARE these claims against the ACTUAL statistics???\n \n You'll note that they specifically state \"ESTIMATED total\". As in, they have NO statistical counting data to support their claims...\n \n How about we look at what the ACTUAL numbers are, shall we?\n \n http://www.avert.org/usastats.htm\n Total number of reported people (not just gays) living in the U.S. with HIV: 212,275\n LOOK at the web-site to see the distribution.\n \n The largest reported STATE number for HIV is New York: 39,129\n If California has similar numbers (not reported), then they are saying that JUST UNDER HALF of the entire gay HIV population of California is HIV positive in San Francisco. (And note, comparing the ONLY HIV+ GAY MEN to a possible California total HIV count...)\n \n To put it another way, California has a total population of: 35,893,799 (approx 2004)\n San Francisco: 764,000\n \n So a city that has just a little over 2% of the state's population supposedly has just under half of an assumed number of state HIV counts????\n \n And the SOURCE for these statistics is WHERE???\n \n Oh yeah. \"ESTIMATED\".\n \n And compare their 16,401 ESTIMATE in San Francisco, with the ACTUAL country-wide HIV+ gay men count: 181,206.\n So about 9% of the ENTIRE HIV+ gay male population lives in ONE city, which has a population of less than a million?\n Or to put it another way, U.S. Gay Community: 7,320,000.\n San Francisco (estimated) gay community: 63,577\n \n So San Francisco has LESS THAN ONE PERCENT of the nation's gay population, but it has 9% of the gay HIV+ population???\n \n I realize to those who are comfortable with stereo-types and convenient assumptions, this would seem realistic, but to the rest of us who live in the real world, it just demonstrates even further how grossly exaggerated these statistics are...\n \n One thing people should learn is that when it comes to the CDC and \"estimated\" HIV data, they are simply taking a REAL number that they have found via hard and REAL data, and multiplying it by whatever other number they feel convenient...",
