   "It seems that new pictures are surfacing from the now infamous Abu Ghuraib prison west of Baghdad. Nearly a thousand digital pictures were found fromt the summer of 2003. \n \n Our administration can cover this up anyway they want. On the homefront everything can calm and settle, but the question is what is the sentiment in the Middle East. Since this war is more about occupation, reconstruction and winning the \"winning the hearts of the people,\" exactly how did this impact the situation? So far it has worldwide rebuke and the Middle East is beyond outraged. Not only were these prisoners treated like completed animals, the soldiers forced them into sexual positions that any man of religion would be revolted and humilated by. \n \n I understand the idea that these people are prisoners and they kill soldiers and bomb people. However these prisoners don't have an official charge and many are suspected. There are thousands of prisoners attained without the conviction of guilt, many times just the suspicion, or the link to someone that is guilty. So to say that these people are prisoners serving out their time is a mischaracterization of reality. \n \n Secondly to mandate sexuality and perversion on deeply religious people in the world of Islam is of the utmost disgrace and humiliation. This would all be to trivial if we weren't trying to liberate the nation and show the people that we are on their side. \n \n This is a major step back in the strive for a peaceful and democratic nation in Iraq. If there were no insurgents we would have a relatively peaceful nation and we could be focusing on rebuilding. However images like these only fuel the angst and animosity in Iraq and around the Middle East. And to say that this was just a mistake and that \"we'll look into it\" without an apology by the President or Rumsefeld is a mistake. \n \n Somebody in this administration has to take the downfall and in this case it is much more severe in the past. Who has taken heat for 9/11 and the information that was apparently there before that day? Noone. Who has taken the fall for there being no wmds and a \"miscalculation of evidence?\" \n Noone. Who will go down for this prisoner abuse scandal and the idea that this kind of abuse could be more widespread and used on civilians and in other prisons? Noone. \n \n The distinctive difference in the latter is that the issue is not domestic. 9/11, wmds- most of the heat is coming from home. This abuse case however is damaging us severly in the eyes of the Iraqi's and the eyes of the Middle East. It is taking something they had believed true and reaffirmed there accusations. Most Iraqi's think this in the norm of practice and now they have proof. And reconciling with them is going to take more than a couple of comments of disapproval by our President and Rumsefeld, it is going to have to be a fundamental change in how we instruct our soldiers to treat a nation that we are trying to reconstruct and liberate. \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5623-2004May5.html \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/photo/world/G63388-2004May03.html \n \n Remi",

   "For some reason, liberation and reconstruction have been left in the dust, replaced by that good old American standard of importance, my way or the road, in this case the slammer. Democracy at work against the forces of 'foreign' fighters and a 'minority' of ex-Saddam followers. According to official reports, no real Iraqis are involved. They're too busy showering our troops with affection and appreciation for liberating them from tyranny. You do believe your government, don't you?",
