   "Well its finally here, polling day in the elections to decide the next President of the United States of America.\n \n Sat on the east side of the pond, I've been watching this quite closely to see how things have unfolded. Last news I heard and the pollsters were saying its neck and neck between Bush and Kerry so it seems like there is everything still to play for.\n \n So if you are an American, what are your feelings on the coming events? are you a passionate supporter of either of the main candiates, one of the independents or maybe none at all? Do you want Bush out, or do you think he is the man of the hour and the only choice for America's future?\n \n If (like me) you are not an American what do you think of what will surely been one of the most closely watched elections in recent times? do you see it as been important in shaping the events of the next four years or do you think it will be \"more of the same\" regardless who wins?\n \n Whatever, its going to be an interesting couple of days- I really hope you get a decisive result for the sake of confidence in your Presidential election system.",

   "\"Whatever, its going to be an interesting couple of days- I really hope you get a decisive result for the sake of confidence in your Presidential election system.\"\n \n Razor,\n \n I am a strong supporter of George Bush. I think it is very good for America and the world that he was elected. I had not seen your post til today. I think it was very insightful. I truely appreciate your well wishes for the USA and our electoral system. I think it was very important that we had a decisive victory of one of the candidates. As bad a President as J.Kerry would have made, in my opinion, I'd have preferred he won rather than another unclear result.\n \n As allies the USA and GB have done great things for humanity. I'm sure, as allies, we will continue to do so. Thank you again and I hope all is well with you and yours in Leeds.\n \n Bill",
