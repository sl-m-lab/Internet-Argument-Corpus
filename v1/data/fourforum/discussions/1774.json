   "The Seven Myths of Gun Control\n \n Richard Poe \n January 17, 2000 \n \n Does the press have an anti-gun bias? Yes, says Brent Bozell, chairman of the Media Research Center. A study by the Center found that television news stories calling for stricter gun laws outnumbered newscasts opposing such laws by a ratio of 10 to 1. \n \n In other words, we are hearing only one side of the story. No wonder so few Americans are equipped to debate the issue of guns intelligently. \n \n \"Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe,\" wrote Thomas Jefferson in 1816. But when the press aligns itself with special interests - such as the anti-gun lobby - critical information is censored, and liberty itself hangs in the balance. \"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be ...\" warned Jefferson. \n \n Ignorance about guns and gun rights has reached pandemic proportions. Children are not taught the history or meaning of the Second Amendment in school, nor do they learn later as adults. Most of what Americans think they know about guns is false. The anti-gun hysteria now sweeping our nation draws on several deeply erroneous assumptions. I call them the Seven Myths of Gun Control. They are: \n \n Myth #1 -- Guns increase violent crime. \n \n Just the opposite is true. Experts have found that criminals tend to avoid physical confrontation, when they fear their victims may be armed. But when strict gun laws are imposed, criminals become bolder and more violent, confident that their victims are defenseless. \n \n Australians learned this lesson the hard way. When a madman slaughtered 35 people at a Tasmanian resort in 1996, the government responded by banning most firearms. More than 640,000 guns were seized from law-abiding citizens. \n \n The result was a sharp increase in violent crime. In the two years following the gun ban, armed robberies rose by 73 percent, unarmed robberies by 28 percent, kidnappings by 38 percent, assaults by 17 percent and manslaughter by 29 percent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n \n The same thing happened in England. The government cracked down on guns following a 1996 massacre of schoolchildren in Scotland. A terrifying crime wave ensued. The U.S. Department of Justice announced, in 1998, that the rate of muggings in England had surpassed that in the U.S. by 40 percent. Assault and burglary rates were found to be almost 100 percent higher in England than in the United States. \n \n In his book More Guns, Less Crime, Yale Law School economist John R. Lott points out that most criminals, in America, choose empty houses to burglarize. They avoid late-night break-ins, because, as many convicts have explained to researchers, \"that's the way to get shot.\" Hot burglaries - in which the criminal enters while people are home - account for only 13 percent of all U.S. burglaries. \n \n But in countries with strict gun control, such as England and Canada, criminals enter houses at will, without worrying whether anyone is home. The hot burglary rate in those countries is nearly 50 percent. \n \n After studying 18 years' worth of crime statistics from around the United States, Lott concluded that \"states experiencing the greatest reductions in crime are also the ones with the fastest growing percentages of gun ownership.\" \n \n On average, Lott found that violent crime dropped by 4 percent for each 1 percent increase in gun ownership. The most dramatic improvement came in states that allowed citizens to carry concealed handguns. States enacting such laws between 1977 and 1994 experienced an average 10 percent reduction in murders and a 4.4 percent drop in overall violent crime during that period. \n \n Myth #2 -- Pulling a gun on a criminal endangers you more than the criminal. \n \n Gun bashers claim that if you draw a gun during a mugging, the mugger will probably take it away from you. But the facts say otherwise. According to surveys by Gallup, the Los Angeles Times and other national polling organizations, Americans use guns to defend themselves between 760,000 and 3.6 million times each year. In 98 percent of those cases, simply brandishing the gun was enough to scare off the attacker. \n \n Myth #3 -- Guns pose a special threat to children. \n \n Gun haters argue that firearms pose a unique danger to children. But statistics do not support this claim. Only 200 children - aged 14 and younger - died from gun accidents in 1995. That same year, 2,900 children died in car crashes, 950 drowned and 1,000 died of burns. \"More children die in bicycle accidents each year than die from all types of firearm accidents,\" Lott observes. Yet, there is no national outcry to bar children from using bicycles. \n \n Myth #4 -- The Second Amendment applies only to militiamen. \n \n Gun prohibitionists argue that the Second Amendment confers a right to bear arms only on duly enrolled members of a state militia. But that is not what the document says. It specifically grants the right to keep and bear arms to \"the people\". \n \n \"The phrase `the people' meant the same thing in the Second Amendment as it did in the First, Fourth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments -- that is, each and every free person,\" writes constitutional scholar Stephen Halbrook in his book That Every Man Be Armed. \n \n Even Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe - a gun-control advocate known for his liberal views - admitted, in the 1999 edition of his book American Constitutional Law, that the Second Amendment confers an individual right on U.S. citizens to \"possess and use firearms in the defense of themselves and their homes.\" \n \n Myth #5 -- The Second Amendment is an obsolete relic of the frontier era. \n \n Gun bashers say that the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness. They argue that pioneers needed guns to fight Indians, redcoats and grizzly bears. But we don't face such threats today. So why do we need guns? \n \n In fact, the framers of the Constitution were not greatly concerned about Indians, redcoats and grizzly bears. But they worried deeply about the possibility that some future government might strip the people of their rights. The best insurance against this, they believed, was to make sure that the people were armed. \n \n \"The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword,\" said Noah Webster, \"because the whole body of the people are armed...\" \n \n Guns will become superfluous to Americans only when our lives and liberty no longer need defending. That time does not appear to be coming soon. \n \n Myth #6 -- We should treat guns the same way we treat cars, requiring licenses for all users. \n \n When you apply for a firearms license, the government may or may not grant it. And, having granted it, the government may later choose to revoke it. What that means is that you never really had a right to bear arms, in the first place. A right, by definition, cannot be withheld or denied. As Thomas Jefferson put it, \"I have a right to nothing, which another has a right to take away.\" \n \n Consider the right to freedom of religion. Like all freedoms, religious liberty creates problems. It allows murderous fanatics such as Jim Jones and Marshall Applewhite to create killer cults like the Peoples' Temple and Heaven's Gate. \n \n A government licensing program might prevent such tragedies. Anyone starting a church could be subjected to psychiatric screening, his beliefs and doctrines vetted by a board of experts. Cult killings would likely diminish. But freedom of worship would be dead. \n \n How about freedom of speech? Think of all the pornography, hate speech and conspiracy theories that could be eliminated by denying \"speech licenses\" to undesirable web geeks. Hillary Clinton has actually proposed something along these lines. Arguing that cyberspace is too free, she suggests that the Internet needs an \"editing or gate keeping function\" to control its content. \n \n But, aside from Hillary, most Americans understand that requiring licenses for the exercise of basic constitutional liberties is a bad idea. \n \n There is no doubt that life is more orderly in a police state. But our country was founded on the principle that freedom takes precedence over order. As Thomas Jefferson put it, \"I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty, than those attending too small a degree of it.\" \n \n Myth #7 -- Reasonable gun-control measures are no threat to law-abiding gun owners. \n \n Anti-gun activists argue that reasonable gun-control measures, such as waiting periods, one-gun-a-month limits, trigger locks, \"smart\" technology and so on, do not threaten the rights of legitimate gun owners. \n \n But this argument presumes that guns will only be used for sport. And, indeed, most gun-control activists recognize no other legitimate use for firearms. \"To me, the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes,\" says Sarah Brady, chairman and founder of Handgun Control Inc. \n \n Perhaps for that reason, many gun-control measures now on the table seriously impede the use of firearms for self-defense. \n \n Take \"smart\" guns. They only work when the user wears a special ring or wristband with a magnetic actuator or radio transponder. Let's say you wake up in the dead of night. Your husband is on a business trip, and there's a serial rapist standing in your bedroom. This is not the time to be fumbling around in the dark, undoing the trigger lock and trying to remember where your husband put the transponder. \n \n Waiting periods can also be deadly. News reports show that many women have been killed, because the Brady Law prevented them from obtaining guns immediately, when they were threatened by stalkers. \n \n As for one-gun-a-month rules, these prevent people from stocking up quickly on arms during times of emergency. When riots or natural disasters strike, looting and brigandage present a real danger. People have a right, in such situations, to stockpile arms for their families, neighbors and employees. \n \n None of these arguments will persuade the gun haters, of course. Their crusade is driven by ideology, not reason. \n \n But fair-minded Americans should seek out the facts. Our freedom was bought at too high a price to let it slip away through ignorance and apathy.",

   "Coming from a person who used to believe in more gun controls (myself), I'd like to say this post really sums up all the reasons I've changed my views on gun controls. Not only do they not work the way they are intended to, they make the constitution work the way it was intended to.\n\n \n \n \n oh it gets better.... \n \n \n Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control\" \n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",
