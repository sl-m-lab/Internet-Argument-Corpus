There are people here who often reply to posts with just a Biblical citation, as if that were some sort of useful response. If two people both hold the same level of belief in the Bible, than simply swapping citations may constitute useful discussion. However, if the level of belief in the Bible varies among the participants in a debate (and I think we can assume that here) than simply quoting the Bible as if it were fact is no more useful than saying \"I say so, therefore it is true\" or \"my fortune cookie says...\". If you don't accept as an axiom \"The Bible is true\" than you won't accept any argument based on that axiom, and so arguments based on just citing scripture are pretty pointless. Of course, that having been said, citing the Bible is quite justified for supporting one's own personal beliefs.",

That sounds a tad hypocritical to me. I don't think anybody is \"afraid\" of people quoting scripture; quite the contrary. In my opinion, unless it is a religious debate, a person who resorts to quoting scripture has lost a debate. That is basically like saying, \"My imaginary friend says I'm correct so you have to listen to what I say and accept it as the ultimate undeniable truth.\" Which undermines the idea of a debate in the first place. I have no problem with people quoting scripture, but it is hypocritical to attack people who disagree with you or present an opposite point of view. That is, after all, why we are all here.",

   "As far as I am concerned, people can quote scripture all they like. They just loose the debate, unless of course the debate is regarding some biblical point, in which case quoting scripture would be appropriate.\n \n I think that in the case cited here (the \"Why worship god\" thread), posting scripture essentially amounts to a logical fallacy, so it is invalid.\n \n This causes problems with some folks who have abandoned logic for religous nuttiness. Most people know full well that you cannot produce a logical argument on most religous issues, so they are forced to fall back to C&P of biblical verse and refuse to recognize that this is not going to win them the debate, it simply signals a crushing defeat since they have essentially admitted that there is absolutly no logical argument for their position, so they must fall back on ancient mythology.\n\n \n Actually, the subject matter would determine the fallaciousness of the argument. For instance if one is requesting information about the character of God in a thread (eg Why worship God, no scripture please), then it is necessary to use scripture as the definition of God is only found in scripture, if we are to use some form of objective authority. If all that is wanted is my opinion and that there is to be no debate, then it becomes a message board and not a debate board. This board is dedicated to debate is it not?\n \n You will note my arguments in that thread and you will note that I do not specifically limit \"scripture\" to the bible. I say that I would use the bible as that is where I get my info about God. HOwever, a buddhist, hindu, muslim etc will likely use their own references as to the nature of who god is.\n \n The question of Why worship God is one that asks for info concerning God's nature. If the arguments take the form of \"Scripture says we are supposed to\" then that would be an illogical argument and actually non topical. HOwever, you will also note, that I have NEVER NEVER said, \"because scripture says so.\" It is not my style. I will use scripture as a reference and then point to the logic of its statements and provide context. \n \n Others have then argued the context or that I misinterpreted the context etc, but those are legitimate points of argument. \n \n The problem that I have is not a \"whining\" as Dr. Sprocket suggests that I cannot do what I want but that the question itself is actually illogical.\n \n To ask a question about the character of God (Why worship GOd) and to then not allow anything that actually describes the character of God to be admitted as evidence is a logical fallacy. It is the same as asking a question such as Who was the greatest batter in the American League and then not allowing batting statistics.\n \n It is an illogical question. Another example is asking \"What happens when the irresistable force meets the immovable object?\" It is an illogical question because the existence of the irresistable force necessarily precludes the existence of an immovable object by its very definition.\n \n To ask an illogical question and expect logical debate is simply ridiculous.\n \n EF",

Would you accept the phrase \"It is the 'most' objective authority we have on the nature of god.\"?\n EF\n\n If Grimm's fairy tales were the only source we had on the history of \"Little Red Riding Hood\", would that mean it is the \"most objective authority\"?\n Assuming your assumption true, if there were \"no other source for such information\", would that mean that it automatically qualifies as an \"authority\" or \"objective\"?\n \n You are assuming a lot about the Bible, and I think that is part of the problem with using it as a source. The people who use it often can assume the validity of the source without acknowledging it is a BELIEF and not an \"authority\".",

   "In reply to foundit: You are the one making an assumption. I am not assuming the bible. In fact, if you reread my previous posts in discussion with Johnhanks you will note that I am accepting of any scripture as authority on the nature of God where debate is concerned. Please note that it is on this subject, The Nature of God, on which I believe scripture to be appropriate. For purposes of debate, I made it clear that ANY religious document generally accepted as scripture (The Quran, The torah, etc.) to be reasonable references for someone to use in a debate that specifically concerns the nature of God. In particular \"Why worship God\". I did not limit it to the bible. It is interesting that you accuse me of assuming a lot about the bible and about my predispositions when you did not bother to read through the previous discussion to learn that I was not describing the bible. You made an assumption about me. I do use the bible as that is indeed MY BELIEF. Others are free to use what they know to be scripture. I do not limit it. It was another thread and poster who limited the discussion by asking about \"Why worship God No scripture Please\". \n \n Before you accuse me of things, I do wish you would do even the minimal research of reading through the discussion. Thanks\n \n Johnhanks: By authority I refer to some reference outside the debater themselves that offers a legitimate position and has some expertise in the matter. Another example would be in the topic of economic principles. I could post a rather conservative set of principles arguing for privatization of social security for instance whereas you could post a liberal set of economic principles arguing against it. Neither of us could PROVE one over the other. We would be hardpressed to prove that there was a landslide of evidence in one direction or the other. However, to support our position we would post documents and quotes and pitches from various experts and authorities (those who know something).\n \n To keep with religion, it would be reasonable to use scripture and then also quote some religious personages. From ANY religion. It makes the debate hinge on an actual authority. Otherwise it is my opinion against yours. You and I can do some logical analysis of our opinion (and I try to stick to that because using outside authority on this board seems to degenerate into a validity of the source debate which is hardly useful for purposes of actual debate). \n \n You see, I am trained in formal debate and I tend to stick to formal debate principles. One of which is that the debater themselves is NEVER an authority on a subject. The debater can assert a position but then must back it up with outside sources in agreement and also analysis of the logic and facts concerning the assertion. It is one of the reasons that Trebor vexes me so. He is ultimately illogical and frequently asserts things with no analyis and the only claim to authority is to himself.\n \n That being said, I also appreciate the discussion and the final courtesy. I shall give the final word to you if you have more on the subject. \n \n At the risk of injuring my position\n \n God Bless,\n \n EF",

Please note that it is on this subject, The Nature of God, on which I believe scripture to be appropriate.\n\n In that specific environment, I feel that it is an authority as to what some people believe.\n It may be a semantic quibble, but I feel it is a significant one.\n To me, an \"authority\" would have to be objectively verifiable. And when it comes to debates of beliefs, \"objectivity\" isn't really a possibility.\n \n \n \nFor purposes of debate, I made it clear that ANY religious document generally accepted as scripture (The Quran, The torah, etc.) to be reasonable references for someone to use in a debate that specifically concerns the nature of God.

It was another thread and poster who limited the discussion by asking about \"Why worship God No scripture Please\". \n\n And to me, such a discussion would help eliminate some of the arguments which aren't perceived as arguments.\n If a person doesn't believe in the Bible, then it's pointless to \"debate\" an argument to him based on the Bible. Like arguing \"you should worship God to be saved according to the Bible\". If the other person doesn't believe God is passing out damnation or salvation, then such an argument is fruitless and wasted. It can't really go anywhere or evolve into a discussion.\n But to another degree, \"why worship god\" includes a LOT of personal belief issues in the first place where people aren't going to agree. So perhaps limiting it in such a regard is not sensical.\n \n I think to some degree it's also a frustration with some statements like the one Easyrider made earlier in this thread. He said something to the degree that forbidding scripture helps people to ignore the fact that they are violating God's word.\n Can you see how such a false statement can be annoying in an attempt for real debate? Or statements assuming the validity of the Bible, and assuming that the other person actually thinks the bible is valid but chooses to violate it, can be annoying in an attempt for an intellectual debate?\n \n I think the rule (to some degree) is an attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff. Unfortunately, I think some can intelligently bring their beliefs to the table without making such gratingly false claims....\n And for them, it can be a situation where the rule doesn't suit its purpose.\n \n \n \nBefore you accuse me of things, I do wish you would do even the minimal research of reading through the discussion. Thanks\n\n I think you misunderstand my statements. If you could explicitly state what you think my \"accusation\" or \"assumption\" was, it would help.\n You talked about the scripture being an \"objective authority\" on God.\n THAT is the basis of my statements. And it may be a purely semantical disjoint between us where we define \"objective authority\" differently.\n Hopefully my comments above elaborate on where I am coming from.",
