   "by Patrick Buchanan\n \n \u00a9 2003 Creators Syndicate, Inc. \n \n \n Is Kim Jong Il seeking a showdown with the U.S. president who told the world he personally \"loathes\" the North Korean ruler? \n \n Does Kim intend to force Bush into a humiliating retreat from the vaunted Bush Doctrine of \"pre-emptive strike,\" as Khrushchev was forced to publicly retreat in the Cuban missile crisis? \n \n What other explanation is there for Kim's brinkmanship? \n \n In recent weeks, North Korea removed U.N. cameras and broke the seals on its nuclear reactor, ordered U.N. inspectors out of the country, and renounced the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now, satellite photos reveal that North Korean trucks may be transferring spent fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor to a nearby reprocessing plant. There, the plutonium can be extracted for nuclear weapons. \n \n Within \"weeks and months,\" says Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency, North Korea may be producing atom bombs. Nor has Kim tried to hide what he is up to. \n \n He has thrown up an in-your-face challenge to the president who, in last year's State of the Union, declared to the world, \"The United States ... will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\" \n \n Remarkable. Iraq denies it has weapons of mass destruction. U.N. inspectors cannot find any. Yet, Iraq faces invasion. But North Korea brazenly fires up a plant to produce fuel for atom bombs, as President Bush offers repeated assurances he has no plans to attack. \n \n This cannot continue. For if North Korea has decided to build a nuclear arsenal, not only is the Bush Doctrine dead on the Korean peninsula, the balance of power in Asia is imperiled. For if America does nothing, while Pyongyang goes nuclear - despite the president's vow he would not permit it - U.S. credibility, on which all our Asian alliances hinge, will be gravely eroded. \n \n George Bush's America will have been faced down by a tyrant. \n \n As of today, no one knows whether North Korea has perfected an atom bomb it can deliver on target. Kim has never conducted a test. But if North Korea turns out enough fissile material for half a dozen bombs, and Bush does nothing, the option of a U.S. pre-emptive strike vanishes. Put bluntly: If that Yongbyon reprocessing plant is not shut down by Kim, or destroyed by U.S. air power by April, U.S. credibility will be shredded in Asia. \n \n But what is Kim after? Does he want war with America? \n \n This seems improbable. Though North Korea - with its 11,000 artillery tubes on the DMZ, its hundreds of missiles and a handful of atomic bombs - could kills scores of thousands of Koreans, Japanese and Americans, Kim cannot win a second Korean War. Yet, such a war would bring the destruction of his country and the end of his regime. \n \n The more likely answer is that Kim seeks several goals, all of them attainable. The first is security from attack. The second is to force Bush to accord North Korea recognition and respect. The third is a renewal of fuel and aid to keep North Korea alive. \n \n Kim is not a madman. He has seen how, when Red China went nuclear, U.S. threats ceased, Nixon came to pay his respects and Beijing was handed China's seat in the U.N., while Taiwan was expelled. America then abrogated its defense treaty with Taipei and shifted its embassy to Beijing. U.S. investment poured into China, and America escorted Beijing into the World Trade Organization and now permits China to run a trade surplus at our expense of $100 billion a year. \n \n Even George Bush kowtows. When a Chinese MIG crashed into a U.S. surveillance plane in international airspace, Bush and Secretary Colin Powell repeatedly expressed sorrow for the death of the crazed Chinese pilot, and paid to have our plane crated up and shipped home. Kim wants the kind of deal the Chinese got. \n \n Now, with the world watching, he is demanding that the Americans negotiate directly with him, as he moves closer to producing weapons-grade plutonium. \n \n President Bush has very few options. He can bomb the Yongbyon reprocessing plant and risk war. He can seek U.N. sanctions, which Kim says would be a declaration of war. He can refuse to negotiate, as Kim defies his ultimatums and acquires enough fissile material for a dozen bombs. \n \n The president and Powell have apparently decided that the way to win this showdown is to smash Iraq to show Kim what happens to regimes that defy the United States. But even before Baghdad is occupied, Kim may have enough plutonium for half a dozen atom bombs. What do we do if he then says, \"OK, come and get 'em.\" \n \n By the way, who was it that put all that bellicose Axis-of-Evil rhetoric in the president's speeches in the first place?",

   "A. Saddam would invade his neighbors for oil, deman santions be lifted. \n\n \n Show me documented evidence that Saddam Hussein is planning on invading his neighbors to acquire oil in 2003, preferably something from these countries themselves. Oh wait I see, of course America would never invade another country to acquire oil now would it? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nB. Iraq is and has been developing nuclear weapons by our intelligence and defectors accounts.\n\n \n I do not care what U.S. intelligence has to say. U.S. intelligence has been exposed to be entirely fradulant on numerous occassions by independent sources. The U.N. inspectors have not found a trace of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program.\n \n \nC. North Korea may already have one, we aren't sure. \n\n \n Yes, by all means. Lets do everything possible to APPEASE North Korea and send a message to every little country in the world to develop Weapons of Mass Destruction, the only way to prevent America from belligerently attacking and bombing the living hell out of your country.\n \n \nWe can't invade now, it's too late. \n\n \n Yes, that is the crux of it isn't it. The message America sends the world is basically as follows: We are a rogue state. We will attack anyone we feel like, provide you do not build the weapons to fend off our attack. In other words, do everything possible to proliferate and develop such weapons. Also North Korea will sell this stuff to feed its own population.\n \n \nBlame this on Clinton...he trusted them and struck the deal.\n\n \n If Clinton had not struck the deal with North Korea that state would have hundreds of atomic bombs RIGHT NOW.

   "North Korea didn't have nukes in 94!\n\n \n North Korea shut down its nuclear reactor as well. North Korea can use those fuel rods to build dozens of atomic bombs. Getting North Korea to shut that reactor down was a good idea.\n \n \nWe should have just went in then because now they do! \n\n \n LOL yes, we should have just have gone right on in! After all, America does not have to follow the rules it requires everyone else in the world to follow. Perhaps China should simply go right on in to Taiwan or maybe Kim should follow your policy and go right on in to South Korea!\n \n \nWe can't bomb them! Kim will just nuke it all! Calling for us to go in is madness!\n\n \n The United States has utterly blown it in East Asia. You have sent a message to every nation in the world to develop nuclear weapons to protect themselves from an American attack. Kim Il Song is laughing his XXX off, he is utterly humilating George W. He knows very well he has Dubya by the balls, and so does North Korea's neighbors like South Korea and Japan who are seriously beginning to question whether the U.S. has the balls to maintain the status quo in East Asia.\n \n \nIf you don't think he is developing nukes, so be it.\n\n \n I think it is great that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons personally.\n \n \nI don't care. You obviously have some strange opinions...\n\n \n My opinion is basically as follows. America chides the Europeans for \"appeasing\" Iraq all the while it does everything to appease Kim Il Song, just one dictator in this world like the many others America appeases annually with billions of dollars. America's entire foreign policy is centered around appeasing corrupt despotisms. Afghanistan is still ruled by warlords. Kuwait is still ran by the despotic emirate. It was America which supported the dictator Siad Biarre in Somalia which presided over the horrendous famine. It is the Bush Administration giving China of all nations \"most favoured nation\" trading status!\n \n \nwe should send our men to North Korea, get them nuked, and then make the same mistake with Hussein. Whatever.\n\n \n What better incentive could there be for people like Saddam Hussein to develop nuclear weapons than to like at how America now deals with China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea? India developed nuclear weapons by the way because it was afraid of being attacked by America, in the aftermath of America bombing the living hell out of the former Yugoslavia. That caused Pakistan to develop nuclear weapons in response. Now that North Korea has obviously decided its a good thing to develop atomic weapons while Dubya is waging a two front war in Afghanistan and soon to be Iraq, that is going to induce Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to develop nuclear weapons, which could possibly infuriate China and lead to an invasion, a Chinese Bush Doctrine so to speak. Iran must be living in fear of being next on America's hit list as well. The Iranians are looking at North Korea and the soon to be destroyed nation of Iraq and have fired up their nuclear reactor as well. The entire foreign policy of George Dubya Bush seems to me to be quite simple. DO everything possible to encourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Incite every terrorist on earth by bombing nations who disagree with America at will. Make sure every terrorist on earth can immigrate to the United States, just call the INS, they will hook you right up with a VISA! Do everything possibly to increase the likelihood of another terrorist attack, to expand the federal government, to above all increase spending and the power of Washingon, D.C.",
