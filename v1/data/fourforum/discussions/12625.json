   "Hemant Mehta pointed me to an article from The Dallas Morning News, \"Dallas-area atheists discuss their outlook, relationships.\" It discusses the lives of atheists in the area, their growing socialization with each other, and socialization with their fellow citizens who are religious. There is a lot that is interesting in the article, but I will focus on the example of discrimination - this is Secular Discrimination Report after all.\n \n From the article:\n \n Clark Vinson, a Baptist-turned-atheist who grew up in Irving, said he believes he has been discriminated against in the Bible Belt because of his lack of religion.\n \n \"I was on the verge of sealing a contract for $105,000 a year for a school district in the area for counseling services,\" said Vinson, who was a therapist at the time. \"I lost the contract suddenly.\"\n \n He said a friend who worked for the district told him a school official was disturbed after seeing a Darwin fish on his car. \n \n This type of discrimination is exactly what atheists and others who lack religion or religious supernatural belief deal with throughout the United States, from the East to the West to the North to the South. The dominance of religion and expectation that everyone at least believes in some deity leads to some level of innate distrust of the nonreligious in even the most liberal of areas. We don't always see examples such as this because it is avoided by atheists hiding or at the least not being open about our lack of faith. If not, discrimination such as this would happen much too often. If we look at history, as the nonreligious civil right movement is growing and there are more open atheists, we are already and will undoubtedly see more of this in the future.\n \n Where is the Outrage?\n \n Giving Mr. Vinson the benefit of the doubt - there are two sides to every story, after all - this business contract was virtually a done deal until the school official realized that he was an atheist. You can't get much more bigoted and hateful than that. Apparently he was a good enough therapist to work in the school system before the revelation of his lack of belief. The contract wasn't lost because of anything he had done, but because he lacks religious beliefs. Is this the tolerance they teach their children in that school system?\n \n If Mr. Vinson was a member of a different religion, would that have lost him the contract? I doubt it. If such discrimination against a Christian, Jew, or even Muslim did happen and this was reported, it is likely that there would be public outrage. How much stronger would the reaction be if he canceled the contract after seeing a Jesus fish on the car instead of a Darwin fish? Our country was founded partly on the notion that we should all be able to worship or not worship how and if we choose. Where is the outrage that a public employee, paid for by tax money, is discriminating against atheists? We are protected by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment just like anyone else.\n \n Silent Discrimination\n \n This is not an isolated incident. There are many instances of such discrimination that have been reported, and undoubtedly many more that have not been. If it were not for the fact that Mr. Vinson's friend worked for the school district and was able to tell him why he lost the contract, he would have never known the act of discrimination committed against him. I propose that this \"silent discrimination\" is much more insidious. It allows anti-atheist bigots to discriminate freely while it robs the nonreligious of their ability to seek redress for such actions. How many more atheists have been discriminated against without whistle-blowers to let them know of the injustices committed against them?\n \n I leave you with one more point. The nonreligious are constantly criticized for being intolerant of religious people, but this is blaming the victims. Many of us are intolerant of religious belief, but we live and work very well with those who hold such beliefs. Our family members, friends, and colleagues are religious. When was the last time you heard of an atheist canceling a deal or firing someone because he found out they believe in a god? The converse happens much too often. Too many religious people simply can't get over the fact that someone can not have any religious belief at all, and clearly have no problem with discriminating against us.Are You an Open Atheist? You Might Not Be Able to Work for a Texas School District Secular Discrimination Report\n \n The \"religious\" discriminating against atheists...\n \n From the way some Christians scream and shout, you would think THEY were the victims of bringing back the lions...",

   "The \"religious\" discriminating against atheists...\n \n From the way some Christians scream and shout, you would think THEY were the victims of bringing back the lions...\n\n \n Firstly, it's only one example. Are people really supposed to believe that there is widespread discrimination against atheists based on one example? Secondly, I think that a lot of the attacks and rudeness, which also seem to be in this post are just as hateful as any discrimination against atheists. \n \n Somehow it doesn't seem hard for me to see foundit getting a job applicant who had a Jesus Christ Superstar shirt on and turning to that applicant with nose turned up and saying \"so you're \"religious\" I presume? I see. We'll call you if a spot opens up.\"",

   "Another example is what percentage of the country would not vote for a \"qualified\" representative of their political party, just cause he's an atheist...\n Black President More Likely than Mormon or Atheist\n That would be 53%.\n \n \n \nA new study by University of Minnesota sociologists Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann confirms the longstanding research finding that public hostility towards atheists is considerably more widespread than that towards any other ethnic or religious minority group. Edgell, et al. conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups and found that prejudice against atheists topped the scale. For example, almost 40% of respondents said that atheists are a group that \"does not at all agree with my vision of American society.\" Note that the question did not ask whether the respondent disagrees with atheists on some issues (which would be a perfectly understandable and noninvidious view), but asks if they are a group that does not at all share his views.\n\n Scribal Terror: Problematic Question?\n \n \n \nDespite changing attitudes, polls continue to show that atheists are ranked lower than any other minority or religious group when Americans are asked whether they would vote for or approve of their child marrying a member of that group.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html\n \n \n Boy Scouts of America precludes atheists from serving.\n \n \n \n \n \n Gray, Tennessee: Carletta Sims joined a financial firm in June 2001. Shortly afterward, two Baptist coworkers took offense upon learning that Sims was an atheist. Management granted the coworkers' request to be assigned workspaces further from Sims. When Sims complained about a picture of Jesus left on her computer, management discharged her. Sims filed suit, seeking $250,000; U.S. District Judge Thomas Hull ruled that \"religious discrimination (or preferential treatment of Christians) can be inferred.\" In January 2004, the major bank that had since acquired the firm settled with Sims for an undisclosed amount.\n \n Ada, Oklahoma: A Baptist student told a local newspaper she wouldn't take professor William Zellner's classes because he was an atheist, triggering a flurry of abuse. Zellner received harassing notes and telephone calls, some threatening. His car was vandalized, for a time on a daily basis. A local church sold \"I am praying for Dr. Zellner\" buttons. His children experienced shunning and beatings from religious children.\n \n Minneapolis, Minnesota: First-grader Michael Bristor, an atheist, was denied an honor roll certificate when he refused to participate in an unconstitutional \"prayer time\" at a public school. For three years, administrators ignored the family's complaints until a lawsuit was filed.\n \n Caro, Michigan: In December 2001, Anonka-an open atheist who maintains a museum of Christian religious atrocities-appeared before the Tuscola County Board of Commissioners to challenge a nativity scene placed on public land. Commissioners responded angrily, saying she had no right to be present and proceeding to ridicule her. Anonka and her family suffered repeated harassment including annoyance calls, threatening calls and letters, and vandalism. In February 2004, the county settled in U.S. District Court, agreeing to pay an undisclosed sum and to issue a \"public expression of regret.\"\n \n Pocopson, Pennsylvania: My own atheism came to prominence when I became involved in a legal challenge to a Ten Commandments plaque on the wall of the Chester County, Pennsylvania, courthouse. Neighbors organized a shunning campaign, some area merchants refused to do business with me, and I received hundreds of threatening letters and phone calls. (The depth of public animus against me became a subject of local news and magazine coverage.) I was forced to close my interior decorating business because of death threats that compelled me to stop visiting the homes of persons unknown to me.\n \n Calgary, Alberta: An eleven-year-old boy (name withheld) experienced daily physical attacks and threats against his life by schoolmates-notably the sons of three local pastors-after protesting intercom readings of the Lord's Prayer in a public school. He was repeatedly body-checked into hallway walls and attacked in the rest rooms. One pastor's son stalked him with a butcher knife in an empty portable classroom. Despite the seriousness of this incident, no action was taken. The boy's parents transferred him to another school for his own safety.\n\n Discrimination Against Atheists: The Facts",

I urge you not to follow anybody that uses the bible as a personal righteous meter and flames everyone for not believing what they say. I would also urge you, if you met someone who genuinely used the gospel in as many areas of his/her life as possible and doesn't resort to making themselves look superior (and I'm not saying that's me, although that is my goal), that you consider the merits of their belief. God will save whoever He wishes to save and I do not argue with Him on that. I do not believe that everyone saved must conform to my beliefs or suffer eternally in hell.

If you want to kill a chicken for Zeus or worship a lump of coal, I'll support your right to do so.\n\n \n Why then, do you think just about every thread started here in the religion forum is started by an atheist? Check out the first page - other than 'montalban' (who was banned long ago) I don't clearly see another Christian thread starter on the entire first page. Second page isn't much different. Combine that with prominent Atheists who, unlike yourself, write best selling books condemning Christians for believing in God etc, and I think we have more than one mix-up. I also find myself wondering what tiny fraction of TQ style of rule demolitions montalban commited to get himself banned.",

   "I don't believe principles of the Bible instruct us to sit by and do nothing while the word of God is destroyed.

The idea that Christians should stand with them and fight against violence against anyone. not that we should compromise our beliefs. \n \n \nI'm thinking about the book of Acts, the book that concerns itself almost exclusively with the ministry of the followers of Christ.

Most Christians don't come anywhere near 4forums (keep checking this place out and you'll see what I mean :) ) Do you think new, young readers here that are in the midst of having godless evolution rammed down their throats in public science classes see strength in that? I'm certainly not blaming any Christian who chooses not to post here, but believe those few of us who do are called to do it, and that it's a strength for Christianity.\n\n \n It's a debate forum.

If some Christian post without belittling detractors and enemies (no matter what they say) about how pitiable/demonic/fit for hell/God hating/Anti-American/leftist/pinko scum they are then the gospel is being presented wrong.

   "The original post was referring to standing up against discrimination regardless of whom it targets. The idea that Christians should stand with them and fight against violence against anyone. not that we should compromise our beliefs. \n\n \n You should read that opening post again - it was specifically about discrimination against atheists. You should also distinguish between violence vs discrimination. Big difference between violence and something like denial of employment. \n \n \nfight against militant Christian opposition then. Be careful when you turn a blind eye to someone else's suffering no matter what there political ties are is my original point. \n\n \n The opening post was about discrimination in the workplace, and I think the described \"discrimination\" was justified. In a prominently Christian populated school system, it doesn't make sense to have an open atheist (one who proudly displays their atheist belief with a bumper sticker) as a counselor/therapist for predominantly Christian children. \n \n My method of fighting against militant Christian opposition started with post #16 - pointing out that a somewhat comparable discrimination happens when religious people are denied positions in the scientific community. I think anti-religious science discrimination is far worse, while atheists think discrimination as described in post #1 is far worse. Who is to say which is worse, and who is to say who starts these conflicts, and who reacts to them? Maybe the discrimination described in post #1 was reactionary to previous discrimination in that school districts science department, or the more national Dover decision. Don't you think that's a possibility? \n \n My point is, if I as a Christian, stand with the atheists to fight against the discrimination described in post #1, they're going to refuse to stand with me to oppose the discrimination that goes on concerning science. \n \n \nIt's a debate forum. Anyone wishing to turn to Christ shouldn't be affected by bluster and political/religious posturing but by the truth they see in the words and the life of either side. \n\n \n But they're not only affected by the debate forum, they're going to decide to turn to or from Christ according to what they see in the entire society they live in. \n \n \nIf name calling by atheists spawns fire and brimstone and self righteousness by Christians then who wins? \n\n \n Well, it could often go either way, couldn't it? It's human nature for minds to be changed by attention getting forcefulness, whatever the worldview. If name calling by atheists spawns abandonment of the forums by Christians, followed by atheist taunts of \"running away\", then who wins? \n \n \nIf some Christian post without belittling detractors and enemies (no matter what they say) about how pitiable/demonic/fit for hell/God hating/Anti-American/leftist/pinko scum they are then the gospel is being presented wrong. IMHO. \n\n \n I don't present the gospel that way, yet my posts often inspire rage and name calling from the atheists. Though I never name-call, I'll admit my posts sometimes convey anger, and I probably do it too much. But it's always reactionary. \n \n \nWouldn't matter to me how badly they mocked me, I wouldn't resort to the same attitude. The Holy Spirit should answer them, not my offended ego. The apostles labored under the same constraints, yet the bible still exists. That doesn't constitute compromise or servitude to opposing world views.\n\n \n You seem like a good, thoughtful poster - good luck to you, but I'm afraid you may not last long here. These kinds of discussions are done on one muddy playing field. Not really possible to participate without getting muddy. :)",

   "Quote:\n Gray, Tennessee: Carletta Sims joined a financial firm in June 2001. Shortly afterward, two Baptist coworkers took offense upon learning that Sims was an atheist. Management granted the coworkers' request to be assigned workspaces further from Sims. When Sims complained about a picture of Jesus left on her computer, management discharged her. Sims filed suit, seeking $250,000; U.S. District Judge Thomas Hull ruled that \"religious discrimination (or preferential treatment of Christians) can be inferred.\" In January 2004, the major bank that had since acquired the firm settled with Sims for an undisclosed amount.\n \n Ada, Oklahoma: A Baptist student told a local newspaper she wouldn't take professor William Zellner's classes because he was an atheist, triggering a flurry of abuse. Zellner received harassing notes and telephone calls, some threatening. His car was vandalized, for a time on a daily basis. A local church sold \"I am praying for Dr. Zellner\" buttons. His children experienced shunning and beatings from religious children.\n \n Minneapolis, Minnesota: First-grader Michael Bristor, an atheist, was denied an honor roll certificate when he refused to participate in an unconstitutional \"prayer time\" at a public school. For three years, administrators ignored the family's complaints until a lawsuit was filed.\n \n Caro, Michigan: In December 2001, Anonka-an open atheist who maintains a museum of Christian religious atrocities-appeared before the Tuscola County Board of Commissioners to challenge a nativity scene placed on public land. Commissioners responded angrily, saying she had no right to be present and proceeding to ridicule her. Anonka and her family suffered repeated harassment including annoyance calls, threatening calls and letters, and vandalism. In February 2004, the county settled in U.S. District Court, agreeing to pay an undisclosed sum and to issue a \"public expression of regret.\"\n \n Pocopson, Pennsylvania: My own atheism came to prominence when I became involved in a legal challenge to a Ten Commandments plaque on the wall of the Chester County, Pennsylvania, courthouse. Neighbors organized a shunning campaign, some area merchants refused to do business with me, and I received hundreds of threatening letters and phone calls. (The depth of public animus against me became a subject of local news and magazine I was forced to close my interior decorating business because of death threats that compelled me to stop visiting the homes of persons unknown to me.coverage.) \n \n Calgary, Alberta: An eleven-year-old boy (name withheld) experienced daily physical attacks and threats against his life by schoolmates-notably the sons of three local pastors-after protesting intercom readings of the Lord's Prayer in a public school. He was repeatedly body-checked into hallway walls and attacked in the rest rooms. One pastor's son stalked him with a butcher knife in an empty portable classroom. Despite the seriousness of this incident, no action was taken. The boy's parents transferred him to another school for his own safety.  \n \n Discrimination Against Atheists: The Facts\n \n Discrimination Against Atheists: The Facts\n\n \n Oops, my fault. This is what \"my\" instead of \"the\" first post in this forum was addressing. Not that I hold Atheist claims any more valid than the Christians. I think you'd agree that assaulting and threatening the lives of people that disagree is something that shouldn't happen in America, and Christians should be engaging this issue, and that it trancends partisan politics.",

   "Oops, my fault. This is what \"my\" instead of \"the\" first post in this forum was addressing. \n\n \n Okay, so you were including foundit's subsequent posts, that's fine. You didn't make it clear, (you just specified the opener) and the whole first page is a few months old, so I wasn't thinking much about it. No problem. \n \n \nNot that I hold Atheist claims any more valid than the Christians. I think you'd agree that assaulting and threatening the lives of people that disagree is something that shouldn't happen in America, and Christians should be engaging this issue, and that it trancends partisan politics.\n\n \n A lot of things happen in America that shouldn't - they have to be decided on a case by case basis. What more should Christians be doing? In the first case, the atheist settled for an undisclosed amount. Wasn't that good enough? I'm sure foundit could come up with more like those, and I'd bet I could come up with more cases than the movie expelled documented about discrimination against religion from someone in the scientific community. It goes back to what I said in the above post;\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] I think anti-religious science discrimination is far worse, while atheists think discrimination as described in post #1 is far worse. Who is to say which is worse, and who is to say who starts these conflicts, and who reacts to them? Maybe the discrimination described in post #1 was reactionary to previous discrimination in that school districts science department, or the more national Dover decision. Don't you think that's a possibility? \n\n \n Maybe the discrimination described in post #3 was reactionary to some atheist provocation. There's actually no maybe about it;\n \n \nCaro, Michigan: In December 2001, Anonka-an open atheist who maintains a museum of Christian religious atrocities-appeared before the Tuscola County Board of Commissioners to challenge a nativity scene placed on public land. \n\n \n \"Maintains a museum\" / \"appears before a board of Commissioners\" - was this person not asking for trouble? Again another \"settlement\" - should Christians be bending over backwards to make sure these settlements are bigger? If they do, is that going to make atheists one bit more tolerant of Christians in the scientific community? You know the answer. \n \n In the six cases from foundits post #3 that you referred to, you'll notice that five of them were the result of atheist provocation.  If the atheists are clearly in the minority in these school settings, business settings, whatever, they should have enough sense not to do these things. If they don't and it leads to actual violence against them that justifies a jury trial, I've no doubt that a jury full of Christians will do the right thing.",

   "Denouncing threats and violence in a public forum instead of reactionary we get discriminated against too. If we want to present the other side denounce what wrong is done then present evidence that Christians also suffer the same. I dont think that that would offend non-Christians, in fact one of them said this attitude among Christians would result in less resentment. Then by Christians denouncing what is clearly wrong and showing there side too, if non-Christians refuse to denounce threats and violence against Christians, so be it. The hypocrisy if any will be proven. Take the \"ding dong the abortionist is dead\" posts and threads lately. They will get reactionary posts if you dont denounce murder, and then state your problem with the victim. I hate abortion but I know that isn't the way to present it. And non Christians will just make a Christian doing that look foolish. I hope they do. \n \n About the scientific community I can't answer, if theres discrimination based on the beliefs of a scientist rather than his performance, it should be corrected. I know of scientists personally that believe in evo and God. I know of scientists personally that are Creationists. I don't know their feilds. I'm not a scientist. I for one believe Genesis is truth. If someone wants to describe the origins of earth and man to me fine, be prepared for my views too. I don't go looking for scientists to debate on it because I'm not a scientist. I can tell them what I believe, but I wont understand when it's their turn. Their fields are specialized anyways, and an archaelogist most likely won't care much about the problems or validity of new biology or astronomy findings. I get no satisfaction in trying to post opposing evidence I can not understand to refute their claims. Chances are they either won't care or I'd have to depend on information I can't verify to tell them what the devil I'm talking about. And I have trouble being referred to and reading academian lectures on Ritters Law of Self Combusting Fecal Matter Regarding the Common Fruitfly (yes I made that up). So I tend to not post in creation vs. evo threads too often although they are entertaining to read. I don't think there's any wide ranging conspiracy among evo scientists or adherents except for the most looney to actively destroy God. More like satan's desire to destroy God, in which case you can point a finger at nearly anywhere for evidence, even Christianity. \n \n I agree I don't know what if anything can be done to stop it aside from standing on the truth and punishing according to the law. I wasn't calling for any special new laws about it, in my opinion we have enough.\n \n There was provocation, sure. So is missionary work. Because somebody stands for ideals and is willing to risk certain consequences, may mean they are committed or stupid, depending who you ask. They still have rights, and we still call what is wrong to be wrong.",
