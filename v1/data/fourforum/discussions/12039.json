To properly kill an animal which my grandfather did when I was a kid, meant to cut the jugular vein and bleed the animal of all blood before butchering it. He would actually slice a chickens throat and have it run around so the blood would pump out of it. Once it died, he would remove its head and hang it upside down for another half hour or so before butchering it. \n \n There is nothing wrong with transfusions though according to the bible that I have seen, especially for health concerns.",

   "There go the pleasures of a proper Blutwurst, I guess.\n \n Anyway, the blood thing is, in my opinion, a religiously hardcoded procedure for draining the blood, which I gather is quite important in the heated lands of the middle east. Just like the prohibition from killing cows so you wouldn't lose milk production in times of famine (when it's easy to forget that the milk of the cow will feed you in long term while the meat will only last a short while) now has hindus abstaining from all beef. Anything hardcoded into a religious prescription will work fine, but will be very hard to remove once it is obsolete.\n \n Mind you, I'll never forgive the JW. They owe me a pan's worth of french fries for distracting me with their visit one time I was having myself a good lunch. I left a whole pan of fries in the oil, soaking into inedibility. A crime only matched by the Chinese, who took a full plate of delicious fries... and then put about half a kilo of sugar on top. What had the poor fries done to deserve that?!?\n \n Oh, yeah, the JW...",
