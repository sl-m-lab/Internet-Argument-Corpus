   "I have started this thread in order to avert the potential to confuse the Employment Non Discrimination Act with the Hate Crimes/Matthew Shepard legislation. For a refresher, here is an article discussing Congress' abandoning the approach of attaching this legislation to a defense appropriations bill: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071206/ap_on_go_co/congress_hate_crimes;_ylt=ApnNbFuSSAn5bJfo5ZyHLBo8KbIF\n \n Also, you can catch up on the present discussion by reading from post 79 in the ENDA thread.\n \n Finally, I will reiterate my view that:\n As for the reasons people might not support the Matthew Shepard Act: I don't support any hate crimes legislation, and hence I do not support that bill. It has nothing to do with hostility to anyone. It has to do with hate crimes legislation treating similar crimes differently. I perceive that as unfair.\n I have no doubt that we will have the opportunity to discuss my view (and others' as well) now that this thread is separate.",

   ":xbanghead\n\n No need to bang your head. Let's talk this out and see if we get somewhere. lol.\n \n \nThe law commonly prescribes scales of punishments based on severity and motive -- for example, there are various verdicts and sentences involved in the crime of killing someone, ranging from accidental or negligent homicide through 1st degree murder. There is nothing unusual or unfair about this, and it's been historically applied to many kinds of crime.\n\n This is not exactly what I mean by \"similar crimes.\" I am aware of the fact that there are degrees of homicide, but the categories are not distinguished according to motive in the sense that I use the term. Let me give an example using the crime of homicide. I want to consider this abstractly in order to make my point clearly.\n \n First allow me to give an example where a similar homicide would be treated differently under the law. Suppose we have two individuals who kill their girlfriend for the exact same reason, yet under very different circumstances. In order to remove the sort of emotion that is stirred up by using current classifications, let's generically say that both of these individuals killed their girlfriend because she wore a pink jacket, and both of these individuals happen to dislike very much (or, hate) the color pink.\n \n Now, suppose individual number one commits the crime of first degree murder, whereas individual number two commits the crime of second degree murder. Our first individual, to be charged with first degree murder, would have to have planned to kill his girlfriend. So, suppose one day he picked his girlfriend up, and she was wearing a pink jacket which he happens to despise. But instead of getting in an immediate rage, he performs no hostile action. Now suppose that after that incident, the individual proceeds to go home and draws up an elaborate plan to kill his girlfriend. Then, one day, he executes the plan. In this instance, our first individual committed premeditated murder of his girlfriend, and he did so specifically because she wore pink some number of days previously.\n \n Now, take our second individual who will commit second degree murder. Make the scenario the same. One day he picked up his girlfriend, and she was wearing a pink jacket. But unlike our first individual, this person goes into an immediate rage, killing his girlfriend in the exact manner as the previous person killed his. In this instance, the individual killed his girlfriend because she wore pink, but it was not premeditated.\n \n From this example we see that the crimes are not treated differently because of their motives; but rather because of the circumstances surrounding the crime (premeditated vs. non-premeditated). The distinction has nothing to do with one person committing a crime for a different reason than the other person, since both of them committed the crime for the same reason.\n \n Now, this is not the type of distinction that hate crimes legislation makes. Hate crimes legislation creates a new category within existing categories of crime, and says that if you commit the crime for x, y, or z reason, then you will be treated one way. But, if you commit the exact same crime for xx, yy, or zz reason, then you will be treated another way. Using our hypothetical, we can now modify it to cover an example of a hate crime vs. a non-hate crime.\n \n Let's suppose that committing a crime against someone based on the color of their jacket is defined as a hate crime, but committing the same crime against someone based on the color of their shoes is not. Then the following scenario results.\n \n Suppose person 1 commits first-degree homicide against a person because they were wearing a blue jacket, and person 1 happens to detest blue sweaters. This person will have committed a hate crime.\n \n Suppose person 2 commits first-degree homicide in exactly the same manner (or, to show even greater discrepancy, commits first-degree homicide in an objectively more brutal and inhumane manner) than person 1 above. Suppose that person 2 committed the crime because the individual was wearing blue shoes, and person 2 happens to detest blue shoes. But because killing someone because of their shoe color is not classified as a hate crime, person 2 will be treated differently from person 1. And the nature of hate crimes is that person 1 will receive harsher treatment than person 2 simply because of the motivation behind his crime. He will be treated harsher than person 2 merely because of the reason that he committed his crime, not based on any substantially different circumstances surrounding the crime.\n \n The implications of such disparate treatment include, but are not limited to: suggesting that person 1's crime was worse than person 2; suggesting that person 1's victim is more valuable than person 2's; suggesting that killing someone for reason X is manifestly and objectively more unjust, immoral, and deplorable than killing someone for reason Y. I do not agree with any of these suggestions as a matter of justice. If it is demonstrable that harsher penalties are needed to prevent jacket-color homicides, then I submit that harsher penalties ought to be applied to all homicides.\n \n \nIn any case, the sort of acts prohibited under so-called hate crime law are really acts of terrorism over and above any injury caused to the immediate target. Therefore their consequences are correspondingly greater, and it is perfectly just to exact a correspondingly greater punishment. There is nothing restrictive here of thought or speech, just action.\n\n You won't get far with me by appealing to terrorism. I can see how that could be the case in the early-mid period of the 1900s with respect to racial crimes, but I do not see it happening today to any particular classifications (race included). Sure there might be isolated instances of these particular crimes, but nowhere near the amount that would warrant treating people differently as a matter of deterrence. And besides that, if deterrence is the purpose, then simply increase the penalties for the entire category of the crime. Don't just increase the penalties for a crime merely because it was committed for reason Y rather than reason Z. To do so is to suggest that it is more acceptable to commit the crime for reason Z than it is for reason Y. My view is that it is not acceptable to commit the crime period.\n \n Also, I have not suggested the laws seek to restrict thought or speech. I realize that that is a common objection to these laws, but I have not made that argument myself. My main issue is that treating similar crimes different is de facto unjust to the perpetrator of the crimes, and it suggests that committing a crime is more acceptable according to the reasons why it was committed. There may be other pragmatic reasons to treat crimes that are similar differently, but I do not see a need for that in today's society. And furthermore, I certainly do not see a need to expand the definition of hate crimes.",

Terrorism is a good analogy. It affects an entire group of people in how they live day to day, not simply the person(s) directly harmed or killed. Many Americans remarked how life would never be the same after 9-11, there was the so-called, \"new normal\".

The distinction has nothing to do with one person committing a crime for a different reason than the other person, since both of them committed the crime for the same reason.\n\n \n Premeditation is frequently an issue in terrorism directed against the gay community. Matthew Shepard, for example, was not simply punched because he made a sexual advance to some drunken homophobe who blew his stack. He was taken away, and basically lynched by two guys, observed by their girlfriends. The bombing of gay bars -- for example, when Christian activist Eric Rudolph bombed the Otherside Lounge, a lesbian bar in Atlanta -- is certainly not a random, spur-of-the-moment act. It's premeditated and designed to strike fear into the gay community. Gay-bashers will often stake out gay bars, follow people who exit them alone, then attack them in the street or in their homes.\n \n The element of premeditation is frequently present in gay-bashing. That is one reason WHY they count as terrorist acts.\n \n \nNow, this is not the type of distinction that hate crimes legislation makes. Hate crimes legislation creates a new category within existing categories of crime, and says that if you commit the crime for x, y, or z reason, then you will be treated one way. But, if you commit the exact same crime for xx, yy, or zz reason, then you will be treated another way. Using our hypothetical, we can now modify it to cover an example of a hate crime vs. a non-hate crime.\n\n \n This isn't true at all. If someone mugs a person for their wallet, and that person happens to be gay, then that's just unfortunate, one of the risks of being in a dangerous environment. It's not a hate crime, and no police force in any jurisdiction that has hate crime legislation would regard it as one. It is, in fact, very difficult to prove a hate crime, precisely because the prosecution has to demonstrate that degree of premeditation, that the crime was not random, but deliberately targetted against an individual or property perceived to be gay. Evidence might consist of anti-gay literature in the assailant's home, or anti-gay epithets shouted during the course of the attack, or a history of hostility towards gay people.\n \n \nLet's suppose that committing a crime against someone based on the color of their jacket is defined as a hate crime, but committing the same crime against someone based on the color of their shoes is not. Then the following scenario results.\n \n Suppose person 1 commits first-degree homicide against a person because they were wearing a blue jacket, and person 1 happens to detest blue sweaters. This person will have committed a hate crime.\n \n Suppose person 2 commits first-degree homicide in exactly the same manner (or, to show even greater discrepancy, commits first-degree homicide in an objectively more brutal and inhumane manner) than person 1 above. Suppose that person 2 committed the crime because the individual was wearing blue shoes, and person 2 happens to detest blue shoes. But because killing someone because of their shoe color is not classified as a hate crime, person 2 will be treated differently from person 1. And the nature of hate crimes is that person 1 will receive harsher treatment than person 2 simply because of the motivation behind his crime. He will be treated harsher than person 2 merely because of the reason that he committed his crime, not based on any substantially different circumstances surrounding the crime.\n \n The implications of such disparate treatment include, but are not limited to: suggesting that person 1's crime was worse than person 2; suggesting that person 1's victim is more valuable than person 2's; suggesting that killing someone for reason X is manifestly and objectively more unjust, immoral, and deplorable than killing someone for reason Y. I do not agree with any of these suggestions as a matter of justice. If it is demonstrable that harsher penalties are needed to prevent jacket-color homicides, then I submit that harsher penalties ought to be applied to all homicides.\n\n \n Well, the response here is quite simple. Ask the question: is there a history of hostility towards people who wear jackets and shoes of a particular colour? There is such a history for people of one religion or another; one skin colour or another; and one (only) sexual orientation. There is a real history of terrorism in all these cases, not only in America, but throughout the world.\n \n \nYou won't get far with me by appealing to terrorism. I can see how that could be the case in the early-mid period of the 1900s with respect to racial crimes, but I do not see it happening today to any particular classifications (race included).\n\n \n And you won't get anywhere with me by turning a blind eye to terrorism if it is committed against people you do not identify with. OK, so the group of people you belong to isn't terrorised. Good for you. Matthew Shepard is no less an act of lynching than that of any black strung up by the KKK. \n \n \nSure there might be isolated instances of these particular crimes, but nowhere near the amount that would warrant treating people differently as a matter of deterrence.\n\n \n So if only a few people are terrorised, then we shouldn't bother trying to deter the crime? That is an astonishing piece of sophistry! emoticon_wow Tell us, Phyllis, how many victims does it take before a crime is fit to be deterred and punished as an act of terrorism? 3000? Six million? What kind of a person would try to do this sort of math? \"Oh, it's only x thousand a year, we don't need to deter that!\"\n \n \nAnd besides that, if deterrence is the purpose, then simply increase the penalties for the entire category of the crime.\n\n \n Well, here you come close to admitting that hate crimes against gays are just as terroristic as those against blacks or Jews, the other two principal targets of terrorism in the US. I am all in favour of laws against ALL acts of terrorism, not just those that exclude gays as victims.\n \n \nDon't just increase the penalties for a crime merely because it was committed for reason Y rather than reason Z. To do so is to suggest that it is more acceptable to commit the crime for reason Z than it is for reason Y. My view is that it is not acceptable to commit the crime period.\n\n \n You are refusing to get it. The penalty is not increased merely because of the motive or intention; it's increased because of the consequences to a larger group of people. You cannot just look at intent and ignore consequences. When someone commits a terrorist act against blacks or gays, or Catholics or Jews, there is more than one victim of that crime. The whole community is intimidated, because they realise they are targets BECAUSE they are members of that community, rather than members of some other, and there is nothing they can possibly do to avoid being seen as members of that community.\n \n \nAlso, I have not suggested the laws seek to restrict thought or speech. I realize that that is a common objection to these laws, but I have not made that argument myself. My main issue is that treating similar crimes different is de facto unjust to the perpetrator of the crimes, and it suggests that committing a crime is more acceptable according to the reasons why it was committed. There may be other pragmatic reasons to treat crimes that are similar differently, but I do not see a need for that in today's society. And furthermore, I certainly do not see a need to expand the definition of hate crimes.\n\n \n Well, again, similar crimes have a history of being treated differently, because of distinctions in intent, motive, circumstances and consequences. That is as it should be. A deliberate gay-bashing is more heinous than an attack on someone who coincidentally happens to be gay. You may not see the consequences of terrorism in society, but I humbly submit that you aren't looking too carefully. I see it all the time.",

   "Terrorism is a hate crime\n \n Here is the rationale behind terrorism, and why the term applies to gay-bashing, racial lynching, and systematic attacks against adherents of some religion, such as anti-Semitism.\n \n Terrorism is designed to identify members of a community, and to intimidate that community by singling out individuals within it for persecution, or even murder. The message is: anyone might be a victim, even you, just because of who you are and what you represent by your mere existence. A classic example is the pogroms against the Jews carried out in Poland and Tzarist Russia.\n \n The attack of 9/11 can be defined as a terrorist attack, because it singled out Westerners, and especially Americans, as particularly worthy of dying because they are Westerners or Americans. The victims weren't chosen at random; it wasn't a pique of insane rage; it was a cold, calculated, deliberate and brutal attack against an entire community in order to make it feel insecure and fearful. It was very successful, far beyond the immediate 3000 casualties.\n \n The regular and in some cases systematic assaults against minority communities in the US fall into a similar class, though perhaps not as acute. Indeed, over the years, they have had similar numbers of victims, though no single prior terrorist attack has been as shocking and effective as 9/11. The psychological effect they have is both powerful and pervasive -- it can be crippling, and it can be argued that US democracy has been crippled as a result.\n \n The effects of more minor acts of terrorism such as gay-bashing or lynching of blacks are slower, but ultimately just as insidious to the community they are aimed against. They generate fear and apprehension. When they are as heinous as Matthew Shepard's, they can also induce shock, as they are meant to. This is part of the reality of the society we live in, but it is not one we should meekly accept as inevitable or not worth trying to correct.",

   "Laws against terrorism are unfair? Says who?\n \n Another thing I don't get is the claim that laws against terrorism are \"unfair\" to the terrorists. Since when? It is particularly interesting that fairness mysteriously becomes an issue when dealing with the instigators of gay-bashing, but is never the issue when dealing with equal rights for gay citizens, who apparently do not have the same rights to fair treatment under the law as the people who attack them. Evidently, fairness is only in the eyes of the beholder.\n \n No, laws against terrorism are perfectly fair, because they address a different form of crime. Just as one wouldn't punish a driver who negligently killed a pedestrian with the same severity as one who deliberately ran one down, one shouldn't punish an opportunistic mugger with the same severity one reserves for a calculating terrorist.

It's also tiny compared to the 1,366 combined anti-homosexual hate crime incidents and the 1,027 anti-Jewish hate crime incidents. It's even lower than the 191 anti-Muslim hate crime incidents. In fact, even Asians and Pacific Islanders experience more hate crime incidents that Christians - and Christians make up the majority of the U.S. population!\n\n \n Yet the tiny handful of reported hate crimes committed against the vast majority of Christians are evidently a tidal wave of anti-Christian hatred. Ignore the Christian terrorist, it's only terrorism against Christians that counts!\n \n emoticon_rolleyes",

It's anti-gay activists who have suddenly discovered that when hate crime legislation covers gays, they are agin it... probably because they've realised Christians tend not to be the victims of hate crimes, so legislation is superfluous in their case. :)",
