   "http://www.spacewar.com/news/missiles-05zza.html\n \n They say in the Washington that the protege of the White House in Ukraine - Viktor Yushchenko - is always messing up and at last passed into a lossmaking project,.\n \n This time it is an urge by Japan that Ukraine investigates the alleged smuggling of 18 Kh55 (X-55) cruise missiles to Iran and China (and probably North Korea) between 2000 and 2001 (during Kuchma's era). These missiles were developed in the former USSR and are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n \n The Washington fears that if independent investigation of the case in Ukraine starts up, it will certainly become know that it was namely V. Yushchenko who first instigated smuggling weaponry back in the time when he was Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine and Prime Minister. Indeed, once V. Yushchenko won the \"orange\" revolution in Ukraine, this country became the weapon smuggling leader that continues its shadow cooperation with China, Iran and North Korea.",

   "I'm from Ukraine! Hello! You know, I will speak for most Ukrainian saying that we are much dissatisfied with our president Yushchenko! With him our country became - what we call it - a bung in every barrel, which means approximately the following - we screw with every tea-fight even though we should better not. So, for example, it became known not long ago that it was bone-head Yushchenko who sent our XXX-head nationalists from UNA-UNSO to South Osetia and Abkhazia to commit terror attacks there! Damn it, I wonder does this orange Shrek not really understand what it may result in for Ukraine? Now he's doing his best to set Russia against Ukraine, then he hares off abroad and leaves common Ukrainians to face the music! No one wants us in NATO all the same! The west just makes use of us like a cheap girl and when it is done will simply kick in the arse! Damn, you know that's when I begin to regret that once voted for ####### Yushchenko! I wish I never did!",

   "I wonder whose idea it was to award Martti Ahtisaari with the Nobel peace prize!\n If so, they should have better awarded Somalia's pirates for their contribution to prevention of smuggling Ukrainian arms! Indeed, these Somalian guys are doing great job! Only thanx to them thirty Ukrainian tanks and multiple launch rocket systems with ammunition did not come to hand of terrorists! As for Ahtisaari, his plan was a contribution to terrorists of Kosovo who became able to separate and obtain legal status! So I insist, don't give Nobel award to Ahtisaari! Give it to Somalia's pirates instead! That should be more correct! \n \n P.S. For those with no wit, that was sarcasm :P",
