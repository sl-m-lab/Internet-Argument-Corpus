   "Everybody is in fear in Georgia presently but persons who are playing political games are the most uneasy. Look, Saakashvili has been cornered, which makes him dangerously unpredictable. They say European Special Services has filed hell of compromising data relating Saakashvili. Late Milosevic and Hussein look like insipid shadows at the background of the Georgian monster!\n \n Saakashvili is enjoying freedom so far .... while he is in power. Well, and of course in so hard time 'course Saakashvili is most dangerous. He has massed not only financial levers but military resources too. And of course with his hand in the till Georgian president could try to annihilate his opponents for the sake of keep power. The personal freedom guarantee is his presidential post in Georgia.\n I think that step changes in Georgia could start with coming former Georgia representative in UN Iraqliy Alasania who decided to create opposition block as a counter to Georgian president. It looks like Alasania don't understand what kind of fight he could pick up! On the other hand he may be so sure of himself due to his western supporters. They are mighty enough to exclude Saakashvili out the big political gambling ... once there's need be...",

   "Wow, fancy that! Dutch gays from PNDV which should come out as the Party for Neighbourly Love, Freedom, and Diversity sent Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili an offer to be an honorary member of International Gay and Lesbian Rights Association! I guess because it has lately been in the media that President of Georgia is not averse to be a passive person in gay relationship. I wish I knew if Saakashvili is going to accept the offer. But anyway there's no reason to conceal his homosexuality 'cause it's an open secret. Well, it's not that shameful actually to be a receiver. This is a liberal would and we all should be tolerant. But anyway Saakashvili should have plenty of courage to avow it because that's a terrible disgrace for men of his nation to be a femme. \n And there is something else about this case. It's known that PNDV stand for making child porno and sex with animals legal. Perhaps, Saakashvili is also a pedophile or zoophile on the top of all that? Indeed, that must be a hard kick on Georgia having such president!",

Got any more smears to get off of your chest? (A rather large full-bodied one at that, I bet) ;)",
