   "I don't ever belong to any religion, I've studied bible this book for 12 years, 6 years in christian school and another 6 years in catholic school. And some days later after school, I have had at least 10 years time in my life so believe in God , I swear I was !\n \n My mom died in Jan 2000, I was so sad and I still miss her so much till now. I began to read bible again after my mom's death cos I really hope that I could meet my mom again in my next life so that I could do something to return to my mom. I hope that I could find if there's any hints about that in bible.\n \n This time I read the bible, damn it, I found that bible is just a common fairy tales book only, oh, no!!! .......I found that there's no GOD !!! \n \n I was fool for so many years by this bible , damn it !!!\n \n That dosen't matter that I was fool but I was so hurt, you know, I really hope that there's GOD in our life !!!",

I would like to respond to this though, because I've had a similiar experience. My sunday school teacher asked us why we thought \"God\" didn't punish people of other religions for not believing in him....I think we were supposed to answer because he is a merciful god. However, I asked why it couldn't be that all the Gods are really the same essence of God, just worshipped in different ways. My sunday school teacher told me that this absolutely could not be true and continued to shoot down my arguement. However, the only proof she could come up with was a quote from the ten commandments which I can't remember the exact words of...something about believing only in him and no other god....so, yeah, feel free to pick apart my arguement 'cause I don't really care....",
