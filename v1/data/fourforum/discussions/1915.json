   "This is an entry form an internet journal that I don't really maintain anymore but I think it is still relevant. I wrote it a year ago or so. Personally I believe that if the Republicans and Christians (I add Christians to Republicans because even John Kerry says he is against gay marriage.) are successful in banning gay marriage they will look for another target. I believe that alternative religions will be a prime target for them. Let's face it Jerry Falwell went on television after the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 and blamed the \"gays\" and \"pagans\" as well as many others for the attacks. So once they are done restricting the rights of the homosexual community they will be looking for the next group to persecute.\n \n Anyway, here's that entry...\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\" The establishment clause in the 1st Amendment of the U.S. constitution.\n \n This is a great and admirable ideal. It is too bad that the religious majority in this country does not hold this ideal. In fact mainline to conservative Christians in this country are much more like the leaders of the Taliban than they are like the founding fathers. The founding fathers understood that people must be allowed to have their own religious beliefs. They knew that no government should not be allowed to legislate religion. \n \n Let's look at the Taliban. They were a governmental organization that was heavily influenced by religion. Let us forget for a moment that they are Muslims. They hated and wanted to obliterate all other religions. They destroyed beautiful and irreplaceable works of art in this endeavor. With the Taliban the only freedom of religion was to practice their brand of religion. That is not freedom. \n \n Now if you exchange the leaders of the Taliban with current political leader in the US and change Islam with Christianity you get about the same results. Here are some examples. \"The military should rethink their position. That's not a religion.\" G.W Bush, governor of Texas, referring to the Wiccan religion. \"This move sets a dangerous precedent that could easily result in the practice of all sorts of bizarre practices being supported by the military under the rubric of 'religion.' \", Bob Barr (R-GA) about the military allowing Wiccan soldiers to practice their religion. As you can see this religious intolerance reaches to the highest levels. I can't say it enough; George W. Bush is an anti-freedom leader. He neither represents the people of this country or its ideals. He would have peoples' religious freedom stripped from them! We are not talking about some obscure executive order insuring religious freedom here. We are talking about THE BILL OF RIGHTS! This is a list of our most sacred rights as Americans. Religion is one of them. Bush and Barr are clueless. What they fight against in the so called \"war an terror\" they perpetrate in this country. I heard on 770 AM here in New York, a station known for its conservative hosts, a suggestion that all environmentalists should be fingerprinted as possible terrorists. It's not a big leap for these people to start suggesting that this be done to religious groups they disagree with. Let's face it most Wiccans are very involved with the environment. (As a side note I am a Neo-Pagan, my job title is environmental scientist, and I'm a Marxist so basically I'm ****ed. I might as well kiss all my rights goodbye now!)\n \n If I made comments about these Christians like they do about pagan religions I would be sued for defamation. Barr said, \"What's next? Will armored divisions be forced to travel with sacrificial animals for Satanic rituals? Will Rastafarians demand the inclusion of ritualistic marijuana cigarettes in their rations?...\". Did you know that the FBI has no record of any human sacrifice or \"satanic\" ritual abuse ever happening in this country? That's right its just a Christian smear campaign. (See religioustolerance.org) If I said that Bob Barr and GW Bush sacrificed bunnies and I had no proof what do you think would happen to me? I don't want to take Bush and Barr's religion form them. Quite frankly I don't want them as a part of mine, they would reflect poorly on it.\n \n Because of people like Bush and Barr I am unable to talk to friends, colleagues and family about my religious choices. My freedom is gone because Christians are insecure in their faith. They can't stand the idea that there might be multiple paths to enlightenment. My beliefs are no more valid than the Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Taoists, atheists, pantheists etc... It is my journey and according to the constitution it is my right to freely practice it! But I can't because I risk being fired from my job and being ostracized by my friends and family. So, for now I will continue to wear my pentacle beneath my shirt while others wear their crosses openly. I will put away my alter when people visit me but I will be subjected to church bells on Sunday. I will hide my esoteric library but will find a Gideon Bible in the next hotel I stay in. \n \n Some day I hope to be able to live in a free country.",

Much like this war on terrorism it is easy for any government to kill people as long as the problem is perceived as \"bigger\" than the rights of the individual. That is why drugs are illegal it is my right to consume any substance I want. It should be noted that drinking poison with out intent to kill your self is not illegal, but certain substances scare the government so they feel it is better to deny your human rights than to play clean up for irresponsible or malicious individuals.\n \n BTW the first drug law in the USA was to ban opium dens in an attempt to prevent white women from being \"seduced\" by Chinese men an underhanded attempt to segregate whites who preferred morphine which was legal from Chinese laborers who culturally preferred smoking opium. Majority of drug laws are elitist and statistically racist. Prison got worse when drug offenses became a crime not only were more people put into prison, but most felt the laws were unjust so they breed dissent (the first dealers were doctors and their addicts were their patients) unlike old school criminals they felt they didn't deserve time. That new psychology plagues the prison population to this day. At the turn of the century \"it was just a little morphine\" was the precursor to the \"modern it was just a little pot\".\n \n Back to religion considering it is the \"opium of the masses\" religion will be banned or limited in the future. While you'll still have your \"rights\" as an individual, but your religion won't have many if any rights. Your religion will only be able to exist in between your ears. Individuals may be safe institutions will not, and any that is not under fealty to the respective government will be dismantled. There goes my propaganda for today.",

Ever wonder why we have things like pro-choice, even though the right-wing hates it?\n \n The US is a free country.
