   "First of all, humans did not evolve from monkeys! Monkeys are a current group, not an extinct one. Humans and Old World monkeys share a common ancestor probably some where in the Oligocene, 38-22 million years ago. However, I dont think that there have been to this date any suitable fossil finds that can verify this. Humans only diverged from the Great Apes 5-7mya. \n \n Also, speciation events do not take place immediately as you say(usually. Occasionally errors in meiosis will yield gametes with twice the normal number of chromosomes, thereby immediately leading to a new species. This is in fact very common among many plants especially ones that humans rely on for food. I believe that it has also been observed in some amphibian species. But dont quote me on that.) Speciation is a gradual process overtime, though how much time and how fast speciation occurs is still a matter of debate (graudualism vs punctuated equilibrium). Also, we don't evolve out of necessity. The fact that a species is endangered does not necessarily imply that it will \"evolve\" to survive. Endangered populations may be able to adapt, some wont, but there is no conscious effort on the part of the organism to evolve to a better form.",

   "Well, I'm going to have a go at this on the presumption that you aren't a troll, although this string of posts kind of has that sound. There are two parts.\n \nAlthough I believe in evolution, I haven't studied it enough to learn how a new species actually begins.\n\n Evolution isn't something to believe in. The theory is something that is accepted as the best explanation for the observed facts. The facts of evolution are the evidence upon which the theory is built. In spite of what creationists tell you, we have observed evolution. In fact, creationists claim that all of the species we now know evolved from the \"kinds\" on the ark in only a few years. They call it \"variation in kind\" but have never been able to present any evidence for a barrier that prevents speciation.\n \nTake humans for instance. Assuming we came from monkeys or whatever, our species obviously started out with only 1 human.\n\n No. No species is never only 1 unless it is the last one. Here is the biological definition of evolution: Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. To make that clear, an allele is one of two or more alternate forms for the same gene. The gene that determines eye color has several alleles. Since genes are the units of heredity, the first condition of evolution is that it is heritable. Second, by frequency the definition means relative proportion. If in 1950 the allele that made the peppered moth black was so numerous that 98% of all peppered moths in industrial areas of England were black. 50 years later, about 2% are black. The frequency of the black gene relative to the white gene has decreased. Third, individuals don't evolve, populations do. I already gave the example of the population of peppered moths. Finally, evolution happens over time, from generation to generation, often times very slowly, but some times observable change happens rather quickly - but always from generation to generation.\n \nA strange twist of fate created a human from a monkey. Now, where does it go from there? We have this one human with no other humans to mate with. Do more monkeys begin having humans? Does the human mate with monkeys to make half human, half monkeys?\n\n I'll bet if you actually think about that that after reading what I said above you will see where it is wrong. Aside from the fact that man wasn't born from a monkey, there was never a time when there wasn't a population of organisms. And in a way you might say that it is a twist of fate that caused speciation. Some thoughts on the matter have been that a gradual change in in climate (recorded in the geology of Africa) resulted in a gradual change from forest to open grassland and caused the isolation of populations of a species of ape. In some of those populations some individuals had some genetic characteristics that allowed then to better survive to reproduce. Those characteristics became more and more common in the population. In other words, the frequency of those alleles became more common over generations. This isn't my field and I can't speak with any authority. But even if it were, the exact causes are a matter of much debate and research. If you are really interested then I recommend that you read The Fossil Trail: How we know what we think we know about human evolution by Ian Tattersall (Oxford University Press, 1995). Tattersall is a paleoanthropologist and an expert in the field. He is Curator of in the Department of Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History.\n \nAnd once a small population of humans begin, how do they prevent breeding with close relatives and causing retardation and such?\n\n It's not retardation. Interbreeding between closely related species or populations is called hybridization. It happens all the time in nature. It doesn't matter. It happens all the time. In fact, it is one of the recognized mechanisms of evolution - it's called gene flow and it increases the genetic diversity of populations. But a small population of some insipient species probably arose because it was isolated from the partent species in the first place - geographical isolation, adaptation to breeding cycles of prey animals, change in food source - there are many ways that a sub-population may be isolated. If it remains isolated long enough, the cumulative evolution of both sub-populations may prevent interbreeding if they do meet again.\n \nSo your [sic](Crim) suggesting it would be an extended period of slow microevolutions within a group that would eventually create a new species? What could cause an entire group within a close proximity of each other being to begin evolving all at once?\n\n Given that microevolution is any evolution below the level of species, yes. But species don't \"begin\" to evolve. They are always evolving. Environments are changing all the time and the organisms in those environments either have the genetic diversity that allows adaptation, or they don't. If they don't they go extinct in that environment and are replaced by other organisms. It's funny. You seem to look at it as a matter of \"gosh, how could two populations become different?\" and I see it as how can they not if they are isolated. We know that populations evolve - there is no doubt. That is not speculation or assumption but well documented and published fact. We know that genetic mutation occurs - again observed fact. Given isolation for sufficient time or when one population is subjected to environmental stress they may undergo genetic change (evolution) to such an extent that they no longer interbreed. It has been observed in fruit flies. Such has been observed in several strains of Drosophila in the lab. Although they arose from the same source, they have been cultivated for so long as isolated populations that they have become separate species.\n \nAlso if this is the case, then is it even possible that we can evolve from humans now that we are so mobile and our groups are often mixed?\n\n I agree with Crim if you question is whether humans can possibly speciate. Probably not. We move around and intermix a bit too much. Guess what it's called? Gene flow. My heritage is Polish, Prussian, English. And the Germanic people were, of couse, the barbaric hoards from the east. I have known people who were a little as 1/16 Cherokee, because the Cherokees keep track. No. There is a bit too much gene flow for speciation to happen. But don't get the idea that someone from one side of the world needs to breed with someone from the other side of the world. It is enough that an Englishman breed with a French woman. The offspring breeds with an Austrian whos offspring breeds with a Cerb and so on and so on. All populations of humans interbreed with neighboring populations.\n \nNah there are surely greater forces working on us now than there were when we were cavemen.\n\n You'll have to define \"greater forces.\" If those forces do not affect the likelihood that an individual will survive and reproduce, then it is irrelevant. Not only that, the differential reproductive success that is natural selection says that evolution is driven by those individuals that reproduce in greater numbers.",

   "Part 2 of 2\n \nConsider that we now spend a lot less time moving, have very different diets, and deal with a whole lot more stress. The environment no longer really dictates our lives and it is now more our society that does so. Don't you think that living in a certain society will make for a need to evolve especially considering the fact that a specific group living along side other groups may evolve while the other don't?\n\n No. Go back to the definition of evolution to see why. Only those things that have an effect on reproductive success are meaningful. Although that is not to say that there aren't some very real evolutionary changes that can be observed in human populations. A good example is the peoples that live at high altitude. Where you would require oxygen, a Sherpa or an Andes Inca will perform hard physical labor. Apparently these are adaptations (genetic) to some degree. It has been noted that high Andes people who live in Lima, Peru seem to have health problems and have a lower life expectency. That is evolution. If you want another example in humans we can talk about wisdom teeth. Some people don't have them and that seems to be increasing in certain societies, the U.S. for one. Humans are still evolving but only in those areas where we have not learned to control our environment. Humans probably aren't evolving at a very rapid rate but we are. But there is too much gene flow to allow for speciation.\n \nAnd don't you think animals who are living in more and more endangered environmental areas should begin evolving to compensate especially those that are now forced to live in cities?\n\n But populations (animals or plants) don't \"begin\" to evolve. They are evolving all the time. But generally speaking, the larger the population, the larger the gene pool and the less obvious that evolution will be and the longer it will take. Also speaking generally, if the change in environment is too extreme and/or too quick, populations don't have the genetic diversity to adapt go extinct in that environment.\n \nI really wish I could see a case of actual evolution happening naturally on a complex and obvious level so there would be no need to wonder whether evolution really does exist or not. If there is a case of this already let me know.\n\n Sure. I gave you one above. Drosophilia in laboratory strains. How about Brown bears? DNA analysis has shown that they are remarkably similar around the world, except for small populations on the ABC islands of Alaska. The DNA of these Brown bears is like Polar bears. So these Brown bears are indistinguishable from other Brown bears in appearance, and yet are indistinguishable from Polar bears from DNA analysis. Curious, isn't it? Also consider the fact that all Brown bears and all Polar bears are interfertile and produce fertile offspring (as far as is known).\n \n Or how about Herring gulls? The Herring gull is found in northern Europe and ranges to the west to Iceland and southern Greenland. There it meets the American herring gull, from which it is almost indistinguishable and with which it freely interbreeds. The American herring gull ranges across North America to Alaska where it is adjacent to and interbreeds with the Vega herring gull in Siberia. The Vega herring gull interbreeds with the adjacent population of Birula's gull, which interbreeds with the adjacent population of Heuglin's gull, which interbreeds with the adjacent population of Siberian lesser black-backed gull, which interbreeds with the Lesser black-backed gull. All very nice, I'm sure you will agree. Here are all of these adjacent populations of gulls that are only slightly different in appearence, one from the other, that interbreed. Except that the Lesser black-backed gull shares an almost identical range with the Herring gull and doesn't interbreed with it. So here we have a contiguous and continuously interbreeding population of birds that circles the globe and the extremes of that population cannot interbreed. If you could eliminate all herring gulls in North America, you would create two species. Even though we know that these birds are the overlapping extremes of a single species (known as a ring species), the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull are traditionally classified as seperate species.",

   "I have only one quibble with what you have said. I may be on the road to learn something here.\n \nSpeciation is a gradual process overtime, though how much time and how fast speciation occurs is still a matter of debate (graudualism vs punctuated equilibrium).\n\n I think that representation of the problem is no longer gradualism vs punk eek. Eldridge and Gould did not ever intend the hopeful monster hypothesis of GoldSchmidt. Punk eek proposed that under stable environmental conditions, well adapted populations tended to show very little change. In other words, natural selection tended to select for the status quo. However, if some sub-population became isolated under different environmental conditions, the those individuals that were better adapted to the new environment would tend to survive in greater numbers. Moreover, given the smaller population, those genes that were adaptive to the new environment would be likely to reach fixation in the new, smaller population where they would be only one example of many diverse alleles in the parent population. That is not to say that the evolution of the sub-population was not gradual. It just happend more quickly than the well adapted \"equalibrium\" of the larger parent population.\n \n Eldridge and Gould made it clear from the start that they were not arguing against gradualism. They proposed the relatively more rapid evolution of isolated populations followed by the replacement of the parent population when the two sub-populations were joined.",

The environment no longer really dictates our lives and it is now more our society that does so. Don't you think that living in a certain society will make for a need to evolve especially considering the fact that a specific group living along side other groups may evolve while the other don't?\n \n A response from the viewpoint that modern civilization is in evolution more than Man:\n \n If you are wondering if homo sapiens will branch, I think Darwin, at least, would tell you that we will not see any further ascent of Man on the evolutionary scale. In his discussion of natural selection and civilized nations, he identifies stages of Man, past and present: \"semi-human, modern savage, and civilized man.\" When Darwin reaches the present age, he tends to drift away from the idea that Man as a species is in evolution and begins to make the case rather that societies and civilized nations are evolving. As Darwin advances his thoughts, the reader perceives the presence of a growing uncertainty within the author about the future state of modern Man and society.\n \n To Darwin, modern Man is an altogether different creature than the plants and beasts his theories were built around. This is because modern Man has acquired an overall higher sense of moral responsibility. He says that in the world of savages the weak and infirmed are quickly eliminated, whereas civilized man \"...checks (stops) the process of elimination.\" We have done this as an outcropping of our acquired instinct of moral sympathy and via the creation of a welfare system, e.g., hospitals, asylums, care for the elderly, vaccinations made available to the less fortunate, etc.\n \n This moral enlightenment and its subsequent thwarting of the natural evolutionary process of elimination seem to trouble Darwin. He writes, \"We must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad affects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind.\" He only comforts himself by identifying a free-standing process of elimination: \"...the weak and inferior members of society do not marry so freely as the sound.\"\n \n This is just one instance of the kind of back and forth movement that drives Darwin's thoughts as he identifies processes in contemporary society that aid in natural selection and processes that otherwise hinder it. He seems happy that the wealthy, educated, and moral people are more prone to stay healthy and in power, but his tone turns melancholy when he mentions the \"multiplication of the reckless and improvident.\" \n \n He adds that if natural selection is not allowed to work in modern society and does \"...not prevent the reckless, the vicious and otherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate than the better class of men, the nation will retrograde.\" He warns, \"We must remember that progress is no invariable rule.\"\n \n At this juncture, Darwin is faced with a paradox. He has already gone to great lengths to define the rise of moral instincts in Man: love, obedience, aid of fellow man, sympathy, benevolence, self-sacrifice, desire for praise, dread of blame, shame and remorse, the Golden Rule, temperance, chastity, religion, a God who hates sin and loves righteousness. But these are the very instincts that he says frustrate and impede the law of natural selection in modern society. The irony to Darwin is our morally motivated attempts to mitigate the very law that brought our species into existence. \n \n Yet, even in view of this conundrum, Darwin is not willing to see the species abandon these virtues in building great societies. Indeed, it has been his observation that the rise of a nation to power and influence and the speed at which it does so depends on an increase in its population and \"...on the number of men endowed with high intelligence and moral faculties....\" And again, nations that \"...generally prevail over less favored nations...\" are proved to be the most fit to survive and have produced over a protracted time \"...the greatest number of highly intelligent, energetic, brave, patriotic, and benevolent men....\"\n \n In the end, Darwin feels compelled to lay out the evidence that all civilized nations were once barbarous. Perhaps his remarks are to serve as a reminder to Man of his roots and how from a \"lowly condition\" he began to \"force [himself] upwards\" in his struggle for existence. Or maybe his motive is to sound an alarm about the dread of a societal regression while promoting the \"...more cheerful view...that man has risen to the \"highest standards\" of \"knowledge, morals, and religion.\" And while Darwin relegates primeval Man to \"false religious beliefs,\" it is here that he acknowledges that modern Man has attained to \"...the highest form of religion - the grand idea of God hating sin and loving righteousness.\"",

   "A clue for you, notsofast.\n \n What Darwin said, especially in the realm of human evolution, is no longer authoritative. Darwin is only interesting from an historical standpoint at this late date. Darwin laid out 5 theories of evolution. But evolutionary biology no longer falls back to Darwin for validation. The theories have been tested again and again. Although some minor points have been found to be incorrect, overall his theories were sound.\n \n (My bet is that you can't name the 5 theories of evolution that Darwin stated in Origin)\n \n Essentially, \"Darwin said...\" is an historical exposition and not a worthwhile argument in any modern context. Darwin had no knowledge of genetics and that re-discovery was initially viewed as evidence against Darwinism until it was recognized as the mechanism of heredity that Darwin predicted.\n \n So you can quote Darwin up the ying-yang if you want. But you have to show that it is relevant to current evolutionary theory before your comments are meaningful.\n \n In short, it doesn't matter what Darwin said. That has been tested and discarded or accepted many times over. In some specific cases Darwin was wrong.\n \n So what is your point in bringing up these historical and irrelevant arguments?

   "I read a reply here that just stated specification has occurred. The lack of evidential support given leads me to conclude that the writer may not be aware of actual incidents to use as an example.\n \n First, what is a species...\n I've picked up an average looking text-book. \"Human Perspectives: Book 1\" by T J Newton and A P Joyce. How does it define species? \n \"Species The basic unit of biological classification; members of a species are capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring\"(p367) \n \n Most web-site online biology dictionaries seem to define species based on breeding units.\n \n The classic example given in textbooks is Darwin's Finch, which is said to have speciated into 13 distinct groups. \"They are also a classic model of speciation: again, they figure in virtually all of the textbooks, very often as the central illustration. That is why these birds have become such a universal symbol of Darwinism process, so that their beaks now represent evolution the way Newton's apple represents gravity.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm \n Further...\"Biologists now have applied modern methods of DNA analysis to Darwin's finches. Not surprisingly ? for Darwin was almost always right, though he knew of neither genes nor DNA ? they have found that the finches are all descended from a single ancestral species.\" \n http://www.bibledecoded.com/understanding221.html \n This seems pretty convincing stuff.\n David Lack who studied them in 1937 had said \"in no other birds are the difference between species so ill-defined.\" So, perhaps it's because they are the same species! The so-called proof of them being separate species derives from Lack's study when he tried to mate a single pair (from different 'species') and could not. Other people have continued with that mistake. \n \" The respected ornithologist John Gould was especially thrilled with \"a series of ground finches, so peculiar in form that he was induced to regard them as constituting an entirely new group containing 14 species, and appearing to be strictly confined to the Galapagos Islands.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm \n \n But, not all is so clear...\n Let's look at the most widely known book at present - Jonathan Weiner's \"The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time\" (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize). (he's an evolutionist)\n \"Back in 1983, for instance... a male cactus finch on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island), a scandens, courted a female fortis. This was a pair of truly star crossed lovers. They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood.\" \n \n How then, are they different species? This is a case of a scientist who can't see the woods for the trees, it's starring him in the face... they aren't different species at all... but he's a trained mind, who's had it drilled into him... Evolution is true, Darwin's Finches are proof of Evolution! \n \n Further studies by Grant or Graham (I can't recall the name) showed that they 'cross-pairings' are often the most successful!\n \n Thus the classic example of specification actually is not proof or evidence of specification at all!\n \n \n \n (all quotes taken from Milton, R \"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\", p143ff, unless otherwise sourced)",

   "I read a reply here that just stated specification has occurred. The lack of evidential support given leads me to conclude that the writer may not be aware of actual incidents to use as an example.\n\n What does \"specification\" have to do with a discussion on speciation? It's not clear what you are talking about since I can't find that discussion.\n \nFirst, what is a species...\n I've picked up an average looking text-book. \"Human Perspectives: Book 1\" by T J Newton and A P Joyce. How does it define species? \n \"Species The basic unit of biological classification; members of a species are capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring\"(p367) \n\n That's good, as far as it goes.\n \nMost web-site online biology dictionaries seem to define species based on breeding units.\n\n Populations is a better word. The concept is known as the biological species concept (BSC). Generally, populations that are reproductively isolated are considered separate species. But the line is muddy. Separated populations become more and more diverse until they are no longer able to reproduce. But it is a slow process and even though the populations may be geographically isolated, until they are genetically isolated the line may be a bit fuzzy. It's not of concern to evolutionary biologists because it is expected. Old style taxonomists have problems. Anyone who wants to separate everything into separate and distinct \"kinds\" has a problem.\n \nThe classic example given in textbooks is Darwin's Finch, which is said to have speciated into 13 distinct groups. \"They are also a classic model of speciation: again, they figure in virtually all of the textbooks, very often as the central illustration. That is why these birds have become such a universal symbol of Darwinism process, so that their beaks now represent evolution the way Newton's apple represents gravity.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm\n\n Yes. The birds are a good example of evolution in progress. And the Grants observed evolution by means of natural selection.\n \nFurther...\"Biologists now have applied modern methods of DNA analysis to Darwin's finches. Not surprisingly ? for Darwin was almost always right, though he knew of neither genes nor DNA ? they have found that the finches are all descended from a single ancestral species.\" \n http://www.bibledecoded.com/understanding221.html\n\n That's a pretty horrid site. The author seems particularly ignorant. Why wouldn't he try to learn about what he claims he opposes. He is just full of bad information. Let's see, \"Darwin's theory of evolution as an explanation of the origins of Species has been in trouble for some time and is nowhere near universal acceptance.\" Actually, more than 99% of qualified biologists and more than 95% of all scientists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observed facts. \"Ironically Darwin studied Theology at Christ's College Cambridge, going up in 1828, before he became interested in biology!\" Two mistakes in one sentence! Darwin didn't study theology at Christ's college. Darwin intended to begin his study to become an Anglican clergyman in the fall but received the offer of the position on the Beagle first. There are many records of Darwin's interest in natural history going back the when he was 9 years old. He studied geology at Edinburgh, dabbled in chemistry with his brother, collected bugs, and studied botany, natural history and geology at Christ's college. Darwin was recommended for the voyage because he was an accomplished scientist.\n \n In the case of the finches, Darwin was wrong. He didn't recognize them as separate species until it was pointed out to him after the trip. But being a scientist, he corrected his error.\n \n The quote, by the way, is from the New Yourk Times and not the particularly ignorant author of that site. Get a load of this bit of bit of ignorant tripe!\n \nSo Jan Klein and his team have discovered that the 6 ground finch 'species' all have the same Mitochondrial DNA (the Mitochodria are the components of cells which generate energy, the DNA is our Genetic Code - The DNA in the Mitochondria carries the genetic code for the whole Finch!)...\n\n How moronic! The DNA in the mitochondria doesn't carry the whole genetic code.\n \nThis seems pretty convincing stuff.\n\n Not if you don't understand it. It is clear that you must be impressed by so much misinformation.\n \nDavid Lack who studied them in 1937 had said \"in no other birds are the difference between species so ill-defined.\" So, perhaps it's because they are the same species! The so-called proof of them being separate species derives from Lack's study when he tried to mate a single pair (from different 'species') and could not. Other people have continued with that mistake.\n\n Wow! 1937? So you think that because these birds look a lot alike it is a mistake to claim that they are different species. Where did you study ornithology? No. They are not the same species. The fact that they are different species was verified by the mtDNA studies mentioned in that New York Times article. That study and others have verified that all of the finches in the Galapagos are monophyletic. Another study using microsatellite DNA which is nuclear rather than mtDNA and accumulates change at a faster rate than other sequences.\n \n\" The respected ornithologist John Gould was especially thrilled with \"a series of ground finches, so peculiar in form that he was induced to regard them as constituting an entirely new group containing 14 species, and appearing to be strictly confined to the Galapagos Islands.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm\n\n Not sure what that is supposed to mean. There are 6 species of ground finches.\n \nBut, not all is so clear...\n\n Well, when you cut and paste from such horrid sites with the intent to confuse, of course it isn't.\n \nLet's look at the most widely known book at present - Jonathan Weiner's \"The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time\" (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize). (he's an evolutionist)\n\n I've read it. Have you?\n \n\"Back in 1983, for instance... a male cactus finch on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island), a scandens, courted a female fortis. This was a pair of truly star crossed lovers. They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood.\"\n\n And what is the problem? What is your point? Normally Geospiza scandens and G. fortis don't interbreed. The Grants had studied the birds for more than 15 years at that point in time and they had never seen interbreeding before. The birds were under great stress that year; the populations had been reduced because of a drought. The fact is that both finches are ground finches and the only two species of ground finch on that island. They are closely related, both belonging to the genus Geospiza.\n \nHow then, are they different species? This is a case of a scientist who can't see the woods for the trees, it's starring him in the face... they aren't different species at all... but he's a trained mind, who's had it drilled into him... Evolution is true, Darwin's Finches are proof of Evolution!\n\n Well, anyone who actually had the integrity to learn what they were talking about would see the evidence. How ridiculous to claim that because two birds in related species (in the same genus) can successfully interbreed, even though they rarely do, that all the birds in the family can interbreed. Silly.\n \n The DNA studies, both the mtDNA and the microsatillite, indicate that the closest species of bird in South America is the dull-colored grass quit (Tiaris obscura). Of the finches on the Galapagos, the genus Certhidea, the warbler finches appears to be the oldest in both of the DNA studies. The warbler finches show the greatest diversity even among birds on the same island. Some have classified the warbler finches into 2 to 8 species alone, but they are generally grouped by most experts into C. olivacea. These birds seem to be directly descended from the original population. All of the other species diverged from this population, beginning about 3 million years ago. From that lineage the vegetarian finch (Platyspiza crassirostris) first diverged. The reamining population split into two main lines, the tree finches and the ground finches. Among the tree finches, all DNA studies indicate that the genus Camarhynchus has diversified only very recently and if it were not for the fact that they are geographically isolated on separate islands, it is likely that they would be able to interbreed. The only interspecies breeding that has been observed has been between the two species of ground finch. The others, even though the various species share ranges with the other genra on various islands do not interbreed.\n \nFurther studies by Grant or Graham (I can't recall the name) showed that they 'cross-pairings' are often the most successful!\n\n Did you have a point?\n \nThus the classic example of specification actually is not proof or evidence of specification at all!\n\n Actually it is proof that neither you nor your sources learned what you were talking about. Funny how the evolutionary trees drawn from morphology and the evolutionary trees drawn from mtDNA studies and the evolutionary trees from microsatillite studies all are quite similar. They differ in the final branches only, the differences within a single genus.",

   "So here we see a small twist on the word games evolutionaries use...\n\n But you are playing the word games. Your assertion is that if any of the closely related species can interbreed, then all of them can.\n \nIf they all can interbreed, then they are all of the one species!\n\n Exactly. But they can't. Only two of closely related species in one genus have been observed to interbreed. DNA analysis (both that I mentioned before) shows that the three species of tree finch in the genus Camarhynchus are so closely related that it is likely that they can interbreed, althought it hasn't been observed. In fact, the observed genetic diversity between the species is no greater than the genetic diversity in any species.\n \nThat's what the common definition of species is based on, animals that are all capable of successfully breeding.\n\n Right. That's what it is based on. But it's more than that. It is reproductive isolation. But those who have actually tried to learn the basics know that hybridization is sometimes possible to varying degrees. In fact, if Darwin was right, it would be expected.\n \nAs I said at the beginning, animals from different species are not supposed to interbreed successfully- because that would mean that they are of the same species! That is the common definition of species - the basic unit!\n\n Why don't you learn what you are talking about. It is very important that you define species as something that doesn't exist, isn't it? You know that if the evidence indicates that populations of animals actually do speciate, creationism is nonsense. Speciation takes many generations of reproductive isolation to genetic diversity to the extent that interbreeding may not be possible. Please explain to me why Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls don't interbreed. They share the same range in northern Europe. And yet these two \"species\" are the estreme ends of a single population of gulls the circles the globe. Why is it possible that Brown bears and Polar bears can interbreed? Are the the same species? They are certainly geographically isolated and never do interbreed in the wild. But this isn't a problem for evolutionary theory.\n \nDavid Lack was used as an example by me because he confirmed the idea that they were different species... when he was unsuccessful in one pairing. One of the Huxleys shouted this as a triumph, proof of Darwin's theory in action.\n\n One of the Huxleys? You are just so full of reliable facts, aren't you? Cite the work please. Specifically which two species of Darwin's finch did Lack try to cross. Since they would not interbreed, is it not an indication by the very definition upon which you insist the they are separate species?\n \nDarwin's Finch all can interbreed because they are not 13 different species, but the same one.\n\n I'm not sure why you would make such a claim. By your own information Lack showed that they are not all the same species. Certainly the warbler finch isn't the same as any of the ground finches. There is no question that Darwin's finches are monophyletic (they have a common ancestor population) and there is no question that there are several species. The warbler finch separated from the lineage that lead to the other finches so long ago that some taxonomists divide them into 2 to 8 species. Why is it that creationists have to make up information? Unless you can give evidence to show that Darwin's finches are a single interbreeding population I can only assume that you are being intentionally deceptive. Well, it is \"creation science\" isn't it? If you don't like the data, change it.\n \nThere is wide variation in the group - just as there are with dogs.\n\n Right. There is wide \"variation\" that is genetic and that isolates them into repoductively distinct populations. Sometimes, closely related species (in the same genus) interbreed, but it is an unusual event.\n \n And now we go on to the standard, ignorant creationist claptrap about dogs.\n \nAnd, just as with dogs, there are some pairings that are more readily successful - a Chihuahua would not want a Great Dane to mate with her. Would you suggest that a Chihuahua and a Great Dane are separate species?\n\n In fact, most dogs can interbreed with wolves and coyotes, and wolves and coyotes can interbreed. In all observed cases the offspring seem to be fertile. So that means that they are all one species, right? Actually, were it not for the fact that dog breeds have been artificially developed by man, dogs would be most likely to be divided into separate species. And, in spite of what you think, Great Danes and Chihuahuas don't interbreed because they can't. It is physically impossible for them to comsumate the act, althogh they may respond to each other as if it were possible. Even worse, even if the cross were accomplished artificially, the offspring are not viable.\n \nAll we have is a wide-variety within a single species! Even the author of \"The Beak of the Finch\" didn't realise this when he studied these birds successfully crossing 'species' lines.\n\n Certainly you haven't ever read any of the papers that the Grant's have published on the topic. And certainly you haven't read Weiner's book about their work even though you represent knowledge about it. I wonder. Are you lying intentionally or are you just stupid? It was Weimer who reported the observation by the Grants of a cross between two species in the book. Prior to that time it had been reported only in scientific journals. Oh. By the way, Weimer was the author of the book, not the researcher. The researchers he wrote about were Peter and Rosemary Grant, both of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University. It is they who reported the observation of interspecies breeding that Weimer wrote about.\n \n Did it occur to you to actually learn what you were talking about? Read the book and see how many years they had been watching the finches on Dauphne Major before they saw the first example of interspecies breeding. The book covered about the first 20 years. But of course, you speak without haveing read the book. I'll bet you haven't read any of the three journal papers on the DNA studies either. Here's one for you. Phylogeny of Darwin's finches as revealed by mtDNA sequences\n \nBack to the word games...\n\n Let me see if I understand what you are saying. You have stated several facts that are not true in this message alone. You presume to speak authoritatively on a topic that you don't understand, and you have lied about the contents of a book that you have not read. I'm playing word games? You certainly are an example of the moral bankruptcy of the creationist position.\n \nevolutionaries are now trying to switch to a new definition of species so as to re-draw the Finches back into different groups. They are basing this on 'breeding groups' that is, even though two animals might be able to prefer to breed successfully, prefer not to, therefore they are of a different species.\n\n No. It is just the need of creationists to separate organisms into groups where there are barriers that can't be crossed. If you had the integrity to actually learn something, you would know that it isn't always possible. So dogs, wolves and coyotes can interbreed. So can horses and donkeys, but they don't produce fertile offspring. And that fact is also indicated by the fossil record. Horses and donkeys separated longer ago than dogs and wolves. And according to your claim, Polar bears are nothing more than white Brown bears, even though they have several distinctive adaptations that make them look different from Brown bears. And, you must agree with the fact that Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls are different species because they do not interbreed, even though they are parts of the same population.\n \nThis new definition of sexual preference is not widely accepted - otherwise you'd have to say that racists are a different species - because they prefer not to breed with people outside of their own race!\n\n I've never heard of the new definition of sexual preference. Where did that come from. Of course, you can cite the scientific literature, can't you? Or are you just spewing misinformation again.",

Your assertion is that if any of the closely related species can interbreed, then all of them can.\n \n Nope, what I'm saying is if they can interbreed successfully, then they are not different species, by the very definition of the word!\n\n But only two of the 13 species have been observed to interbreed. And they are very closely related and do not normally interbreed. What about the other 11 species that don't interbreed.\n \n I'll see if I can explain it again. The various DNA studies indicate that the parent population first arrived in the Galapagos about 3 million years ago. This is estimated by the number of mutations that have accumulated in the various species. Three studies have been done, two involving mtDNA and one with microsatillite DNA.\n \n Do you understand that speciation doesn't happen in a single step? Are you not aware that it is a process that happens over time? If two populations are reproductively isolated then they will become genetically divergent because of the accumulation of changes in the DNA (mutations). If the two populations meet again, if enough time has passed they may not be able to interbreed. However, if they meet again after a shorter time it may still be possible.\n \n That is why Brown bears and Polar bears are still able to interbreed. Morphologically the Polar bear is quite different from the Brown bear because Polar bears have accumulated genetic changes that were adaptive to cold and living on the ice. But according to you Polar bears and Brown bears are the same species.\n \nLurch said \"I've never heard of the new definition of sexual preference. Where did that come from. Of course, you can cite the scientific literature, can't you?

So, if you are a white-supremacist, who won't go near a 'lesser' race, are you a new species?\n\n Well, most racists that I have met were fundamentalist christians and I never thought of them as a separate species. But, no that wouldn't be a new species. Speciation involves the complete reproductive isolation of a population over a long period of time.\n \n You just really need to have species fixed and unchanging, don't you? Sorry, they aren't. The differences between closely related species is a bit fuzzy sometimes. So Polar bears and Brown bears can interbreed but never do in the wild. Horses, donkeys, and zebras can interbreed. Great Danes and chihuahuas can't. All of the populations of gulls of the genus Larus interbreed with adjacent populations whether they are called a species or a subspecies except the European herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull who share the same range. They don't interbreed.\n \n Organisms are grouped into phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species with subs and supers of all of those as a way to organize them by how they are related. It is arbitrary and traditional to name an organism that way. Even humans are Homo sapiens sapiens. As data accumulates the classification sometimes changes. First there was H. neanderthalensis, then it became popular to call them H. sapiens neanderthalensis and now it is swinging back to H. neanderthalensis. Naming species is just a convenience for humans.\n \n But if you want to lump and split things according to your own definition, go ahead. You will end up with some really strange species. How about cattle and bison - yep! they interbreed. And how about the hawthorn maggot fly and the apple maggot fly? They are identical and can't even be distinguished by DNA studies and yet they don't interbreed. Also consider the fact that since apples were introduced to North America from Europe, the apple maggot fly didn't even exist before 1850. Did God just create it - POOF? Or could it be a slight change in a hawthorne maggot fly that allowed it to infest apples?\n \n None of this is a problem for evolutionary theory. But it seems to be for your form of creationism.",

   "Darwin's Finch still puzzles me. In reading the several posts here on this thread I am back to my bepuzzled self.\n \n If the definition of species is so fuzzy, then scientists shouldn't be using it to declare that they have found Darwinian evolution in action - with respect to the aforementioned finches. What is there definition of species?\n \n It seems that this is quite duplicitous of scientists. They use this as a text-book example of specification, and yet when hard pressed say that they can't really define what a species is! This seems rather absurd\n \n So, I used the text-book definition of species to see if I could apply it to said finch.\n \n It is true that I have assumed based on one observation that all the Finches can interbreed. I've been informed that only two different bird 'species' have been observed interbreeding. At best then, this is empirical evidence that there is in fact one less species then the supposed 13.

   "Darwin's Finch still puzzles me. In reading the several posts here on this thread I am back to my bepuzzled self.\n\n It's not that difficult but it would mean that you would have to accept that evolution is a fact.\n \nIf the definition of species is so fuzzy, then scientists shouldn't be using it to declare that they have found Darwinian evolution in action - with respect to the aforementioned finches. What is there definition of species?\n\n Why not? We see populations of birds as well as other animals diverging into species. I presume you mean, \"what is their definition of species. Well, here you go. From Futuyma's Evolutionary Biology.\n \n...the members of a group of populations that interbreed or potentially interbreed with each other under natural conditions.\n\n I told you before that a species is a population of interbreeding organisms.\n \nIt seems that this is quite duplicitous of scientists.\n\n You have no integrity, do you. You show little honesty on this board. I hear you acted in a similar way on another board. Duplicitous? Look it up in the dictionary and you will see your picture.\n \nThey use this as a text-book example of specification, and yet when hard pressed say that they can't really define what a species is! This seems rather absurd\n\n It is absurd that you misrepresent what was said. I think you are just playing stupid. You have been given a definition of species several times.\n \nSo, I used the text-book definition of species to see if I could apply it to said finch.\n\n And you weren't able to do it? It is a simple task. Maybe it takes someone who doesn't have an axe to grind. It isn't that hard. The evolutionary trees developed from morphology, two different mtDNA studies, and a microsatellite DNA study all come up with the a very similar tree.\n \nIt is true that I have assumed based on one observation that all the Finches can interbreed. I've been informed that only two different bird 'species' have been observed interbreeding.\n\n Right. Yet another example of creationists twisting the evidence to reach unwarranted conclustions. In fact, inventing evidence. You actually asserted that they could all interbreed. Why should anyone respect anything you have to say. We have caught you being dishonest.\n \nAt best then, this is empirical evidence that there is in fact one less species then the supposed 13. Let's then correct the text-books, as far as the observation that we know of, and declare that there are 12 species.\n\n But the birds that interbred are separate species. They do not interbreed under normal conditions. During that year the finches on that island were almost wiped out and there was a limited number of mates available in both species.\n \nI am sure that with continued observation this number will in fact drop to 1 species of finch.\n\n Nope. They can even be distinguished on the basis of DNA. With time, the species will likely separate further. In fact, they don't interbreed.\n \nIf cattle and bison can interbreed.... they are the same species! (I am assuming that this information posted by another person is correct.)\n\n Unlike you, when I say something about a book, I have read that book, I know who the author is and what the book is about. Unlike you, when I say that beef and bison can interbreed, I know if for a fact. I don't make broad and unfounded assertions based on a single unusual incident. To do that would be ignorant.\n American Beefalo International\n It's easy to verify such things if you had the will and the smarts. If you want them to be the same species then you are free to call them that. You make youself look pretty much like an idiot when doing so, but hey, you seem to have a knack for that.\n \n But you still haven't told me how you would seperate the gulls into species. All populations (27 named species) interbreed with adjacent species so that hybrids are found where two populations meet. And yet, the two ends of this huge mass of interbreeding populations meets in northern Europe where the two ends don't interbreed. Please tell me are Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls that same species or not? They don't interbreed.\n \n How about Polar bears and Brown bears? No answer there either.\n \n And horses and donkeys and zebras? They can interbreed.\n \n And then there are the dogs, wolves, and coyotes. All can interbreed generally speaking. Except that some dogs can't interbreed with others. You gave the example of the Great Dane and the Chihuahua. They cannot interbreed and even if you try it through artificial insemination, the embryo isn't viable. So they aren't the same species, right? But you can breed Chihuahuas with dogs that are a bit bigger and those with dogs that are a bit bigger and so on in a continuous line until you reach the Gread Dane. So Great Danes and Chihuahuas are different species after all and we know for a fact that they are descended from a common ancestor. How can that be?\n \nI have still yet to hear from anyone who defines species on breeding groups. (that is, those groups that actually do breed together, rather than just having the 'potential' to interbreed).\n\n Because you are being a putz, and an ignorant one. I have tried to explain but you think that definitions that are descriptions for the convenience of men are somehow the law to the diversity of life. In truth, the very fact that in closely related species interbreeding may be possible. The point is that it usually doesn't happen. That's pretty good evidence that evolution is going on. As might be expected, the two species that were observed to interbreed are closely related in the same genus. And you still haven't answered my question about which two species failed to interbreed in the experiment that you mentioned. Is it somehow a rule that you don't have to support your assertions? I mean, I know you can't in most cases, but can I expect that you would actually back up something you said once or twice?\n \nIf this is the new definition of species then it is clear that sexual preference is to be the new rule of thumb, which means that all those racists out there have become a new species of human being.... and if they continue to interbreed, then I'm sure that the population characteristics would pretty-well stabilise, hence why we have Caucasion, Mogolid, and African groups now (I do recognise that these categories can be blurry at the edges, but there is clearly a superficial difference between myself and Denzel Washington with regard to skin colour and hair type).... I believe this is why bison and cattle look different... stability within a type.\n\n What absolute XXXX. You believe do you? Did you observe, hypothesize, predict, and test? We're going to have to get bigger diapers to hold the XXXX that you spew. What does \"stability within a type\" mean? Again, since your previous explanation was senseless, what is sexual preference. Yes there is a difference between Denzel Washington and you. He is a famous and accomplished actor. You are a racist.\n \nIt seems to me that evolutionaries are trying again to have it both ways, absolute authorative pronouncements, and then very little real definition when hard pressed.\n\n You really are slow, aren't you. You are making the absolute pronouncements. I have been saying all along that under the right circumstances closely related species can interbreed. The definition of species isn't an authoritative pronouncement. It is a concept - the Biological Species Concept. It isn't a rule but an idea used to classify organisms. The concept isn't a claim that what we call species are necessarily unable to interbreed, it is an observation that we don't see them interbreed under normal circumstances.\n \nThis is, I believe, typical of the type of evidence that evolutionaries use. On the surface it works, but on closer examination it becomes rather hazy.\n\n Of course, the whole discussion demonstrates that evolution is a fact. It has been observed and it is still being observed. The separate and fixed created kinds don't exist and no matter how you whine or how you misrepresent, it won't happen. Just because we hang labels on some birds and say that they are different species doesn't mean that they are suddenly unable to interbreed. We labeled them because they don't do so under normal conditions.\n \n So now that we have covered that, why don't you present the less hazy evidence from creationism. Wouldn't that be a good idea? You will have applied the same strict examination to that evidence as you have to the word \"species\" I am sure. And your evidence will explain all of this more clearly and more rationally than evolutionary theory.\n \n Do it! Don't be a coward. Creationists claim to use the same evidence so the observations have been covered. So state the hypothesis, make the prediction, and then tell me how it was tested. You have the gall to claim that scientists are duplicitous but my bet is you don't have the guts stand up and argue your side. Talk about duplicitous!",

Because you stated that they could interbreed because all dogs are the same species. You are wrong. They cannot interbreed. Therefore, even though we are quite aware that they have a common ancestor, they must be, according to you definition, a separate species.

Evolutionaries can't claim categorically that Darwin's Finch is an example of specification, when in the end, the very definition of species is blurred in this case!\n\n We do have a proper definition of species, but you just don't like it and assume that reality must conform to hard and fast rules. Darwin's finches are an example of speciation because we see many species of the finches. Your claim that because two closely related species have on rare occasion been seen to interbreed means that all can interbreed is silly. They are a good example of speciation because we can see that it has happened recently. Study of the relationships of the populations, study the morphology, study the mtDNA, and study microsatellite DNA all result in similar cladograms. The are almost identical. They differ in the specific groupings at the level of genus. But still, we know that they are only quite recently divergant and the various populations interbreed in only unusual situations - like when mates of the same species are not available due to extreme population reduction.\n \nI look forward to hearing the sound of ripping-pages as people removed the offending pages from their biology text books.\n\n I guess you have ripped pages from your bible where it is asserted that coneys chew cut, that bats are birds and the grasshoppers have 4 legs.\n \nThis same poster has again failed to see the difference between parapharsing and quoting him... but is quite happy to do the same himself, by re-working statements into rhetorical questions such as 'So, are you trying to say...' blah blah.\n\n Please have the courage to stand up and name the person you are addressing. I have seen at least two other people respond to your silly XXXX because they thought your were addressing them.\n \n You haven't paraphrased what I have said, you have misrepresented it. And isn't, \"So you are saying...\" a question? How is that a misrepresentation? I am asking if I understand what you have said. You, on the other hand, \"paraphrase\" in a manner that misrepresents. And now you whine about it.\n \nThis same poster who still hasn't said sorry himself, seems to think that such things only work one-way. And then this same poster who resorts to name-calling has a big cry about it himself!\n\n Again an anonymous reference that shows christian courage. Sorry for what? I haven't misrepresented what you have said while you have. I haven't asked for an apology, while you whine about it. Name calling? Guilty. When you continue to spout XXXX that you know is wrong, references to your intelligence, honesty and integrity just seem to follow.\n \nIntegrity! Ah, the cry of the innocent and not so innocent alike!\n\n But you seem to lack integrity. You oppose evolution you tell us and yet you haven't even learned the basics.\n \n So you have yet failed to answer why this crosswise hair you seem to have is meaningful. I keep asking, so what? But you don't explain. Why is it important that real living organisms sometimes fail to conform to our definitions? In other words, so what?\n \n I think that you are hung up on the creationist idea of dogs giving birth to cats and just don't want to put it that way. But in the case of finches that have only diverged into separate populations in the last few thousand years on the basis of specialization in the food they eat, why is it surprising that they interbreed when mates of their own species are hard to find? I know that you understand this since you mentioned The Beak of the Finch and tried to tell me what the author found in his \"research.\" Only a fool or a liar would cite a book that he had not read.\n \n There are a lot of questions about species that you seem to be afraid to address. Oh well. I didn't think you could.",

Because you stated that they could interbreed because all dogs are the same species. You are wrong. They cannot interbreed. Therefore, even though we are quite aware that they have a common ancestor, they must be, according to you definition, a separate species. I don't think they are simply because we know that dog breeds are artificially produced by artificial selection.

You say you have a 'proper definition of species' where is it?

   "I shall present a summary, if I may of what we've discussed on this thread...\n\n Actually, more misrepresentation than summary.\n \nAt best the definition of species is 'fuzzy'.\n\n Yes. The first misrepresentation. The definition is actually precise. The problem is that closely related - that is recently divergent populations - may still be able to interbreed, and may occassionally do so even if it is not the norm.\n \nYet scientists categorically claim:\n a) that there are 13 distinct species of Darwin's Finch\n\n Actually they don't. Some have classified them into more species. If you had actually looked into the matter you would know that the warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) is sometimes divided into from 2 to 8 species. The most common is C. fusca. But certainly, the warbler finch doesn't interbreed with the common cactus finch and must therefore be a different species. The various species had never been observed to interbreed, not even in attempts to interbreed captive birds, until the Grants observed such cases. The first instance was in 1976 when 5 male Geospize fortis mated with 5 G. fuliginosa. These birds have so recently diverged that they are indistinguishable by DNA analysis. Of the species that are usually named, these two are some of the closest. None of the offspring survived the drought of 1977. So your claim that these hybrids are somehow more viable doesn't seem to hold. And yet, the Grants report a single interbreeding of a fortis and a fuliginosa that produced offspring for several generations.\n \n Let me quote Weiner in \"The Beak of the Finch\" to see if I can get the point across. Since you referred to the book, I'm sure you have read it.\n \nIn nature, the isolation between sibling species is seldom absolute. Among closely related plants, hybridization is more the rule than the exception, as Darwin notes: even annuals and perennials, or deciduous and evergreen trees, \"can often be crossed with ease.\" Among animals crossing is less common, but it happens. Mallard ducks and pintail ducks interbreed freely. In zoos, lions and tigers can be made to hybridize and produce tiglons. Zebras and horses can hybridize and produce striped sterile zebroids.\n\n By the way, you claimed that David Lack tried to breed various species of finch and failed. That's not true. Lack made observations in the Galapagos with the purpose of observing interspecies breeding. He was unsuccessful. But he sent many birds (Weiner says a multitude) to Robert Orr at the California Academy of Sciences. It was Orr who attempted to breed the various species of finch. Orr was 100% unsuccessful - like bred only with like. In Darwin's Finches, Lack concluded that, \"Clearly hybridization between species is rare, if not absent.\"\n \n Of course, you require that a definition of species be true and inviolate in every case. No matter that two species are reproductively isolated except in rare cases. It isn't a matter of surprise to biologists that closely related species sometimes interbreed.\n \n By the way, you claimed that it was a G. scandens that mated with a G. fortis. I accepted that because I was aware of the interspecies crosses that the Grants had observed. However, I can't find that in the book. They report crosses between G. fuliginosa and G. fortis, more closely related species.\n \nb) that said Finch is evidence of evolution - it is used as the textbook case.\n\n But it is. The very fact that several different methods result in very similar evolutionary trees indicates that we must be on the right path. you seem to think that once some biologist has designated a population as a species it is somehow forbidden that it can interbreed with closely related species. What matters to you is how we define nature and not how nature actually is.\n \nThe definition of species, for sexually producing animals seems to be based on either two criteria:\n a) that a population is a species when they are confined to those that actually do interbreed, not those that have the potential to naturally breed.\n\n Some do and some don't. You have never addressed my question of Polar bears and Brown bears. Are they separate species?\n \nb) that a population is a species when they either do actually breed, or have the potential to naturally breed.\n\n So Polar bears and Brown bears do interbreed if given the chance. But they don't ever, ever in nature. They are reproductively isolated and even have distinctive morphology. Brown bears don't have webbed feet, small ears, long legs, colorless fur, and so on.\n \nThe problem is not so great if we use category a). We could say that even though two finch species can potentially mate, the fact that they don't, means that they are distinct species - a problem arises only in that some have actually been shown to mate.\n\n But they are descended from a common ancestor. When the population is reduced to the extent that mates are hard to find, sometimes they do. Not a problem for evolutionary theory. It is a ball buster for creationism.\n \nBut, we could reduce the number of species based on those that actually do mate. However the main problem if category a) were to be used, then it would mean that certain dog breeds are in fact new species of dog.\n\n But you were the one who claimed that dogs were all the same species in the first place. We know that dogs have all descended from a common ancestor. So what? By all practical definitions they would be classified into different species if we didn't know the source. If you want to call them different species, go ahead. Generally the biological definitions aren't applied to artificially select organisms.\n \nFurther, certain human populations are also new species of human as they prefer or confine their 'breeding' to certain racial groups.\n\n First you have to show that this breeding group is actuallly isolated from all other breeding groups. Your christian racist must be isolated from all other populations, not only the races that you find objectionable.\n \nThis sexual selection or breeding-group definition would 'create' new species in other examples.\n\n No it wouldn't. Are your christian racists isolated from all other populations? You are claiming that your christian racists don't interbreed with any non-racist ever.\n \nThe problem with criteria b) is that because they do actually interbreed, and can interbreed naturally, thus they are all the same species!\n\n If they were all the same species then they would all interbreed freely. Thy don't. Only a very few closely related species have been observed to interbreed on rare occasions. Warbler finches don't ever breed with vegitarian finches or with tree finches or with woodpecker finches or with cactus finches or with ground finches. Never! Only two closely related species have been observed to mate in unusual circumstances.\n \nThus for a textbook example, Darwin's Finch fails miserably.\n\n Do you actually understand evolutionary theory? Why would 13 or more species of birds not still show an ability to interbreed when they have diverged from the partent species only about 3mya?\n \nWhy is it still in the textbooks? It is the prominence of the Finch in Darwin's theory formation that gives it such import.\n\n It is still in the text books because it illustrates because it illustrates the way that evolution works. It shows the accumulation of genetic diversity in reproductively isolated populations.\n \nTo the evolutionaries out there, removing Darwin's Finch from the textbook would not mean the end of evolutionary theory. It would only mean the removal of this poor example; which serves as an embarrassment anyway.\n\n Well, to the creationaries and the christianaries out there, Darwin's finches are a great illustration of the way evolution works. It seems that the creationaries and the christianaries aren't able to understand. For them, species must be fixed.\n \nIt is something you could learn to live with.\n\n We do live with it because it is a great example of genetic diversification that results in speciation. (By the way - the word \"specification\" isn't relevant. If you want to look less the fool, stop using that word when you mean speciation.)",

   "There are some posters here who try to have the best of all worlds...\n\n Actually we have been discussing the biological species concept. There are others. The reason is that populations diverge and sometimes they reunite before they have become reproductively isolated.\n \nWhilst saying species is clearly defined,\n\n Yea. It's pretty much a clear definition. I don't know why that should be a problem for you.\n \nand that Darwin's Finch is evidence of evolution,\n\n Yes. They certainly are. We find 14 different populations of birds that have all descended from a single population. We see that in the past lineages have diverged and that as time passed those lineages diverged again. So today there are 14 different breeding populations.\n \nthe same poster claims that the finch sometimes is 'x' amount of species, sometimes 'y'.\n\n Are you just slow or is that intentional misrepresentation? It isn't \"the finch\". There are 14 different species of finch. Warbler finches don't interbreed with the others. Neither do vegetarian finches. Tree finches only breed with tree finches, and ground finches with ground finches. But the medium ground finch and the small ground finch are distinguishable only by the size of their beak which is adaptive to a specific food. DNA studies also show that they are indistinguishable from the DNA. So they have been classified as separate separate species because the two populations do not interbreed in normal situations.\n \nBut hey, it's all good!\n\n \nThe doggered holding onto contradictory evidence is itself evidence of why evolution holds such sway... it is based on the irrational beliefs of its followers to say that black is both black, and white, and that this is not in any way preposterous.\n\n That's funny. You creationaries who claim that two contradictory myths are both the truth don't have much room to talk.\n \nHow I have misrepresented this,\n\n An example above when you make it seem as if I were talking about a single finch\n \nwhen I've said too that Darwin's Finch is not a good example of speciation is also proof of certain mind-sets of evolutionaries.\n\n But it is the mindset of you creationaries that somehow beleive that speciation is a sudden event. It isn't. It is caused by the slow accumulation of genetic differences in two populations. If the populations are reproductively isolated for long enough, they may not be able to reproduce should they meet again. On Daphne Major the finches are not geographically isolated but isolate on the basis of preferred food. Sometimes the closely related species interbreed. It is a speciation event in progress.\n \n Maybe you weren't aware that there is a word for interspecies breeding. It is \"hybridization.\" It is quite common. But you just continue to whine while ignoring questions that would pose a problem for you. Are zebras and horses the same species? Are bison and cattle? Are lions and tigers? How about the herring gulls? Please tell me if the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull are one or two species. They don't interbreed. And there is still the question of the Great Dane and the Chihuahua. If we follow you argument to the logical conclusion, they are separate species while most other dogs, wolves and coyotes are the same species.\n \nEven when the evidence is presented, because it is done so by a creationist, it must automatically be flawed,\n\n You didn't present any evidence. But usually evidence presented by a creationary is flawed or misrepresented.\n \neven if its the same as that presented by evolutionaries!\n\n But the difference is that in science the evidence is used to build an hypothesis, which is used to make a prediction, which is then tested.\n \n So tell me about the evidence you presented, how it is better explained by one of the two creation myths, what prediction can be made from the myth, and how it has been tested.\n \nThe evolutionary spokesperson on this thread will continue to maintain that this Finch is a good example, yet it isn't!\n\n And the creationary christianary will continue to pretend that he understands the discussion. Darwin's finches (more than one species) are a great example because they exemplify various lineages that have speciated completely and other lineages that are less well reproductively isolated. It is all explained quite nicely by evolutionary theory.\n \n Now if we could just get the creationary person in this thread to explain why the evidence is better explained by one of the creation myths.\n \nI can say little more then... but I'm sure I can come up with something.\n\n And it will be as senseless as what you have said to this point.",

You'r pretty much a cartoon character, aren't you.\n \nDarwin's Finch is 13 clear species, but Darwin's Finch also contains species that clearly aren't agreeing with this term.\n\n That's Darwin's finches. There are 14 species. And there are none of them that do not conform to the definition. They are under normal circumstances they do not interbreed. In fact, the Grants observed other species of finch on the island, like some of the tree finches. They show up briefly and then move along, going else where to breed.\n \n And of course, since this is a recognized phenomenon there is a name for it, hybridization. It is common in closely related species. There is also a name for it in evolutionary theory. It is known as gene flow and it is one of the recognized mechanisms of evolution.\n \nThe fact that some suggest they are able to breed because they are closely related species is a bit of a novelty in the realm of argument... Darwn's Finch are all supposed to be related, having been raised from a common ancestry.\n\n That's true, but only the most closely related species are still able to interbreed.\n \n You aren't claiming that all of these 14 species diverged at the same time are you? The species of ground finches, cactus finches and tree finches diverged somewhat recently.\n \nWhen some of them show-up the fallacies of Darwin, by not complying with his laws, then the problem is glossed over by saying that they aren't clearly defined lines of species...\n\n What are you babbling about? They are a beautiful illustration of Darwin's theories. What laws? Are you trying to look stupid? What kind of idiot would say something like that? And yes, they are clearly defined species, but only recently. That's what Darwin's theory predicts. Recently diverged species may still be able to interbreed. Just look at wolves and dogs.\n \nSo they are and they aren't clearly defined species...\n\n Yes they are unless one lacks the intelligence to grasp the concepts. Close species interbreed.\n \n \nThe Grants have begun to think about how far all this goes beyond the Galapagos. \"Hybridization,\" as they have written this sabbatical in an article for the journal Science, \"provides favorable conditions for major and rapid evolution to occur.\" There are a total of 9672 species of birds in the world today. Back in 1975 a German ornithologist, W. Meise, estimated that about 2 percent of the younger, more recent species hybridize regularly, and about 3 percent more hybridized occasionally. In 1989 a Russian ornithologist, E.N. Panov, compiled a more extensive list, including every species of bird that has ever been seen, even once, to hybridize. As the Grants note, \"no other class of organisms of comparable size is known so comprehensivel.\" And the new numbers look interesting.\n \n The total number of bird species in the world is almost 10,000. Almost 1,000 of them, the Grants write, \"are known to have bred in nature with another species and produced hybrid offspring...roughly one out of every ten species.\"\n \n --Weiner, Jonathan, The Beak of the Finch, Vantage Books, New York, 1994, p. 198.\n\n \nPity the Finches aren't aware of this... they seem quite happy to breed across 'species lines'.\n\n Aren't aware of what? These laws of Darwin's that you have invented? All of these populations, some going extinct and new ones arising all the time by the processes of mutation, recombination, gene flow, natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift, and you claim that it isn't evolution because you don't understand it. You have to have species fixed and unchangable.\n \n You're pretty much a shallow thinker.",

   "Lurch, what are 'normal' circumstances? Was there a massive blizzard that forced crossbreeding?\n \n What? You don't mean to tell me that you were citing the book, \"The Beak of the Finch\" without having read it? You can't be serious! How can you intelligently discuss a topic without even educating yourself about it? The interspecies breeding was observed during years of severe drought that caused a reduction in population.\n \n I just can't believe that you continue to make assertions about things of which you are so ignorant.\n \nSpecies is well defined, but Darwin's Finch is not!\n\n So you are starting to get the idea. The definition of species is a convenience for people. It is an attempt to describe nature. We can see that warbler finches don't interbreed with sharp beaked finches. No problem. They are different species. The Grants observed that under normal conditions the small and medium ground finches didn't interbreed either. Moreover, they have measurable morphological differences and different food sources, also under normal conditions. The availability of two different sources of food has favored the speciation into two different beak sizes. But the more recently divergent species of finch are still able to interbreed. The evolutionary term is gene flow and it introduces genetic diversity into the population. The same is true of lots of birds and other animals.\n \nOut of curiosity... Where did these other finches move to?\n\n Do you understand that the word \"islands\" is plural. That means that there is more than one. Move your lips as you read if it helps. Daphne Major is so small that you won't even find it on most maps of the Galapagos. Here it is. http://www.galapagos.to/DAPHNE.HTM It is a small island just to the north of Santa Cruz. So the obvious answer to thinking people would be that the other species of finch that came to the island and then left the island, came and went to other islands. Look at this picture.\n http://www.galapagos.to/NASA.HTM \n The circular island in the middle of the picture is Santa Cruz. There is a small dot dead-on due north. That is Daphne Major.\n \n There are three species of Darwin's finches that have been observed to breed on the island; the Small ground finch (Geospiza fuliginosa), the Medium ground finch (G. fortis), and the Common cactus finch (G. scandens). Again, no species of finch is found on all islands and no island has all species of finch. Of the ground finches (Geospiza), no island has all three. No island has all three of the tree finches (Camarhynchus). Only one island has the Mangrove finch (Cactospize heliobates). It is almost extinct because it doesn't even interbreed with it's close relative, the Woodpecker finch (C. pallida).\n \n On the various cladograms where the length of the line represents time since the divergence of the species, the warbler finches diverged about 3 million years ago. But G. scandens diverged from the tree finches only about 700,000 years ago and G. fuliginosa and G. fortis diverged only about 190,000 years ago.\n \n And yes. You have become a cartoon.",

   "\"Darwin's Finches \n Many biology textbooks claim that finches on the Galapagos Islands, whose beak sizes are correlated with the foods they eat, helped to convince Darwin of evolution by natural selection in 1835. But the legend of \"Darwin's finches\" was actually contrived a century later. Some textbooks also tell students that a slight increase in the average size of finch beaks, observed after a severe drought in the 1970s, shows how natural selection could produce a new species in only two hundred years. But the textbooks fail to mention that the change was reversed when the rains returned, and no net evolution occurred. \n A = explicitly points out that the Galapagos finches had little to do with the formulation of Darwin's theory; explains that selection on finch beaks oscillates between wet and dry years, producing no net evolutionary change; points out both that the genes affecting finch beaks are unknown and that hybrids between several species are now more fit than their parents, suggesting that those species may be merging. \n B = explicitly points out that the Galapagos finches had little to do with the formulation of Darwin's theory; explains that selection on finch beaks oscillates between wet and dry years, producing no net evolutionary change; points out either that the genes affecting finch beaks are unknown or that hybrids between several species are now more fit than their parents, suggesting that those species may be merging. \n C = describes the Galapagos finches as a good example of adaptive radiation (the origin of species by natural selection); but points out both that selection on finch beaks oscillates between wet and dry years and that the finches did not play an important role in the formulation of Darwin's theory. \n D = describes the Galapagos finches as a good example of adaptive radiation (the origin of species by natural selection); but points out either that selection on finch beaks oscillates between wet and dry years or that the finches did not play an important role in the formulation of Darwin's theory. \n F = describes the Galapagos finches as a good example of adaptive radiation (the origin of species by natural selection); but fails to mention that selection on finch beaks oscillates between wet and dry years, and implies that the finches played an important role in the formulation of Darwin's theory.\"\n \n http://www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_tbookreport900.htm#he",

If opponents of evolution say animals can't create new \"kinds\" fine... but they need to define \"kind\" (they also need to define kind if they want to include it in any theory they try to put forward in science). Supporters of evolution can use the term species to help clarify, and classify evolution.

In fact, it becomes very confusing to the reader, and someone assumes an error has occurred in the printing process, or in spell check - and they'd be right.\n \n This is exactly how biology deals with such duplication. When a chromosome is duplicated to where 10 chromos become 20 chromos, with 2 of each chromo, you have something that is not more fit to survive, and cannot last. In fact, the population of the species will always refuse to move towards the duplicated chromosomal structure.

In fact, it becomes very confusing to the reader, and someone assumes an error has occurred in the printing process, or in spell check - and they'd be right.\n\n It is an analogy. It is not a perfect representation of genetics. You are trying to be too literal.\n \nThis is exactly how biology deals with such duplication.\n\n No, it's not.\n \nWhen a chromosome is duplicated to where 10 chromos become 20 chromos, with 2 of each chromo, you have something that is not more fit to survive, and cannot last. In fact, the population of the species will always refuse to move towards the duplicated chromosomal structure. These \"mutants\" will be weeded out by natural selection.\n\n Weren't you paying attention? It was mentioned that polyploidy has been observed in plants. Contrary to your assertion, the plants were fit to survive and did last. There are also examples in amphibians and, I believe, reptiles. It seems that you are just making an assertion of what you wish to be true.\n \n Moreover, duplication of genetic material happens frequently. It isn't necessary that the whole genome be duplicated. Junk DNA is observed to expand and contract without any observable effects. But sometimes entire genes are duplicated, which is the \"torntorn\" example. And while you may assert the it doesn't make sense in English, it does in molecular biology. Genes code for proteins and duplicating the gene means that it codes for the same protein.\n \nThe rest of the problem.....\n \n DNA is not only a digital code (as you pointed out by the binary example) and a self-replicating code. It is also an error-correcting code.\n\n Yep. But it isn't perfect. The error correcting part is still being worked on. How that functions isn't understood very well at this point. But still, not every error is corrected.\n \nWhen a non-exact replication occurs, the DNA code will either stop there by unfitness or inability to re-duplicate, or it will duplicate to another copy which is specifically similar to the grandparent.\n\n Quite simply, that is horsepucky. It will do no such thing. Non-exact replication may or may not cause the substitution of a different amino acid in the protein sequence. Generally, a change in the third position of a codon results in the same amino acid. In one of the other two positions it will most likely cause a substitution of another amino acid in the protein sequence. Even at that, the protein may be perfectly functional.\n \nThere are also several error correction mechanisms within the DNA replication scheme itself.\n\n Really? I'm sure you can explain this to us. How do these correction mechanisms work?\n \nOne obvious one is the double-helix structure. When duplication occurs, there are two information duplications happening simultaneously, consequently if one side of the helix has a problem, it is fixed by comparing with the other side's replication.\n\n No kidding? How is that comparison accomplished? Please explain the mechanism that compares the two strands for errors? How do they prevent duplication of some material?\n \nBack to the torn....\n\n Why? It is an analogy that was intended to illustrate a point. It isn't actually applicable to genetics.\n \nSo, in biology, when torn is being replicated and it \"accidentally\" becomes torntorn, the next generation will either replicate as merely torn (because all that information is there!), or it will die the death of not being in the dictionary.\n\n Make up your mind. Either the error correcting mechanisms that you are going to explain to us will reproduce \"torntorn\" or you are inventing this stuff.\n \nIf torn replicates as torntorn, and somehow (not by any known biological process) survives to the next 1000 generations and becomes torntonr, the DNA code will not allow tonr to continue, because of its error-correcting capabilities.\n\n Unmitigated XXXX. \"not by any known biological process\"??? What does that mean. Please inform us where you earned your degrees in biology that makes you so informed. You have already shown that you don't understand what you are talking about and now you apply an illustrative analogy in a literal sense.\n \nFor more information.....\n \n DNA\n http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaP...re01408_fs.html\n\n Sadly, you don't seem to have understood.\n \nAnd regarding previous conversation.....\n \n Peppered Moths - are all those \"evidences\" just dead moths glued to tree trunks? You mean the peppered moth doesn't actually rest on tree trunks in the wild?\n\n I suspect that you are merely an unthinking dupe in this matter. The fault really lies with the XXXXXX who were unable to realize that the moths on the trees were place there specifically for pictures that would show the camouflaging effect of their color. Those moths were not part of the data and only fools believe that they were. They were for illustrations only. Let me see if I can construct an analogy for you. It seems that God is an old man with a long beard because I have seen christians represent Him as such.\n \nUpdate: For the record, I'm not trying to argue either way on this - I am not smart enough for that.

Yet you still made the remark.\n \nSomeone used the peppered moth as an example of allele frequency changes.\n\n Indeed. And so it is.

   "Well, there are problems with the paper you cite. First, Wells has declared that his purpose in earning a PhD in biology was to \"prove\" evolution wrong.

Wells' paper is not an attempt to discuss the issue but an attempt to discredit evolution.\n \n While it is true that he earned a PhD from Berkeley, it is incorrect that he cites his affiliation with Berkeley. He was never affiliated with that university except as a doctoral candidate.\n \n\n \n Apparently if the facts are against you, ad hominem attacks serve a useful purpose.\n \n Apparently Wells has 10 questions... Here's one of the questions, pertaining to the discussion, NCSE's response, and his rebuttal.\n \n http://www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_inheritthespin.htm\n \n\n My Question: PEPPERED MOTHS. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection--when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don't normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged? \n \n NCSE's Answer: These pictures are illustrations used to demonstrate a point--the advantage of protective coloration to reduce the danger of predation. The pictures are not the scientific evidence used to prove the point in the first place. Compare this illustration to the well-known re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. Does the fact that these re-enactments are staged prove that the battle never happened? The peppered moth photos are the same sort of illustration, not scientific evidence for natural selection. \n \n My Response in Outline: \n (a) The NCSE's first point is technically correct: The textbook pictures are illustrations, not actual evidence. \n \n (b) The NCSE is using this technical point, however, to obscure the real issue: The textbook pictures misrepresent the natural resting-place of peppered moths and conceal serious flaws in the standard story. \n \n (c) Staged peppered moth photos are not comparable to re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg, because the former misrepresent the truth. \n \n (d) If using staged photos and re-telling a flawed story \"demonstrate a point,\" as the NCSE claims, the point is that students cannot trust what they read in their biology textbooks. \n \n My Response in Detail: \n (a) True, the textbook pictures are illustrations, not actual evidence. It would have been more accurate for me to write \"examples of\" or \"illustrations of\" instead of \"evidence for.\" \n \n (b) The NCSE uses this technical point, however, to obscure the fact that textbook pictures misrepresent the evidence and conceal serious flaws in the peppered moth story. Two hundred years ago, almost all peppered moths in the U.K. were light-colored. During the industrial revolution, dark-colored moths became much more common--especially in the polluted woodlands around major cities. According to theory, the shift occurred because dark-colored moths were better camouflaged against pollution-darkened tree trunks, and thus less likely to be eaten by predatory birds. In the 1950's, Bernard Kettlewell released light and dark-colored moths onto nearby tree trunks in polluted and unpolluted woodlands, and watched as birds ate the more visible ones. The story, and Kettlewell's experiments, became the classic textbook example of natural selection. When pollution-control legislation resulted in cleaner air after the 1950s, light-colored moths became more common again, as the theory predicted. Contrary to the theory, however, this occurred BEFORE tree trunks reverted to their former light color. In the 1980s, biologists discovered that peppered moths don't normally rest on tree trunks, and many began to question the classic story about camouflage and bird predation. In 1998, Theodore Sargent, Craig Millar and David Lambert wrote in Evolutionary Biology: \"There is little persuasive evidence... to support this explanation at the present time.\" And as University of Chicago evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne wrote in Nature, the fact that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks \"alone invalidates Kettlewell's... experiments, as moths were released by placing them directly onto tree trunks.\" (14) \n \n (c) The NCSE's comparison of staged peppered moth photos with re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg is inappropriate, because the former misrepresent the facts. The appropriate comparison would be with FALSE re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg--such as re-enactments staged in Chancellorsville (where the other side won). Scientific illustrations, like historical re-enactments, should portray the truth. \n \n (d) Instead of telling students the truth about peppered moths, most biology textbooks repeat the classic story and illustrate it with staged pictures--many of them made by pinning or gluing dead moths to tree trunks. For example, Johnson's Biology: Visualizing Life (1998), Guttman's Biology (1999), Schraer and Stoltze's Biology: The Study of Life (7th Edition, 1999), and Miller and Levine's Biology(5th Edition, 2000) all use staged photos and summaries of Kettlewell's experiments to convince students that peppered moths are a classic demonstration of natural selection in action. Mader's Biology (6th Edition, 1998) goes even further, using Kettlewell's experiments as the paramount example of how to do science: \"The scientific method consists of forming a hypothesis, testing it, and coming to an conclusion.... In order to examine the scientific method in more detail, we will consider research performed by British scientist H.B.D. Kettlewell.\" If these illustrations \"demonstrate a point,\" as the NCSE claims, the point is that students cannot trust what they read in their biology textbooks. (15) \n \n\n \n \n\n In fact I read the \"paper\" not long after Wells posted it. And my polemic was based on your statement about gluing moths to tree trunks. As I explained, I thought you were ignorant of why it was done. I was wrong, you seem to be well aware that it was done soley for the purpose of illustration and was never represented by anyone (except creationists) as data. So the question is, what did you mean?\n \n\n \n As Wells illustrates carefully in the above quoted rebuttal, most textbooks, from which most people learn of the peppered moth, use these pictures not as examples but as evidence. They are used as evidence that the certain colored moth is better fit for survival under certain conditions due to predatory issues. The facts line up against this \"evidence.\" The method of \"experimentation\" in this issue is anything but the scientific method, notably that there is no control group. Whether the original pictures are intended as evidence or examples is irrelevant, because they are being used as evidence in most textbooks.\n \n \n\n But error correction is not always successful. Mutations do happen and they do not always result in disease. It doesn't take a high school diploma to figure that out.\n \n\n \n If a certain theory requires a DNA sequence to be mutating relatively often, and this DNA sequence has built in mechanisms to thwart mutations, wouldn't that make it harder for the mutations to come about that are necessary for gradual change? At what point to the difficulties of producing the required mutations and keeping them for 1000 generations become so overwhelming that they are statistically rediculous?\n \n \n\n But never mind. Your statement brings up a question. What do addition of information and increase in complexity have to do with whether or not allele frequencies changed? Please define information in a biological context. Please be specific so that we can quantify the information in a given genome so that we can recognize whether it increases or not. Please define complexity and how that relates to information.\n\n \n The reason I brought up DNA's error correction, which you took issue with, is part of the \"definition\" of information in a biological context. DNA is a digital code. It is a self-replicating code. It is an error-correcting code. These facts show that DNA is essentially information. In order to produce an organism you need both the information blueprints (DNA) and the machine to operate this information. If you have a blueprint for a fish, you would need entirely different information to change that into a blueprint for a dog. Not necessarily one big jump, but over many small jumps, the DNA blueprint needs information added in order to get from a primitive life form to a more advanced life form.\n \n There have been no observable additions of information to the DNA code of any organism.\n \n In regards to complexity, in order to have a more advanced organism, with a more complex structure, the information must be greater than the information for a less complex structure.\n \n ---------------------\n \n The fact that DNA is a digital code, and the machine to run this code is separate from the code itself, brings up another problem. When you run your computer, it is similar. The hardware and operating system must be designed in tandem to produce a working machine. When this relates to DNA, we see that the machines that run the information could not have occurred independantly of the information, and the information could not have occurred indepenantly of the machines.",

Evolutionary is an adjective all the time. You continue to make yourself look like a fool.\n\n \n Lurch. Grammar lesson 101\n \n Functional Grammar:\n What is Functional Grammar?\n \"Functional Grammar (FG), as developed by Simon Dik and others, is a general theory of the organization of natural language. FG wishes to be a theory which is 'functional' in at least three different, though interrelated senses: It takes a functional view on the nature of language; \n It attaches primary importance to functional relations at different levels in the organization of grammar; \n It wishes to be practically applicable to the analysis of different aspects of language and language use.\"\n http://home.hum.uva.nl/fg/theory_func_gram.html\n \n \"Functional grammar is concerned with the way in which grammar is organised to make meaning. Because it is concerned with meaning, it can be related directly to the concerns of teachers and students in all subject areas.\"\n http://anenglishpage.tripod.com/christie.html\n \n The National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research (attached to Macquarie University, Sydney).\n Office of the Board of Studies NSW\n University of NSW\n others: http://langue.hyper.chubu.ac.jp/jalt/pub/tlt/99/jan/martin.html\n Are using Functional Grammar here in my state. They are not alone.\n \n Example of the differences in function. Taken from my post-grad text book...\n \"Let us explore some other problems with traditional grammar terminology. First, compare these four sentences;\n 1 Bathurst is a town in the country\n 2 Bathurst is a country town\n 3 My cousin has brought a town house in Bathurst\n 4 Stop here for a real Bathurst experience\n \n 'Bathurst', 'town' and 'country' are all nouns in sentence 1. But what about 'country' in sentence 2, 'town' in sentence 3 and, indeed, 'Bathurst' in sentence 4? We could say these words are still nouns in terms of CLASS, but in terms of FUNCTION they are playing a different role. In sentences 2, 3 and 4, each of these words play the role we expect an adjective to play, that is as a describing word to provide additional information about a noun. So 'Bathurst' in \"a real Bathurst experience\" belongs to the class noun, but it functions to provide information about another noun - experience. Usually when a noun acts as if it is an adjective, we apply the functional label CLASSIFIER...\" Butt, D (et al), \"Using Functional Grammar: An Explorer's Guide\" p28.\n \n Therefore the word evolutionary needs to be seen in the context of a text to see how it functions.\n \n If I say \"He developed an evolutionary theory\" then the word evolutionary is functioning as an adjective as it is describing the word 'theory'\n In the sentence \"Smith wrote a book called \"Evolutionary Theory\" it serves as a noun, because it is part of the name of the book.\n \n Here endeth the lesson, free of charge.",

Would you like to post some of those definitions here? \n \n \nPlease remind me what you're trying to achieve?\n\n \n a while ago you stated that species has several definitions so it's useless to try to claim that speciation occurs when there is not a definition set in stone. I am arguing that if anyone were to claim speciation has happened, it's up to them to define what they mean by species. \n \n But more importantly: evolution does not depend on \"speciation\" happening. Evolution depends on allele changes occurring over time. We have seen mutations occur. Mutations that made the organism better at surviving and reproducing tended to propagate this allele through a population. Based on current evidence we can infer that these changes over time caused dramatic changes in organisms (you can even say species). The point is that evolution does not hinge on the definition of species. Species is not used to put any limits or boundaries on evolution. It instead used as a gauge to show how much variation has been produced. \n \n Creation science on the other hand has not defined kind, and is instead content with naming various animals part of the same \"kind\" while never trying to say what kind actually means.",

   "The chance of the right animal, having the right genes, passing the right genes on, makes evolution highly improbable.\n\n \n Although that might seem to be a conclusion of your verbal model real world evidence proves it to be false:\n \n \"Selection is widely accepted as the principal force shaping phenotypic variation within populations. Its importance in speciation and macroevolution has been questioned, however, because phenotypic differences between species or higher taxa sometimes appear to be nonadaptive. Here, we use the quantitative trait locus (QTL) sign test to evaluate the importance of directional selection in phenotypic divergence. If a trait has a history of directional selection, QTL effects should be mostly in the same direction; otherwise QTLs with antagonistic effects should be common. Analysis of QTL effects for 572 traits from 86 studies revealed significantly fewer antagonistic QTLs than expected under neutrality, a result that validates Darwin's claim that phenotypic diversification is caused mainly by selection.\" (1)\n \n Natural selection does work in the real world to alter morphology. Another interesting example is the morphology of ciclids in lake Malawi that has been shaped by natural selection (6).\n \n Another example of natural selection is the fixation of new alleles and genes by natural selection, this leaves distinctive traces on the genome. A good example is the fixation of a new gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This gene (SDIC) was formed by the duplication and then fusion of two pre-existing genes to form a new sperm motor protein. This gene was then rapidly fixed in the population by natural selection (2). Selection has been found in many other genes in the Drosophila genome (3) and has been found to shape the human genome interesting acting most on genes that releate to the brain and nervous system, skeletal morphology and development and the human subcutaneous fat layer (one of the few differences between humans and the other apes) (4). A recent review also found many examples of beneficial mutations in other genes fixed by natural selection (5).\n \n In the light of real of real world evidence that contradicts your your assertion will you withdraw it?.\n \n (1) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Sep 17;99(19):12242-5.

   "This is why I don't believe speciation is a good theory; Darwin's Finch aren't geographically isolated, so any mutation in one part of the species would spread around to other members.\n\n \n speciation isn't a theory, it's a result of evolution. \n \n being on separate islands isn't enough of a geographic separation? (yes they can fly, but do they regularly interbreed with birds on different islands?) and if conditions on the different islands were different, then genes introduced from a different island of birds wouldn't be as successful because they would contain instructions on how to survive in a different environment. \n \n \nSo, if luck is playing a part, then being 'fit' doesn't come into it. The lion with the genes to save it's species is marching up to mate with a lioness, and boom, shot dead by a poacher.\n\n \n can we add false dichotomy to your list of logical fallacies? \n \n Random chance, and genetic makeup of individuals both have an impact on organisms, but the random chance isn't able to have a long term effect on the genetic makeup of the species because random chance (random death at least) ignores the genetic makeup. genetic makeup on the other hand is passed on from generation to generation.\n \n Does this mean an organism that is inherently better at leaving behind successful offspring will always leave behind more offspring than an organism with a competing allele? Of course not. But generally the allele better at reproducing itself will propagate throughout the species. \n \n \nSo 'fittness' is not an attribute for survival. Survival is.\n\n \n just to clarify, you're the one using the term \"fit\", so to define that word in this context: fitness has to do with surviving to adulthood, and producing successful offspring. Or more generally, fitness deals with alleles that make the most copies of themselves in a population. \n \n If you're going to push \"survival of the fittest\", then you should be aware that I see \"survival\" as more as the propagation of specific genetic sequences. Survival of the fittest becomes propagation of the alleles that are best at reproducing themselves in a given population/environment combination. \n \n So finally to answer you question, in some cases being better at propagating itself throughout a species does not guarantee the allele will actually become common, but more often than not this does happen. \"fitness\" is an attribute of survival, as well as luck, but fitness (more often than not) does influence survival. \n \n \nWould you replace a scientific theory with an unscientific one?\n\n \n not in terms of what theories science supports. \n \n \nSo what makes one better? One can only tell in hindsight - because a species has survived.\n\n \n If I were to find a verified prediction that has been made about the survival chances of a certain organism because of a known mutation would this disprove the stance that deciding what is better is just ad hoc reasoning?\n \n I don't have an example off hand right now, but I don't see why such a prediction couldn't be made. There would be a problem with identifying which pieces of genetic code actually code for changes in behavior, or physical characteristics, but once the change is known it shouldn't be difficult to predict which organism will generally do better at surviving in a given environment.",

   "AMD,\n \n I do not have firm answer for you, but I do wish to make some conjectures as to how everything became as it is:\n \n 1.)The catalyst for this particular evolutionary change, I believe, would have had to have been female. A male simply would not have been able to survive in any such primate group, nor do I believe his seeds would have been able produce others of his type. I think the female egg is far more versatile as to what it accepts to fertilize it. In the event that the catalyst were male, I believe it would only be able to mate compatibly with its own mother.\n \n 2.)Only a female would be able to care for its young in a way that would allow it to survive. After having this young, she would gaurd it closely.\n \n 3.)It is not extremely difficult to conceive that a quasihumanoid primate would be able to exist and be fertilized by a similar specie. There are many races and creeds of people in the world today whom are all capable of crossbreeding. Black, white, spanish, eskimo, indian, etc... This indicates that we must all have a single common origin.\n \n 4.)I'd like to say that the change in dynamic form was radical, retarded actually, and that all of the catalyst's offspring remained hereditary to her. Perhaps seperating completely from other primate groups. I would also venture to say that the development of our species as far as intelligence and capacity was probably a very slow process.\n \n 5.)Scientists generally refer to us being more like monkeys as far as IQ and build, though I believe it was apes. I think the first quasihumans were retards of an impotent ape. Segregated from ape culture, the retard children learned from momma and from observing other forms of life. The more intelligent the species became, the more versatile it became.\n \n \n Anyway, that is my conjecture. I am curious to know what reaction takes places when similar species of sperm and eggs meet. Does the sperm cell penetrate the egg? Is it killed off long before? Does it try to penetrate and fail? Does anything happen? My thought would be to test human sperm against different groups of primates' eggs. My theory is that, if there is even a remnant in existence, that the reaction with human sperm versus the catalyst would be different than any other reaction, even if it failed to produce.\n \n I don't really know anything about geneology, I just like to make intelligent guesses.

Does it happen a significantly often enough? does luck play any role greater than removing random sets of DNA? \n \n Crude analogy time. You get a bunch of dice all with varying numbers of sides. You stick them in a bowl, and you roll them. Then you keep all the dice that are showing numbers 1, 2 or 3. after multiple rolls (taking out the dice that show unwanted numbers) expect to end up with the dice that have a fewer number of sides (it's easier to get a 1, 2 or 3 on a four sided die rather than a six sided die). \n \n So then you restart the game but add in a new element. After rolling the dice, you pick up the 10 dice that are closest to you. It seems that you would point at this and say \"ahha, now that tendency of \"fewer faced dice will tend to be left over\" because your random removal of the dice sometimes takes out dice with very few faces. \n \n But the tendency still stays because my random removal removed all faced dice at the same rate. There is no larger (or smaller) proportion of any type of dice in the pile after my removal.\n \n In nature, random death, accidents, and \"nights on the town\" happen, but these chance events don't favor any specific genetic makeup, therefore it can not be used to strike down an assertion that some alleles make their host organism better at reproducing and surviving than it's more common competing allele, and the new allele is more likely to propagate through the species.\n \n \nIs cancer caused by a parasite? If not why have we still got it? How come the genes for causing cancer havne't been weeded out in the fight for survival? Why are less fit people able to continue to breed with their defective genes?\n\n \n it's my understanding that cancer is started when a human cell's DNA is mutated (be it UV light, or man made carcinogens) in such a way that the cell copies itself much faster and more erratically than it's supposed to. \n \n Cancer isn't explicitly heritable (as in the cancer itself is not passed down) but if a relative had cancer, you are more likely to share the \"weak\" DNA that is susceptible to cancer. \n \n (anyone: if I made any serious errors please point them out to me)\n \n At any rate, evolution doesn't produce the best possible organisms. It produces what is good enough. any diseases that effect an organism after it is done reproducing generally will have little to no selective pressure. It doesn't impede survival to a mature age, or reproduction, so it won't limit its host organism (and consequently the propagation of itself).\n \n In conclusion, random deaths/births have no selective pressure, and the existence heritable diseases do not conflict with evolution.
