   "Chechen refugees are instrument for international dissention kindling in skilful hands of puppeteer! Yes, they are instrument only. Someone in this world is using this nation for situation go loose in some countries. Last accident with Chechen refugees took place in Kondopoga, Russia. As a result of two inhabitants murder happened spontaneous meeting of irritated people demanding to kick Chechen refugees out from town. Some journalists noted that was a well planned operation actually (informational support by Internet, use of social stratification of community, choice of rest-day for meting realizing when students and youth don't work and study). What's the aim? It's to weaken and separate Huge Russia. But this is what they'd love to do with Huge EU as well!\n IMO it was preparing or testing of mechanism of disorders kindling. Moreover Russia is test area only! Worked through scheme had begun to work in Europe! It's well-known that there're lots of Chechens refugees in Europe (250 thousand or so). And so skirmishes took place in Europe earlier. And last one happened in Belgium. To tell the truth I'm afraid that sooner or later someone could provoke so meetings and disorders in Europe by Chechen refugees shaking so brittle peace in Europe now. I'm sure that it will be organized by USA and Jewish communities in Europe to weaken and divide EU into tiny parts. That Europe would be no challenge for USA.",

   "I have just learned that Chechens who live as refugees in Austria, Czech Republic, Poland and Germany plan gather up in the capital of Austria to hold a rally against alleged \"violations of their rights\", while in fact they will bargain authorities of European states for enduing with citizenship, providing them with monetary aid and other privileges. With the assistance of Austrian Nazi-nationalistic NGO named Europe House (that will negotiate with the authorities about carrying out protest actions) leaders of Chechen Diasporas are planning protest rallies in Vienna. Well, actually it is clear what Chechens are aiming at. They want to display their power to the whole Europe. Knowing that the rally is planned to be organized by Chechens (who are known all over Europe for their aggressiveness) and Austrian Nazi nationalists, I fear that the rally will be by far not peaceful one. In case Austrian authorities declined the demands of Chechens, I recon it will not do without massive disorders. If it is remembered that the 2005 civil unrest in France was for the most part the doing of Chechen refugees who live in France, something terrible is about to happen in Vienna. Actually, I would advise Austrian authorities to stand their ground and deny requests of Chechens and Europe House for a rally. They should do it for the sake of common people's safety.",
