   "I always thought that the development of Africa is mainly a political issue, until I delved into the book of Ne Kiana Mazamba \"Kindoki: an African mystery elucidated\" (www.kianamaz.com). Kiana gives another perception of the problematic of the African development which puts spirituality at the centre. For him the African trouble comes from the destruction of the African spiritual traditional values, this destruction let lose the belief in witchcraft, the main element of that blocks good initiatives on individual and collective level. Mr Kiana gives two solutions: first religion in Africa should be able to help people handle the issue of witchcraft. And secondly spirituality should help African connect with black saints.",

   "In many cases witches are vast repositories of cultural, herbal and medical knowledge which can be of great benefit to the societies in which they live.\n \n However, there is a tradition of burning witches and destroying their knowledge within European Christian society and Europeans are constantly trying to force their culture and beliefs onto other cultures.\n \n It must be said, that a culture should be self-critical and should, I think, have reference to a wider world culture to find out if there have not been better solutions discovered to shared problems.",

   "Whilst some people were burnt as witches, the number is maybe a few hundred, hardly constituting a tradition. It shouldn't have happened, but more is made of it than should be.\n\n Rounding up witches and burning them at the stake is the same as rounding up jews and burning them in ovens. One is just on a larger scale than the other. Also, one was done by Hitler, whom some people consider to be the anti-christ. The other was done by christs followers in the name of christianity. I would say that the tradition it points to is not burning witches, but the intolerance of christians to anyone other than other chrisitians. Just my 2 cents.",

Really? That must be why the link says 4 in Ireland, 10 in Russia, and that most were concentrated in 3 countries out of dozens in Europe. You will note that England, where many of the early settlers came from, is not on the list of those countries where the trials were common. And, in any case, the victims at Salem were hanged, not burned, and they do appear on the timeline, 1690s.",
