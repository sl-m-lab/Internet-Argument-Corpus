   "Yep, they did it.\n \n For those who don't know about stewart, here is the brief:\n \n Stewart was arrested and charged with (among other things) posession of a machine gun. The machine gun in question was home made. In court, stewarts attorneys argued that since the machine gun in question had never been in interstate commerce, the NFA did not apply to it (remember, the NFA is a tax bill, nothing more). The 9th circuit found that stewart was correct. The DOJ appealed and the appeals court upheld the ruling. It looked like the DOJ was going to let it go, but at the last second filed for certiorari, and now it is up to teh supreme court to decide whether or not to hear the case.\n \n Possible ramifications if the supreme court refuses:\n \n From a practical standpoint, the ruling of the 9th becomes the law of the land. People who live in the 9th district can more or less start building machine guns in their garages and there is not a damn thing the government can do about it.\n \n Possible ramifications if the supreme court hears the case:\n \n \n Personally I think they will come up with some lame dodge. A friend of mine who is a congressional aid feels otherwise. As I understand it, this is making some waves at the capitol because about any lawyer they can find says the supreme court will almost certainly uphold the decision of the lower court, thus making closet machine gun making legal in the entire country.\n \n Apparently the real concern is that the ATF, in their haste to make illegal anything that could even remotely be considered a machine gun, ruled that an auto sear is in and of itself a machine gun, whether it is installed in a gun or not.\n \n An autosear is a piece of metal that slips into an AR-15 to make it full auto. It is a U shaped deal with a little bend to it. Your average idiot could make one in about 10 minutes with a pair of tin snips and some pliers. \n \n Lets say for a minute that the supreme court rules that a machine gun, constructed at home and never having traveled in interstate commerce is not subject to the provisions of the NFA. Now, if the ATF had not been in such a hurry to outlaw anything and everything that could be considered a machine gun, that would still restrict the construction of such weapons to people who are fairly well equipped and posess a fair amount of technical expertise. By ruling that an autosear (or a FA bolt) is in and of itself a machine gun, they have kind of shot themselves in the foot, since either component can be constructed by your average 10th grader.\n \n \n What do you guys think? Will we see stewart in the supreme court? What do you think the likely outcome will be?",

   "Do you think that if the SOCTUS rules in favor of stewart, a ban on making firearms will result?\n\n \n This seems higly unlikely. Most of the laws we currently have on the books which are passed by congress are passed under the guise of the commerce clause. For years they have abused the commerce clause, and the courts have been fairly lenient in this regard. As of late, the courts apparently are reinging in congress (US vs. Lopez).\n \n The specific powers of congress are:\n \n \nClause 1: The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n \n Clause 2: To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n Clause 3: To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \n Clause 4: To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n Clause 5: To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; \n \n Clause 6: To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States; \n \n Clause 7: To establish Post Offices and post Roads; \n \n Clause 8: To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; \n \n Clause 9: To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court; \n \n Clause 10: To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations; \n \n Clause 11: To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; \n \n Clause 12: To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; \n \n Clause 13: To provide and maintain a Navy; \n \n Clause 14: To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; \n \n Clause 15: To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; \n \n Clause 16: To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; \n \n Clause 17: To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, byCession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;--And \n \n Clause 18: To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. \n \n \n All other powers are reserved for the states or the individual. If the SCOTUS rules that a homebuilt machine gun (or silencers, destructive devices, AOW's, etc...) is outside the bounds of the commerce clause, that pretty much knocks congress out of the running as far as doing anything about it, unless they wish to issue some Letters of Marque and Reprisal. Not likely.\n \n If the SCOTUS does rule for Stewart, it will be up to the states to pass laws regarding home made machine guns. If that becomes the case, I think there is a better than average chance that we will se a firearms case in the SCOTUS in the not too distant future, and I say it is about damn time.\n \n Even the antigunners seem to realise that if a gun case actually does reach the supreme court, they are sunk. The supreme courts has historically depended HEAVILY on original intent in dealing with constitutional matters, and there is simply no question as to the original intent of those who drafted the constitution. The RKBA is an individual right, not necessarily connected to the militia, and SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.\n \n The supreme court already established a test for second ammendment protection in the miller case, an individual must be able to show that the weapon in question is militarily useful. Pretty much any firearm on the planet is militarily useful.",

   "I don't believe firearms manufactured by an individual are transferable. Hence, '86 ban wil stand no matter.\n\n \n Sure they are. You simply can't make them to sell (that would make you a manufacturer). This is kind of one of those questions that nobody is willing to answer. They set forth a definition of \"manufaturer\" in the definitions section of the act:\n \n \nThe term \"manufacturer\" means any person engaged in the business of manufacturing firearms or ammunition for purposes of sale or distribution; and the term \"licensed manufacturer\" means any such person licensed under the provisions of this chapter &#91;18 USCS Sec.Sec.921 et seq.&#93;.\n\n \n People who build firearms at home are generally not doing it to sell them. If they were, that would make them a manufaturer and it would be illegal. At the same time, there is no law against transferring a home build firearm provided you did not build it for the purpose of transeferring it. If you build one and then a couple years down the line decide you don't wnt it or need it or like it anymore and give it to your buddy, you are fine. They are not going to believe that you built and then decided you didn't like 100 guns per year.\n \n Most of the pages that discuss building homebuilt firearms or completing 80% recievers tell you YOU CAN NEVER TRANSFER IT. This is wrong. I have sold a couple of the guns I have built, and with the blessing of my local ATF office. \n \n As far as home built machine guns go, you could probably not transfer them because it could be argued that in transferring them ther is a good chance that they will end up in interstate commerce, and depending on what district you are in, this may or may not make it illegal (some districts have taken a fairly wide view of what is \"interstate commerce\". Others have stuck by the logic that an illegal transfer must take place before a crime is indicated.)\n \n \n From a practical standpoint, this is probably not going to be as biug a problem as many people believe, or as big a hurdle for the ATF to overcome as many of the homebuilt gun folks like to think. \n \n A large part of the lower courts rulings were based on the fact that the weapons in question in the stewart case were built mostly form scratch. He did not just order a kit and assemble it. The law already make distinctions between \"raw materials\" and \"components\". It is far from inconcievable that the ATF would simply rule that in order for a homebuilt machinegun to be a homebuilt machine gun the majority of the components would have to be home made. This would knock about 99% of home builders out of the picture right from the start. There is a world if differnce between making your own reciever and putting a parts kit on it and actually building a gun from scratch. Most people simply do not have the skill or equipment to do the latter, and it would be cheaper to caugh up a couple thousand bucks for a registered weapon than to obtain the equipment needed (sorry, folks, a minilathe and a chinese minimill isn't going to do it)",

You would likely be able to use a prefab barrel and stock.\n \n As far as just building a Dias, not likely. while a Dias is considered a machine gun for purposes of transfer, it is likely that the eventual ruling will be that since a substantial portion of the finished, operable unit (that being the finished gun) was involved in interstate commerce, the construction as a whole is significantly tied to interstate commerce. This would mean that kit builds would be a no-no. \n \n I know there are 3 or 4 different drafts of bills currently being worked on the hill that would make this the case, but they are only likely to berought up if the ATF doesn't rule like this immediatly (it all depends on what the supreme court has to say on the matter). \n \n From a practical standpint, the only possible way we are goig to be building machine guns easily (such as from parts kits) is if we get 922 repealed.",

   "In the Commonwealth of Virginia, the answer is Yes.\n\n \n Is this somethign that is generally enforced, or is it one of those selective enforcement issues? It seems likely to me that somebody who owns a machine gun is likely to own other guns as well. Such a person is most likely to be a collector. since machine guns use the same ammos as many other weapons, would this mean that a guy with a machine gun in his collection, lets say an Uzi, would basically be prohibited from storing 9mm ammo in their home? What if they owned a 9mm pistol as well?\n \n As a prosecutor, would you actually prosecute a stupid law like that?",

   "I can't tell if it is an issue of selective enforcement or not, Daewoo, because I have never seen or heard of a prosecution for possession of an unregistered machine gun at the state level. It is an element of proof of a particular crime, and not a crime itself, to possess ammunition or spent shell casings which can/could have been fired in the machinegun. The crime is possession (or use) of the machinegun for an \"aggressive\" purpose. The code was written to make it a presumption that the weapon was possessed for an \"aggressive\" purpose if ammo or spent casings are found nearby. \n \n Prosecution of any case depends on the facts I am presented with when law enforcement screens the case with me. I know people who own machineguns, and I've even had the chance to play with the MP5s as well as some old National Guard hand-me-down M-16's my Sheriff's office owns (I've even heard of, but not handled or seen, an original full auto Thompson which one of the town PDs in my jurisdiction is rumored to still have mothballed) It is unlikely that I will ever get the chance to prosecute someone who possesses an unregistered machinegun, however, because they are expensive and the people who fool with them tend to follow the rules. Now if we ever catch a few guys with AKs and photos of Osama then I will use these statutes. Beyond that, I can't say without specific facts.... The law is only stupid if when applied to specific facts it leads to a stupid result. This is where \"prosecutorial discretion\" comes into play with the ability to refuse to use the law where its use would generate an unjust result.",

The law is only stupid if when applied to specific facts it leads to a stupid result. This is where \"prosecutorial discretion\" comes into play with the ability to refuse to use the law where its use would generate an unjust result.\n\n \n That's a reasonable approach to criminal prosecution of any matter and one I've found to be the norm with prosecutors I've known on a personal basis. They were generally in large cities, and in personal conversations candid about the overwhelming amount of criminal offenses dictating selective prosecution based on public attention levels. \n \n You're also correct about little, if any, surfacing of unregistered Class 3 weapons within conventional society. All class 3 receivers and bolts including relics and curios were subjected to registration in 1986. They're so closely monitored that the BATFE knows where each and every one is located at any given minute. The tax process, the actual control point, takes about 90-days for the transfer of any class 3 weapon, which documents the seller, the licensed class 3 selling transfer agent, the licensed receiving class 3 transfer agent and the buyer. Add in the cost of most class 3 pieces, which puts them out of reach for the average person, and control is virtually absolute. \n \n Which created a thriving black market with urban gangs, the dope crowd (not to combat authorities but competitors), survivalists and those people who bend laws for enjoyment as eager buyers of cheap, smuggled and stolen class three weapons. And that's an unfortunately large segment of society. IMO, we've once again penalized harmless collectors and hobbiests with federal and state regulation without denting availability of supply for those who use those weapons for criminal activities and pay no taxes. Morality or lack of again proves itself resistant to legislation.",
