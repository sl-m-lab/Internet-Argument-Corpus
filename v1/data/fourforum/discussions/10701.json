   "Yeah but was the number you picked behind the door you chose? That was the point of the thread. And what are the odds of the program figuring it out?\n100% because it's programmed to do that. Note that when you pick a color for your number, you have narrowed the programs choices to five. Note the groupings of the like colored numbers and you will see that when you get ready to pick your house that each of the numbers in your color range has been placed in a different house. (This applies to all color groupings. They've also added numbers 26 thru 30 which do not appear in the original array.) When you pick your house (if your honest about it) the program knows your number. It then displays that number behind the first door that you click on, regardless of which one of the three doors you choose.\n \n Elementary, my dear Watson!\n \n \n\n AND MY QUESTION IS, WHY ARE SO MANY OF YOU AROUND HERE SPOIL SPORTS WHO JUST LOVE TO PI$S ON A WELL INTENTIONED THREAD WHICH IS MEANT TO JUST LIGHTEN THINGS UP!!!\nSome people just hate to see Christians having fun?",
