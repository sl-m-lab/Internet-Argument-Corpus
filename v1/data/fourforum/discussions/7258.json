   "The New Jersey Senate late Thursday passed sweeping amendments to the state's domestic partner law that would, upon a partner's death, give the surviving partner control of the estate and inheritance in the absence of a will. \n \n The legislation also would give the surviving partner control of burial decisions absent a directive otherwise.\n \n In a vote that stunned even LGBT civil rights advocates the Senate vote was unanimous - 35-to-0.\n \n \"This is the most lopsided pro-LGBTI-rights vote in New Jersey history and one of the most lopsided pro-gay votes in American history,\" Garden State Equality spokesperson Steven Goldstein told 365Gay.com\n http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/01/010606njPartner.htm",
