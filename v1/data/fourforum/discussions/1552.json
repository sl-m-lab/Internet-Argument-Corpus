   "Because Hilary had to have a NY address to be Senator,\n She & Bill, both pretty broke already,\n bought a multi million dollar estate for themselves,\n at a monthly mortgage payment of $10,000.\n How will they pay for it, you ask?\n By requiring the Secret Service to build at taxpayer\n expense, a housing compound on the property for SS use,\n (thus vastly increasing the resale value of the estate)\n then CHARGING the Secret Service rent, you guessed it,\n at $10,000 a month in taxpayer dollars, for the privilege!\n Even when they're not in residence!\n As Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax\n deductable, They could stand to profit a huge amount by the\n tax benefit!\n Then pocketing Millions in profit when they sell the estate\n that the taxpayers bought for them!!\n So next time you see Hilary wagging her finger at\n government spending, know that she's scooping up free money\n from the taxpayers by the bucketload in the other hand!",
