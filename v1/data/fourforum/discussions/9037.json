   "Our government has seriously departed from the ideas of our forefathers. The people are no longer in control, and politician is not a civil service...it's a career. Our government practices the theory of \"divide and conquer\" by giving us two sides of every issue. Liberals and Democrats side up versus conservatives and Republicans and it becomes a sport. Each side tries to shoot down the other and score points for their \"team.\" Everybody seems to forget we all play for the same team....America. My question is this: Can a thrid party ever make it in this country and, if so, is the time now? I think our country is crying out for a third party more now then ever before.

The only difference is that the Democrats will get a higher percentage of lobbyists' money for the next 2 years because they have the majority. \n If you want real reform in Washington, you need bold moves.\n 1. Prohibit any retiring member of Congress from working for any company that they regulated while in office\n 2. Enact full disclosure requirements for any contact with lobbyists under penalty of perjury if not disclosed.\n 3. Set a monetary limit on any gifts or \"in kind\" entertainment.\n 4. Limit the size of Congressional staffers to a few per member.\n 5. Eliminate all gov't ONLY benefit programs. Make Congress use commercial HMOs and PPOs just like the rest of us. Make them part of SS and eliminate gov't only pension plans and their liberal qualification requirements.",

   "If you want fair elections, you shoud get rid of the primaries. They are a waste of time and money. They should allow each person to debate regardless of how many there are and then let the poeple vote all in the same day who the president is, not vote to represent a party. That is the only fair way to hold an election.\n \n There are already more than two parties that run for president, libertarian, communist, prohibition, liberal, green, independant, and I can't remember the other one or ones, but they are out there if you care to look.\n \n People are only voting on the most popular 2 because they think other parties take way votes from main two parties. This is a crock because the votes didn't belong to the party anyways. \n \n People are going to have to make a change to get rid of what's moving into our government. Bush has already appointed himself a dictatorship and nobody care to impeach him. What a shame!",
