And if you can't prove it in a scientific manner then how can you justify keeping it in place?\n\n Sorry, I miss-spoke. It's impossible to prove that a prohibition works simply by looking at the events within the prohibition. Scientifically, the test is obvious, if very difficult to enact - set up (or find) two identical areas, let people carry guns in one and control them in the other. Compare, contrast, and repeat if possible. The problem is that finding two suitable areas is very hard - they not only have to be very similar, but they have to be suitably isolated for gun control to have an effect (for example: DC is a poor test case because any gun could simply be carried into the city from outside).\n \n \nThe problem is that the definition of \"assault weapon\" is determined purely by cosmetic features that make no impact on the overall function of the weapon.

I'm not particularly pro/anti the AW ban, because I would say that a regular firearm is just as easily misused. I was more fault-finding with your argument than trying to propose another ban - my position is to introduce stricter control (mandatory training/testing, list of gun licence owners, remove 'self-defence' as a valid reason for owning a gun), and pretty much leave it at that. Going on to a full gun ban might be a nice ideal, but it's not practical in today's America - even my current stance would have to be introduced slowly.",

As I said above, this does not mean that the ban had no overall effect - and to imply that it should is kinda intellectually dishonest.\n \n It's like saying 'murder is illegal, but we have all these murders going on, so clearly a ban on murder isn't having any effect'.\n \n \nIn my experience the guns people generally consider to be for hunting or sporting purpose are far more deadly than so called \"killing guns\". About 95% of all hunting ammunition can easily penetrate body armor, cars or concrete walls, and most of what can't will certainly cause grave injury through the body armor.\n\n However, a hunting rifle is neither concealable, rapid-fire, or widely owned (compared to handguns). Those are the issues I have which make 'personal defence' guns targetable.\n \n \nHow exactly is our level of control lacking? And is it truly a lack of sufficient control, or a lack of effective enforcement?\nBetter enforcement would be a start. However, your lack of control is evident in that it doesn't match up with what I'd like to see.

Saying that such is wrong, is wrong in itself.\n\n People always get this wrong.\n \n I have nothing against self-defence. However, a gun, while being usable as such, is not a primarily defensive tool. There are also plenty of self-defence tools that, while not entirely as effective, are perfectly viable alternatives to guns, especially when used in synchrony.

Perhaps if the two didn't have guns then they would've paid precise attention to the bombs and then they would have gone off as they intended.

The criminals have guns, that's a constant. In turn the states one by one started letting citizens legally carry guns as well, that hasn't lead to an arms race like you're suggesting; if it had then we'd see criminals armed with AK-47s for everyday muggings instead of handguns like they're most often found in possession of.\n \n The current setting is criminals armed with handguns, citizens armed with handguns. Very, very few criminals are using long guns that offer superior range, firepower and accuracy. Your arms race analogy is flawed and wrong. It hasn't happened in the 20 years that concealed carry has been implemented.\n \n \nAnd the skunk?\n\n \n What of it? What protects it more, it's chemical agent or its unique color pattern that advertises itself? The skunk is basically open carrying and displaying that it's armed and willing to hurt something or someone.

The situation is similar to that of criminals who wear body armor so when they're shot at they won't have lethal results. In this case the mongoose is the bad guy.",

   "iangb: Just a few points. First on stabbing someone, you only need to be within 20 feet of the intended victim. Most people don't have the reflexes to avoid an attack from under that distance, you can do it in app. 3 steps. If you don't believe me try it. A person with a gun that hasn't been formally trained is very unlikely to hit someone standing more than 25' distant.

   "There is a reason we have the right to bear arms in our constitution. It was so important to our founding fathers that it was the second amendment.\n \n Amendment II\n \n A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be INFRINGED!\n \n Tell me how a gun ban doesn't infringe on my second amendment rights. I don't need a reason to own a gun it IS MY RIGHT!\n \n \n \n \n \n I cannot take credit for this but I feel it is relevant for the topic at hand.\n \n \n \n ------------------------------\n \n A Little Gun History Lesson \n \n \n In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n ------------------------------\n \n In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n ---------------------------\n \n Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated\n \n -----------------------------\n \n China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n ----------------------------\n \n Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n ------------------------------\n \n Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n ------------------------------\n Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n \n -----------------------------\n \n Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.\n \n ------------------------------\n It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first year results are now in:\n \n Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent\n \n Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent\n \n Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent)!\n \n In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent. Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!\n \n While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed.\n \n There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the ELDERLY. Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in successfully ridding Australian society of guns. The Australian experience and the other historical facts above prove it.\n \n Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.\n \n With Guns...........We Are \"Citizens\".\n Without Them........We Are \"Subjects\".",

   "Something interesting in the news: Topeka police department breaks out the big guns\n \n Interesting article. Kindly notice the date: December 02, 2004.\n \n And now, notice the quote in the article: \"In the last 10 years we've seen an increase in fire power by assailants, mostly high powered rifles,\" says Sgt. Dave Thomas with Topeka Police, \"Shot guns and pistols can't match that.\"\n \n I can arrive at only two possibilities about this. Either the officer interviewed was wrong, or lying through his teeth; or the entire 10 years during with the 94 AWB was in effect, it didn't do a damn bit of good at hindering criminals.",
