   "Actually, Big Orn raises a valid point. And if I understand it correctly I will try to put it into different words as I THINK he is trying to tell me. If I do not, then I guess I'm not as smart as you I think I am....(no, that couldn't be! :p )\n \n If I knew that sharing needles and injecting drugs into my body caused A.I.D.S., yet I chose to do it anyways, and contracted A.I.D.S. and died, would one say that A.I.D.S. killed me or that I killed myself?\n \n Action vs. Reaction.\n \n God didn't kill the people, they killed themselves by knowingly defying the Almighty. They knew the penalties yet chose to ignore them thus suffering the consequences.\n \n Was I close?\n \n Of all the scripture I have read, the character of God was, in fact, a cruel diety. However, his cruelty, or wrath if you will, was always a result of defience to his laws and not done for some sick, demented \"Bwa-ha-ha I am God!!\" reason.\n \n If I could wrap my head around religion, (if it were that pliable and less hard,) I could only do so from the standpoint of being a father myself. I would NEVER punish my children to the degree the \"Loving God\" was reported to have done. I cannot and would not hitch my wagon to any diety that would punish their children, as the god of the old testament was reported to have, be he the god of heaven in the white hat OR the god of hell with the horns of a goat. Cruel is cruel. Period.\n \n It is usually at this point of the dialog that the religious say to me, \"But that was the OLD testament. Through the blood of Jesus Christ we are under a new covenant. In the old times, god held up one end of the rope and mankind held up the other. If mankind dropped it's end, it was doomed to the wrath of God. But Jesus delivered us from this bondage through his divine grace and our yoke has been removed and our burden has been lightened. Jesus now holds up the other end of the rope for us. All you have to do is hang on somewhere in the middle. He has already died for your sins. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of god but through the acceptance of Jesus Christ as your savior, you can and will be saved.\"\n \n That's usually the time when my head feels like I just stepped off the merry-go-round and I hear the quacking of ducks.

   "#1 Did god create this ,and everything, in this universe or not. This is what i'm told by christians ... god created everything.\n \n #2 see #1\n\n its like this, god created all the raw mateirals in the earth that everything is created from, so technically anything that is created is due to what god has provided for things to be created out of. hope that makes sense. the iron ore, copper ore, aluminum ore, crude oil, silica, and other \"naturally occuring\" materials that are used in the construction of the car was created by god. but god didnt create the car\n \n anyway, thats my take on it. ask around among other theists and see what they think\n \n \n #3 Nothing to hard to understand here I agree.. poeple do things and make choices about them.

This is pretty simple\n\n very simple, and exactly the idea. god can and does make up the rules as he goes along, and can change those rules when convenient. you may notice though, that when something as universally important as the great almighty god making a new rule, it is only revealed to the assigned priest, judge or king in power at the time, and then conveyed to the national population. god doesnt make these new rules universally apparent to everyone simultaneously. so its not surprising that these \"new god-given rules\" end up being in accordance with the ruler's agenda\n \n \n #4 I thought god could do anything?? Is this true or not??\n\n god can only do what is logically possible. doing \"anything\", like creating a 3-sided round square, is beyond god's abilities. interestingly enough, converting a stick of chalk into an elephant is just as impossible, and cannot be done by god either",

I'll wait to hear form Unkerpaulie befor I believe that he has \" lost his faith in god \" .. if true we share something else.\n \n Answers to simple questions.\n\n dogma, bias and sbjectivity are the fundamentals of most religions. in christianity this is very prevalent because it explicitly requires you to believe that christianity is the only true religion, and all other religions are false. any religion of this opinion will have a particularly strong dogma, referring to those outside their religion as infidels and outcasts, and putting themselves on an elevated level of morality and godliness\n \n because of this, any questioning of such a religion will be taken as a direct attack on the members of the religion, and they will feel compelled to retaliate in the face of these attacks. not only is there a deep emotional attachment, blurring any logic and reality, but they already have the sense of superiority in their religion, and any \"infidel\" with the audacity to mock their beliefs and threaten their moral status deserves to be trampled\n \n now it gets really interesting. today, there are many christians that would like to disassociate themselves from the group of condescending over-zealous fundamentalists, so they adopt a more \"tolerant\" approach to those that question christianity. as a result, they must drop their belief in a substantial portion of the bible in order to do this. their belief is more based on what is politically correct than what is biblical. what's really ironic is that these same christians turn around and act morally superior to the fundamentalist church members\n \n so here's your choices. your question will either be answered by the fundamentalist, whose view is completely bible-based, but so infected with emotional rhetoric and bias its almost useless; or you'll be answered by the \"liberal\" christian, who essentially knows very little bible-wise, and will try to answer in the most politically format possible, making their response just as useless\n \n enjoy ;)",

If He would have given us His mind, then why are we encouraged to acquire His mind?\n \nIf this is true then we agree .. We are what we are because of all that god has created us to be.

God can do nothing but that which is holy and sin is in opposition to holiness. We well know of the sin of Lucifer, who was given free will by God, but God did not bring about that state or action - Lucifer did. Even now, those who blame God or someone else, even the devil, are committing a sinful act by doing so.\n God did create conditions in the world where the ability to rebel against Him was possible, but He is not responsible for that rebellion once it has been committed. Therefore, sin originated with Lucifer who was the first to rebel and entered the world through Adam who likewise chose disobedience.\n \nI'll be happy to get to this after we clear up the image reflection copy attributes likeness thing\n\n ...which I hope this helps....",
