   "Subject: Mais, Why You Say Such a Mean Ting? \n \n Boudreaux staggered home late after another evening with his drinking buddy, Thibodeaux. He took off his shoes to avoid waking his wife, Clotile. \n He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their \n upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step. As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump. A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful. Managing not to yell, Boudreaux sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding. He managed to find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a band-aid as best he could on each place he saw blood.He then hid the now almost empty box and shuffled and stumbled led his way to bed. \n \n In the morning, Boudreaux woke up with searing pain in his head and rump and Clotile staring at him from across the room. She said,\"You been drunk again last night, hon Boudreaux?\" \n \n Boudreaux said, \"Mais chere, why you say such a mean ting?\" \n \n \"Well,\" Clotile said, \"it may bin de open front door, it may bin de \n broke glass at de bottom of de stairs, it may bin dem drops of blood \n trailin' tru de house, it could bin yo' bloodshot eyes, but, mostly. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (ready for this?) \n \n it be all dem Band-Aids stuck on de downstair mirror!\"",
