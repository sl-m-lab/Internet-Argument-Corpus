   "Mohammed said, \"I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers are women.\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Women/in-hell.html\n \n \nI freely admit to not knowing all the details before I responded, I've got some egg on face over that one. However, if you want to attack me, you better come to the table with more than calling me an \"arm chair liberal\".\n \n I'm not liberal on most issues, far from it.

Get off your high horse buddy.\n \n Waxy\n\n Can you be oppressed without feeling oppressed? I believe you can be.*\n \n It is clear from Islamic tenets that women are second-class citizens.\n \n I have detailed quotes on the Religion post under \"Islam\", but for a summary;\n Under Islam\n A woman's testimony is, in court, worth less than a man's.\n A woman has a right to inheritance, but this is worth less than a man's.\n A woman has no right to refuse her husband's sexual advances (unless she's having her period)\n A woman has a right to divorce, but it involves a complex legal passage, whereas a man may simply say \"I divorce you\" three times... and he automatically gets custody of the kids, if she's a non-Muslim.\n A woman may have to face the prospect of living with a man who has wives other than herself - yet she can't be married to more than one man at a time.\n \n Wearing a head-scarf is symbolic of belonging to this cruel and debasing religion. Many western Muslim women aren't as persecuted because they live in a western nation that grants them civil rights.\n \n Thus, again, without understanding the details of the subject matter, you, like most Americans :-) are prepared to offer your opinion.\n \n A good other sources is\n The Place of Women in Pure Islam\n http://debate.domini.org/newton/womeng.html\n \n There is also a links site at\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Women/inislam.html\n \n You must also realise that even in a democracy, things such as 'freedom of expression' are not absolute. Although you have the right here to insult me (in response to my condescending smugness; one of my failings is an intellectual arrogance), you don't have a right, for instance, to slander someone.\n \n The 'right' to express yourself is also curbed in some countries (such as my own) when dealing with 'symbols of hate'. It is not permissible here to carry a Nazi flag for the purposes of promoting and supporting racism.\n \n The head-scarf is an agreed symbol of Islam. The debate really should then be \"What does Islam represent?', or more specifically 'What does Islam represent for women?\"\n \n It is, as I believe, a symbol of oppression, and should be banned.\n \n \n *You can feel okay, but still be oppressed.\n Marx said that the workers were oppressed by the bourgeoisie, and needed to develop 'class consciousness' to understand this.\n \n Your own boss can be skimming entitlements from you, without you realising. Is it 'illegal' only when you realise what he is doing?\n \n Women who suffer in instances of domestic violence' often will swear on a stack of Bibles that the husband 'didn't really mean it'... even if a woman's got a bruise, she might lie for him, and deny the violence.\n \n Thus a woman needs to realise what an Islamic world would mean for her. She must develop a 'Gender consciousness' that involves studies of religion.",

   "Intellectual arrogance. LOL.\n \n You automatically assume I have no knowledge of the subject, that's arrogance indeed. I don't have any formal education on Islam, I do watch the media and read as much as I can to try and be informed. I also have a cousin with a BA in Religious Studies majoring in Islam, we've talked at length due to the influence that Islam has on current events. I'd suggest some caution on your part before you simply dismiss people as \"stupid Americans\". \n \n Anyhoo, again, I'll ask you, what gives you the ability, or the RIGHT, to speak on the behalf of Muslim women around the world? Are you a mind reader?\n \n What gives you the right to judge another's religion as being inferior to yours? Shall we examine Christianity in detail?\n \n What gives you the right to label someone as being oppressed when they freely accept their position? (granted not all accept it freely)\n \n Who's the limousine liberal in this situation? Who's trying to \"save them from themselves\". \n \n Perhaps we should send some Christian missionaries over there and convert the savages? \n \n I'm not in favour of oppression of any kind, however, I don't believe in forcing my views upon anyone. The need to impose our \"western ideals\" on others is the root of much of the unrest in the middle east IMHO, and the knee jerk reaction is further extremism on the part of Islamic fundamentalists.\n \n Waxy",

Now you say you've got a cousin who's opinions you rely on... let him speak for himself.\n\n \n As JP pointed out, Canadian, and you better believe I'll \"mouth off\" my opinions. \n \n Kinda difficult in a forum such as this don't you think?\n \n \nOh please! I read, for a starters, on the subject - something you ought to do. I have read more haddiths and suras than I care to mention. Just because you refuse to read the quotes I gave, or the post I wrote on \"Islam\", and therefore choose to remain ignorant, you feel that I have no right to speak up on injustices.\n \n If a Muslim beats his wife, and I find a Koranic (my spelling - out of vogue, I know) text supporting it, then like any rational being, I can put two and two together.\n \n You can read these things too.\n\n \n Did I not just state that I read as much as I can? Of course, no one can be as educated on the subject as yourself.\n \n Never did I say you had no right to speak, I would NEVER presume to say that, though that seems to be EXACTLY what you are telling me.\n \n \nYes, let's compare the two, if\n a) you believe that one set of bad behaviour can be off-set simply because you believe that another party behaves badly (think of that in a law court -\n Montalban: \"Sure your honour, I cheated on the taxes, but other people do it\"\n Magistrate: \"Case dismissed!\" LOL with that attempt at 'reasoning'\n b) you know anything about Christianity - and let's compare Christianity to Islam, but this might take you a while - seeing as you're so pig ignorant on the subject. But feel free to continue to comment... it's your 'national right' to do so.\n\n \n The purpose of that point was merely to demonstrate that Christianity is not without its \"texts\" that can be interpreted in support of oppression as well.\n \n \nI believe in an absolute 'good'. And I compare things against that... based on Christian principles I therefore am against beating of women, for instance. I know you find that culturally imperialistic of me, so sorry if that upsets you.\n\n \n I believe in an absolute good as well. I also believe in tolerance. There is a balance to maintain based on individual freedom.\n \n \nHowever I am not going over there and forcing them to do anything, I am simply having a conversation with you - but you assume that I'd act like an American - go in with guns blazing.\n\n \n I don't assume anything about you Montalban.\n \n In a nutshell, I view your stance as more of an attack on Islam than injustice. Simply interpreting the Koran in favour of oppression/violence is not enough for me to declare Islam, and all of its symbols, oppressive and evil. No more than the words of the Old Testament are enough for me to declare ALL Christians and ALL of symbols of Christianity evil.\n \n This discussion started about something as simple as a headscarf, it's become about ending violence and oppression caused by Islamic beliefs, IMHO, that's a huge stretch. \n \n The Islamic world has some serious work to do in terms of human rights, based on my limited knowledge of Islam, I would suggest that the source of all of these injustices is not the Koran itself, but those that interpret the Koran so as maintain the injustices.\n \n The last method that I see working in advancing this change is the cavalier \"cowboy\" western approach of going in guns blazing and attempting to force change.\n \n As a closing comment, I will no longer continue to respond to your posts. Conversing and debating with someone does not involve calling them \"pig ignorant\" and continuous insults. I've slipped a time or two, but to prevent myself from ending up in the mud with you, I'll \"turn the other cheek\" and politely withdraw.\n \n Waxy",
