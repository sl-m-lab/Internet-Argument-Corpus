As with the Everest post, 'so what?'\n\n \n We've received an incredible amount of information from the Voyager missions regarding everything from the surface of the distant planets, their moons, etc... to the mundane info we've gathered on the operating systems and communications systems of the probes themselves. The value of this data, and the data yet to be recovered regarding space beyond our 9 little planets, could be of immeasurable importance. As for what it does that we haven't already done or determined, every second it's out there is something we haven't already done, and testing not what we've determined, but what we've hypothesized - the very essence of science. \n \n This seems painfully obvious to me, I'm honestly shocked at Van der Woude's flippant statement and some of the opinions here.\n \n Saying the Voyager missions have no scientific value or are a waste of taxpayer's money is tantamount to saying that Columbus' voyage or Lewis and Clark's expedition had no scientific value. We may not see the fruits in our lifetime, but the groundwork has to be laid.\n \n Waxy",

However, there needs to be some parameters set on the definition of worthy art ( I hate paying for trash just because its creator calls it art.) if my agreement is to continue. I'm familiar with the saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but this truth is used today to classify a crucifix in a beaker of urine as art.\n \n I'm in favor of art appreciation courses and art DEFINITION courses being available to all ages....at the expense of all taxpayers!\n \n Government support for mountain climbing expeditions makes since only to those who would profit from it. Unless the return would include some awesome art in the form of photographs or some scientific discoveries regarding life at high altitudes, the benefits would be limited to the climbers (by way of a free vacation), the suppliers (by way of profits) and the bearers (by way of jobs).
