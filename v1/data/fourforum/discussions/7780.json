   "I'm shure this one is going to get me into trouble, but I've never let that stop me from speaking befor !\n \n I find it hard to even take this issue seriously simply because I think most others just take it way too serious. Others taking this issue too serious is the reason you all sit around here talking about \" morals \" and \" equal rights \" and \" personhood \" and a whole host of other words that have nothing to do with the real issue.\n \n This joke of a thing we call marriage.\n \n More than half fail. \n The number of one or both partners cheating is even higher.\n A great number are entered into not for love, but for money or status.\n A large portion would simply end if it were not for the cost involved.\n Others will end after the kids are no longer an issue.\n And last but not least .. It's just a stupid contract. Yes thats right, just a legal binding contract between two people.\n \n When this whole notion of marriage was created it was simply so that estates and other things of value could be secured. And it was very common to have a lover on the side with your partners knowledge. It was also common that the two in a marriage would only have sex in an effort to have kids, never any other time. \n Love was never the consideration for the creation of the institution of marriage !!!\n \n This whole ntion that marriage is sacred is the biggest joke I've heard in a long time. \n \n \n Here's how I see it...\n \n If someone wants to marry someone of the opposite sex, How does that affect me.. It doesen't so why should I care !! It's just a freaking contract anyhow and it's one that doesn't affect me so I just don't care !!\n If someone wants to marry a person of the same sex ...again not my concern, It's just a contract!!\n If someone wants to marry a person of each sex ...again the whole thing is just sooo \" NONE OF MY BUSINESS \" That I just don't care. ( as long as all the participants agree. )\n If someone wants to marry a goat.. again it's just a contract between two parties involved and none of my business. I say if the goat doesn't care I could give a XXXX also.",

   "There hasn't been much of a backlash..in fact, it hasn't stopped the judges at all.\n\n \n Well, I think there has been a backlash. Two people considered constitutionalists have been appointed to SCOTUS this last year. Harriet Miers DIDN'T get appointed in part because of the fear of judicial activism. Remember the stir over the judge in Vermont that let a child sex offender basically off the hook? (He was part of a spceial interest group that felt child sex offenders should be rehabilitated instead of punished.) Judicial reform wasn't even on the table a few years ago, but it's a big topic now. I consider all that a backlash.\n \n \nPeople love the living constitution, it is appealing and easy to work with.
