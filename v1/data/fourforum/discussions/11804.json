Surely there is a great merit of the Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou. After his success in the presidential election, Ma said he would work to fulfill his campaign pledge to improve relations with mainland China. He has said and he has done: direct charter flights have been started, Chinese tourists are welcome to visit Taiwan and the ROC's legislative restrictions on the financial sector to invest in Chinese economy are lifted. Considering all these facts I understand the recent accusation of China in having 1500 missiles directed at Taiwan as a nothing but canard ([spacewar. com/reports/China_pointing_about_1500_missiles_at_Taiwan_Taipei_official_999.html]China pointing about 1,500 missiles at Taiwan: Taipei official). It looks like somebody wants to destabilize the situation in the East; somebody wants to initiative the conflict between Beijing and Taipei. Friendly speaking, I think that it is Japan who wants to derive benefit of it. Using its connections in official circles in Taiwan, the Japanese tries to aggravate its contradictions with China. Evidently they are too much concerned about the fact that China, cooperating with Taiwan, may become powerful rival in the regional leadership race.",
