This is given that there are several 'first world' countries that have (almost) all guns banned, and none are 'police states'. As an aside, many also have lower violent crime rates.\n \n Oh, and an interesting fact. I noticed the other day that America locks almost 1% of it's population in jail at any one time. That certainly seems quite police state-y already...\n \n I think that very little would change, for most people. Violent crime would (most likely) reduce, and gun clubs would shut down - but neither of these actually affect that many people. I expect that the NRA would be unhappy, schools with potentially psychotic students would be happy, and (by their words, at least) Ethmi and a few other pro-gunners from these boards would become criminals.",

   "I would challenge you most strongly to find me somewhere where I state that 'all gun owners are evil'.\n \n I make distinctions between gun owners - there are the many who have brought a gun and will never use it for self-defence, the very few who have brought a gun and will use it for self defence, and the slightly-more-than-very-few who have brought a gun and will use it for an illegal activity. Those that buy a gun for work/sport (read: valid) purposes, I have no issue with - as you really should have noticed by now.\n \n In the same way, I make distinctions between those that break the speed limit whilst driving - many do it and harm no-one, a few do it and kill someone. You are arguing that speed limits should be removed so that the many who enjoy driving fast (or getting places quicker) can go on speeding, because 'they're not part of the problem'.\n \n I've said this repeatedly - it seems to be a common blind spot amongst (many of) the pro-gun crowd that 'good' citizens can never commit an 'evil' crime. This is blatantly false.\n \n Also, if you actually read my posts in this topic, you would see that I don't support the idea of public gun-owner lists. It would certainly be useful for the police to have such a list, and for it to be mandatory to report to the police a gun theft, but I disagree with the idea of making such a list public. It's actually quite amusing that you are trying to shock me with demands that I make my 'background' public - I am a student teacher, so I recently had to pass a standard CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check to ensure that I am 'safe' to work with children. Would you say that it is a bad idea for the police to hold those records on me?",

   "I would challenge you most strongly to find me somewhere where I state that 'all gun owners are evil'.\n \n I make distinctions between gun owners - there are the many who have brought a gun and will never use it for self-defence, the very few who have brought a gun and will use it for self defence, and the slightly-more-than-very-few who have brought a gun and will use it for an illegal activity. Those that buy a gun for work/sport (read: valid) purposes, I have no issue with - as you really should have noticed by now.\n \n In the same way, I make distinctions between those that break the speed limit whilst driving - many do it and harm no-one, a few do it and kill someone. You are arguing that speed limits should be removed so that the many who enjoy driving fast (or getting places quicker) can go on speeding, because 'they're not part of the problem'.\n \n I've said this repeatedly - it seems to be a common blind spot amongst (many of) the pro-gun crowd that 'good' citizens can never commit an 'evil' crime. This is blatantly false.\n \n Also, if you actually read my posts in this topic, you would see that I don't support the idea of public gun-owner lists.

It's actually quite amusing that you are trying to shock me with demands that I make my 'background' public - I am a student teacher, so I recently had to pass a standard CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check to ensure that I am 'safe' to work with children.

   "I think that we've reached our impasse. Again.\n\n \n Alright let's see if we can get past this impasse.\n \n I don't believe that maintaining a list of gun owners serves any justifiable purpose. By law the only people who can legally own a gun are people who haven't broken any laws and haven't done anything wrong. By definition a list of gun owners is nothing more than a list of people who are law-abiding in nature. So exactly what crime fighting purpose would a list of non-offenders serve to the police? Are they going to use it as a list of people who they don't have to question in regards to a crime taking place? For that matter what justification is there in the police maintaining a list of people who aren't lawbreakers? Police are responsible for upholding the laws of the community, therefore they would have no use for a list of people who aren't violating these laws.\n \n A database registry of gun owners wouldn't give police any clues to finding criminals either. Criminals can't legally own guns, so they can't register them even if they were required to, nor would they because they don't obey the laws. And even if it could be mandated that criminals had to register their firearms with the police, they could resist on the basis that such a registry would violate their 5th Amendment protections against self-incrimination; if you're prohibited from owning a gun, registering it is an admission that you're violating the law.\n \n So again, what is the purpose of instituting a plan that would allow the police to monitor only those without a criminal history, but which can't be used to monitor criminals because it would violate their constitutional protections?",

I've said all gun owners (feel free to extend that to 'all people') should be treated equally by the law. I've said that a major blind spot of yours is that you refuse to admit that 'good' people can do 'evil' things. I've said that I haven't called all gun owners 'evil'.\n \n Is it possible (hint hint hint yes hint) that I consider no person to be intrinsically 'good' or 'evil', and that instead I simply consider all gun owners to be 'people'? Certain individuals are more or less likely to commit a crime than others, true. But that doesn't mean that all people are 'evil', just that all people - cops and military included - have the ability to commit crime. Guns (in my opinion, and in the opinion of some reports I posted a while back) make that ability stronger - both by being highly lethal and by fuelling aggression.\n \n \nI don't believe that maintaining a list of gun owners serves any justifiable purpose.

If they commit a crime with a gun which they have legally purchased, then the fact that they are armed will be most useful to the police. Furthermore, if a crime is committed with a gun they legally bought, and they haven't reported it stolen, this implies that they have been straw purchasing. Finally, if they commit a crime without a gun, then only the cops' record that they previously brought a gun prevents them from going back home and being a criminal with a (legally purchased) firearm - something which you seem to be very keen on discouraging.\n \n \nSo again, what is the purpose of instituting a plan that would allow the police to monitor only those without a criminal history, but which can't be used to monitor criminals because it would violate their constitutional protections?\n\n This is particularly interesting. You freely agree that criminals should be denied certain rights - for example, the right to bear arms. However, you fight to protect other rights for them. How do you decide which ones you like and which you don't?\n \n \n As an aside - you are still relying far too heavily on the 'it's a right!' argument. This is why we hit our impasse.

   "When I buy a car, I don't have to drive it down to the DVLA (Driver and Vehicles Licensing Agency) in Swansea in order for them to take my address, name, and all the car details. Instead, it is an automatic part of the process - it takes me absolutely no more time, because the people I'm buying from already have my contact details and already know the specifications of the car. All that this system requires extra effort for is if you're buying an illegal car - which shouldn't be happening in the first place.\n\n \n Do the police have access to this database?

If you have a ballistics database that stores the so called \"fingerprints\" of a gun, the marks left on the bullet as it travels down the barrel of the gun, then you might be able to get a lead. But if you try and match the bullet recovered from the crime scene against the same caliber bullets in the registry and come up empty then the database has proved useless and taken up valuable time that could've been better utilized by having more police on the streets looking for and investigating clues.\n \n If a gun used to commit crimes isn't found in the registry, then the registry isn't much of a valuable crime fighting tool is it?

   "As an Australian (we have gun bans, with noted exceptions)\n I feel if America banned guns it would be a mistake.\n \n The initial effect would be that people would already have stockpiles from when it was legal and that would make the prohibition ineffective (this is why prohibitions are generally ineffective) \n Then police resources would be wasted tracking down these now illegal guns, even if many citizens turned theirs in.\n The gun industry itself would be largely unharmed, remember they are supplying the largest and most powerful army in the world and the USA does a roaring international arms trade.\n Overall prohibition would be too restrictive, once the right is given to a person you can't just take it away, whether or not they deserve to have it (it's cruel).\n \n Here in Australia we have a less extreme solution that works better:\n 1. Average citizens can only acquire guns with a great deal of effort and only for a specific legitimate purpose; these include; Registered and legal hunting clubs, registered and legal gun enthusiast clubs (usually target shooters and marksmen recreational clubs) and for participating in Gun sports.\n 2. Guns and ammo must be kept separate at all times when not in use for the preapproved reasons above, most clubs will keep either the ammo or the gun at the club while giving the other half to members for safekeeping.\n 3. It is a crime to be caught with a loaded gun in public (not at a private residence however, privacy laws and all that)\n 4. The gun owner is responsible in all cases for what happens to the gun and what it is used for unless it is stolen (the charge can even then still be negligence if proper steps aren't taken to protect a firearm from theft)\n Yes this does mean an owner can be held responsible for his kid getting a hold of his gun and be charged criminally for it.\n 5. Gotta be 18 and have a completely clean criminal and mental health record to even think about applying for a gun license.\n 6. The police have access to gun licensing and sales lists (including serial numbers, names and the purpose of the gun), but it is only accessed with a warrant, like all other records. \n NOTE: The police in the USA under the patriot and crimes act can access almost any data, record or file with a warrant, the patriot allows some to be accessed without warrants :( \n So no saying that maintaining lists of gun owners is invasion of privacy, because police have the right to access any potential evidence in investiagation.\n \n In summary:\n Gun prohibition in America is an awful idea, it simply will not work, especially given the population size in the USA.\n The real solution? firstly, gun law would have to go back to federal government because the states will never have identical gun laws otherwise (which is essential for equality purposes), then if you want to get rid of guns, you need to work in phases by slowly introducing more restrictions (like the ones we have in Aus) and carefully rewording the second amendment.\n \n However if you took a referendum to change the USA constitution to take out the right to arms, I think you'd find a majority no vote. So in support of Democracy, no gun bans. Come live in Aus to escape the guns! :D",

   "Some more things I have against being required to register guns...\n \n First, the idea that you should be required to display a genuine \"need\" for ownership in the first place. In none of the other amendments is this at all necessary; you don't need to justify why you chose to switch to Catholicism, you don't need to justify why you want to hold a protest, you don't need to justify why you don't want to let the police search your home without a warrant, you don't need to justify why you shouldn't be charged for the same crime you were acquitted of, etc. so why is it that when we get to the concept of gun ownership you should be required to display a justified and recognized need for owning a gun?\n \n Second, New York City for example, is notorious with their licensing and registration system, and have been known to take months and even years before finally letting someone actually get their license to own a gun. The NYC police have full authority to delay the registration system for as long as they want, and can deny you at any point and for any reason. Unless you're going to set it up so the police are required to issue a license to absolutely anyone who qualifies, in a time span that doesn't exceed more than one month at the most, then you're just setting the people up to be under the thumb of the city but not under their protection.\n \n And then there's what Washington DC did with their gun registration scheme. The district set it up so only registered handguns could be legally owned, and in 1976 they declared that they would no longer allow for the registration of handguns to take place, making it a defacto ban on handguns, which took 32 years to finally put an end to. What's to stop a similar scheme from happening anywhere else?\n \n Third, registration systems can be easily defeated. Ballistic databases, for example, can be fooled by applying scratches to the inside of the gun barrel after it's already been registered, or just switching the barrel out entirely. The hilarious part is that scratching up the bore, or changing the barrel out, is a perfectly legal practice and often occurs from cleaning practices, so the only way to prevent it is to outlaw firing guns under any circumstances.\n \n Then there's the new concept of microstamping, where the brass case has the gun's serial number imprinted on it during firing. This is quite stupid and easily defeatable by running a piece of sandpaper across the firing pin and any other location that might have the identifying marks. Let's face it, criminals are far from stupid, they read newspapers and watch CNN like everybody else. If they got word that this system would be set up then they could avoid it by simply sticking to the old guns, defacing the firing pins, or by gathering brass from a shooting range (which is known for leaving large piles on the ground) and having an assortment of cases at the crime scene for the police to search through. Or the criminals could just do what we handloaders do and actually pick up our brass so there's nothing left behind; no cases at the scene = microstamping is a failure.\n \n Fourth is the fact that the application process could be set up in such a way that absolutely nobody could qualify for ownership, which is another defacto ban. There's nothing to keep it from happening, so don't even say \"Oh that won't be done, there's no unfairness in the world\".",

Their liscenses were supposed to be good indefinately or until revoked, but as I said, people were not notified. And the reason for the revocations was because of a change in the law that affected only certain people who had certain types of guns. And even though the state was at fault because of the failure to notify these people, the state took the old stance that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and they are prosecuting these people.

   "First, the idea that you should be required to display a genuine \"need\" for ownership in the first place. In none of the other amendments is this at all necessary; you don't need to justify why you chose to switch to Catholicism, you don't need to justify why you want to hold a protest, you don't need to justify why you don't want to let the police search your home without a warrant, you don't need to justify why you shouldn't be charged for the same crime you were acquitted of, etc. so why is it that when we get to the concept of gun ownership you should be required to display a justified and recognized need for owning a gun?\n \n Second, New York City for example, is notorious with their licensing and registration system, and have been known to take months and even years before finally letting someone actually get their license to own a gun. The NYC police have full authority to delay the registration system for as long as they want, and can deny you at any point and for any reason. Unless you're going to set it up so the police are required to issue a license to absolutely anyone who qualifies, in a time span that doesn't exceed more than one month at the most, then you're just setting the people up to be under the thumb of the city but not under their protection.\n \n And then there's what Washington DC did with their gun registration scheme. The district set it up so only registered handguns could be legally owned, and in 1976 they declared that they would no longer allow for the registration of handguns to take place, making it a defacto ban on handguns, which took 32 years to finally put an end to. What's to stop a similar scheme from happening anywhere else?\n \n Third, registration systems can be easily defeated. Ballistic databases, for example, can be fooled by applying scratches to the inside of the gun barrel after it's already been registered, or just switching the barrel out entirely. The hilarious part is that scratching up the bore, or changing the barrel out, is a perfectly legal practice and often occurs from cleaning practices, so the only way to prevent it is to outlaw firing guns under any circumstances.\n \n Fourth is the fact that the application process could be set up in such a way that absolutely nobody could qualify for ownership, which is another defacto ban. There's nothing to keep it from happening, so don't even say \"Oh that won't be done, there's no unfairness in the world\".[/QUOTE]\n \n 1. The \"reason\" it's necessary for guns is because they are DEADLY weapons in the same category under (AUS) law as combat knives, high powered lasers and explosives. Also why do you \"need\" a gun? That's the first assumption in Aussie law regarding guns. Police; need guns, the Army; need guns, Average people; do not need guns. Civilized people do not have a necessity to defend themselves with a weapon of deadly force. Most police will tell you it's better to give in to the demands of criminals, then report them to the police rather than risk a fight (or firefight in this case) that could leave the victim seriously injured or dead.\n 2. If the police have a reason not to let you have a gun, they won't delay it. They'll just insist you don't meet requirements. And if the police don't want an individual to have a gun, then said individual probably does not meet the requirements anyway.\n 3. Washington DC is a perfect example of why such laws really should be either federal or identical laws across all states to prevent inconsistancy.\n Also the thing that stops this from happening is that democratic processes will prevent such \"defacto\" bans being introduced. All laws do have to be passed, they don't just show up.\n 4. Registration systems and microstamping will still catch less crafty criminals (and there are plenty) and it will also catch non pre-meditated crimes out. In addition evidence that a gun has been modified in this way may prove pre-meditation in court.\n 5. Again popular protest and democratic processes prevent things like this from happening and any lawmaker who tried would be committing political suicide as sneaky tactics like this generally don't fly with voters. Also the whole point of the difficult registration scheme in Australia is to restrict the amount of gun ownership (which works better than bans). \n \n It restricts gun ownership by ensuring that all gun owners fall under 3 categories; Those who need guns for their recreation of choice, police and armed forces and criminals. People who don't need guns, don't have them because it's not worth the trouble of getting one. In America I can get a gun with no hassle, so why not get one? The idea is that people have no real need for guns so they should not be allowed to possess them without a valid reason to do so.\n \n Oh and FYI protests do need to be justified or the police will arrest you for disturbing the peace and usually you do justify to police why you don't want them to search your home because a refusal is usually pretty suspicious. \n \n Gun ownership must be justified!",

If you get a political rally worked up just right then you've got a riot on your hands and a lot of people are gonna get hurt and killed by angry protesters. That's why the police always have to be called out when somebody's holding a protest, no matter how peaceful, but the police almost never have to be called to a gun range just because the patrons are shooting.\n \n And another thing.

What do TGC members in Australia do about the bans on semi-auto and pump action firearms?\n \n \nIn America I can get a gun with no hassle, so why not get one?\n\n \n Because you don't have $500 to spend and there's no dealer in town?\n \n \nThe idea is that people have no real need for guns so they should not be allowed to possess them without a valid reason to do so.\n\n \n Valid reason by who's decision?

How does gun registration and licsensing, bullistic fingerprinting, microstamping, purchase limits, waiting periods, having to show a good reason for owning a gun, no carry concealed permits, and making a person who kills in self defense a criminal even sound reasonable. Not to mention convicting a person for not reporting a stolen or lost gun within twenty four hours of it being lost or stolen. People dont check their guns daily to see if it has been stolen or not, so how are they supposed to report it within the timeframe specified. You keep saying you are not against gun ownership, but everything you post is just the opposite. We dont need any more gun control, what we need is the full enforcement of existing gun laws, and the creation and enforcement of laws addressing the use of a gun in a crime. And if a person has had treatment for a mental disorder, they should be given a mandatory psych exam by a neautral doctor before being denied on a gun purchase. I myself have had to see a psychiatrist, and I was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. After living with the diagnosis for four years and taking meds the whole time, I was reevaluated and told the bipolar thing was a misdiagnosis by the original doctor. And for those for years under the misdiagnosis, I was not able to obtain a carry concealed licsense. And this denial was based on what someone thought I might do, even though I already had guns and had not commited any crimes. I think a lot of laws need to be strengthened, enforced fully, and some rewritten because they are general instead of specific.",

   "Tsk tsk I go away for a few days and you silly Americans devolve into insulting, misinterpreting and contradicting each other ;) \n (I kid, I kid, I'm just being silly)\n \n Hollyh brings fresh argument to this thread with her international and UK experiences. Unfortunately Hollyh far as I know the American Constitution (like the Aussie one) needs a countrywide vote (called a referendum) for any change to the constitution. The President and the Cabinet can only present the bill (amendment).\n \n I heard mention from Grizzly of an offer to give up free speech in exchange for the right to bear arms as well. We did that here in AUS, our constitution contains no Bill of Rights at all! That's right NONE! We have no freedom of speech, no right to guns that are protected by constitution. \n \n So how do we poor, poor Aussies live without any freedoms or rights?\n We pull together and write more specific laws and then combine that with a constitutional clause that basically says \"anything not prohibited by law is legal\". So instead of free speech we have laws against racism, inciting hatred, discrimination etc then anything not prohibited you are well within rights to say. Instead of a right to guns we have laws prohibiting them unless you prove conclusively that you need one for sporting activities or recreational activities, and even then there are more laws controlling how they are sold, transported, stored, tracked, marked and when they can be fired. \n \n It doesn't have to be a right. \n American's are all seemingly under the impression that the ownership of a deadly weapon that has no use besides killing and target shooting is some kind of inalienable freakin right! \n Again I say why do you need guns so badly?\n \n Defending yourself just lands you in jail, sued or at the least in a lengthy and expensive court process to prove self-defence (the hardest defence in the legal system to prove).\n \n The mere threat of other people having guns does not deter the deranged, the suicidal, the psychotic, those in a rage, and those who are just plain mad. \n Yeah there are other weapons out there like Kitchen knives and wood chopping axes but these actually have other uses, necessary uses and therefore can't be compared to guns. In aus we have knife control as well anyway. As well as controls on power tools. \n \n In Australia the only ones armed in public are the Police. You know who everyone fears? The cops, with gun control the Police become more than twice as formidable because they're the ones with the guns. Police should be respected and this is how they command respect; Authority and means of enforcement. \n \n I keep hearing that Criminals have access to guns anyway from Omega, well Omega with our Australian gun control there has been a dramatic drop in the guns in circulation that crooks can steal (wonder why?). And with regards to the Black Market, its not something you find in a nearby alleyway and comparatively very few criminals (pretty much only organized crime) have real access to guns. And since people and criminals alike have fewer guns then the Police don't have to use their guns much at all. I watch my local news every day and read the paper and the police actually needing to use their guns for more that threatening criminals makes damn page 2 articles its that rare, doesn't that sound wonderful? Police not having to shoot their guns to stop criminals?\n \n A recent example of how gun control really saved a situation check out something that happened in Sydney recently thats not too unlike the School attacks that have resulted in massacres in the USA\n (sorry apparently I need 10 posts to link so copy+paste to browser and take out the spaces)\n http: //www . theaustralian. news.com. au/story/0,,23503767-13881,00.html\n \n Imagine how much worse an attack like this would be if these boys had guns instead of just blunt weapons? This could've been a Columbine scale massacre, but it wasn't because these criminals (who would have been able to acquire guns if they were in the USA) only had less deadly weapons and nobody was killed or even seriously injured as a result. \n These are the kinds of criminals we're taking about, those who aren't super intelligent evil geniuses or mob bosses or hitmen. Just regular people with problems they (wongly) try to solve with violence. The people like the ones in this article whom if they had guns would have killed someone like the teacher who heroically stood up to them or the girl they assaulted, or the guy they were looking for.\n \n Gun control works Americans, get used to it. Every other part of the western world thinks so. \n I've also heard Omega ask for how we can control guns without affecting him and stopping criminals at the same time, well Omega, we can't or rather shouldn't. Maybe you gun owners should shoulder some responsibility and get rid of your guns for a greater good than your own selfish need for guns (even if that selfish need is wanting to be the hero who stops the bad guy).\n Selfish American.\n \n You wanna know what a post-gun America would be like? Go to any European country that used to have guns. You may find they're doing wonderfully.\n \n Guns are not a right, they are a great privilege. \n Hang up the guns end the violence!\n If everyone has guns, eventually everyone gets shot!",

The new laws established a gun offender registry, required city gun dealers to inspect their inventories and file reports to the police twice a year, and limited individual handgun purchases to once every 90 days. The regulations also banned the use and sale of kits used to paint guns in bright or fluorescent colors, on the grounds that such kits could be used to disguise real guns as toys.\n\n Murder rate in London = 156 murders for population of 7,355,400 = 2.12 per 100,000 people (figures from the Met and wikipedia.\n Murder rate in New York = 7.3 murders per 100,000 people (figure from wikipedia).\n \n In short, New York is doing better than it used to, but part of the systems that have resulted in this is more gun control.

I'm asking how your belief that the government is all powerful, the people are ruled, and the Constitution is enforced against the people, is the correct interpretation that we should all be abiding by. \n\n Short answer: Occam's/Ockham's razor. Either rights are inalienable and absolute, or the simply don't exist.\n \n Pragmatic answer: All 'rights' are granted by the state, because the state controls the power. As such, all rights come from the state. As such, all rights are privileges - they are subject to summary removal by those with the power (ie - the state). I'm not talking about what 'should be', I'm talking about what is. If the Administration decides that it is in the best interests of the Nation to suspend some 'human rights' then it will do so, and your guns will not stop them. They might prove an influencing factor, but by no means would they be a deciding vote.\n \n In-depth answer: If you want to talk about how things 'should be', two points of view. \n From the trusting-the-government point of view, removable rights is a benefit because a competent government will grant those 'rights' up until the moment when it becomes harmful for those 'rights' to be followed, at which point the removability of said rights is a bonus to security. The US government already does this, to a certain extent - Gitmo and The Patriot Act\n are extremes, but even preventing felons from bearing arms or banning child pornography are infringes on 'inalienable rights'. Justified indeed, but more evidence that there is no such thing as an absolute.\n From the not-trusting-the-government point of view, the fact that a right must be justified in order for it to be maintained is a bonus for those who consider the government to be unjustly granting or removing rights. If there was an amendment to the constitution that you did not approve of, on what grounds would you argue against it once the Supreme Court has spoken? Not treating the Constitution as some sort of Absolute Scripture allows for critical analysis of it, which is always useful.\n \n Finally (for now), I would say that which I have said before. If you want to do something, and you cannot justify that action beyond the fact that \"It's a right!\", your argument for doing that thing is nothing more than an appeal to authority - to that which you consider to be true (your opinions on what a 'right' is). As such, removing the grounds by which many people consider an appeal to authority to be a valid argument can only be a good thing, if for nothing other than aiding the cause against intellectual dishonesty.",

They print the money, they make the laws and they control the armed forces.\n \n So what stops them from abusing their terrible power here in Aus? Why don't they just take our freedoms and take anyone who objects away to their \"secret torture facility\"? \n \n The answer is that people in government are still people, people like you and me that are trusted, upstanding members of society who know the difference between right and wrong and are not about to seize power and declare a police state. You may find this hard to fathom but people don't become politicians to achieve world domination and immense wealth, they do it to serve the public, the greater good of those around them. \n \n Long story short, politicians tend not to turn places into Police states because they know its a bad idea and inherently wrong.\n \n Moving on to less blatantly foolish arguments:\n In response to what Omega said about my last post\n 1. Yeah these criminals do need counseling\n 2. They would have killed if they had deadly weapons, a gun dispatches that heroic teacher easier than a blunt object and they were there to perform a \"job\" on a particular student; presumably to kill him.\n 3. The thing about people handing in their guns is no not everybody will, but most will, this is about taking deadly force away from innocents and the untrained (i.e. the Army and Police are \"trained\" in this sense).\n 4. The stuff about self defence being a bad idea with a gun actually does extend to the US. In the USA you can only use self-defence as a legal defence in court if your attacker had a better weapon than you and only automatic weapons and explosives rank above a handgun on the legal scale, so yes the humble handgun really does make a crappy self-defense mechanism cos chances are you'll wind up in jail for it emoticon_ic\n \n 5. The police stance is not \"fear me or i'll shoot you\" that is the worst extrapolation I've ever heard. The Police are still subject to self-defence laws and only ever use their guns as a threat, because they'll be taken to court themselves if they use their guns for purposes other than express self-defence against more heavily armed criminals. In general the fact that the Police are the only ones in public with visible guns enhances their authoritativeness (a guy with a gun who won't use it is still scarier than a guy with no gun). \n Also on a patriotic note: Don't you ####ing dare insult the Australian Police Force again by comparing them to thuggish tools of government oppression! emoticon_angry\n \n 6. You'd be lucky to find one Aussie who thinks we've gone down the tubes following our gun ban. Why? Because we've never had a right to guns, duh!\n It's not a gun ban to us. To us deadly weapons are illegal. You might some in organised crime rings who don't like the gun restrictions in Aus, thats about it. Oh and some US tourists\\residents complain about it.\n \n Also seriously put a can on this dumb argument about \"it IS a right in the USA, get used to it\". Rights can be changed, suspended etc with a fancy new law or a (shock horror!) amendment to the constitution (OMG REALLY?!).\n \n All it takes usually is a national vote on the passing of the amendment.\n \n Trouble with America is that most people would be too selfish about keeping their precious guns to vote yes on any amendment to remove the right to arms from the constitution.\n \n And on a serious note; things like the gun laws in America are what makes Americans somewhat of a laughing stock around the world. Don't believe me? You know alot of South and Central America resent the people of the USA being called \"Americans\" because the term americans technically encapsulates them as well and they really don't like being associated.\n Hell this whole Gun laws thing is just like the slavery thing, \n Lincoln removed slavery because:\n 1. It was wrong\n 2. Other countries were leaning on the US to abolish slavery and Lincoln felt it was an embarrassment that the US maintained such backwards laws.\n \n Gun rights were all very well and good when you needed Militia's to help defend against British aggression in the war for independence. But they are simply outdated and downright dumb by today's standards and are only being kept (like slavery) because of selfish people who won't give them up. \n I can only hope it doesn't take another Civil war or presidential assassination to overturn these archaic laws\n \n end of rant\n *awaits Omega's careful deconstruction of rant written around midnight after poring over History essay for hours*",

Not only wrong but foolish. Every single government in history has eventually become tyrannical. That is the nature of government. I believe it is sometimes done with good intentions, but that does not change the fact that every single tyrannical government in the history of the world was brought into being by politicians, and that every single government that has ever existed had eventually turned tyrant.

All you have to show in order for \"self defense\" to work as a defense is that a REASONABLE PERSON would have felt they were either in mortal peril or that there was significant risk of bodily injury. It is not necessarily illegal to shoot an unarmed person if that criteria is met. There was a case not long ago right nere in my home state where a 100 lb woman shot a 250 lb man in a parking lot. He was unarmed, but it did not matter because any reasonable person is going to see a risk of mortal injury or bodily harm if you put a 100 lb woman against a 250 lb man in a boxing match. \n \n Frankly your understanding of this is just plain stupid.

In general the fact that the Police are the only ones in public with visible guns enhances their authoritativeness (a guy with a gun who won't use it is still scarier than a guy with no gun). \n Also on a patriotic note: Don't you ####ing dare insult the Australian Police Force again by comparing them to thuggish tools of government oppression! emoticon_angry\n\n \n Wrong....and like the above shows a complete and total lack of understanding of...well....pretty much everything. The only tool that government actually has is a monopoly on the use of force. That is quite literally what a government is...a body brought together to monopolize and control the use of force. It has been this way since the first group of humans banded together for protection against wild animals and attack from other people. \n \n \nAlso seriously put a can on this dumb argument about \"it IS a right in the USA, get used to it\". Rights can be changed, suspended etc with a fancy new law or a (shock horror!) amendment to the constitution (OMG REALLY?!).\n \n All it takes usually is a national vote on the passing of the amendment.\n\n \n No, actually it takes a lot more than that. I have often said, however, that if people want to ban guns or heavily restrict them, a constitutional amendment is the way to go. Passing gun laws that are clearly unconstitutional based on logic that is clearly nonsensical is dishonest. \n \n \nTrouble with America is that most people would be too selfish about keeping their precious guns to vote yes on any amendment to remove the right to arms from the constitution.\n\n \n The problem there is that this has been discussed before (in fact removing a couple of other rights from the bill of rights has been discussed before) and it cannot be done without invalidating the constitution. Our entire society is (supposedly) based on a theory of natural rights. In fact, the entire concept of a \"right\" is that it IS natural...you get it simply for being born. The bill of rights does not grant any rights, it recognizes rights that were considered to be pre-existing. You cannot remove a right that the government did not grant. In theory they could decide they were no longer going to recognize the right, but that would not make it legal for them to do so. \n \n This has been an issue several times in the history of the US and basically there is no legal way to remove something from the bill of rights. It cannot be done, and doing so would invalidate the entire constitution. \n \n \nGun rights were all very well and good when you needed Militia's to help defend against British aggression in the war for independence. But they are simply outdated and downright dumb by today's standards and are only being kept (like slavery) because of selfish people who won't give them up. \n I can only hope it doesn't take another Civil war or presidential assassination to overturn these archaic laws\n\n \n Only if you assume that for some reason todays governments will not follow the lead of every other government in the history of the planet and end up turning on its people. Frankly, I dont think a case can be made for that.",

   "Omega, perhaps the deadly combination of people who would use a gun and possess a gun is what hollyh is scared of?\n\n \n If that were the case then she should've said so.\n \n \nI'm generally afraid of anyone who finds reason to arm themselves, especially the police.\n\n \n What for?\n \n \nAlso on this forum I've noticed mentions of \"what's stopping the government then from invading my privacy?\" \n You know what, in the end no dumb 300 year old piece of paper, or a supreme court or any other check or balance will stop the big bad government. They print the money, they make the laws and they control the armed forces.\n \n So what stops them from abusing their terrible power here in Aus? Why don't they just take our freedoms and take anyone who objects away to their \"secret torture facility\"?\n\n \n Well if nothing is stopping them then what's keeping them from doing it now?\n \n \nThe answer is that people in government are still people,\n\n \n Ever hear the old saying \"power corrupts\"?\n \n When it gets to the point that they can have guards armed with machineguns for their own protection, they're no longer normal people and shouldn't be seen as such.\n \n \npeople like you and me that are trusted, upstanding members of society who know the difference between right and wrong and are not about to seize power and declare a police state. You may find this hard to fathom but people don't become politicians to achieve world domination and immense wealth, they do it to serve the public, the greater good of those around them.\n\n \n So...people like you or me can be trusted to make the correct decision on a subject like stem cell research or abortion or the death penalty, but we can't be trusted to carry a gun?\n \n \nMoving on to less blatantly foolish arguments:\n In response to what Omega said about my last post\n\n \n Oh it's on.\n \n \n1. Yeah these criminals do need counseling\n\n \n No! Somebody who wants to hurt and kill doesn't need counseling to help them sort through their muddled emotions, they need to be confined away from others! The VT killer didn't need counseling, he needed to be forcibly institutionalized and kept with the other psycho killers. This new age BS of \"Deranged killers and rapists are just troubled individuals who need to sort out where they are in life\" is what gets people killed!\n \n \n2. They would have killed if they had deadly weapons, a gun dispatches that heroic teacher easier than a blunt object and they were there to perform a \"job\" on a particular student; presumably to kill him.\n\n \n Funny, I don't ever remember a case where a man couldn't be charged with \"assault with a deadly weapon\" when they used a crowbar on somebody. I don't remember the police or the courts saying \"We can't charge them with assault with the deadly weapon because they weren't armed with a gun\".\n \n And another thing, your entire position is offensive to anyone that's ever lost a family member that had their skull bashed in with a blunt instrument. Surely those that die of bludgeoning deserve some consideration, right? \n \n \n3. The thing about people handing in their guns is no not everybody will, but most will, this is about taking deadly force away from innocents and the untrained (i.e. the Army and Police are \"trained\" in this sense).\n\n \n Taking away from the innocents. Did you even hear what you just said?\n \n And another thing, not everybody that's honest would turn in their guns, a good number of them would keep them from confiscation and hide them. If guns were ever banned in this state I would refuse to turn them in for destruction, making me the block king because I'd still be armed.\n \n That's the problem with these gun laws, they rely wholly on the honor system to work, and if people don't want to abide by the honor system then they're useless.\n \n \n4. The stuff about self defence being a bad idea with a gun actually does extend to the US. In the USA you can only use self-defence as a legal defence in court if your attacker had a better weapon than you and only automatic weapons and explosives rank above a handgun on the legal scale, so yes the humble handgun really does make a crappy self-defense mechanism cos chances are you'll wind up in jail for it emoticon_ic\n\n \n Then find me a case of a homeowner being found guilty of murder, for shooting and killing somebody that broke into their home and was armed only with a crowbar. Show me that this argument of yours is how it really works, because I've read the Castle Doctrine legislation that's being passed in numerous states, and these laws leave absolutely no room for what you've just proposed.\n \n \n5. The police stance is not \"fear me or i'll shoot you\" that is the worst extrapolation I've ever heard. The Police are still subject to self-defence laws and only ever use their guns as a threat, because they'll be taken to court themselves if they use their guns for purposes other than express self-defence against more heavily armed criminals. In general the fact that the Police are the only ones in public with visible guns enhances their authoritativeness (a guy with a gun who won't use it is still scarier than a guy with no gun).\n\n \n You said the police command respect by being armed while everyone else isn't.\n \n \nAlso on a patriotic note: Don't you ####ing dare insult the Australian Police Force again by comparing them to thuggish tools of government oppression! emoticon_angry\n\n \n And don't assume to tell us what is and isn't a right in this country, and don't question why we \"need\" our rights.\n \n \n6. You'd be lucky to find one Aussie who thinks we've gone down the tubes following our gun ban. Why? Because we've never had a right to guns, duh! It's not a gun ban to us. To us deadly weapons are illegal. You might some in organised crime rings who don't like the gun restrictions in Aus, thats about it. Oh and some US tourists\\residents complain about it.\n\n \n Well then I must be damn lucky because I do know them.\n \n \nAlso seriously put a can on this dumb argument about \"it IS a right in the USA, get used to it\". Rights can be changed, suspended etc with a fancy new law or a (shock horror!) amendment to the constitution (OMG REALLY?!).\n\n \n That may be true, but it just can't happen at the drop of a hat or in the blink of an eye. It takes a real and considerable effort to change the Constitution and take away rights. One single killing isn't justification for the kind of #### you and the UK have put up with.\n \n \nTrouble with America is that most people would be too selfish about keeping their precious guns to vote yes on any amendment to remove the right to arms from the constitution.\n\n \n Just because you people don't have rights, don't assume to tell us that we're selfish for not wanting to give up what we hold as important.\n \n \nAnd on a serious note; things like the gun laws in America are what makes Americans somewhat of a laughing stock around the world. Don't believe me? You know alot of South and Central America resent the people of the USA being called \"Americans\" because the term americans technically encapsulates them as well and they really don't like being associated.\n\n \n Then tell them to change the name of their countries.\n \n \nHell this whole Gun laws thing is just like the slavery thing, \n Lincoln removed slavery because:\n 1. It was wrong\n 2. Other countries were leaning on the US to abolish slavery and Lincoln felt it was an embarrassment that the US maintained such backwards laws.\n\n \n Are you saying that owning guns is like owning slaves?\n \n \nGun rights were all very well and good when you needed Militia's to help defend against British aggression in the war for independence. But they are simply outdated and downright dumb by today's standards and are only being kept (like slavery) because of selfish people who won't give them up. \n I can only hope it doesn't take another Civil war or presidential assassination to overturn these archaic laws\n\n \n ########! There's absolutely no proof that the concept of being armed is an outdated idea by today's standards.",

   "Ever hear the phrase false dichotomy?\n \n Poor you, so vehement yet so clueless.\n\n \n Well let's look at it this way. If people aren't proposing laws that will lock up murderers and rapists and robbers for long periods of time, then obviously they're afraid of the tool, and that's just plain wrong. People with hoplophobia can be ruled by a single person with a crowbar or butcher knife. They're nothing but sheep.\n \n People who fear the object need serious mental help. People who're projecting their fears onto an inanimate object and making it seem to have a consciousness and an evil nature need psychiatric help.\n \n \nHolly's got it nailed, yet in your continuing mindless advocacy of vigilantism you can't/won't see the point.\n\n \n How many times do I have to tell you before you get it? It's not vigilantism when they're coming after you. It's only vigilantism when you hunt people down to kill them, when you knowingly go looking for trouble.\n \n An example of vigilantism is going to a known gang hangout and murdering them in cold blood. But shooting and killing your mugger or attempted rapist is not the same.\n \n \nIt terrifies me as well to walk down the street not knowing what loony has a gun and will not hesitate to use it at any time for any reason or for no reason at all.\n\n \n You suffer from extreme paranoia and are in need of therapy as much as Holly.\n \n \nMaybe you think the shootout at the OK corral was justified,\n\n \n The OK corral was between lawmen and criminals, and the lawmen won.\n \n \nmaybe you think Clint Eastwood and Rambo folms are documentaries,\n\n \n You do realize the guy that plays Rambo endorses anti-gun laws, while at the same time possessing a concealed carry permit, right?\n \n \nmaybe you are a secret Maoist who, like your idol the Chairman, believes that all power comes out of the barrel of a gun, but I can assure you that there are millions of people who disagree.\n\n \n And maybe you're the kind of person who believes that if we could just get rid of every last gun ever created then all the evil and hatred and unfairness in the world would just disappear.

If you were in favor of controlling the criminals, or better yet taking them out of the general population, then it would be more reasonable.

Do you use it for sport ... Why do you need to carry it around in public?\n \n Just trying to understand your position.\n\n \n Alright.\n \n Why exactly this right is so important isn't an easy question to answer, there's a lot of areas that it covers that I'm just not able to answer over the net; it just doesn't translate. But I'll take a stab at it.\n \n Why is the Second Amendment so important? Why do we fight so hard to protect it? Because Many of us see it as the most important of rights in the Constitution. No other right has been the target of so much infringing legislation as the Second Amendment, none has been so fiercely hated and ridiculed. There's all this talk about the Second Amendment being out of date in today's world, how it's a holdover from Colonial times, how it's useless because handguns can't stop tanks, etc.\n \n Here's the thing about all that BS; if it can be determined that the Second Amendment is truly out of date, and that it can simply be bypassed by a single bill, what's going to stop the same fate from following all the other Amendments? Last I checked Amendments 1-10 were all written at the same time and by the exact same people, all made as integral parts of a single document. So if one can be ruled as out of date and no longer relevant, what could really prevent the same Amendments from being ruled as \"out of date\" and swept away like nothing?\n \n Think about it, the Second Amendment is a part of our founding document, the document by which the government is judged and confined. If we start poking holes in what is and isn't relevant any longer, how exactly are we ensuring that the rest remains strong enough to resist destruction? This isn't a pick and choose matter as far as I can see.\n \n Why do I own a gun? Because this is a dangerous world, and there are times when non-lethal is simply a non-option, and I don't want to find myself in a position where somebody is threatening my life and all I have is a defensive item that's simply making him madder and more inclined to kill me.\n \n I dislike methods of defense that rely on a chemical reaction. You never can tell just how long a can of pepperspray was sitting in a warehouse before it was shipped out, and how long it was sitting on a store shelf before you picked it. Pepperspray loses its effectiveness as it gets older, and I don't want to find out what I bought was 10 years old at the time.\n \n Don't even get me started on stunning devices. Stunguns are so compact that you literally have to get within stabbing distance to use them, and if I have to be so close to the guy that I can view his dental work then I'd rather have something that can slice tendons and render him immobile. And tasers? Tasers cost $5-600 easy, that's as much as a regular handgun, and you only get one shot and if you miss with that one shot then you're screwed. Not even the .357 Magnum, a hallmark of stopping power in handgun cartridges, can guarantee a drop everytime in one shot, so why should I trust my life to one shot with a taser.\n \n Am I likely to face the significant risk of being murdered in a violent fashion? Probably not, I've probably only got a 1 in 10,000 chance of needing my gun at any given time. But wouldn't you like to have access to it if that chance ever did come up? You're more likely to die from a bee sting than a shark bite, but we still get out of the water anytime that dorsal fin appears.\n \n This isn't a nice world, there's no glossing over that fact. No country is perfect and a safe haven where the people are free from the risk of harm, that's simply an indisputable fact of life. The bad guys aren't going to play by the rules, so I'm gonna want things to be as even as possible between me and the person seeking to make me a victim.\n \n And despite the claim of others, I've seen no proof that taking away rights will make anyone safer or make things any harder for criminals. So I don't believe that the loss of rights should see continued use as a suggested tool of combating crime and violence.",

   "Thank you for actually speaking to me, without insulting me, i appreciate your opinions when they are delivered to me to digest not personaly defend.\n \n Can you tell me why you like this right so much, what is it about you owing a gun that you wish to protect. Do you use it for sport ... Why do you need to carry it around in public?\n \n Just trying to understand your position.\n\n \n I know you have already had one response to this, but I will add mine. I own and use guns for many reasons, I hunt, I enjoy shooting at targets, I feel safer in my home and in my pickup, and as I have a concealed carry licsense, I feel safer in public. Most people do not go looking for crime, crime finds them. Carrying a gun in public is a lot like building a tornado shelter at my home, I probably wont ever be hit by a tornado, but if I am and because I was prepared for it, my chances for survival are greatly increased. The right to keep and bear arms is a right that can do one thing none of the other 9 rights can do, it can save your life.",

   "That doesn't answer the question of how exactly the courts get to be superior in terms of authority to the government. How do the courts get to have final say if people have no legal protections against the government? Why would courts even exist if there are no rights but only privileges that it itself grants?\n \n Can you explain that to me, why do courts that rule on government action taken against the people, exist if the people have no legal protections except what the government provides them?\nSee 'separation of powers'.\n \n In the US, the legislative branch makes all the rules, and the judicial branch \"judges when a law is unconstitutional\". In the UK, the legislative branch (parliament) makes the laws, and the judicial branch (in my words) \"judges when a law is bloody stupid\".\n \n \nCase in point, this whole debate could be taken as a highlight of how logic varies between individuals. To you the idea of going by logical arguments rather than a founding document makes sense, you believe that the founding document isn't needed because logic is used. to me that doesn't make sense, because as I've said logic varies widely between administrations and even individuals. If you don't have an instruction manual to guide your actions, then logic isn't going to be of much help at all, and to me the Constitution asks as a sort of instruction manual on how to run the government.\n\n Instruction manual, I have no issue with. Absolute rulebook, I can see will lead to problems, notably the inflexibility and intellectual dishonesty as mentioned before. Is the constitution mild guidelines, or absolute truth (in your eyes)? If it's just minor guidelines, then why fuss about removing a 'right' if there is logical argument for it?\n \n EDIT: With regards to the other arguments since your post... A taser is much more likely to put someone down with one shot because it doesn't act like a bullet. And if 'putting them down' is your issue, why not by a hunting rifle and load it with fast-acting tranq darts?\n \n Effectively, you (and grizzly) have voiced the argument I suspected to be true - that guns have a effect on you in that they make you feel safer. However, I would argue that this is a placebo effect, given that there is more gun violence than gun defence. A gun is no more than putting the covers over your head to hide you from the monsters.",

I would guess that the average police officer would far prefer to be shot at by a non-lethal implement, and this further gives the public defence against criminals who are (for some unknown reason) bullet-proof.\n \n EDIT: Grizzly posted\n \nThis whole post is false and doesnt hold any weight, the estimated number of guns in the hands of private citizens is estimated to be about 250,000,000. If there are 250,000 incidents per year involving guns being used badly(crime, suicides, and accidental shootings), then how do you figure that the malority of privately owned firearms are used in crimes, or used irresponsibly. Again, you anti-gun people want to exagerate the numbers and statistics to your advantage, and throw in a few lies for good measure.\nSee the appropriate thread.\n \n \nAnother fact for you, if you manage to get guns banned, it could actually end up costing you or one of your loved ones their job, because there would be massive layoffs and buisinesses would go under. Maybe your job sells or manufactures a material that is used in the making of hunting apparell, and if there are no guns, there is no need for hunting apparrel, thus you or a loved one loose their jobs.\nDo you have any figures on the US gun industry? The best I could find was that in 1999 the US produced 4 million guns, and the number was falling fast due to international competition...\n \n I welcome your data.",

   "And if there's something 'better' for the police? They seem to favour tasers, although you don't...\n\n \n The police aren't issued tasers in an exclusive manner, suggesting that tasers only is a bad idea.\n \n \nSorry, probably my bad. I'm not suggesting such things are used now, I am simply stating that one could be developed - a non-lethal rapid-fire weapon such as one that only fired rubber bullets.\n\n \n We already have that, it's the pump action shotgun. But while police are issued beanbag and rubber rounds, they still get issued lead buckshot and slugs. And the fact that the police still get issued live ammunition, along with non-lethal ammunition, suggest to me that there are times when non-lethal is simply a non-option.\n \n \nReturn to the 'rights' argument already?\n\n \n No, I'm saying that you can't have freedom unless you have risk with it. The only way to have total security is total tyranny where there are absolutely no freedoms of any sort, and the government has the power to dictate every aspect of your life.\n \n \nThe point is, however, if I lived in the US I would be far more likely to be thinking \"I wish he didn't have a gun\" than \"I wish I did\".\n\n \n Lots of luck getting that first chain of thought to be what's going to come to pass.\n \n \nWas a gun originally made to defend yourself and your property, or to kill an enemy?\n\n \n Long gun or handgun?\n \n \nI would suggest that gun defence is the 'mis-use' of a deliberately lethal weapon.\n\n \n So...somebody tries to kill you, you kill them instead, that's misuse of a product?\n \n \nIf you don't agree, which I expect, I would say that if an item is misused more than it is properly used, it should be removed.\n\n \n Does that mean you're against the Internet because it's used by child pornographers?\n \n \nDo you need a gun to commit self-defence?\n\n \n It sure makes things easier. Do you need a ferrari to drive to work every morning?\n \n \nI have nothing against military and (to a large extent) police ownership of firearms. What I ear a grudge against is allowing the general public access to lethal weaponry on the grounds that 'its a right'.\n\n \n Military and police don't own weapons, they're issued to them for duty use.\n \n \nIt would - if there was mandatory training/testing for the lethal force, strict tabs were kept on who possessed the lethal force, and there were enough armed confrontations prevented by lethal force to warrant allowing it. Unfortunately, you don't want any of the first requirements and I don't think there's enough of the last.\n\n \n I've seen no evidence to support the concept that mandatory training has prevented any accidental shooting or killing incidents from occurring.\n \n \n \nA quick google shows that tasers can indeed pierce kevlar.\n\n \n Well then that's ground for banning them. At least if you believe all the hype about how our police are behind the 8-ball because criminals can steal rifles that penetrate their standard issue body armor.\n \n \nThey also show this awesome beasty... for police use only, currently.\n\n \n I've seen that on the Mossberg promotional commercials.\n \n \nHowever, this is plenty argument for my side, not for yours. I would guess that the average police officer would far prefer to be shot at by a non-lethal implement, and this further gives the public defence against criminals who are (for some unknown reason) bullet-proof.\n\n \n I don't know about that. If they're shot with a taser and their vest offers no protection against getting shocked, the the bad guy can taser them into submission and steal their gun then, then it's gonna be pretty bad for everybody involved.",

   "Man, you guys post way too much for me to quote.\n \n Firstly, it seems I need to repeat this. Because it is the one reason that seriously disinclines me from wanting to own a gun. OK, I am a Law student, I asked my prof about this one. I made sure, it is a legal doctrine Australia actually copied from America (Australian law tends to copy the most successful laws from around the world). A gun is a bad choice of self-defence mechanism.\n \n Using a gun in self-defence will see you arrested along with your attacker, or at the very least sued by your attacker. Because self-defence only qualifies as a legal defence if your opponent had a superior weapon and had intention to use it on you. If you are using a semi-automatic weapon (handgun) then the only way to prove self defence is if your opponent has an automatic weapon, a Semi-auto combat shotgun or an explosive of some definition. If he has the same weapon, then your sentence may be downgraded. \n \n However if you had a handgun and your opponent threatened you with a knife (not knowing you had a handgun on you) and then you shot him in self defence and he died. Then you would be convicted of anywhere between Involuntary Manslaughter or a Murder charge (not first degree). Which gives you a jail sentence, and a serious criminal record.\n \n let me just emphasise: This legal situation WOULD occur in America under American law. In Australia the same would occur except you would also be charged with possession of a deadly weapon. \n \n And I don't think I could live with the blood of another man on my hands. I wouldn't be able to live with killing another person, not even if it was justified. \n \n Also seriously Omega? You think (or joke) that south america should have its name changed if they don't like being associated with America? That is so blindingly arrogant and pretentious to say, even as a joke.\n \n Grizzly do not even try to throw an economic argument into this, if guns were banned then the gun industry would continue as it always has; making guns for the army, enforcement agencies and exportation. \n (I'm beginning to feel that Omega is the only one really worth listening to on the pro-gun side of this thread)\n Besides, going back to my first post a total gun ban is just silly. Target shooting is still a recognised sport and is even in the olympics, and civilians play it, if you banned guns you would ban target shooting. Then there's game hunting which is another reasonable use for guns.\n \n The idea in Australia with gun laws is so that only people who actually have a proven need for a gun can have one. Which is just: The police, target shooters, game hunters, the army and private security forces. And the laws also restrict how they are stored or used in order to prevent them from either falling into the wrong hands or being misused by legitimate owners.\n \n One more thing; There seems to be a great misunderstanding of my position from the pro-gun side. The idea of the mass gun turn in when gun restrictions are brought in is that you remove the guns from the hands of as many people as is possible, you often say you would shoot someone in self-defence, well gun confiscation would prevent you, the innocent civilian from becoming a criminal by killing another man (as explained above).\n \n OK I ALREADY KNEW THAT PRE-EXISTING CRIMINALS WILL NOT TURN IN THEIR GUNS ON THE HONOR SYSTEM, ENOUGH CONFUSION ON THAT MATTER!\n Now what we would do is with the bulk of citizens being nice law abiding people they would turn in their guns and that would remove a bulk of guns from the system, then through arrests, search warrants and normal police action the number of guns possessed by criminals and the public would reach a point where the number of criminals with guns would become so little that their overall threat would be insignificant enough for the Police to handle without regular people needing to shoot bad guys for them. \n \n Such a point has occurred in Australia, the amount of guns possessed by criminals pretty much boils down to the elite criminals (organised crime) and legal owners who don't follow the laws (legal guidelines) of gun use, protection (against theft) and storage. \n I heard the point about substituting one weapon for another (i.e. knives) which is valid. However in Australia possession of a combat knife is illegal and possession of a knife in public that is not in a locked container can see you charged once again with possession of a deadly weapon. And in addition you have to be 18 to purchase a knife that is large enough to kill. \n And after a recent scandal such \"deadly weapon\" laws were extended to cover lasers (of Class-3 or better) because some jerks were using class-3 lasers to blind pilots as they came in for landings at airports. (sorry I still don't have enough posts to link :( )\n The point is that you restrict not just guns, but rather any implement that can be considered deadly. The same laws go for ninja death stars, swords and even cordless power tools. \n It sounds restrictive, but keep in mind all you have to do is keep stuff at home (like knives and power tools) or any private property you own and you aren't violating possession laws. (no this does not mean you can shoot someone at home). \n \n It is rather complex with most weapons having different laws reagrding waht is legal possession and what isn't (mainly based on the reason you claim legal ownership of the weapon). For example it's legal to possess a sword for ornamental or historical antique purposes, however swords have a specific law saying they have to be kept blunt because you aren't meant to be using them to chop people up. \n \n Anyway. On to another point a couple of pages back: Omega mocked my saying that these criminals DO need counciling. Well they do, this particular case involved troubled youths who took drugs and lashed out. The thing about jail is that it's like university for Criminals, criminals most often come out of jail better criminals than when they went in. Here in Aus in particular there's an argument that Juvenile detention centers are actually offer better living standards for minors with bad parents or in poverty, so some actually try to get in on purpose. Think about it, Jail offers 3 square meals a day, running water, free accommodation, bed, entertainment. It's bad yeah, but for people at rock bottom jail is an improvement in living standard. The point here being that the focus in sentencing criminals should really focus on rehabilitating offenders not to commit such a crime again with jail being more for those who can't be rehabilitated (the remorseless) and being used in conjunction with counciling or psychiatric help to rehabilitate and punish in a double whammy.\n \n So much crime could be prevented with better psychological rehabilitation.\n So yeah maybe counciling is a better idea than jamming criminals in jail so they can become harder criminals later. \n Life sentences however can go without counciling ;)\n \n \n Anyway to close off a long, long rant: Guns are deadly, so are lots of other things, so controls should be placed on all of them (read: NOT bans). Guns in particular are designed with killing or serious injury in mind so they need more regulation than other potential weapons. And Guns make poor self defence mechanisms (see above) as well as the moral consequences of killing another human being.",

It is selfish of you to demand that criminals using guns be targeted in such that it in no way affects anyone besides criminals is affected. I have repeatedly outlined feasible deadly weapons control methods that exist and are effective in other countries, but they all inconvenience you because you would have no grounds for gun possession (except for sport). And as I have outlined almost any use of a gun in self-defence will make YOU a criminal because you have wounded or killed your fellow man.\n \n And we already have enough support Grizzly, the USA is the last 1st world country left that doesn't support gun restriction. The support of the combined 1st world is significant.\n And that doesn't even count how many are anti-gun within the USA.

I made sure, it is a legal doctrine Australia actually copied from America (Australian law tends to copy the most successful laws from around the world). A gun is a bad choice of self-defence mechanism.\n\n \n A lot of things have changed. What you say can happen in some states, but in others it's not the case anymore. A number of states have adopted the Castle Doctrine which does three things:\n \n 1. It states that you can use, up to and including, deadly force if you reasonably believe that you're facing imminent harm or death.\n \n 2. It clarifies that you don't have to flee if you have a right to be where you're at, at the time of the attack.\n \n 3. It shields you from civil lawsuits from the attacker or their families if the courts find that you did nothing wrong.\n \n \nUsing a gun in self-defence will see you arrested along with your attacker, or at the very least sued by your attacker. Because self-defence only qualifies as a legal defence if your opponent had a superior weapon and had intention to use it on you. If you are using a semi-automatic weapon (handgun) then the only way to prove self defence is if your opponent has an automatic weapon, a Semi-auto combat shotgun or an explosive of some definition. If he has the same weapon, then your sentence may be downgraded.\n\n \n I don't know. I've heard of people shooting criminals who're only armed with handguns, and they didn't face criminal charges because it was ruled as self-defense. Is that how it works in Australia? Because I never saw anywhere that you had to have less weapon than your attacker to be justified in using it. If that were the case then nobody would keep a rifle or shotgun as a home defense weapon because they'd automatically be found guilty on the grounds of use of excessive force.\n \n \nHowever if you had a handgun and your opponent threatened you with a knife (not knowing you had a handgun on you) and then you shot him in self defence and he died. Then you would be convicted of anywhere between Involuntary Manslaughter or a Murder charge (not first degree). Which gives you a jail sentence, and a serious criminal record.\n\n \n I can't remember seeing an example of this being the case. I don't remember somebody being found guilty when they shot a home intruder armed with a baseball bat. Maybe there are some cases of this occurring that you could present?\n \n \nlet me just emphasise: This legal situation WOULD occur in America under American law. In Australia the same would occur except you would also be charged with possession of a deadly weapon.\n\n \n I'd like to see some examples of this actually being the case. I'm not doubting that it can or has happened, but I'd like to see some examples.\n \n \nAnd I don't think I could live with the blood of another man on my hands. I wouldn't be able to live with killing another person, not even if it was justified.\n\n \n Some people don't have it in them, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n \n \nAlso seriously Omega? You think (or joke) that south america should have its name changed if they don't like being associated with America? That is so blindingly arrogant and pretentious to say, even as a joke.\n\n \n It's happened in the past. People don't want to be associated with what their ancestors did so they change their family name. We left Britain and King George and called ourselves Americans. If you don't want to be associated with a perceived hellhole, then don't share the name of the hellhole.\n \n \nGrizzly do not even try to throw an economic argument into this, if guns were banned then the gun industry would continue as it always has; making guns for the army, enforcement agencies and exportation.\n\n \n Don't be so sure. American sports and exhibition shooters fire hundreds of thousands of rounds every year to stay as good as they do. That's a lot of money that gets contributed to the economy.\n \n \n(I'm beginning to feel that Omega is the only one really worth listening to on the pro-gun side of this thread)\n\n \n Thanks!\n \n \nBesides, going back to my first post a total gun ban is just silly. Target shooting is still a recognised sport and is even in the olympics, and civilians play it, if you banned guns you would ban target shooting.

Which is just: The police, target shooters, game hunters, the army and private security forces. And the laws also restrict how they are stored or used in order to prevent them from either falling into the wrong hands or being misused by legitimate owners.\n\n \n What about your obligation to your family to not die at the hands of a criminal?\n \n \nOne more thing; There seems to be a great misunderstanding of my position from the pro-gun side. The idea of the mass gun turn in when gun restrictions are brought in is that you remove the guns from the hands of as many people as is possible, you often say you would shoot someone in self-defence, well gun confiscation would prevent you, the innocent civilian from becoming a criminal by killing another man (as explained above).\n\n \n So...laws that protect us from ourselves, by outlawing something to shield us from doing something illegal?\n \n I dunno, sounds awfully Big Brother to me, real \"the government will take care of you like you're its children\" sort of thing if you ask me.\n \n \nOK I ALREADY KNEW THAT PRE-EXISTING CRIMINALS WILL NOT TURN IN THEIR GUNS ON THE HONOR SYSTEM, ENOUGH CONFUSION ON THAT MATTER!\n Now what we would do is with the bulk of citizens being nice law abiding people they would turn in their guns and that would remove a bulk of guns from the system, then through arrests, search warrants and normal police action the number of guns possessed by criminals and the public would reach a point where the number of criminals with guns would become so little that their overall threat would be insignificant enough for the Police to handle without regular people needing to shoot bad guys for them.\n\n \n We had something like that in DC for over 30 years, and the police still couldn't get guns away from the criminals. It was very clear in DC, all semi-autos were banned from ownership, nobody could ever, under any circumstances have a gun outside of their home, or assembled in a functional manner. For all effective purposes DC was an island cut off from the rest of the United States, it still didn't do any good. The mayor of DC was robbed at gunpoint last year and he refused to press charges against the individuals that robbed him.\n \n \nI heard the point about substituting one weapon for another (i.e. knives) which is valid. However in Australia possession of a combat knife is illegal and possession of a knife in public that is not in a locked container can see you charged once again with possession of a deadly weapon.\n \n \n What's the definition of \"combat knife\"?\n \n \nAnd in addition you have to be 18 to purchase a knife that is large enough to kill.\n \n \n How large is \"large enough to kill\"? Because as has been said before, it was boxcutters that were responsible for 3,000 people being killed in just a few hours.\n \n \nAnd after a recent scandal such \"deadly weapon\" laws were extended to cover lasers (of Class-3 or better) because some jerks were using class-3 lasers to blind pilots as they came in for landings at airports. (sorry I still don't have enough posts to link :( )\n\n \n I'm waiting for glass bottles to be banned because they can be used for making molotov cocktails.\n \n \nThe point is that you restrict not just guns, but rather any implement that can be considered deadly. The same laws go for ninja death stars, swords and even cordless power tools.\n\n \n You can beat a person to death with a 2X4, do you implement wood control next? Tell somebody that they can't build that new shelf unit to store stuff?\n \n Where exactly does it all end? If people start choking each other to death with their hands or shoelaces, do you pass laws that mandate people being handcuffed in public and wearing only flipflops?\n \n \nIt sounds restrictive, but keep in mind all you have to do is keep stuff at home (like knives and power tools) or any private property you own and you aren't violating possession laws. (no this does not mean you can shoot someone at home).\n\n \n Wait...this contradicts your earlier statement of how banning guns and initiating police search and seizures would reduce the numbers in circulation. You just said that keeping them on privately owned property doesn't violate possession laws. Doesn't that mean that if the police carried out a bust on somebody who was using their home for black market business, engaged in the selling of converted automatic weapons imported from China or Africa or Iraq, the police wouldn't be able to charge him with the possession of prohibited weapons since it was his house?\n \n \nIt is rather complex with most weapons having different laws reagrding waht is legal possession and what isn't (mainly based on the reason you claim legal ownership of the weapon). For example it's legal to possess a sword for ornamental or historical antique purposes, however swords have a specific law saying they have to be kept blunt because you aren't meant to be using them to chop people up.\n\n \n Sword Buyer's Guide.\n \n \nAnyway. On to another point a couple of pages back: Omega mocked my saying that these criminals DO need counciling. Well they do, this particular case involved troubled youths who took drugs and lashed out. The thing about jail is that it's like university for Criminals, criminals most often come out of jail better criminals than when they went in. Here in Aus in particular there's an argument that Juvenile detention centers are actually offer better living standards for minors with bad parents or in poverty, so some actually try to get in on purpose. Think about it, Jail offers 3 square meals a day, running water, free accommodation, bed, entertainment. It's bad yeah, but for people at rock bottom jail is an improvement in living standard. The point here being that the focus in sentencing criminals should really focus on rehabilitating offenders not to commit such a crime again with jail being more for those who can't be rehabilitated (the remorseless) and being used in conjunction with counciling or psychiatric help to rehabilitate and punish in a double whammy.\n\n \n Mocking perhaps, but I stand by my position. You took law, I took psychology. If you torture and kill animals for fun then you're a sociopath and commit outrageous acts because it's the only way you can feel something, people like that aren't going to be satisfied with mundane things and counseling won't reach them.\n \n I also don't believe that anybody who would carry out cold blooded murder on fellow classmates deserves a second chance and counseling. The VT and Columbine killers certainly weren't remorseful in their actions, I don't see why they would be deserving of a chance to turn their lives around after maliciously ending so many just for the fun of it.\n \n Then we come to the issue of certain people not wanting to be rehabilitated, like serial and career individuals who habitually commit crimes because it's what they like, and it's what they're good at. If these people are unwilling to change then rehabilitation should be dropped and keeping them out of society should be the main focus.\n \n \nSo much crime could be prevented with better psychological rehabilitation.\n So yeah maybe counciling is a better idea than jamming criminals in jail so they can become harder criminals later. \n Life sentences however can go without counciling ;)\n\n \n Call me crazy, but I can't see a counseling being an effective method of dealing with hardened individuals who've been in and out of jails all their lives, or people that were raised by criminal parents.\n \n There's an old saying, you can't fix what no longer works. I think of hardened and life-oriented criminals as burnt out light bulbs; beyond repair and better off discarded/locked up for life.\n \n \nAnyway to close off a long, long rant: Guns are deadly, so are lots of other things, so controls should be placed on all of them (read: NOT bans). Guns in particular are designed with killing or serious injury in mind so they need more regulation than other potential weapons.\n\n \n I think we already have such laws in place. We've got laws dictating where you can shoot, what you can shoot at, when you can and can't display your gun, where you can't display it at, who can't own or possess one, where you can and can't take it, when you can and can't use it, etc.\n \n Crazy example. Two towns over there used to be a local ordinance that stated a person could open carry their legally owned gun, but only from 7 AM to 7 PM.\n \n \nAnd Guns make poor self defence mechanisms (see above) as well as the moral consequences of killing another human being.\n\n \n Well the way I see it, you can either be the one who remains alive to feel bad about it later, or you can be the one that dies and feel nothing at all.",

   "Grizzly stopping criminals typically means sucking it up and making a few sacrifices yourself. e.g. For the police to catch drunk drivers they perform random breath tests, which inconveniences you, a law abiding driver, but also catches criminals, When airport security checks your person and baggage it inconveniences you even if you are innocent and catches terrorists, Police typically investigate all witnesses as potential suspects in crimes and that could also inconvenience you as an innocent. It is selfish of you to demand that criminals using guns be targeted in such that it in no way affects anyone besides criminals is affected. I have repeatedly outlined feasible deadly weapons control methods that exist and are effective in other countries, but they all inconvenience you because you would have no grounds for gun possession (except for sport). And as I have outlined almost any use of a gun in self-defence will make YOU a criminal because you have wounded or killed your fellow man.\n\n \n Slight problem with that comparison. Our courts unfortunately have a longstanding history of dropping charges that occur from criminals violating the various gun laws, and letting them be plea bargained away so very few criminals ever face a day in prison for having a gun in their possession.\n \n For all the gun laws we have, very few ever get actively enforced. And if the ones we already have aren't being enforced just like all the other laws, why should we believe that new gun laws will be enforced better than their predecessors?\n \n If it's not going to be used to actually punish criminals, then we don't want any part of it, because then it's nothing more than an inconvenience to us and not even a speed bump to the ones actually violating the laws.\n \n The courts uphold the charges of drunk driving, drug possession, child molestation, embezzling and other crimes, but when it comes to firearms charges they dropped the ball. Anymore it's a case of arresting the criminal, taking their gun away from them, and ultimately making them serve a meager pittance of a sentence and then put them right back out on the streets, where they'll just get another gun and be back in court and jail before the month is over.",

   "First let me say welcome to the forum. \n \n Now I want to briefly address your arguments made in response to another:\n \n \n Firstly, it seems I need to repeat this. Because it is the one reason that seriously disinclines me from wanting to own a gun. OK, I am a Law student, I asked my prof about this one. I made sure, it is a legal doctrine Australia actually copied from America (Australian law tends to copy the most successful laws from around the world). A gun is a bad choice of self-defence mechanism.\n \n Using a gun in self-defence will see you arrested along with your attacker, or at the very least sued by your attacker. Because self-defence only qualifies as a legal defence if your opponent had a superior weapon and had intention to use it on you. If you are using a semi-automatic weapon (handgun) then the only way to prove self defence is if your opponent has an automatic weapon, a Semi-auto combat shotgun or an explosive of some definition. If he has the same weapon, then your sentence may be downgraded. \n \n However if you had a handgun and your opponent threatened you with a knife (not knowing you had a handgun on you) and then you shot him in self defence and he died. Then you would be convicted of anywhere between Involuntary Manslaughter or a Murder charge (not first degree). Which gives you a jail sentence, and a serious criminal record.\n \n let me just emphasise: This legal situation WOULD occur in America under American law. In Australia the same would occur except you would also be charged with possession of a deadly weapon. \n\n \n And as stated in a subsequent post responding to someone else:\n \n \n And as I have outlined almost any use of a gun in self-defence will make YOU a criminal because you have wounded or killed your fellow man. \n\n \n I accept at face value your claim to be a law student. I must say however that it does not impress me no matter how many times you repeat the claim, nor does it give me any confidence that your opinion of the law is any better than mine.\n \n I would advise against relying on an Australian law school professor for advice on the law in America. I don't pretend to know what the law of self defense is in Australia, but I believe I know a little bit more about the law in my own country (America) than do either of you. \n \n In fact, I believe your post could not be more much more incorrect if you tried.\n \n I'm telling you now that you are both very wrong about the law of self defense in my country, and I doubt very seriously if your nation ever copied the law of self defense from mine. \n \n I'm asking you (and your alleged professor, for that matter) to engage me here in a discussion on the topic of the law of self defense so I can show you just how wrong you are. \n \n I am going to tell you why you are wrong, but I first want to see if you are prepared stand by your claim that the law of self defense in America is as you allege above. \n \n I await your reply....",

   "That's what we do.\n \n \n \n A lot of things have changed. What you say can happen in some states, but in others it's not the case anymore. A number of states have adopted the Castle Doctrine which does three things:\n \n 1. It states that you can use, up to and including, deadly force if you reasonably believe that you're facing imminent harm or death.\n \n 2. It clarifies that you don't have to flee if you have a right to be where you're at, at the time of the attack.\n \n 3. It shields you from civil lawsuits from the attacker or their families if the courts find that you did nothing wrong.\n\n \n \n Intriguing, which how many states has this doctrine been implemented in?\n Oh and about when did this start?\n I've never heard of this before, extremely interesting.\n \n \n \nI don't know. I've heard of people shooting criminals who're only armed with handguns, and they didn't face criminal charges because it was ruled as self-defense. Is that how it works in Australia? Because I never saw anywhere that you had to have less weapon than your attacker to be justified in using it. If that were the case then nobody would keep a rifle or shotgun as a home defense weapon because they'd automatically be found guilty on the grounds of use of excessive force.\n\n \n I would think that if many Americans think as you do then few juries would convict on these \"self-defence\" charges that I mentioned (I can't believe I only just though of that!). So the point would probably be fairly moot.\n \n \n \nI can't remember seeing an example of this being the case. I don't remember somebody being found guilty when they shot a home intruder armed with a baseball bat. Maybe there are some cases of this occurring that you could present?\n\n \n Dammit, I said I can't link! \n Also I don't get US newspapers, and I'm not digging through media sources in the US until I find one that's reputable (that could take ages! :p)\n \n \nSome people don't have it in them, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n \n Nobody should have it in them, then nobody would be murdered.\n \n \n \nIt's happened in the past. People don't want to be associated with what their ancestors did so they change their family name. We left Britain and King George and called ourselves Americans. If you don't want to be associated with a perceived hellhole, then don't share the name of the hellhole.\n\n \n Look I'm sorry but you are missing the point and being quite insensitive. The region you live in is referred to as the \"americas\" referring to South, North and Central American continental land and nearby islands, while the nation you live in is also referred to as \"america\", which causes some confusion.\n Those not in America find such confusions offensive as they are a result of the citizens of the USA referring to themselves as \"Americans\" as if they are the only \"Americans\". countries like Brazil changing their name would do nothing to alter the situation. \n Put simply: Them changing their name would not do anything to dissociate them from \"America\", they resent the US monopoly on referring to themselves as \"america\". \n \n \nDon't be so sure. American sports and exhibition shooters fire hundreds of thousands of rounds every year to stay as good as they do. That's a lot of money that gets contributed to the economy\n\n \n Have my proposals ever suggested we ban gun sports?\n Matter of fact I suggested they be one of few uses of guns that remain legal.\n \n \n \nThanks!\n\n \n Maturity has appeared!\n \n \nI don't like the path this takes us down, to me it cheapens the whole argument.\n\n \n No it doesn't. It is the entire basis of my standpoint that a gun ban is foolish as prohibition has proven ineffective in the past, restrictions (like those in Australia) have been proven much more effective and are the course of action that I most support.\n \n \nWhat about your obligation to your family to not die at the hands of a criminal?\n\n \n Lock your door? Police can help? Get something non-lethal? Pepper spray? Crotch kick? Taser (unlikely!)? There's plenty of ways to incapacitate a man without killing him or critically injuring him, and if he dies from a taser induced heart attack or a pepper spray allergy well then you have the legal defence of it being an accident.\n \n \nSo...laws that protect us from ourselves, by outlawing something to shield us from doing something illegal?\n\n \n Yeah laws do generally protect people from themselves and others it's usually the whole point of criminal laws. And if XXXXXX (there are many) are anything to go by then a lot of people need protection from themselves, not to mention that children need to be protected from themselves. \n \n \nI dunno, sounds awfully Big Brother to me, real \"the government will take care of you like you're its children\" sort of thing if you ask me.\n\n \n OMG so horrible the government is protecting us! emoticon_cry *cries in fear*\n Big brother isn't anything to be scared of if it acts with kindness and in good will. Dictators aren't always evil. ;)\n \n \nWe had something like that in DC for over 30 years, and the police still couldn't get guns away from the criminals. It was very clear in DC, all semi-autos were banned from ownership, nobody could ever, under any circumstances have a gun outside of their home, or assembled in a functional manner. For all effective purposes DC was an island cut off from the rest of the United States, it still didn't do any good. The mayor of DC was robbed at gunpoint last year and he refused to press charges against the individuals that robbed him.\n\n \n Man DC failed, we (Aus) did it. We get along fine.\n silly DC.\n Also that sounded more like a ban than controls\n \n \nWhat's the definition of \"combat knife\"?\n\n \n A knife or blade produced for use in combat (duh).\n A sharp weapon made for the express purpose of killing or wounding living creatures.\n Combat knives are banned in Australia. Hunting knives you can get, but they are even harder to get than guns. \n \n \nHow large is \"large enough to kill\"? Because as has been said before, it was boxcutters that were responsible for 3,000 people being killed in just a few hours.\n\n \n Large is probably not the right word (sorry). It pretty much covers any knife that a person could actually threaten another person with like a butcher knife or a switchblade. It does not include butter knives, table cutlery and scissors. And the restrictions are pretty light anyway on non-combat dangerous knives:\n 1. No having one concealed or in your possession in public (unless it is safely stored in a lockbox)\n 2. Can't be sold to those under 18. \n \n \nI'm waiting for glass bottles to be banned because they can be used for making molotov cocktails.\n\n \n lol, funny you should mention that. Here in New South Wales (the state Sydney is in) the Police Commissioner wants to limit pubs to only serving alcohol in plastic cups after 9pm because of all the late night pub fights that result in serious injuries from broken glass bottles being used as weapons. It's somewhat silly, but not entirely unreasonable. But it says something about Australia that a matter like this is a Police Commissioners biggest concern (that serious crime is pretty under control).\n \n \nYou can beat a person to death with a 2X4, do you implement wood control next? Tell somebody that they can't build that new shelf unit to store stuff?\n \n Where exactly does it all end? If people start choking each other to death with their hands or shoelaces, do you pass laws that mandate people being handcuffed in public and wearing only flipflops?\n\n \n \n Perhaps I should clarify...\n That's stupid, use some common sense. The controls are only for things that are considered a danger to the user or those around them, a good common sense to apply to this is to think of an item like say a gun; then think \"would I be okay with a six year old being in possession of this\" the answer in the case of a gun is no. In the case of a piece of wood, is that you probably wouldn't be that concerned with a six year old having one.\n I know this is not a perfect way to determine such things, but it generally works and the point I'm pushing across is that common sense is needed here.\n In the case of shoelaces and choking, that is based on the physical strength of the attacker and not the quality of the implement. Guns kill (almost) regardless of the physical strength of the wielder.\n \n \n \nWait...this contradicts your earlier statement of how banning guns and initiating police search and seizures would reduce the numbers in circulation. You just said that keeping them on privately owned property doesn't violate possession laws. Doesn't that mean that if the police carried out a bust on somebody who was using their home for black market business, engaged in the selling of converted automatic weapons imported from China or Africa or Iraq, the police wouldn't be able to charge him with the possession of prohibited weapons since it was his house?\n\n \n \n No, no, no and no. Again with that nasty word \"ban\" or \"prohibit\". As I said not ban, restrict. Also try and compare it to the way police reduce drugs in circulation (raids on suspects houses etc) with the difference being criminals have a harder time trying to make their own guns to replace what the police confiscate. You are right about the private property though, but clever lawmakers saw that one coming and banned the unlicensed sale or trade of these restricted weapons which is what the police would arrest them for if they found a guns and had reason to believe you were selling them. Also you forget the registration involved in legal gun purchase which inherently makes the import of guns ilegal (our border security tends to seize gun imports anyway).\n \n \n\n Sword Buyer's Guide.\n \n\n \n Illegal in Australia\n Also what was with that site?\n \n \n\n Mocking perhaps, but I stand by my position. You took law, I took psychology. If you torture and kill animals for fun then you're a sociopath and commit outrageous acts because it's the only way you can feel something, people like that aren't going to be satisfied with mundane things and counseling won't reach them.\n\n \n Do you mean Armchair Psychology? Criminology is a complex and diverse subject and there is no unilaterally effective solution here. Some criminals could reform with counciling while others are beyond help, some would become worse criminals after jail sentences while others are scared into never wanting to end up there again.\n \n \n\n I also don't believe that anybody who would carry out cold blooded murder on fellow classmates deserves a second chance and counseling. The VT and Columbine killers certainly weren't remorseful in their actions, I don't see why they would be deserving of a chance to turn their lives around after maliciously ending so many just for the fun of it. \n\n \n \n Everyone deserves another chance if they can still give to society. Prisoners are only taking away from society, why not reform them into contributing to society if at all possible. Isn't your justice system based on the idea that a man CAN change?\n \n \nThen we come to the issue of certain people not wanting to be rehabilitated, like serial and career individuals who habitually commit crimes because it's what they like, and it's what they're good at. If these people are unwilling to change then rehabilitation should be dropped and keeping them out of society should be the main focus.\n\n \n \n Some people are beyond help. That you are dead right about.\n Some people can't contribute to society in any helpful way. \n These people suck.\n \n \n\n Call me crazy, but I can't see a counseling being an effective method of dealing with hardened individuals who've been in and out of jails all their lives, or people that were raised by criminal parents.\n\n \n \n I'm gonna call you crazy. You might be surprised about how some can turn their lives around with good psychiatric help.\n \n \n.There's an old saying, you can't fix what no longer works. I think of hardened and life-oriented criminals as burnt out light bulbs; beyond repair and better off discarded/locked up for life.\n\n \n \n Harsh\n Also, never heard that saying before.\n \n \nI think we already have such laws in place. We've got laws dictating where you can shoot, what you can shoot at, when you can and can't display your gun, where you can't display it at, who can't own or possess one, where you can and can't take it, when you can and can't use it, etc.\n\n \n I think America should take it a few steps further to change existing gun \"inconvenience\" into gun \"control\" we have in Australia.\n \n \nCrazy example. Two towns over there used to be a local ordinance that stated a person could open carry their legally owned gun, but only from 7 AM to 7 PM.\n\n \n lol, I love old crazy laws. So many. Like the law (I forget which state) which illegalises being found under a sidewalk. How you are \"found\" under a sidewalk is far from clear. \n \n \nWell the way I see it, you can either be the one who remains alive to feel bad about it later, or you can be the one that dies and feel nothing at all.\n\n \n I'd rather die and feel nothing at all than live a life with the tortured conscience of a man whose life I ended early for selfish reasons of my own safety. I'd never be able to help, but think it could've gone down without anyone having to die.\n \n Oh and a side note for Bryan seeing how he is \"awaiting my reply\":\n In light of this Castle Doctrine that Omegamon has brought to my attention and my own conclusions about jury convictions (see above) I must concede the legal points I made on Self-defence as Omegamon has disputed them with aplomb and proper debate. Clearly if this Castle Doctrine overcomes the self-defence doctrines present then I'm wrong and the behaviour of juries (as above) could make the point moot anyway. \n \n Also Bryan I don't think my \"alleged\" Law professor gives a flying #### about this forum or what you say about him. I don't reckon he's going to sign up just to back up my claims or refute yours and it is arrogant of you to think so. \n I presented (reminded? This is the first mention Bryan) my status as a University student to affirm that I didn't just make bull up to back up my own claims and that I do actually have a fair understanding of legal complications in relation to gun laws and why I would not wield one from a purely legal standpoint not to \"intimidate\" forum posters (wow I intimidate them with my \"Studying\", big whoop, I don't think anyone was really impressed by my studying law)\n And I mean really if you are prepared to explain your position then get to it! \n If you're prepared to respond then get responding!\n Jeese, don't ask for your opponent to be a jerk and tell you he's \"proud\" to stand by an opinion like some arrogant jackass, I'm prepared to abandon my position if I feel it has been reasonably disputed or is unsubstantiated, I'm prepared to suck it up and admit I'm wrong. Now you make it sound like me admitting I'm wrong is me not stepping up to a challenge instead of me admitting I'm wrong being an essential and fundamental part of honest debate.\n And Bryan if you know so much about self-defence law then I want to hear exactly what the law is in America. It's fine for you to question my claims, but you haven't even tried to present your alternative here. All you've said is \"I am going to tell you why you are wrong\" well why not get to it?\n No point now, I've conceded the argument based on Omegamon's comments.\n Perhaps I was pretentious of knowledge in the way my point was presented, it was merely a side point anyway and it only bothered me enough to repeat it because it kept getting misinterpreted in replies.\n \n You welcome honest debate by corrupting it's very meaning, affirming that I would be \"proud\" to hold a point in debate is wrong, the whole point is to change the other sides opinion, for that to happen both sides must be open to the eventuality of having to change their opinions. \n You tell me I am very wrong yet present no point of your own to explain upon what grounds I am so terribly wrong. \n \n Now that I've gotten that rage over Bryan being annoying out:\n I deicidist am willing to discard any point about the legal complications of handgun self-defence if this debate can move forward.\n Bryan however is welcome to explain how \"wrong\" I am if I am welcome to tell him how I could be more wrong in that post if I tried emoticon_xgood\n \n Omega you said Bryan raised good points, I agree with you, but he raised them in such a way as to be a total XXX in my eyes. As I mentioned to Hollyh it is hard to take someone seriously when they commit personal attacks on you in debate. I very much doubt he ever took me seriously so I'm not too worried about him.\n \n P.S. really sorry about bagging you Bryan, but your post really annoyed me. And that's saying a lot considering the level upon which I dislike the American gun laws and feel those who advocate them are wrong, despite this I have attempted to remain civil in debate, but you are just too much ,you take the cake. You have gone off topic to take specific personal attack upon me and the quality of my education as well as be outright rude (my post could not be more incorrect if I tried? Oh I disagree).",

   "Intriguing, which how many states has this doctrine been implemented in?\n Oh and about when did this start?\n I've never heard of this before, extremely interesting.\n\n \n It's been enacted in about 15 states so far, with legislation introduced in about a dozen others. It all started in Florida back in 2005.\n \n \nI would think that if many Americans think as you do then few juries would convict on these \"self-defence\" charges that I mentioned (I can't believe I only just though of that!). So the point would probably be fairly moot.\n\n \n Look at the Joe Horn case in Texas. Mr. Horn shot two robbers at his neighbor's place, and he was neither arrested nor indicted for the act. And surely if he did something wrong then the officer on the scene would've hauled him in.\n \n \nDammit, I said I can't link! \n Also I don't get US newspapers, and I'm not digging through media sources in the US until I find one that's reputable (that could take ages! :p)\n\n \n Damn liberal media.\n \n \nNobody should have it in them, then nobody would be murdered.\n\n \n No? What about those who think that they're cut out for the gangster lifestyle and only learn that they don't have the stomach for it after they've made their first kill? Or those that go killing only when they're high on drugs?\n \n \nHave my proposals ever suggested we ban gun sports?\n Matter of fact I suggested they be one of few uses of guns that remain legal.\n\n \n What I was trying to point out was that the civilian market contributes a large amount of money to the economy when it comes to firearms purchases. And we can only do that if we don't have to jump through dozens of hoops in order to buy guns. The more restrictions put in place, the more the economy will suffer because fewer people would bother. That's a lot of revenue to be losing.\n \n \nNo it doesn't. It is the entire basis of my standpoint that a gun ban is foolish as prohibition has proven ineffective in the past, restrictions (like those in Australia) have been proven much more effective and are the course of action that I most support.\n\n \n No, suggesting that gun ownership only be open for the purpose of sports cheapens the nature of the Constitution itself, like it's only there for recreational purposes. At least that's my take on it. The Supreme Court said that the Second Amendment wasn't strictly limited to sports or hunting, but that it included all legal and lawful uses.\n \n Suggesting that the Second Amendment only exists for sporting use is like suggesting the First Amendment is only there so we can discuss movies that we've seen.\n \n \nLock your door? Police can help? Get something non-lethal? Pepper spray? Crotch kick? Taser (unlikely!)?\n\n \n Locked doors can be broken down, police take at the least 8 minutes to arrive on scene, and there are times when non-lethal is a non-option.\n \n \nThere's plenty of ways to incapacitate a man without killing him or critically injuring him, and if he dies from a taser induced heart attack or a pepper spray allergy well then you have the legal defence of it being an accident.\n\n \n In some states without the Castle Doctrine, a criminal can sue you if they were illegally on your property and slipped on your kid's roller skate. Things that happen by accident can be very costly in court if you don't have laws that shield such civil suits from occurring.\n \n \nYeah laws do generally protect people from themselves and others it's usually the whole point of criminal laws. And if XXXXXX (there are many) are anything to go by then a lot of people need protection from themselves, not to mention that children need to be protected from themselves.\n \n \n Protecting the people from themselves isn't the job of the government, nor should it be.\n \n \nA knife or blade produced for use in combat (duh).\n\n \n Anything can be used in combat. Look at glass bottles, they're not designed for anything intentionally dangerous, but they're almost exclusively used in the construction of molotov cocktails.\n \n \nA sharp weapon made for the express purpose of killing or wounding living creatures.\n\n \n Who gets to make the determination?\n \n \nCombat knives are banned in Australia. Hunting knives you can get, but they are even harder to get than guns.\n \n \n Funny, because hunting knives and combat knives share a very similar design.\n \n Hunting knife.\n \n Combat Knife.\n \n See the similarities?\n \n \nlol, funny you should mention that. Here in New South Wales (the state Sydney is in) the Police Commissioner wants to limit pubs to only serving alcohol in plastic cups after 9pm because of all the late night pub fights that result in serious injuries from broken glass bottles being used as weapons. It's somewhat silly, but not entirely unreasonable. But it says something about Australia that a matter like this is a Police Commissioners biggest concern (that serious crime is pretty under control).\n\n \n As I thought...\n \n \nPerhaps I should clarify...\n That's stupid, use some common sense.\n\n \n You're telling me to use common sense? Some people are proposing laws that would allow a District Attorney to have a firearms owner charged as an accessory to a crime if they didn't report the theft of their gun within 24 hours; even if they were away on a business trip during the time of the theft and had no way of knowing it'd been taken from their home.\n \n \nGuns kill (almost) regardless of the physical strength of the wielder.\n\n \n That's why they're the best tool for self-defense.\n \n \nNo, no, no and no. Again with that nasty word \"ban\" or \"prohibit\". As I said not ban, restrict.\n\n \n Restrictions are just a stepping stone towards banning. Look at the UK, over the years they introduced one handgun restriction after another, until 1997 when all handgun ownership was banned.\n \n \nIllegal in Australia\n Also what was with that site?\n\n \n The SBG is stationed in Australia. That guy owns most of the swords reviewed and used.\n \n \nDo you mean Armchair Psychology? Criminology is a complex and diverse subject and there is no unilaterally effective solution here. Some criminals could reform with counciling while others are beyond help, some would become worse criminals after jail sentences while others are scared into never wanting to end up there again.\n\n \n And the one's who've been in the system for a considerable length of time are likely going to treat counseling with a \"pfft, whatever\" attitude.\n \n \nEveryone deserves another chance if they can still give to society. Prisoners are only taking away from society, why not reform them into contributing to society if at all possible. Isn't your justice system based on the idea that a man CAN change?\n\n \n Yes, but we also have a setup for those that don't want to change. And I say we should be using it a lot more than we are.\n \n \nSome people are beyond help. That you are dead right about.\n Some people can't contribute to society in any helpful way. \n These people suck.\n\n \n Something we can agree on. And again I say that we treat these people like they deserve to be, and stop offering them chance after chance after chance.\n \n \nI'm gonna call you crazy. You might be surprised about how some can turn their lives around with good psychiatric help.\n\n \n Oh I know that they can. I'm talking about those that don't want to and refuse to change.\n \n \nHarsh\n Also, never heard that saying before.\n\n \n It's a harsh world we live in.\n \n \nI think America should take it a few steps further to change existing gun \"inconvenience\" into gun \"control\" we have in Australia.\n\n \n I don't think so. I remember reading an article of how a study of 10 years of current gun control laws haven't done anything to make Aussies any safer.\n \n \nlol, I love old crazy laws. So many. Like the law (I forget which state) which illegalises being found under a sidewalk. How you are \"found\" under a sidewalk is far from clear.\n\n \n Or the one where you can't buy beer after midnight on a Sunday, but you can Monday morning; which starts just after midnight Sunday night.\n \n \nI'd rather die and feel nothing at all than live a life with the tortured conscience of a man whose life I ended early for selfish reasons of my own safety. I'd never be able to help, but think it could've gone down without anyone having to die.\n\n \n I'm sure you'd feel different if it was your family that was threatened and you made the decision that they were more important to you.\n \n It's easy enough to feel like your life isn't worth much, but what about the lives of loved ones? When they get brought into the frey would you treat them the same and think you'd rather one of them die instead of you having to kill their attacker?",

   "I'm sorry Decidist. I think I completely misread you when I first looked at your posts. I have a major character flaw in which I do not suffer fools gladly, and when I first read your posts I mistook you for one and responded the way I did. I also didn't realize questioning your opinion the way I did would generate rage in you. That was not my intent. I will try to avoid any further misunderstandings with you.\n \n \n I presented (reminded? This is the first mention Bryan) my status as a University student to affirm that I didn't just make bull up to back up my own claims and that I do actually have a fair understanding of legal complications in relation to gun laws....\n\n \n Fair enough. Here then are my qualifications. I graduated law school in 1993. From '93 to '98 I defended persons charged with various crimes, including crimes of capital murder. In '98 I became a Commonwealth's Attorney, which is what we call a prosecutor. Since that time I have fought against violent crime. I have stood in front of juries and asked them to put men and women in jail for the rest of their lives-and in more than one case I have asked a jury to declare a person's life forfeit-for crimes committed with firearms. I have dealt with self-defense claims many times. I both know and teach the law of self-defense in my state.\n \n \n And Bryan if you know so much about self-defence law then I want to hear exactly what the law is in America. It's fine for you to question my claims, but you haven't even tried to present your alternative here. All you've said is \"I am going to tell you why you are wrong\" well why not get to it? \n\n \n Actually I have explained the law of self defense at some length in this forum. But in fairness this was done a few years ago and since you are new here I did not expect you to have found it. Here is the link to it: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/4779-natural-right-self-defense-use-deadly-force-virginia.html#post105470\n \n Now let me address your arguments. \n \n \n Using a gun in self-defence will see you arrested along with your attacker, or at the very least sued by your attacker. Because self-defence only qualifies as a legal defence if your opponent had a superior weapon and had intention to use it on you. If you are using a semi-automatic weapon (handgun) then the only way to prove self defence is if your opponent has an automatic weapon, a Semi-auto combat shotgun or an explosive of some definition. If he has the same weapon, then your sentence may be downgraded. \n\n \n \n let me just emphasise: This legal situation WOULD occur in America under American law. \n\n \n No it would not. A person acting in self defense is not required to ask his attacker to first fire off a few rounds so he can know whether he is facing a fully or semi-automatic armed attacker. There is not and never has been a requirement that you respond with what you suggest to be inferior firepower. You are never required to prove your assailant wielded a superior deadly weapon. You are also never required to prove your attacker's subjective intent. In fact, self-defense is always viewed from the vantage of the person claiming to have exercised the right. \n \n Here is the actual law of self defense-as explained in the model jury instruction I have used many times. This is how you truly prove self-defense: \n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT if you believe that the defendant was without fault in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, and that the defendant reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of harm, then the defendant had the right to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm. If you further believe that the defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.\n \n (Note from my earlier outline this instruction changes in Virginia to include a \"retreat to the wall first\" requirement if you first provoke the problem)\n \n Now to answer this claim:\n \n \n However if you had a handgun and your opponent threatened you with a knife (not knowing you had a handgun on you) and then you shot him in self defence and he died. Then you would be convicted of anywhere between Involuntary Manslaughter or a Murder charge (not first degree). Which gives you a jail sentence, and a serious criminal record. \n\n \n \n And as I have outlined almost any use of a gun in self-defence will make YOU a criminal because you have wounded or killed your fellow man. \n\n \n Here is the real law of the right to use deadly force, including by firearm, to defend yourself. The jury instruction reads:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm. \n \n Therefore, the deadly/non-deadly use of force distinction is this. You are not allowed to use deadly force in self defense unless you reasonably fear you are being assaulted or threatened with deadly force. Note, however, that deadly force includes assaults or threats with more than just firearms, regardless of how many rounds they can fire per trigger pull. Here is the model jury instruction which defines what constitutes a deadly weapon which justifies the responsive use of a deadly weapon, including a firearm, in self-defense: \n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT a deadly weapon is any object or instrument, not part of the human body, that is likely to cause death or great bodily injury because of the manner and under the circumstances in which it is used.\n \n Any weapon, whether it be a gun, a pipe, a baseball bat, a crowbar, a knife, etc, can become a deadly weapon when used in a manner that renders death or great bodily injury a likely result. If you are ever threatened with any weapon in this manner then you are entitled to use any deadly weapon you have, including any firearm you have at hand-no matter the caliber-no matter the action-to defend yourself. There is no requirement that you must only meet a knife with a knife, or a baseball bat with a baseball bat. If you are attacked with any form of a deadly weapon then you are entitled to use a firearm to respond. The only caveat is this: the law of self defense is always described as the law of necessity, and it is never considered a right of retaliation. You are entitled to shoot a deadly-force wielding assailant as many times as you want so long as he is continuing his attack, but once the attack ends, your use of force against him must also end. This law applies not only to you, but it justifies your use of deadly force to defend others who you perceive to be suffering as faultless victims of a deadly force attack. \n \n And if you perceive a deadly force threat is about to be made, then you are entitled to arm yourself (including by firearm) as preparation to defend yourself without having malice imputed to your actions:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY that when a person reasonably apprehends that another intends to attack him for the purpose of doing him serious bodily harm, then such person has the right to arm himself for his own necessary self defense and if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an attack will be made upon him then no inference of malice can be drawn from the fact of such preparation.\n \n I live in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and this is the law of self-defense where I live. It is a largely unchanged version of the Common Law we inherited from England. Other states laws will be similar, but differences do arise, particularly regarding whether you are required to \"retreat to the wall\" before you can use deadly force in self-defense, and whether you can use deadly force solely to defend property, which Virginia prohibits outside of the limited exception we call the \"castle doctrine\":\n \n \"The use of deadly force to prevent threatened harm to property is never justified except in defense of habitation. . . .[the remainder of this quote comes from a footnote to the preceding sentence--Bryan] The use of deadly force, in defense of \"property\" can also be justifiable, but the classic formulation lists only arson or burglary as crimes against property which can justify the use of deadly force. . . . Even then the use of deadly force must have been necessary. Defense of habitation and justifiable self-defense overlap in the \"castle doctrine\" which states that one may, without retreating, use force, to include deadly force if necessary, to keep aggressors out of his own house. This part of the castle doctrine is one aspect of defense of habitation. . . . [T]he justification exists in the curtilage as well as the castle.\" Roger D. Groot, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia 114 (3rd ed. 1994).\" Alexander v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 771, 780, 508 S.E.2d 912, ___ (1999).",

   "Huzzah, normally when I go away for this long I've got like 3 pages of stuff to reply to!\n \n Bryan, your amazing legal knowledge and credentials have absolutely intimidated me.\n Now can it.\n I'm past the legal self-defense argument because of this interesting castle doctrine.\n And on another note, do you believe those laws are right? For what reasons?\n And this quote interested me:\n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT [/b]the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened[/b], and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\" \n Sounds like the equating of weapons to me, the weapon you use is a pretty quantifiable measure of force. But never mind that, that's a topic for another forum. \n \n \n\n Damn liberal media.\n \n\n \n Curse them! The trouble I have with looking for US references in this debate is that I'm not even sure who is reputable and who isn't. ;)\n \n \n \nNo? What about those who think that they're cut out for the gangster lifestyle and only learn that they don't have the stomach for it after they've made their first kill? Or those that go killing only when they're high on drugs?\n\n \n Yeah, that's why no one should have it in them to kill, drugs or otherwise.\n \n \n \n\n What I was trying to point out was that the civilian market contributes a large amount of money to the economy when it comes to firearms purchases. And we can only do that if we don't have to jump through dozens of hoops in order to buy guns. The more restrictions put in place, the more the economy will suffer because fewer people would bother. That's a lot of revenue to be losing.\n\n \n Yeah I understood that. I just don't really feel that the impact on the world's greatest economy would be that significant, the US pulling out of the middle east would have more effect on the gun industry ;)\n \n \n \nNo, suggesting that gun ownership only be open for the purpose of sports cheapens the nature of the Constitution itself, like it's only there for recreational purposes. At least that's my take on it. The Supreme Court said that the Second Amendment wasn't strictly limited to sports or hunting, but that it included all legal and lawful uses.\n \n Suggesting that the Second Amendment only exists for sporting use is like suggesting the First Amendment is only there so we can discuss movies that we've seen.\n\n \n Yeah OK, I'll pay that. Given that I'd probably say cut the second amendment and roll in restrictions then. No bans, bans are just foolish because they tend not to work. The thing about bans is that it just builds a thriving black market, with restrictions people tend to bother less with the black market and go with the legal route through the restrictions. Hardened criminals tend to get guns no matter what the state of affairs, its just what they do. Now this does sound very arguable, but consider what has been said of the UK and it's crime statistics with their gun \"bans\" compared to Australia with \"restrictions\". Restrictions work better, there's a lot to it but on the face of it restrictions cut gun related crimes more than bans or just not restricting them.\n \n \n\n Locked doors can be broken down, police take at the least 8 minutes to arrive on scene, and there are times when non-lethal is a non-option.\n\n \n Shooters miss, guns can misfire, doors might hold until police arrive. When it comes right down to it you can always disable your opponent. If you happen to have a gun I'd shoot the attacker in the foot or arm so he wouldn't die. \n Oh and if the attacker doesn't have a gun then non-lethal gets a whole lot easier and if he doesn't have a gun then it's more likely you can have the opportunity to run away. \n \n \n \n \n\n In some states without the Castle Doctrine, a criminal can sue you if they were illegally on your property and slipped on your kid's roller skate. Things that happen by accident can be very costly in court if you don't have laws that shield such civil suits from occurring.\n\n \n Sometimes the US legal system weirds me out. I mean here in Aus you forfeit the right to sue once you're trespassing. However the Police can always press charges if they feel you took unnecessary steps to protect your property like traps or beating the hell out of the trespasser (assuming he didn't attack you or something), but that's rare for the police. Most people don't overdo it when they protect their property because they don't use guns to do it.\n \n \n \nProtecting the people from themselves isn't the job of the government, nor should it be.\n\n \n Oh really? Is that why illicit drugs are banned? Or why any potentially dangerous object is required to have warning labels like: \"point away from face\"? There are many cases where government legislation protects people from themselves or their own idiocy, or protects children from myriad ways they can hurt themselves. The Government does have a role in protecting people from themselves as it does in protecting people from each other.\n \n \nAnything can be used in combat. Look at glass bottles, they're not designed for anything intentionally dangerous, but they're almost exclusively used in the construction of molotov cocktails.\n\n \n My point was that a Combat Knife is a blade produced by a manufacturer with the primary purpose of the blade being to Kill someone. And being in possession of a glass bottle is not a crime, however being in possession of a constructed Molotov Cocktail is, because it is a live explosive. Not that anyone would ever be caught for that seeing how Molotov's are usually made and used in the space of minutes. \n \n \n \n\n Who gets to make the determination?\n \n\n \n The Manufacturer\n \n \n\n Funny, because hunting knives and combat knives share a very similar design.\n \n Hunting knife.\n \n Combat Knife.\n \n See the similarities?\n \n\n \n Yeah, it's a real sticky legal situation. The government only licenses sellers as hunting knife sellers and that pretty much makes any Hunting/Combat knife not from these sellers illegal by default. The trouble is that hunting/combat knives are very similar if not identical. So when it comes to legal points it's usually whether or not you have a license to carry a knife like that, and that license is damn hard to get. \n On that note we have a bigger problem with illegal blade trade than with guns here. Hundreds of Combat Knives, throwing stars, Katanas, swords and the like are seized by border security every day! Hell even I have a swiss army knife, but I can have it because I don't take it outside (concealed weapon) and I don't use it. Because it's on my private property it's quite legal for me to have it, just not use it as a weapon.\n \n \n \n\n You're telling me to use common sense? Some people are proposing laws that would allow a District Attorney to have a firearms owner charged as an accessory to a crime if they didn't report the theft of their gun within 24 hours; even if they were away on a business trip during the time of the theft and had no way of knowing it'd been taken from their home.\n \n\n \n I'm also telling those people to use some common sense. Also if you know any of those people, tell them they are XXXXXX. *facepalm*\n That law would solve like nothing, people can just report their gun stolen as a theft, and presumably one would do that as soon as you found it missing. Seeing how guns are pretty valuable the police would probably take that seriously.\n \n \n \n\n That's why they're the best tool for self-defense.\n \n\n \n That's why they're the best tool for killing. Ranged tasers (ones that shoot a little electrified cable at the target) are the best (and coolest) tool for self defense as they also have no strength or skill requirement upon the user and there is no skill needed to avoid killing them with a taser. With a gun you need skill not to kill the target. \n \n \n \nRestrictions are just a stepping stone towards banning. Look at the UK, over the years they introduced one handgun restriction after another, until 1997 when all handgun ownership was banned.\n\n \n Silly UK, bans don't work. As we have seen. It doesn't always have to be a stepping stone. \n \n \nThe SBG is stationed in Australia. That guy owns most of the swords reviewed and used.\n\n \n \"LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Sword Buyers Guide advocates safety and common sense and does not condone violence in any way, shape or form.\n \n Staff of Sword Buyers Guide are committed to responsible sword ownership and use, and under no circumstances condone the use of a sword on another living being or any unsafe practices with live blades. The destructive tests shown on the site are done under controlled conditions and should never be replicated.\n \n SBG is NOT responsible for the abuse or improper application of information contained herein, nor is it responsible for injury, loss of health, or loss of life.\" \n \n Direct quote SBG. They're selling for sword enthusiasts as a hobby as in selling to people who don't want dumb replicas or fragile antiques, they probably went through a lot to protect themselves legally. Also the URL is American. On closer inspection they seem very legitimate actually. I'm actually quite amazed anyone bothered to set up something like that in Australia, it's quite a bit of work.\n \n \n\n And the one's who've been in the system for a considerable length of time are likely going to treat counseling with a \"pfft, whatever\" attitude.\n \n\n \n Most guys treat counseling like that. Doesn't mean it won't achieve anything.\n \n \n \nYes, but we also have a setup for those that don't want to change. And I say we should be using it a lot more than we are.\n\n \n Maybe you wouldn't want to use it so much if these \"non-changers\" weren't armed with deadly guns.\n \n \n \n \n\n It's a harsh world we live in.\n \n\n \n Maybe if less people were armed it would be nicer. \n \n \n \n\n I don't think so. I remember reading an article of how a study of 10 years of current gun control laws haven't done anything to make Aussies any safer.\n \n\n \n Well seeing how these laws came in a bloody well lot longer than 10 years ago that's a silly study. \n \n \n \n \n \nI'm sure you'd feel different if it was your family that was threatened and you made the decision that they were more important to you.\n \n It's easy enough to feel like your life isn't worth much, but what about the lives of loved ones? When they get brought into the frey would you treat them the same and think you'd rather one of them die instead of you having to kill their attacker?\n\n \n I'd still feel bad afterwards about killing him/her. I'd always move to disable/disarm the attacker or delay him if the police were coming if at all possible. And if it came down to it then I'd seriously injure the attacker rather than kill them. And maybe, if there were no guns involved which is not too unlikely in Australia then it would be possible to flee from the attacker, or for me to take the hit while loved ones escaped.\n \n Oh and on a lighter note: Omega mentioned a while ago about restrictions on weapons going so far that we'd have hand restrictions because you can strangle someone (he was joking). Well if you are a master/blackbelt/champion in a style of fighting then you may be required to register your arms or legs as deadly weapons!\n \n So a Black-Belt Karate Master would register his arms and fists as deadly weapons. The only purpose of the law is for legal purposes in court (not like you'll be arrested for having buff arms), so that if said master beat up some guy who threatened him with a knife he wouldn't be able to call self-defense because his deadly arms were greater force than the mugger's knife. \n I'd just love to be able to boast that my arms were registered deadly weapons! :D",

   "Huzzah, normally when I go away for this long I've got like 3 pages of stuff to reply to!\n\n \n That's what we do.\n \n \nI'm past the legal self-defense argument because of this interesting castle doctrine.\n And on another note, do you believe those laws are right? For what reasons?\n\n \n Well I believe that the Castle Doctrine laws are right. If you're being robbed in the grocery store, you shouldn't be prosecuted for failing to retreat first just because that isn't where you live. \n \n I also don't believe that the criminal individual should be allowed to sue you for damages because they got hurt in the commission of a crime. When they can admit \"Yes I was planning to rob him, but he didn't have to shoot me, that's excessive force\" and you wind up in more trouble than the guy holding you at knife point, that just isn't right nor should it be.\n \n \n \nAnd this quote interested me:\n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\" \n \n Sounds like the equating of weapons to me, the weapon you use is a pretty quantifiable measure of force. But never mind that, that's a topic for another forum.\n\n \n I really don't think that the weapon used is the same as a measure of force. Regardless of the weapon you use, you'll be charged with \"assault with a deadly weapon\" if you use it in a crime, be it a knife or a gun or a screwdriver.\n \n I own an AR-15 carbine, one of the best guns ever made in America. Lightweight, very accurate, effective range out to 500 meters or more. Nobody armed with a handgun or a shotgun could ever hope to dominate me in terms of firepower if we ever got into a firefight. In fact the only way to beat me in terms of firepower would be to use a .30 caliber hunting rifle that uses true high-powered rounds like the .30-06 or the .300 Winchester Magnum.\n \n None of that is really relevant, however, because if somebody made an attempt on my life with a machete and I shot them with my rifle, my choice of weaponry wouldn't reflect back on me as being excessive force.\n \n As said before, a lot of people have shotguns and rifles for home defense weapons. But this wouldn't be the case if people were being sent to prison for use of excessive force because their Winchester rifle in .30-30 greatly outclassed the criminal's Hi-Point in 9mm.\n \n \nYeah, that's why no one should have it in them to kill, drugs or otherwise.\n\n \n Well unfortunately people do have it in them, so we've gotta deal with it.\n \n \nYeah I understood that. I just don't really feel that the impact on the world's greatest economy would be that significant, the US pulling out of the middle east would have more effect on the gun industry ;)\n\n \n Nevermind the world economy, I'm more focused on our local economy.\n \n \nYeah OK, I'll pay that. Given that I'd probably say cut the second amendment and roll in restrictions then. No bans, bans are just foolish because they tend not to work. The thing about bans is that it just builds a thriving black market, with restrictions people tend to bother less with the black market and go with the legal route through the restrictions. Hardened criminals tend to get guns no matter what the state of affairs, its just what they do. Now this does sound very arguable, but consider what has been said of the UK and it's crime statistics with their gun \"bans\" compared to Australia with \"restrictions\". Restrictions work better, there's a lot to it but on the face of it restrictions cut gun related crimes more than bans or just not restricting them.\n\n \n I don't think more restrictions would be of any use. The gun control laws already on the books aren't being used to prosecute criminals at this point in time, so I see no point to introduce anymore.\n \n The laws that say a criminal in possession of a firearm is to be sentenced to five years in prison without parole aren't being used now, is an additional restriction on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds going to be anymore effective?\n \n \nShooters miss, guns can misfire, doors might hold until police arrive. When it comes right down to it you can always disable your opponent.\n\n \n The key word is \"might\". I don't trust things that \"might\" work, I don't want to depend on \"it might work\".\n \n \nIf you happen to have a gun I'd shoot the attacker in the foot or arm so he wouldn't die.\n\n \n So...you'd use lethal force with the intent to injure? That'll get you in more trouble than using a shotgun on somebody armed with a rock.\n \n \nOh and if the attacker doesn't have a gun then non-lethal gets a whole lot easier and if he doesn't have a gun then it's more likely you can have the opportunity to run away.\n \n \n Yeah if you can actually beat him. But I don't know any woman that can best a man in physical combat.\n \n \nSometimes the US legal system weirds me out. I mean here in Aus you forfeit the right to sue once you're trespassing. However the Police can always press charges if they feel you took unnecessary steps to protect your property like traps or beating the hell out of the trespasser (assuming he didn't attack you or something), but that's rare for the police. Most people don't overdo it when they protect their property because they don't use guns to do it.\n\n \n Blame the lawyers, they're responsible for most of the ills we're facing. Lawyers are the reason why fast food people have to display a warning to people that their coffee is hot and can cause burns.\n \n \nOh really? Is that why illicit drugs are banned? Or why any potentially dangerous object is required to have warning labels like: \"point away from face\"? There are many cases where government legislation protects people from themselves or their own idiocy, or protects children from myriad ways they can hurt themselves. The Government does have a role in protecting people from themselves as it does in protecting people from each other.\n\n \n The warning labels aren't the result of government intervention, it's the result of manufacturers who don't want to be sued because some XXXXX managed to hurt themselves and then turns around and says \"They didn't tell me it was dangerous, how was I supposed to know I'd get hurt?\"\n \n \nYeah, it's a real sticky legal situation. The government only licenses sellers as hunting knife sellers and that pretty much makes any Hunting/Combat knife not from these sellers illegal by default. The trouble is that hunting/combat knives are very similar if not identical. So when it comes to legal points it's usually whether or not you have a license to carry a knife like that, and that license is damn hard to get.\n\n \n Reminds me of California gun laws. The difference between a banned weapon and a legal weapon is sometimes so thin and so ambiguous, that the police have no way of telling if you're breaking the law or not.\n \n \nOn that note we have a bigger problem with illegal blade trade than with guns here. Hundreds of Combat Knives, throwing stars, Katanas, swords and the like are seized by border security every day! Hell even I have a swiss army knife, but I can have it because I don't take it outside (concealed weapon) and I don't use it. Because it's on my private property it's quite legal for me to have it, just not use it as a weapon.\n\n \n That's pitiful.\n \n \nI'm also telling those people to use some common sense. Also if you know any of those people, tell them they are XXXXXX. *facepalm*\n\n \n They're politicians, they already know they're XXXXXX.\n \n \nThat law would solve like nothing, people can just report their gun stolen as a theft, and presumably one would do that as soon as you found it missing. Seeing how guns are pretty valuable the police would probably take that seriously.\n\n \n Yeah they say it's to stop straw purchasers who buy their guns and then give them to criminals. Like the suppliers haven't thought or reporting this as a theft?\n \n \nThat's why they're the best tool for killing. Ranged tasers (ones that shoot a little electrified cable at the target) are the best (and coolest) tool for self defense as they also have no strength or skill requirement upon the user and there is no skill needed to avoid killing them with a taser.\n \n \n I don't think so. If that were the case then the police would have no cause to carry guns because they could just rely on tasers. I also don't like them because their maximum range is only 15 feet, and that's way too close for my comfort level.\n \n Tasers are also useless if somebody is trying to kick down your door to get to you, as you'd have to wait for them to actually break through the barrier before they can be used, whereas with a gun you can shoot through the barrier before they can get access to you.\n \n \nWith a gun you need skill not to kill the target.\n\n \n Not really. As we've said before guns aren't inherently deadly, you don't die just because you get shot; if that were the case you'd be dead from having your finger shot off.\n \n \nSilly UK, bans don't work. As we have seen. It doesn't always have to be a stepping stone.\n \n \n Not always, but often enough.\n \n \nDirect quote SBG. They're selling for sword enthusiasts as a hobby as in selling to people who don't want dumb replicas or fragile antiques, they probably went through a lot to protect themselves legally. Also the URL is American. On closer inspection they seem very legitimate actually. I'm actually quite amazed anyone bothered to set up something like that in Australia, it's quite a bit of work.\n\n \n Well you were the one who said swords were illegal in Australia. Or that it was illegal to import them.\n \n \nMost guys treat counseling like that. Doesn't mean it won't achieve anything.\n\n \n I'd prefer to have plans in place for those that don't want to cooperate.\n \n \nMaybe you wouldn't want to use it so much if these \"non-changers\" weren't armed with deadly guns.\n\n \n If somebody threatens my life, regardless of the tool they use, I want them to face serious prosecution.\n \n \nMaybe if less people were armed it would be nicer.\n \n \n Oh yeah like that would really affect the human rights violations that China is guilty of.\n \n \nI'd still feel bad afterwards about killing him/her. I'd always move to disable/disarm the attacker or delay him if the police were coming if at all possible. And if it came down to it then I'd seriously injure the attacker rather than kill them. And maybe, if there were no guns involved which is not too unlikely in Australia then it would be possible to flee from the attacker, or for me to take the hit while loved ones escaped.\n\n \n The problem with that is that the police don't always get there in an orderly manner. You might have a two hour wait before the police ever show up, and trying to delay your attacker for two hours just puts you and your loved ones in more and more danger.",

   " Bryan, your amazing legal knowledge and credentials have absolutely intimidated me.\n Now can it.\n I'm past the legal self-defense argument because of this interesting castle doctrine.\n And on another note, do you believe those laws are right? For what reasons?\n And this quote interested me:\n \"THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT [/b]the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened[/b], and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\" \n Sounds like the equating of weapons to me, the weapon you use is a pretty quantifiable measure of force. But never mind that, that's a topic for another forum. \n\n \n The \"castle doctrine\" is part of the legal self defense argument. It is a small part of the overall law of self defense which permits use of force, to include deadly force when reasonably necessary, to defend your home and its curtilage. In Virginia it is a hybrid doctrine which provides an exception to the general rule that you are not allowed to use or even threaten the use of deadly force to defend property. For example, if you walk upon someone breaking into your car in a parking lot you are not allowed to run them off by pulling a knife or a gun and threatening to shoot them, although I suspect threatening the use of deadly force to defend personal property happens regularly.\n \n The answer to the question of do I think the laws are right assumes you meant the laws I outlined for self-defense in Virginia. If so, then I believe all of them are proper and have withstood the test of time. The reasons I think they are proper could prove lengthy and if we want to have this discussion then I request you pick one aspect of the self-defense framework and ask specifically about that one. \n \n The instruction you cite back may sound like equating weapons to you, and I can see how the language is susceptible to that interpretation. But at the old common law \"reasonable in relation to the harm threatened\" meant no use of deadly force unless threatened with death or great bodily harm. As an extreme example-shooting a child who threatens you with a willow switch would not be a use of force \"reasonable in relation to the harm threatened.\" \n \n 200+ years of courts applying this standard in my state have consistently held that there is no equating of deadly weapons. Once a deadly weapon of any type is used to threaten then any deadly weapon at hand may be used in either self-defense or defense of others. There is no requirement that a person carry every possible means of defensive weapon because he must only meet a knife with a knife, a bat with a bat, a revolver with a revolver, etc. To do so would either gut the feasibility of exercising self defense or in the alternative require everyone to go around bristling with several weapons like Mad Max. \n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n [T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\" Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.",
