I'm just trying to show that it's pefectly possible to believe in Christianity and the Bible without believing in a literal Genesis, Fall, or Creation, and so there's no necessary conflict between being a good Christian and believing evolution. There are certainly certain branches of Christianity for which evolution is anathema, but that's a property of those particular branches, and not an inherent property of Christianity as a whole.\n\n i wouls suggest that \"brand\" of christianity that doesnt take genesis as literal is based on an unbiblical doctrine. as you demonstrated above, in order to remove the significance of genesis, you must fill in the gaps with explanations that are not based on, and sometimes contrary to, the bible. clearly, why even call that a christian if they are not folowing the pattern of christ, dont believe in redemption and original sin, and dont believe that this very redemption restores man back to the form man was originally intended to live.\n \n that said, i'm very curious to hear exactly how this \"brand\" of christian fits evolution into the scripture as a basis for their christianity. in order to do that, they'd need to:\n - understand exactly what the \"allegory\" of genesis represents\n - explain how man can be considered in the likeness of God presently\n - explain exactly why jesus died if there is no original sin\n - identify the time in history that God was first revealed to man\n - account for the souls of the homonid species before modern man\n \n so far, noone has even ever come close to scratching the surface on these questions. in fact, members of this \"brand\" of christianity become VERY hard to find when discussions like these arise. yet they are quick to pat themselves on the back for \"not being like those fundamentalists who reject science\". if your version of christianity is the right one, lets discuss it",

Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.\n\n The Bible explains that the \"sword\" of Jesus is His Word. It is the most important part of His mission. It was not meant to display an act of war against humans, but for an engagement with and against evil, to separate (cut asunder) the spirit and soul and into the heart of mankind. The Jews at the time would rather He taken a literal sword to their enemies, but that was not why He came. It was apparent to Him that mankind relied heavily on weapons against their enemies, specifically the sword. It was the most fearsome of weapons due to it being \"hand-held\" and able, at arm's length, to exact carnage at the desire, strength, and skill of the warrior. He proved that His word was much more compelling for in it was the power to raise the dead, give sight to the blind, cure disease, calm the storms, etc. In it was the power to forgive sins, which was considered by those that opposed Him, only that which God could do. Even so, with that evidence, they still declared Him a contemptuous blasphemer.\n \nSecond Paragraph:\n \"christianity teaches that jesus' purpose on earth was to die for mankind so forgiveness could be attained. in order to believe that you must believe that all men are sinful and need to be redeemed.\"\n I'm not entirely happy with the second sentence, but I'll accept it for the sake of argument.\n \"in order to believe that you must believe that all people are born in sin.\"\n Nope, I don't think that follows at all. There are more than enough opportunities for a person to sin in the course of their lives without being born with sin. Nor can I believe that a newborn babe is sinful, and is doomed to hell. At least, that most certainly doesn't fit in with the idea that the Lord is a just and merciful God. While it's possible that Jesus's grace is required for redemption from sin, I can't see how a just God would REQUIRE redemption for all of humanity for something that none of us actually did ourselves. And let me repeat, I'm not trying to show that your beliefs are wrong. I'm trying to show how someone can be a Christian and still not feel the need for Genesis to be literal.\n\n In this case \"born in sin,\" means that the world was ruled by sin. The very nature of man was and is sinful. That is why Christ preached that we must be born again. Even though this has taken on a political twist of late, it is still mandatory and should be held at high regard.\n The Law of God was the forerunner of Christ's mission, which was to be a sacrifice for all sins - what the Law could not do, since it was so weak due to man's nature, Christ did (in the likeness of sinful nature) on the cross, condemning sin.\n \nFourth Paragraph:\n \"genesis is the foundation of all the doctrines of christianity.\"\n With the coming of Jesus we have a new covenant. I'd say the Gospels are the basis of Christian doctrine, not any book in the Old Testament.\n\n The way I look at it is this - For example: Since Christ used Noah and the Flood in reference for His teaching about the conditions on earth at His 2nd coming, then Noah and the Flood had to be real. Did it happen in the literal sense - as the Bible teaches? I believe that it had to happen as the Bible states it did. What that particular event exactly was, I don't know. There are several ways that it was thought to have happened, but in any event you either take the Bible for truth in all parts are none of it is true. The weakest link in this specific chain makes the whole chain useless.\n \n I trust that science will someday discover the reason why \"The Flood\" gets so much publicity; why it is so controversial, etc. Will someone forcing the famous event's discovery find the answer? No. It could be liken to the dilemma of Einstein, who could not get past the fact that science was blotting out God no matter where he turned - or the Permian extinction reclassification. Who knows? Evidence points to one thing, but the answers are slow in coming, that is \"what the evidence really means\".

   "With the coming of Jesus we have a new covenant. I'd say the Gospels are the basis of Christian doctrine, not any book in the Old Testament.\n\n sorry for rehashing this, but it just jumped out at me as i reread it. didnt you just say that everything in the gospels are not to be taken as true (the point of my first paragraph, and the core definition of christianity)? now you are saying that we cannot take the old testament as true, not just because it too was written by \"common people\" but also because the new testament (which by your admission is unreliable) has overridden the old with the \"new covenant\". suppose this \"new covenant\", according to our unreliable new testament, is actually not what jesus said? i mean, would he really say something that would go against the scriptures that he regarded as holy? to me that doesnt sound like jesus now does it...\n \n wouldnt that also be the very reason why christians should also regard the old testament as true, since jesus did, and christianity means following jesus' lifestyle and philosophy?",

   "The Bible explains that the \"sword\" of Jesus is His Word. It is the most important part of His mission. It was not meant to display an act of war against humans, but for an engagement with and against evil, to separate (cut asunder) the spirit and soul and into the heart of mankind. The Jews at the time would rather He taken a literal sword to their enemies, but that was not why He came. It was apparent to Him that mankind relied heavily on weapons against their enemies, specifically the sword. It was the most fearsome of weapons due to it being \"hand-held\" and able, at arm's length, to exact carnage at the desire, strength, and skill of the warrior. He proved that His word was much more compelling for in it was the power to raise the dead, give sight to the blind, cure disease, calm the storms, etc. In it was the power to forgive sins, which was considered by those that opposed Him, only that which God could do. Even so, with that evidence, they still declared Him a contemptuous blasphemer.\n\n yes, orn, but bear in mind that our friends in this \"brand\" dont really believe in the factuality of jesus raising the dead, giving sight to the blind, curing disease, calming the storms, etc. since the reference to the \"sword\" was clearly a figure of speech, then these other events couldnt have been literal events either...\n \n \nThe way I look at it is this - For example: Since Christ used Noah and the Flood in reference for His teaching about the conditions on earth at His 2nd coming, then Noah and the Flood had to be real. Did it happen in the literal sense - as the Bible teaches? I believe that it had to happen as the Bible states it did. What that particular event exactly was, I don't know. There are several ways that it was thought to have happened, but in any event you either take the Bible for truth in all parts are none of it is true. The weakest link in this specific chain makes the whole chain useless.\n \n I trust that science will someday discover the reason why \"The Flood\" gets so much publicity; why it is so controversial, etc. Will someone forcing the famous event's discovery find the answer? No. It could be liken to the dilemma of Einstein, who could not get past the fact that science was blotting out God no matter where he turned - or the Permian extinction reclassification. Who knows? Evidence points to one thing, but the answers are slow in coming, that is \"what the evidence really means\". Science is our only means of discovering new data, exploring ideas, fitting together loose pieces of puzzles, and on and on. And God is our only means of discovering true peace and joy, absolute truth and meaning to life. Why separate the two? Are Christians afraid they will end up like Einstein? Why fear knowledge (science) that could fill the gaps left gaping by ignorance, and why doubt God that could fill the voids of life and make it more abundant?\n \n btw - I am not slapping myself on the back while straddling the fence... :p\n\n science's job is not to figure out why the flood story gets so much attention, we already know why. \n \n i agree that science, history, and all the other natural studies does not address the issues that religion does: higher purpose, soul and salvation, the after-life, etc. but i also agree with you that if you are going to only consider part of the bible true, then it might as well be cmpletely false. if the bible is the word of God, then it must be 100% true. if it is not 100% true, then it is not the word of God. somple as that\n \n here we have a huge chunk of the bible (not just genesis), which science provides contradictions to. 2 contradicting explanations cannot be both true. if science is true, it immediately and automatically falsifies the bible, and vice versa. the fact is, whichever is true is true. rejecting or believing something does not change the truth about it",

   "Unkerpaulie, I'm at work now, and so can't answer at great length. However, you've touched on something several times that I'd like to comment on. If I'm reading you wrong let me know. \n \n You have implied several times that if you can't trust the veracity of every line in the Bible, Old or New Testaments, than there's no reason to trust any of it at all. That if we cast doubt on any of it, then we must cast doubt on the whole thing. I see no reason to make that leap. Something can be 95% true. Something could be totally true to start with, and then someone stuck something false in later. \n \n So, if the Bible is only partially true, what are we supposed to do? As you said, being a Christian is to follows Jesus's teachings. Can we figure out Jesus's teachings from the Gospels? Sure, of course we can. Even if we don't assume that every single act or saying attirbuted to Jesus happened exactly as described, his message still comes through loud and clear. It's the message that we're supposed to hear and understand, not how many people ate how many fish. \n \n I'll go into more detail later when I have more time, but I hope this helps you understand why I don't think it's necessary for a Christian to hold every line in the Bible as literally true.",

We have a book written by wise and learned men with thousands of years of tradition behind it. A book full of beauty, wisdom, and even truth.

Or rather, something that was probably meant to be taken as not literally true when it was first written. Another example: Jesus said \"Love thy neighbor\" (Mat19:19) Did he really say that? Sure, if we don't accept the infallibility of the BIble we'll never know for sure. But that theme is echoed throughout the Gospels. It clearly agrees with Jesus's teachings.

We can never tell. All any of us can do is study as best as we can and come to the best conclusions that we're able to. Your conclusions have led you to believe that the BIble is all literal, even though that contradicts the physical evidence of the universe.

I believe, as do many Christians, that it's this study and effort which are important. A world where we don't have direct access to God's unadulterated word is a world with greater uncertainty, but after close study of both the Bible (not to mention other religious works) and the world, I have to conclude that that is in fact the world we live in.

   "if the bible is not a source of God-inspired truths, then it is but the best judgements and estimates of ancient jewish men. while their wisdom may be quite noteworthy, they actually have no more religious and spiritual authorithy than you, \n\n Thank you for the compliment. :) However, it's misplaced. The ancient Rabbis and sages who wrote the Old testament are far, far better versed in theology, and have far, far more wisdom than I could ever hope to have. That's why the Old Testament has value, even if much of it isn't literally true. Also, I should point out that something can be a God-inspired truth without being literal. Jesus said \"I am the door\", a clear metaphor. If part of the Bible is metaphorical, than clearly other parts can be as well. Right?\n \n \n in fact, christianity as a whole need not be anything more than a person's best judgements and estimates. obviously, truth cannot be derived but these methods, \n\n Why? Are people XXXXXX? Are we completely without moral compass? Do we have no ablility to discern truth from falsehood, good from evil? The answer to that must be no, if you believe that people are capable of moral choices at all.\n \n \n\n whats the point of this effort. we know that at least some of the bible is false. what percentage of the bible is false? 10% 30% 90%? we have nothing to work with except the fact that not 100% is true. added to that is the complication that we dont know which parts are true and which are not, because they are not labelled.\n\n The point of the effort is to better understand Jesus's message, which most would consider a noble effort. And we do have something to work with; the intellect, wisdom, and moral compass that we all posses to a greater or lesser degree. And while we don't know exactly which parts of the Bible are true, it can be assumed that the truth is in there, if one has the dedication to search for it. If would be easier if everything was labeled with a big T or F, but who ever said that wisdom was easy? \n \n \n\n lets use a rational approach to glean away what is false. lets assume that none of the miracles described ever happened. \n\n What could possibly lead you to make this assumption? We're talking about faith. We're talking about belief. If you believe in God then you must believe in the possibility of miracles. This assumption has no basis at all.\n \n \n \n\n its not growth, its a foundation shift. your entire premises of your religion is continually being adjusted. if your religion wasnt true yesterday, how come its true today? wasnt God truthful yesterday?\n \n\n Growth, generally speaking, comes in small, incremental changes. I'm not talking about pitching out your entire belief system and adopting a new one on a daily basis. I'm talking about having your understanding of God's truth grow. Remember, it's not God's truth that's changing, it's your wisdom and ability to undertand it that is. Can you trully claim that your current understanding of God is perfect in every respect?

   "Thank you for the compliment. :) However, it's misplaced. The ancient Rabbis and sages who wrote the Old testament are far, far better versed in theology, and have far, far more wisdom than I could ever hope to have. That's why the Old Testament has value, even if much of it isn't literally true. Also, I should point out that something can be a God-inspired truth without being literal. Jesus said \"I am the door\", a clear metaphor. If part of the Bible is metaphorical, than clearly other parts can be as well. Right?\n\n theology: the study of the nature of God and religious truth. obviously, the people that created the religion and its precepts would be more learned in the theology of their own religion. in fact, they would have absolute knowledge of everything concerning their religion. it doesnt mean they know anything about God. anybody can establish a religion and lay down its precepts. the existence of God is irrelevant.\n \n \nWhy? Are people XXXXXX? Are we completely without moral compass? Do we have no ablility to discern truth from falsehood, good from evil? The answer to that must be no, if you believe that people are capable of moral choices at all.\n\n if your judgement and best guess about something is x, and mine is y, then by our judgements and best guesses about that something alone, we cannot determine the truth about it. truth can only be reliably determined by objective means. it doesnt in anyway mean that the person making the best guess or judgement is an idiot, or even that he is wrong. however, it does mean that the best guess and judgement must be recognized for what it is, and cannot be treated as fact (regardless of if it is true or not)\n \n \nThe point of the effort is to better understand Jesus's message, which most would consider a noble effort. And we do have something to work with; the intellect, wisdom, and moral compass that we all posses to a greater or lesser degree. And while we don't know exactly which parts of the Bible are true, it can be assumed that the truth is in there, if one has the dedication to search for it. If would be easier if everything was labeled with a big T or F, but who ever said that wisdom was easy? \n\n your admission that intellect, wisdom and moral cognizance varies from person to person is enough to realize that even though your judgement and is different from mine, you have no way of knowing if you are correct or not. the ONLY assumption we can make about the bible is that it contains falsshoods. we cannot assume that it contains truth, since we have no way of verifying any of the truths therein.\n \n \nWhat could possibly lead you to make this assumption? We're talking about faith. We're talking about belief. If you believe in God then you must believe in the possibility of miracles. This assumption has no basis at all.\n\n i am working with exactly the same logic that you are working with, ie., that if it doesnt seem logical or fits the ideal i already have, then it cannot be true. i am free to make the assumption that all miraculous acts that defies the laws of science are therefore only \"allegories\" and not to be taken literally. you cannot judge my method of deduction, because it is the same as yours.\n \n it requires as much faith to believe that jesus resurrected himself as it does that God furnished this planet with life in 6 days. since you reject the literal 6 day creation because it contradicts science, then you are not applying faith in that regard. if i reject the literal resurrection of jesus because it contradicts science, then i am not applying faith there either. yet we are both rejecting the parts of the bible that our knowledge of science tells us is conflicting to reality. we are working with the exact same method. how are you to tell me that my method is wrong? is it that you are free to drop your faith when you see fit but i am not?\n \n \nGrowth, generally speaking, comes in small, incremental changes. I'm not talking about pitching out your entire belief system and adopting a new one on a daily basis. I'm talking about having your understanding of God's truth grow. Remember, it's not God's truth that's changing, it's your wisdom and ability to undertand it that is. Can you trully claim that your current understanding of God is perfect in every respect? Of course not. That being the case, you should be striving to improve your understanding, and thus grow.\n\n if today, based on my knowledge, i believe that the flood was true, and tomorrow, based on new knowledge, i believe that the flood is false, then the truth about the flood, from my perspective, has changed. i cannot take everything i read in the bible as true, because everything in the bible is not true. therefore i must evaluate what i read logically, then deliberate and reference it with external information, before deciding if such is true. the faith that you spoke of earlier is non-effect. i cannot accept what i read in the bible as true, based on faith, because there is now an inherent doubt associated with anything the bible says. concerning any given scripture, i could be wrong to believe it for what it says. reading the bible becomes not an exercise in faith, but in skepticism\n \n \nThe persistant point that I've gotten from your arguments is that you don't seem to believe that people can discern truth from falsehood, good from evil, on their own. You seem to think that only by following a very rigid set of literal instructions can people do this. If you truly believe this, than I can understand why you believe a literal Bible to be necessary. Is this really what you think? Becasue if it is, it really isn't a position which stands up to close scrutiny. But if it isn't what you think than most of your arguments make little sense to me. Please let me know which it is.\n\n of course people can live \"good lives\" without the bible, the evidence is abundant (depending on your definition of a \"good life\"). it is not that people cannot make best guesses and judgements about things like right, wrong, good or evil. it is just that the objective truth about right, wrong, good and evil cannot be deduced via best guesses and judgements. \n \n if people can already discern wrong, right, truth, falsehoods, good and evil independent of the bible or christianity or any religious association, what use are these things?",

All any of us can do is live our lives based on our own judgments. Even your belief that the Bible is the literal truth is, in the end, just your best guess. It's a conclusion you reached, based on what you think is right. And, like every other conclusion reached throughout history by us imperfect humans, it could be wrong.

Granted, there's no way to logically support or connect these statements, but why should there be? All that matters is if they contradict, which they don't, as far as I can see. Further, we can add a belief in evolution to that list, and there's still no contradiction. That's how someone can be a Christian and still belive in evolution.

I'm going out on a limb here, but when I hear from God it's not in language, or in spoken words, so to speak, it's in (sort of) a vision...and not the melodramatic variety you hear so much of.

What is missing is this: If the Bible were not considered to be God's literal word, would it change the message that God gave to a chosen few? I don't think it would one bit. That's why it is written in such a manner. God knew that if He wrote a book Himself with whatever proof we would consider sufficient, that sooner or later our own way of dealing with it would put us back to where we are today. In an effort to allow mankind to make up his own mind He gave his words to a chosen few and let them write it down so that it could pertain to any human being. The message will not change simply because one generation sees a horse that runs faster than a cheetah and in our generation we see that same thing as tank or Humvee. The Bible is a divine gift to man from God to be taken as Holy...period. They are written in such a way that they cannot be fully understood without His Spirit so that the Powers of Darkness cannot hear it.

I don't think you can show that the phrases \"jesus is lord\" and \"the bible is not the literal word of God\" actually conflict in anyway, and so there's no reason for someone not to believe them both at the same time.\n\n but they do conflict because of the fact that the bible, which is not the literal word of God, says that jesus christ is lord. the possibility exists that jesus christ may not be lord, because we cannot rely on any part of the bible as absolute truth\n \n \nNo external assurance. And yet people believe anyway. That's faith for you.\n\n faith is also applied in believing that the boogeyman will get you if you dont go to bed early. too bad so many people think any of that stuff in the bible is real...",

   "I don't believe that God intended humans to \"hear\", in the literal sense, His detailed word - as you and I hear each other when we talk. I'm going out on a limb here, but when I hear from God it's not in language, or in spoken words, so to speak, it's in (sort of) a vision...and not the melodramatic variety you hear so much of. I think God is aware of our weaknesses, especially our cradle-to-the-grave mentality, and does not expect us understand. Another reason His Spirit (Helper - Psalms 54:4; Hebrews 13:6) is here for us.\n\n again, the bible would mislead us into thinking that it is possible to actually hear from God. this is because the bible is loaded with instances of God talking to people. whole chapters and passages in the old testament begin with the cause \"and the Lord said\". however, we now know that God does not speak in this way. therefore, nothing that the old testament authors said God said was actually said by God. in fact, what they wrote God said was no more than their best guesses and judgements of what theyd like to think God said, or would have said in such a situation.\n \n orn, you do realize that your belief about how God communicates with men is unbibilical, dont you?\n \n \nNo, but the message would.\n\n how? did they paraphrase? did they summarize? did they record the important points? if they didnt actually hear anything from God, but wrote down that they did, then they were clearly trying to be deceitful. what message could they possibly be trying to convey that we could assume had anything to do with God?\n \n \nI am aware of those that point out errors and I can't argue with the evidence they provide, but it does not take away the effective elements of the message. The power of God's word is still there and would be there if all the Bibles in the world were burned to a crisp. What is missing is this: If the Bible were not considered to be God's literal word, would it change the message that God gave to a chosen few? I don't think it would one bit. That's why it is written in such a manner. God knew that if He wrote a book Himself with whatever proof we would consider sufficient, that sooner or later our own way of dealing with it would put us back to where we are today. In an effort to allow mankind to make up his own mind He gave his words to a chosen few and let them write it down so that it could pertain to any human being. The message will not change simply because one generation sees a horse that runs faster than a cheetah and in our generation we see that same thing as tank or Humvee. The Bible is a divine gift to man from God to be taken as Holy...period. They are written in such a way that they cannot be fully understood without His Spirit so that the Powers of Darkness cannot hear it. Furthermore, as the Bible states, had Evil known that Jesus was Christ, it would not have killed Him. Evil knew the scriptures as good or better than any rabbi, but the one method by which man was capable of hearing and seeing, Evil could not - the Holy Spirit.\n Those that have ears (hearing through the Holy Spirit) let him hear...those that have eyes (through the Spirit) let him see.\n I believe that the Bible is written perfectly to suit its purpose.\n \n I can't see anywhere in the Bible that is polluted with errors, but have heard and read many, many opinions on it.\n\n i can list the errors if you like, just off the top of my head i could give you about 50 out of the first 5 books. \n \n again, what could be this message given to this chosen few? what about the truth God made available to men millenia ago that would not be available today? why cant the same results they got be achieved by doing the same things they did? your \"chosen few\" theory doesnt hold any water, i'm sorry.\n \n the idea that only a chosen few had access to any significant influence, particularly religious access or direct communication with God himself, was and is a ploy used in politics to keep the masses in subjection. \"do what the king says, lest ye feel the wrath of god!!\" it was all invented by men, for the same reason boogeyman stories were invented by parents.",

   "therefore being a christian and not being a christian could well be identical lifestyles. the label would just be arbitrary. whats the point?\n\n The point? Well, my point is that the label Christian can apply to lots of different people, with lots of different beliefs. Include those who don't believe in a literal Bible.\n I see what you're saying though. If a label tells you nothing about a group, why have the label, right? I guess most people would have as a bare minimum requirement that a Christian believe in the divinity of Christ. I'm sure that someone out there would disagree, and some would insist on more, but if you want a meaningful label, I guess that's where I would start.\n \n \n\n but they do conflict because of the fact that the bible, which is not the literal word of God, says that jesus christ is lord. the possibility exists that jesus christ may not be lord, because we cannot rely on any part of the bible as absolute truth.\n\n That's not a conflict, that's just uncertainty. To show conflict, you need to start with \"bible isn't literal\" and \"jesus is lord\" and progress to a point where you have two statements which logically must be true based on your assumptions, and yet contradict. Simply showing that you're not sure, or that you can't prove something, isn't enough.\n \n \n \n\n faith is also applied in believing that the boogeyman will get you if you dont go to bed early. too bad so many people think any of that stuff in the bible is real...\n\n I'm missing your point here.

They know that many of literalists beliefs are wrong, and so abandon those bits. You see that as a debasment of faith, I see it as growth.\n \n \n \n I think we've reached the point where our defintions and philosophies are at basic odds with each other. I've enjoyed this quite a bit, but I'm not optimistic about us being able to go any further without just rehashing what we've said up to this point. What do you think?",

   "again, the bible would mislead us into thinking that it is possible to actually hear from God. this is because the bible is loaded with instances of God talking to people. whole chapters and passages in the old testament begin with the cause \"and the Lord said\". however, we now know that God does not speak in this way. therefore, nothing that the old testament authors said God said was actually said by God. in fact, what they wrote God said was no more than their best guesses and judgements of what theyd like to think God said, or would have said in such a situation.\n\n God does not speak in what way? What part of communication is not considered speaking? Does there have to be a limit or a stipulation on how God speaks to man?\n I think we need to get on the same page. When Israel was gathered together to hear from God they thought that it would be audible or normal speech, however, after God had spoken to them they begged Moses not to let it happen again for they were frightened. It's not the words that God speaks, it's the way He goes about communicating with us that's important. If Daniel said, \"And the Lord spake unto me, saying...\", then all that we care about is the message that God delivered to Daniel, not the precise wording. The words that Daniel had \"heard\" may not even sound the same as saying it in English, but the message would be the same. No one can say how God communicates. I know I can't, but one thing is for certain - it's not like that of you and me.\n \norn, you do realize that your belief about how God communicates with men is unbibilical, dont you?\n\n How so, pray tell...\n Is it other than a small, still voice? Through a donkey? In the thunder? Just what is your idea of how God speaks to man? Or, how He spoke to those that wrote the scriptures? Have we crammed knowledge of God so far back in the closet that we now put human traits to Him? Should we classify God as having only human attributes in order to define Him? Of the members here, what percentage believe that God really \"speaks\" to mankind these days? 2%? Less?\n \n I'll make a poll.\n \nhow? did they paraphrase? did they summarize? did they record the important points? if they didnt actually hear anything from God, but wrote down that they did, then they were clearly trying to be deceitful. what message could they possibly be trying to convey that we could assume had anything to do with God?\n\n I can't say. How can I tell you how they heard from God when I can't explain how I do? All I know is that the wording in the Bible is there as a completed work. Even though there have been many translations, the same powerful message still holds true today as it did back then. I believe that the Bible is Holy because it is the direct word of God to man, written by man, for man. If it conflicts with evidence that's considered irrefutable, then so be it. I have all the proof I need to live a life free of fear and doubt because of what the Bible says. To me that's power beyond all physical evidence.\n \ni can list the errors if you like, just off the top of my head i could give you about 50 out of the first 5 books. \n\n I've read and heard them, but can't agree or disagree without proper research...except to say that the Bible states what it states and I believe it first and foremost.\n Also, would it suffice to say that some parts of the Bible are meant to be seen/understood only through spiritual means?\n \nagain, what could be this message given to this chosen few? what about the truth God made available to men millenia ago that would not be available today? why cant the same results they got be achieved by doing the same things they did? your \"chosen few\" theory doesnt hold any water, i'm sorry.\n\n In a nutshell: Christ is better than that which was ages ago. But, I think the gist of your post requires more. Who were the chosen few? They were the \"prophets of old\"; those that sought God and/or God called them to be His messengers. Even now there are those that bring the true message of the Bible to those that can't grasp it. But, the words in the Bible are dead to them that don't seek His Spirit and takes on about as much meaning as any other historical document. It's only when the Bible comes alive that it makes sense, anyway. And the only way for the Bible to come alive is through His Helper.\n \nthe idea that only a chosen few had access to any significant influence, particularly religious access or direct communication with God himself, was and is a ploy used in politics to keep the masses in subjection. \"do what the king says, lest ye feel the wrath of god!!\" it was all invented by men, for the same reason boogeyman stories were invented by parents.\n\n I didn't say that only a chosen few had His influence, the contrary, really. Those that heeded the prophets faired quite well as a matter of fact. Just because mankind considered (and still does) words of freedom to be those of oppression doesn't change the message. I'm aware of and am opposed to the modern religionists' standards of who and what God is and how He speaks or should speak to me, but the Bible is the true source of it all.",

   "Evolution doesn't address the issue of origins. It remains to be seen whether life can be created in the lab. Even if it is not possible to create life in the lab it does not preclude evolution.

It is entirely possible that in certain conditions the right combination of energy and chemicals will produce a simple organism, such as a virus or ameoba.

The big bang theory is open to challenge, it was named big bang theory by one of its dissenters. The reason there is so little dissent at the moment is that it is the theory that best fits the evidence. The reason no scientist in his right mind challenges the big bang theory is because the evidence doesn't support challenging it. If and when it does, theory will change. Same as the understanding of gravity changed when relativity was suggested, same as the understanding of the atom changed with the construction of the standard model. The expanding universe model fits observed data, if the universe is not expanding then it has to contract due to gravity. To compare physics and piltdown man is false. Piltdown man was a deliberate hoax, there is a clear disctinction between the potential for misreading the evidence in good faith and deliberate forgery. Where is the deliberate forgery of evidence in cosmology.

The Ekpyrotic theory still relies on expansion, and presumably on the red shifts that indicate this expansion. What we have, in effect, is two different models attempting to explain the current observed phenomena. Reading that link, the Ekpyrotic model is based on string theory, which is currently conjecture. That's not to say it isn't true, but the current big bang model is more widely accepted as it fits with other current theories.\n\n \n It is not quite string theory, but rather does not invalidate string theory... which is why the string theorists are interested in it. It does actually make some testable predictions that are different than the current big bang model.. we just have not built the right detection instruments yet.

In dry weather birds with a beak size over a certain critical threshold had a significantly higher survival rate. There is a mathematically verifiable relationship between a genetically heretible trait and survival.\n \n And your idea about speciation is incorrect. It isn't that different speices can't interbreed, it's that they don't tend to. The big billed and small billed finches do occasionally interbreed. The resulting bird has a bill too small to eat the large seeds, but a body size too large to survive on small seeds, and so has a very low survival rate.

I think Peddler deserves an award for bringing about the quickest and most numerous responses I've seen on this forum (in my short time here). \n \n I couldn't resist the urge to insert my own definition of information, which is \"data placed into context.\" I think this might address Peddler's issues, which seems to be that information has to be meaningful to an intelligence to be rightly called \"information.\" In other words, we're able to recieve data from the our rock and when it's placed in our frameworks, it becomes useful \"information\".\n \n I've actually gone back and forth with Tastyfish about this and I can't say that anything was resolved conclusively - it seems that we each have our own definitions and we're all pretty dang sure that we're right. Does this mean that this is an irreconcilable debate? Maybe, but we might be able to at least address Peddler's original assumptions that brought about this debate: that species can't evolve because new genetic information (\"information\" meaning genetic sequences) can't be added, only changed. I suggested transposons, which is what little I know about the issue. Maybe someone has some better info than I?",
