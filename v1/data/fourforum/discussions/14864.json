   "Employers Added 103,000 in December; Jobless Rate Falls to 9.4% - DailyFinance\n \n \nOver the past three months, the economy has added an average of 128,000 jobs. That's just enough to keep up with the population growth. Nearly double is generally needed to significantly reduce the unemployment rate.\n \n But other factors can affect the unemployment rate, at least temporarily. One key reason for the drop was that the government no longer counts people as unemployed when they stop looking for work.\n \n Fewer people said they were out of work last month. The number of unemployed fell by more than 500,000 to just under 14.5 million, the lowest since April 2009.\n \n Still, the unemployment rate has topped 9 percent for 20 months, the longest such streak on record. And even with last year's job gains, the unemployment rate fell only from 9.7 percent to 9.4 percent.\n\n \n Considering that the Government no longer counts those who have stopped Looking for work as unemployed I can see where the numbers would drop. I would be interested in finding the Actual Number of unemployed, As it's my belief that the number more than likely went up rather than down. I mean how could they NOT count someone based on the fact they have ' stopped Looking\" for work. These people , or at least many of them, are still not employed are they not?..\n Either a person has found a job therefore they are no longer looking, or their benefits ran out so they gave up and turned to other means to make ends meet. Considering the extension on Unemployment benefits and the factor in the increase in people turning to Government and state welfare programs to replace the unemployment checks, what would the actual impact be on the Economy. \n \n Also a question ...\n Do you think it is the Governments Duty to create new Jobs?. I personally don't believe that the Government should take the brunt of the blame for Unemployment. Although they can take some blame, probably a larger part of it, Is it really the Job of Government to create work?.",

They stop looking because they have come to the realization that there are simply no jobs out there. That does not make them any less unemployed. \n \n \nAlso a question ...\n Do you think it is the Governments Duty to create new Jobs?.

So no one really knows what the actual unemployment rate would be if they added those people back in.. I bet it would be 13 % or even higher. \n \n I saw a new report on this tonight on the World News.. The numbers they gave for the Drop are the same but they reported about 30,000 more jobs created than the Article I posted. It's looking like no one really knows what they're doing other than tossing out some numbers to give people false hope.",
