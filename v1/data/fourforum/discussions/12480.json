   "So, I get up this morning, do my running, putter around in my shop for a while, then come inside, sit down at the computer and go to googles news page...the business section...and immediately see that durable goods orders are unexpectedly UP this month. What a pleasant surprise! Then I see this:\n \n Revisions Offset Durable-Goods Orders Climb - WSJ.com\n \n \nWASHINGTON -- Durable goods orders unexpectedly climbed during February, but demand in the prior month was revised down deeply, an adjustment countering the idea of a rebound in the slumping manufacturing sector.\n\n \n \nManufacturers' orders for long-lasting goods increased by 3.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted $165.56 billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\n \n The 3.4% increase was a big surprise. Wall Street expected a decline of 2.0% for February. It was the largest increase since 4.1% in December 2007.\n \n But durables, which are goods designed to last at least three years, plunged 7.3% in January, revised way down from a previously estimated 4.5% decrease.\n\n \n They \"missed\" durable goods by 2.8%? A .3% miss in durable goods is a big one. Do they have somebody's KID doing these? \n \n Earlier this year, they missed GDP by over 3%, and they have consistently missed on jobs date by over 100,000 jobs.",

   "For what it is worth you can find them at the actual site too: Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, & Orders (M3)\n \n I actually wonder if the administration is playing with the numbers because people see the initial number and don't care if it is revised the next month...after all it can only make things look better if the previous month went down. \n \n It is interesting to note that most of the gain was from defense...something I thought we were getting out of according to Obama.\n \n I'd also like to point out that Bloomberg did not cover the revision in their article. \n \n Makes you wonder if we are just trying to mask this problem and hope it goes away. I mean you see this kinda stuff with the fed, congress, and banks (see Citi).",

   "I usually dont bother downloading direct from the source unless the numbers come out really wacky. \n \n I, too, noticed that most of the gain was in defense, and there is a good chance that a reasonably large portion of non defense manufacturing was non defense specific parts going to defense. \n \n I am a little concerned about that.

If I was a conspiracy theorist I would point out that this is the first time since the civil war that we have had actively deployed regular army in the US and would wonder if the Obama administration is not doing a rushed resupply of the military because they see a strong possibility of expanded use. \n \n Since I am NOT a conspiracy theorist, I will just assume they are lumping it to give the false impression of growth.",

Frankly I deal with accounting/auditing since that is my job and I don't have the time to learn everything there is. So I tell you this because I still \"get it\". With little to no effort anyone can understand this mess and have a reasonable solution. \n \n We go back and forth here and frankly we don't get many intelligent responses from other forum members which seems to be reflected in the society as a whole. People have their biases which clouds judgment instead of going from facts to conclusion.\n \n Anyway, I post the actual sources to let people know that this stuff is really out there. There is no doubt about the facts (well...after a few revisions ha). We can see defense spending is hiding true growth. These things are real and until congress, other than ron paul, start paying attention...or anyone for that matter...we are in trouble.",

   "Daewoo, created unreality is a legacy of the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Rove Regime:\n \nGeorge W. Bush ... has steadily, inexorably, changed the office itself. He has created the faith-based presidency....\n \n the very heart of the Bush presidency.\n \n The aide said that guys like me were ''in what we call the reality-based community,'' which he defined as people who ''believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.'' I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. ''That's not the way the world really works anymore,'' he continued. ''We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'' \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html\n \n Just like selling make-believe assets like derivatives and credit default swaps which are a whole bunch of nothing.",
