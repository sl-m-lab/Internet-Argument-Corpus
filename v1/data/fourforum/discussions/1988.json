   "If it's a blackout or a plain crash they'd never tell it was a terrorist act these days. For one big reason: elections are approaching. For the same reason we've been teaching others how to combat the evil.\n You see nobody wants big problems for the acting president who is supposed to guard his citizens' peaceful life. Moreover others are supposed to learn from our experience. But **** happens. Sometimes facts come out at wrong time.\n So I heard the last week plain crash in California was nothing but an act of terrorism, so as the fire in Miami...\n They keep mum 'bout it. No wonder.\n I remember Dick Cheney saying in StLouis recently that people shouldn't forget about the threat of terrorism and they should be constantly aware that the threat still exists.\n We are. We aren't let to forget about it. In every newspaper and every day on TV we've been warned about the 'coming Al Qaida revenge against America'. FOR TWO YEARS. Nothing happens.\n We're s'posed to be on our toes all the time and become neurasthenics with the one and only aim to give our voices to Bush who is not only good in security matters, but has wonderfully helped our economy out of the crises by unleashing a war and thus exposing American nation to terrorism. But that's another story.\n Let's get back to the subject at hand. They want us to believe that Al Qaida is some force operating from outside of the country.\n After Sept. 11 terrible things can happen in Spain, Britain or France, but not here, not any more. Because we have perfect spooks to feel safe, we develop the NMD against terrorists and terrorist sponsors and we've almost destroyed Al Qaida in Afghanistan and Iraq...\n To the most part of this is NOT true. Our spook agencies have slept through the Sept.11 (or were ordered to?). There was NO terrorism center. Neither in Afghanistan, nor in Iraq. Terrorists have lots of money and prefer Europe and America to poor Middle East countries. The NMD leaves much to be desired. Moreover the anthrax case, the blackout and the 19 pilots who had been trained INSIDE America will never make me feel safe.\n We are not safe at all. Most of us are not aware to what extent.\n The threats the government combats are artificial and play into its hands. But the real threat is being covered up.\n We are sitting on a barrel of gunpowder.",
