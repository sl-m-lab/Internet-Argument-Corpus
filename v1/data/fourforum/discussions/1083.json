Additionally, it is contrary to federal law to import nuclear weapons into the United States.\n \n Furthurmore, a nuclear weapon cannot be used in self-defense, for obvious reasons. \n \n Being prohibited from owning an AR-15 infringes upon the Second Amendment.

No one has ever been able to explain to me why that phrase it there unless it specifically intends to link ownership of weapons to membership in the militia. Were this not true, if the writers of the 2nd Amentment actually meant that the it is the \"unalienable right\" of every individual to own a firearm, then only the part that begins with, \"the right of the people...\" is necessary.\n \n Perhaps it would help to understand what the militia is. It is provided for in the Constitution.\n \nTo provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; \n \n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\n\n That is from Article I that specifies the duties of Congress. So it would seem that the right to keep and bear arms is in the second meaning of that phrase, to serve as a soldier rather than just carry a weapon. So those who exercise their right are at the call of Congress, which body would then be responsible for arming, disciplining and governing them.\n \n And, of course, the President also has duties and powers that pertain to the militia.\n \nThe President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States;\n\n Perhaps the intent of the framers of the Constitution might be clearer with a little background, like the Virginia Constitution of 1776. Pay special attention to section 13.\n \nThat a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n\n It is the right of the people (not of persons) that shall not be infringed, the right stated in the Virginia Constitution to train the body of the people in arms in order to defend the free state.\n \n This is clearly the intent of the 2nd Amendment.\n \n It is also interesting to note the list of grievences that concludes the Virginia Constitution. Many of them are quite similar, if not identical, to the Declaration.\n \n Another point that is always ignored by the \"unalienable right\" people is that the Bill of Rights were not written as \"unalienable rights.\" The Bill of Rights applied to Congress. You can tell because the 1st Amendment begins with \"Congress shall pass no law...\" Since then there have been other Amendments that have expanded the original scope of the Constitution. The 14th Amendment guarantees all citizens the right to due process and equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has incorporated several Amendments against the states under the 14th Amendment. However, several have not. For example, the Constitutional ban against the quartering of troops in a private home has never been applied to the states in a court of law. The reason is simple. No state has ever tried to quarter troops. I'm pretty sure that if it should happen, the state would be found in violation of the Constitution.\n \n But neither has a 2nd Amendment case been applied to the States by the Supreme Court. It isn't as if there hasn't been a chance. The Supreme Court has just declined to hear such cases, thus allowing states and local governments to make laws that abridge the rights to keep and bear arms. In other words, most local gun control laws are probably Constitutional.\n \n If you want that changed, then violate the law and then make you case in such a way that the Supreme Court will listen and decide in your favor.\n \nThe Second Amendement means exactly today as it did when it was ratified in 1789, and only a constitutional amendment can change that!\n\n Yes. That's true. But the question is, did it mean that everyone has an unrestricted right to carry firearms? I don't think so, otherwise the militia wouldn't have been considered. If you want to bear arms (in the defense of your country), then join the militia. Today we call the militia the National Guard.",

The Supreme Court has just declined to hear such cases, thus allowing states and local governments to make laws that abridge the rights to keep and bear arms. In other words, most local gun control laws are probably Constitutional.\n \n If you want that changed, then violate the law and then make you case in such a way that the Supreme Court will listen and decide in your favor.\n \n Yes. That's true. But the question is, did it mean that everyone has an unrestricted right to carry firearms? I don't think so, otherwise the militia wouldn't have been considered. If you want to bear arms (in the defense of your country), then join the militia. Today we call the militia the National Guard.\n\n \n \n \"It targets civilians, not criminals. It's criminalizing the tool, while allowing the one that used that tool to get out a few years after his crime. \n \n And what's more, a lot of folks, myself included, believe that the right to keep and bear arms is not a civil right, but a natural right - it's a right of all people in all nations, regardless of how their law is written. The 2d Amendment is just putting fact into words.\n \n Who kills more people - civilians or the government? When we talk about civilian mass murderers, I don't think we ever get above a hundred (with the possible exception of Sept. 11). When we talk about governments, we regularly get thousands, if not millions.\n __________________\n Actually, gun control criminalizes the civilian population. There is absolutely, positively no such thing as liberty in the absence of serious firepower. For liberty to exist, the civilian population MUST have equal or greater means by which to project force than the government. That is a condition that must be met, otherwise liberty begins to be limited.\n \n Gun control is the theory of subserviance to a government power. The idea that one actually has the right to project force in defense of themselves or for the preservation of their liberty is despised by many. \n \n Most Americans believe that you do not have the right to project force. This is because the government has worked hard over the last 150 years to mold society into that way of thinking.\n \n It criminalizes citizens because it criminalizes the WILL of the people. It makes it against the law for you to have an opinion, or even to have a say in your own life. People don't get it at all. They say, \"you're wrong, you can still vote\"..But that's nonsense. You have ZERO rights the moment you LOSE the ability to force the government to do the will of the people. When you lose that ability, all rights instantly become privileges given to you by the state.\n \n The only way not to be a criminal is to not harbor such thoughts. In order to do that, you must become a slave of the state. They own your property, they own your money, they own your life. You pay rent to own your home in the form of property taxation, if you don't pay, they take it away. Do you really \"own\" it? No. You can be drafted to fight in a war against your will. If you don't go, you will be sent to prison. This is slavery. You have no control over your own life - it belongs to them. Either your physical life and body will be used against your will, or you will be caged like an animal, in which case you are being denied life. In either situation, your life is taken away from you against your will.\n \n You can stand up to this, but you will be arrested and you will lose in THEIR courts. You can recognize this fact, and stand up to being arrested. They will then use force to arrest you. You can use force to resist arrest. They will then try and kill you. The logical conclusion of liberty is the use of force to defend it. Each side will up the ante until it comes down to one side is going to end up dead. If neither side compromises or gives in, the matter MUST be settled by force. That's sad, that we live in a world where liberty is challenged by the threat of lethal force. Your life is used against you to limit your liberty. \n \n We basically live in a world where they force you to kil them because that is how relentless their tyrannical agenda is. We don't do that though. Instead, we take the abuses. However, we like to reserve the means by which we can resist IF the abuses become too great, or our threshold of tolerance is reached.\n \n \n That it why it is crucial that the civilian population maintain its Right to keep and bear arms. This is why gun-control is the central enemy of a free society.\n -Geronimo45 from THR\n \n Our right to bear arms, is, in fact, and unaliable right. Nevertheless, many states have directly violated the constitution and put strict controls on guns, such as california.\n \n Back then, the Musket was the finest assult weapon of its day, yet it wasnt banned.\n \n Citizens should be armed at all times. It keeps our government in line. Kind of like disciplining a child. Even though the child hates it, it is necessary. Gun control is like stopping the discipline.",

   "Frankly, you should care. You should think about when these amendments were documented, and what the social climate of america was like at the time. You should ask yourself if america has changed since this was written. You should ask yourself why the amendment has not changed since this was written. The fact is that america is vastly different from the way it was in the 1700's. If you don't believe this, look for the statistics on how many school shootings occured in the 1700's to how many occured in the 1990's. Even at ten to one odds there is no argument. I think it makes sense to enact laws / constitutional amendments that make sense for modern day america. I do not believe or support a ban on guns, but i think we must be willing to comprimise on some freedom to attain a higher level of security.\n\n \n I agree, the social climate was vastly different when the Constitution was framed. Therefore, I think we should question every right granted to us by the Constitution. Since so many people seem to be offended these days by what others are saying, maybe we should rethink that whole freedom of speech nonsense. And since these days the New York Times is divulging national secrets, maybe we should eliminate the freedom of the press. None of these freedoms apply anymore because the \"social climate\" is different, right? This is a dangerous argument you pose, and it will lead to nothing but the government attempting to justify removing more rights from the people in the name of security or because of a differing \"social climate.\" I don't really care how much society has changed, people still have the right to defend themselves. I think the framers of the Constitution intended the right to keep and bear arms in order to fight against the government if needed. Am I wrong?",

Many people forget the early 20th century and the failed experiment of alcohol prohbition. The only way to make sure that all guns are registered and in the hands of the people who actually registered them is to allow the general public to purchase nearly any kind of firearm they want. Prohbition always leads to a black market. Cannibus and other recreational drugs are illegal, so, as a result, big time street dealers rack in more money each year than most respectable businessmen and businesswomen. The 18th amendment led to bootleggers, and it also led to the 21st amendment, which repealed the 18th. \n \n If we are really going to crack down on gun crime, we need to lower the supply of firearms, pressure the media to engage in less fear and war mongering, and find ways to keep idle hands busy.\n \n The firearms debate is not as serious in most other countries.

Couldn't I just pick you off or ambush you be stepping up with my weapon already drawn?\n\n \n Ummm?\n \n What scenario are you guys talking about here???'\n \n One of the key things on being a 'criminal' is motive.\n \n Most common motive being the quick aquisition of wealth.\n Thus, the close, direct confrontation based mostly on shock and intimidation with you forking over your hard earned money quickly so I can quickly escape...not murdering you and rifling through your pockets.\n \n Murder also nets more police tasked to the case and a greater chance on I being caught. \n \n As to weapon selection, being a cheapass criminal, I'm using something stolen or bought cheaply. That way I won't miss it if I have to toss it.\n \n \n Now, if I'm going to murder you as my prime motive...\n Well, anyone can be one of those. More so as a crime of passion as I bludgeon you to death with an iron skillet. If intent on murder, nothing will stop you except random chance and murphy's law. Now, if we're talking about getting away with murder...well that's a different thing. Let me know if you ever find out how to do it.\n \n As to accidental firearms discharges.\n Irresponsible gun use and storage.\n Often corrected with training and familiarity.\n \n Ever wonder why it's the young dumbassed teens who cause the most car accidents? Inexperience and lack of training.\n \n I think basic firearm training should be taught in public schools. It is a 'right' after all and with draft registeration, it's concievable that some could be called to use a weapon later in life. One's rights are often dealt with in school. Free speech, voting, religious expression. Even ROTC is often taught in school.\n It should be an elective and dealt with as a drivers ed class. This would also go to help dispell some of the taboo and interest some have with them.\n Like with driver's ed and DUI education, accident photos and videos are shown. Such could also be the case with gun training. Show what irresponsible use of a weapon really can do. \n \n If you don't want to own a gun. Fine. Your choice.\n If you happen to have the (YEARS) training to use 'hands and feet' as lethal weapons and want to fight over the theft...looks like I chose poorly if I picked you as a target.\n \n As a 'bad guy (tm)' I can tell you, randomly armed citizens make theft from them a risky proposition. And no, they won't become up-gunned to deal with it. They'd just chose a differnt target for a higher reward to risk ratio.\n Bank robbery is EXTEMELY common. If I'm going to risk a gun armed victim...I best at least ensure theygot some money...and if that college aged chic is armed, she better have more than $30 on her. I certainly don't want to be shot in the back by her after a mugging. \n \n For all those who don't understand the 'bad guy' side of crime (theft) and how chaotic a crime is when it occurs. \n Bad guys are predominatly predators of opprotunity. They seldom 'wait in ambush'. Impatience doesn't lend itself to that.\n If they were a patient man, they'd just GET A JOB (as an armed security guard).\n \n \n \n \n As to comparing them to WMD's.\n A WMD is an indescriminate weapon by nature. \n A fire arm isn't.",

   "An inanimate object that couldn't kill someone? That's awful limited since just about every single inanimate object ever created CAN be used to kill a person if used correctly. I know how to kill someone with a paper clip, all you need to do is be creative enough to find an application and you can kill with anything.\n\n An oversimplification. Guns are tools and tools help people to accomplish something. Some tools are more effective than others. Guns are more effective killing tools than spears, swords, and rocks. That's why the US Army arms its soldiers with guns rather than rocks or spears. \n If it's just as easy to kill someone with a paper clip as a gun then why don't you advocate arming the military with paper clips? I'm sure it could save a lot of money. \n \n \n\n WMDs are an entirely different story, having no relation whatsoever to the Second Amendment.\n\n I wasn't making a point about the Second Amendment. I was showing the argument that it is just as easy to kill with one inanimate object as another is false. If that were true then we'd worry about tyrants having paper clips as much as we worry about them having WMD's!\n \n \n\n The fact that outlaws still have guns in other \"developed nations\" proves that the saying is correct: when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.\n \n Currently in Japan it's absolutely illegal to possess a handgun or a rifle, yet criminals still have handguns and rifles in their possession and use them in crimes. That goes to prove that the saying is absolutely true and accurate.\n\n Of course, if you outlaw anything then by definition only the outlaws are doing it. But that doesn't tell us if it has resulted in a reduction in the number of outlaws doing it. And when we look at other developed nations we can see that there are a lot less outlaws owning guns.",
