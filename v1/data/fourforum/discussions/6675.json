The remainder are in shelters and hotel meeting rooms. I agree with Sigma, a lack of reality is probably the most common excuse. Cheap (off-season) rates with sweltering humidity and 'it won't happen to me' attitudes.",

The same statistics would hold true if you actually lived in Cozumel. Why do people vacation in Cozumel? Because it is Cozumel and you are more likely to die in a car accident or being hit by a falafal cart in the park then you are to die in a hurricane whilst on vacation. Despite all of the media hype, it is a non-event.\n \n \n Josef Said\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism",

The dieing part is not the most significant part of the situation it would be the waste of money and a week or two ruined.\n\n \n I'd think especially so for those who visit ocean beach destinations during off-season as the timing is generally predicated on saving often substantial sums of money. I've traveled most of Mexico and will pass on summer, early fall months as I dislike extreme humidity. I remember living in Hawaii where the season, best weather, brought a far different generally more affluent crowd than off-season visitors. The reverse being true at ski resorts, where chants for inclement weather bringing fresh powder snow are common in in lounge areas serving alcohol during late hours of an evening.",
