   "What could killing a mother and her four children possibly accomplish? They were unarmed, driving down the road, doing nothing wrong. I deeply oppose many Israeli actions, the placement of settlers, and a unilateral disengagement plan. But what did this attack do? Did it help Palestinians get their land back? Did it make Sharon come to the realization that Palestinians must be a partner for peace? Did it ease tensions, end suffering, or make the living enviornment better? It did none of these things because killing an eight month pregnant woman and her four young daughters does nothing. I never condemn the striking of military bases or armed individuals, but this is just furthering the cycle of violence. This will just further the oppression and killing and suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza. Islamic Jihad, Al Aqsa, and Hamas are not the voices of the people, they act as much as the enemy as the IDF, this insistent violent as reactions to actions or actions to reactions leads nowhere. Kids don't know any better, they didn't steal land, they didn't settle illegally, they were just born, they just want to live and be happy. The targeting of innocent children needs to stop because it only makes the situation worse, fuels animosity and hurts the true Palestinian cause - the fight for a viable homeland.\n \n http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/422652.html\n \n Remi",

   "Well, it helps the Palestinian cause as much as the bombings in Israeli cafes and bars; i.e. not a bit.\n Maybe it is even more shocking because a dead pregnant mother together with her children is simply horrifying.\n \n But the saddest thing is that we all have the certainty that Israel will strike back with extreme violence, the Hamas and their butchery brothers will happily retaliate again, and so on and so on.\n \n \n Is there not even once good news coming from Israel and the occupied territories? emoticon_angry",

Let's not forget that Israel has an equally dismal record of killing civilians in their retaliation efforts. And now we've been using Israeli tactics, developed over 40-years of house-to-house fighting in their attempts to break Palestine, in Iraq with similar public response. Military disregard of civilian property and lives is a sure-fire way to guarantee increased extremist recruitment just for revenge purposes, further perpetuating the cycle.",

   "In response to Daewoo saying Israel should be treated like just another country, if that were the case wouldn't Israel have the rights to the land that they had taken in 1967 and 1973? It is because they were treated in a special manner that all this conflict continues today. Israel would control much of the Middle East and there would be no question about what land was Israel's and what land wasn't. It is because of the UN and their resolutions against Israel that has fueled this conflict in the first place because the land Israel took now stands as debatable over ownership.\n \n To clarify my point, I believe that if the UN considered all land taken from Mexico by the US as an occupied zone which rightfully belongs to Mexico, then there would be terrorist attacks against the US by Mexicans because of this. It would encourage violence because there is no defined ownership over the land.\n \n If you want to end the violence all you have to do is say this is Israel's land and nothing is going to change that. Because of the years of hate it will take a long freaking time for that to finally settle in but it will at least bring peace sooner than the occupied zone label will IMO.",

But the UN doesn't do nothing. Oh no. They actually acknowledge the problem but choose not to do anything about it.

   "Lets not forget a couple of things as well the first being that the UN took land from the Arabs by force in the first place to give it to Israel. The second being that the UN allowed Israel to keep the lands that it took after its first war and those lands have been solidly in Israel hands for some time. 3/4 of the people in these news lands were Palestinian. The UN has the means to set the map however it wants in this situation so I wouldn't let them just slide by saying they are not allowed to. They have done it before for this exact type of situation and it was highly successful.",

Suddenly Israel turns the tide of the battles and is on the verge of victory. Then the anti-sematic people of power jump to their feet and demand the war ends.\n\n \n Israel was attacked October 6. THe UN security council called an emergency session that afternoon to deal with it. The American representative was not able to show up until october the 8th. By october 8th, the Israeli army was doing just fine against the invaders, and had actually managed to push them back to the borders. THe US blocked any action in the security council. Israel began pushing into Syria, then Egypt. By the 26'th of october, Israel had lost 2400 men and over 5 billion dollars worth of equipment, including over 1 billion dollars worth of equipment which was airlifted by the US, since the israelis were dangerously low on ammunition and equipment. The Soviet Union threatened to interfere witht he US's abilty to resupply Israel. The US finally drafted a security council resolution calling for a cease fire.\n \n The Cease fire was not designed to stop Israel from getting more land, it was introduced by the US, and supported by Israel, because without US resupply, the Israeli army was doomed and an invasion of Israel was only a matter of time. In Jauary, 1975, Chief Justice Shimon Agranat, president of the Israeli Supreme Court, finished a report outlining why the performance of the Israeli army had been so dismal. The report showed deficincies in intelligence gathering, discipline within the ranks, and the mobilization of reserves.\n \n The war was not stopped by anti-sematic folks who wanted to see Israel pushed back in its borders, it was stopped by the US, and over the objections of 2 oter UNSC members, because the Israeli military was on the verge of collapse.\n \n I know that your version is what they teach in Israeli schools in order to bolster the myth of the great israeli military, but the report by Agranat is in the public domain. \n \n \nThe UN is a joke and has been for some time. They would have let Israel fall gladly even though they would never allow for Israel to gain ground.\n\n \n That would be that whole \"international law\" thing. It is the terms Israel agred to live by. NOw it is time for them to do it. \n \n \nForget politics and forget what the UN \"wants\". Do what is right to end this ongoing war. Give the land to Israel and say that is that. It won't be something that ends the fighting over night but it is a valid solution.\n\n \n Israel already posesses the land, but refuses to annex it. This is becasue that would mean that the palestenians living there would have to be made citizens, treated as such, and allowed to vote. You would see a pretty massive change in Israeli policy, since the number of palestenians in these occupied territories make for a pretty big voting block. For a racist nation like israel, this would hardly be acceptable. Israel wants to stick with their racist policies.\n \n Besides, you are back to that pesky \"international law\" thing. If it is wrong to expect Israel to remove their occupying forces, I suppose it was unreasonable to expect Saddam to vacate Kuwait, right? Kuwait did attack Iraqi positions on the border before Saddam ordered the invasion.\n \n \nSo lets all bow to the Islamic extremists now. Perhaps we should aid in the destruction of Israel as well since we don't want those extremists angry at us.\n\n \n How many Ameircans should we allow to die? A large part of the extremists problem with America is the fact that we support Israel, which is inarguably in violation of international law. You can argue different point about the issue all day, but htere is still absolutly no doubt whatsoever that Israel is in violation of international law.\n \n \nCome on now, wise up. If we did what the extremists wanted to they would just want more. Be strong and take a stand against them and do what is right. The Arabs lost that land because of their anger and greed. They lost that land because the UN didn't stop the war before the land was in Israeli hands. They should not get back that land because it is not right what they are doing to try and get it back. They do not deserve it back.\n\n \n DO what is right? Ok, we will force Israel to comply with international law. We will charge Sharon with war crimes for the killing of thousands of civilians. \n \n \nBe careful when trying to talk to Israel about numbers. Try 10 to 1. According to the numbers Israel shouldn't even exist anymore.\n\n \n You are right, they shouldn't. The only reason they do is because the US supports them. Realistically, Israel is a small, worhtless nation with no real natural resources, no real industrial infrastructor, no real hope of having a decent industrial infrastructure, and even uif they DID manage to develpe some decent industrial facilities, no businessman in their right midn would ever do business with a nation as unstable as israel. Somehow, supporters f israel have managed to sucker the US into providing billions in welfare to israel. Is the US destined to prop up this worthless country forever? They will never be self supporting. I, for one, would prefer to see my money go other places. MAybe it is time for the US to pull out of Israel, and allow things to go the way they ineveitably will, allow the arabs to destroy israel.",
