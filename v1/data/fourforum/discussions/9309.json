   "Is Evolution's Foundation Missing?\n \n WHAT is the essence of Darwin's theory of evolution? \"In its full-throated, biological sense, .#.#. evolution means a process whereby life arose from nonliving matter and subsequently developed entirely by natural means.\" Darwinian evolution postulates that \"virtually all of life, or at least all of its most interesting features, resulted from natural selection working on random variation.\"-Darwin's Black Box-The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, by Michael Behe, associate professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.\n \n Irreducible Complexity-Evolution's Stumbling Block?\n \n When Darwin developed his theory, scientists had little or no knowledge of the amazing complexity of the living cell. Modern biochemistry, the study of life at the molecular level, has revealed some of that intricacy. It has also raised serious questions and doubts about Darwin's theory.\n \n The components of cells are made up of molecules. Cells are the building blocks of all living creatures. Professor Behe is Roman Catholic and believes in evolution to explain the later development of animals. However, he raises serious doubts about whether evolution can explain the existence of the cell. He speaks of molecular machines that \"haul cargo from one place in the cell to another along 'highways' made of other molecules .#.#. Cells swim using machines, copy themselves with machinery, ingest food with machinery. In short, highly sophisticated molecular machines control every cellular process. Thus the details of life are finely calibrated, and the machinery of life enormously complex.\"\n \n Now, all of this activity is taking place on what scale? A typical cell is only one thousandth of an inch [0.03 mm] across! In that infinitesimal space, complex functions vital to life are occurring. (See diagram, pages#8-9.) Little wonder that it has been said: \"The bottom line is that the cell-the very basis of life-is staggeringly complex.\"\n \n Behe argues that the cell can function only as a complete entity. Thus, it cannot be viable while being formed by slow, gradual changes induced by evolution. He uses the example of a mousetrap. This simple apparatus can function only when all its components are assembled. Each component on its own-platform, spring, holding bar, trap hammer, catch-is not a mousetrap and cannot function as such. All the parts are needed simultaneously and have to be assembled for there to be a working trap. Likewise, a cell can function as such only when all its components are assembled. He uses this illustration to explain what he terms \"irreducible complexity.\"\n \n This presents a major problem for the alleged process of evolution, which involves the appearance of gradually acquired, useful characteristics. Darwin knew that his theory of gradual evolution by natural selection faced a big challenge when he said: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\"-Origin of Species.\n \n The irreducibly complex cell is a major stumbling block to belief in Darwin's theory. In the first place, evolution cannot explain the leap from inanimate to animate matter. Then comes the problem of the first complex cell, which must arise in one fell swoop as an integrated unit. In other words, the cell (or, the mousetrap) must appear out of nowhere, assembled and functioning!\n \n The Irreducible Complexity of Blood Clotting\n \n Another example of irreducible complexity is a process most of us take for granted when we cut ourselves-blood clotting. Normally, any liquid will immediately leak out of a punctured container and will do so until the container is empty. Yet, when we puncture or cut our skin, the leak is quickly sealed by the formation of a clot. However, as doctors know, \"blood clotting is a very complex, intricately woven system consisting of a score of interdependent protein parts.\" These activate what is called a clotting cascade. This delicate healing process \"depends critically on the timing and speed at which the different reactions occur.\" Otherwise, a person could have all of his blood clotting and solidifying, or on the other hand, he could bleed to death. Timing and speed are the vital keys.\n \n Biochemical investigation has shown that blood clotting involves many factors, none of which can be missing for the process to succeed. Behe asks: \"Once clotting has begun, what stops it from continuing until all the blood .#.#. has solidified?\" He explains that \"the formation, limitation, strengthening, and removal of a blood clot\" make up an integrated biological system. If any part fails, then the system fails.\n \n Russell Doolittle, evolutionist and professor of biochemistry at the University of California, asks: \"How in the world did this complex and delicately balanced process evolve? .#.#. The paradox was, if each protein depended on activation by another, how could the system ever have arisen? Of what use would any part of the scheme be without the whole ensemble?\" Using evolutionary arguments, Doolittle tries to explain the origin of the process. However, Professor Behe points out that there would be an \"enormous amount of luck needed to get the right gene pieces in the right places.\" He shows that Doolittle's explanation and casual language conceal tremendous difficulties.\n \n Thus, one of the major objections to the evolutionary model is the insurmountable hurdle of irreducible complexity. Behe states: \"I emphasize that natural selection, the engine of Darwinian evolution, only works if there is something to select-something that is useful right now, not in the future.\"\n \n \"An Eerie and Complete Silence\"\n \n Professor Behe states that some scientists have studied \"mathematical models for evolution or new mathematical methods for comparing and interpreting sequence data.\" However, he concludes: \"The mathematics assumes that real-world evolution is a gradual, random process; it does not (and cannot) demonstrate it.\" (Last phrase italics ours.) He earlier said: \"If you search the scientific literature on evolution, and if you focus your search on the question of how molecular machines-the basis of life-developed, you find an eerie and complete silence. The complexity of life's foundation has paralyzed science's attempt to account for it; molecular machines raise an as-yet-impenetrable barrier to Darwinism's universal reach.\"\n \n This raises a series of questions for conscientious scientists to consider: \"How did the photosynthetic reaction center develop? How did intramolecular transport start? How did cholesterol biosynthesis begin? How did retinal become involved in vision? How did phosphoprotein signaling pathways develop?\" Behe adds: \"The very fact that none of these problems is even addressed, let alone solved, is a very strong indication that Darwinism is an inadequate framework for understanding the origin of complex biochemical systems.\"\n \n If Darwin's theory cannot explain the complex molecular foundation of cells, then how can it be a satisfactory explanation for the existence of the millions of species that inhabit this earth? After all, evolution cannot even produce new family kinds by bridging the gaps from one family kind to another.-Genesis 1:11, 21, 24.\n \n The Problems of the Beginning of Life\n \n No matter how plausible Darwin's theory of evolution may appear to be in the eyes of some scientists, they must ultimately face the question, Even if we assume that forms of living things evolved by natural selection, how did life get its start? In other words, the problem lies, not in survival of the fittest, but in arrival of the fittest and the first! However, as Darwin's remarks on the evolution of the eye indicate, he was not concerned with the problem of how life began. He wrote: \"How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated.\"\n \n French science writer Philippe Chambon wrote: \"Darwin himself wondered how nature selected emerging forms before they were perfectly functional. The list of evolutionary mysteries is endless. And today's biologists have to humbly admit, with Prof.#Jean G\u00e9nermont of the University of South Paris in Orsay, that 'the synthetic theory of evolution cannot readily explain the origin of complex organs.'\"\n \n In the light of the tremendous odds against such endless variety and complexity of life forms, do you find it difficult to believe that it all evolved in the right direction just by chance? Do you wonder how any creatures could have survived in the battle of the survival of the fittest while they were still evolving eyes? Or while they were supposedly forming primitive fingers on a subhuman body? Do you wonder how cells survived if they existed in an incomplete and inadequate state?\n \n Robert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of \"a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.\" That line of reasoning can probably be applied to every single creature that exists today. The odds are stacked against it. Yet, we are expected to believe that by chance evolution also produced a male and a female at the same time in order for the new species to be perpetuated. To compound the odds, we also have to believe that the male and the female not only evolved at the same time but also in the same place! No meeting, no procreation!\n \n Certainly, it stretches credulity to the limit to believe that life exists in its millions of perfected forms as a result of millions of gambles that paid off.\n \n Why Do the Majority Believe?\n \n Why is evolution so popular and accepted by so many as the only explanation for life on earth? One reason is that it is the orthodox view taught in schools and universities, and woe betide you if you dare to express any doubts. Behe states: \"Many students learn from their textbooks how to view the world through an evolutionary lens. However, they do not learn how Darwinian evolution might have produced any of the remarkably intricate biochemical systems that those texts describe.\" He adds: \"To understand both the success of Darwinism as orthodoxy and its failure as science at the molecular level, we have to examine the textbooks that are used to teach aspiring scientists.\"\n \n \"If a poll were taken of all the scientists in the world, the great majority would say they believed Darwinism to be true. But scientists, like everybody else, base most of their opinions on the word of other people. .#.#. Also, and unfortunately, too often criticisms have been dismissed by the scientific community for fear of giving ammunition to creationists. It is ironic that in the name of protecting science, trenchant scientific criticism of natural selection has been brushed aside.\"\n \n \n \n _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n \n Creationism involves belief that the earth was created in six literal days or, in some cases, that the earth was formed only about ten thousand years ago. Jehovah's Witnesses, while believing in creation, are not creationists. They believe that the Bible's Genesis account allows for the earth to be millions of years old.",

   "Oh, not again. Is evolutions-fake really presenting all this stuff to us as though it were new?\n \n Ample refutations of the blood clotting claim, the mousetrap analogy etc. have been posted elsewhere (see here for example.) I will do no more than point up some of the more jejune errors.\n \nIn the light of the tremendous odds against such endless variety and complexity of life forms, do you find it difficult to believe that it all evolved in the right direction just by chance?\n\n There is no such thing in evolution as 'the right direction'. Selection makes allele frequencies shift in the direction it does: there is no 'right' or 'wrong' way.\n \nDo you wonder how any creatures could have survived in the battle of the survival of the fittest while they were still evolving eyes? Or while they were supposedly forming primitive fingers on a subhuman body? Do you wonder how cells survived if they existed in an incomplete and inadequate state?\n\n Not in the least. At any given point in a phylogenetic history, the extant organisms are the end-point of their particular branch or twig: they are not mere 'half-finished' life forms on their way to being something else. Whatever features they possess have been selected as advantageous at their time: it is a crass mistake to compare them unfavourably with features that may have arisen later. (This confusion is a corollary of the 'right direction' muddle above.)\n \nRobert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of \"a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.\"\n\n And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.\n \nThat line of reasoning can probably be applied to every single creature that exists today. The odds are stacked against it. Yet, we are expected to believe that by chance evolution also produced a male and a female at the same time in order for the new species to be perpetuated. To compound the odds, we also have to believe that the male and the female not only evolved at the same time but also in the same place! No meeting, no procreation!\n\n We have to assume that evolutions-fake is not a biologist, and has no knowledge of the emergence of sexual reproduction - isogamy, anisogamy etc. He/she probably thinks the chicken-and-egg argument is pretty neat, too.\n \nCertainly, it stretches credulity to the limit to believe that life exists in its millions of perfected forms as a result of millions of gambles that paid off.\n\n It would indeed, if that's what evolutionary theory actually claimed. As it is, this is a rather feeble straw man.\n \nWhy is evolution so popular and accepted by so many as the only explanation for life on earth? One reason is that it is the orthodox view taught in schools and universities...\n\n A perfectly circular argument. Why is evolution accepted as the only explanation for life on earth? Because it is the orthodox view taught in schools and universities. And why is it the orthodox view taught in schools and universities? Why, because it is accepted as ...

The origins of many groups are still not documented at all.\" (Futuyma, D., Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution, 1983, p. 190-191) \n \n \"The main problem with such phyletic gradualism is that the fossil record provides so little evidence for it. Very rarely can we trace the gradual transformation of one entire species into another through a finely graded sequence of intermediary forms.\" (Gould, S.J.

OK, #1 kiddies....\n The author states that it is contradictory, because Paley states that nature is disorganized and random, then later states that it is ordered and complex. Hello? Sarcasm? He states it that way ON PURPOSE to show the ridiculousness of the atheists viewpoint. Someone needs to go retake 9th grade english...\n #2 In argument #2 he says If you wandered farther and found a shoe, then you would have two creators...a watchmaker and a shoemaker. First, I would still logically assume that SOMEONE made the shoe, and certainly it could be a watchmaker. People can have more than one craft. Even though its not my profession, I can build race engines, paint a house, use many different computer programs etc. The foundation of the argument (That some form of intelligence had created the shoe and the watch) would be logical and scientific. \n #3 The argument who made God/ who made God's father etc. is an argument that plagues both natural Cosmology/evolution etc. and creationsim. Who/what made the matter? Who/what made the energy? Who/what made time? Matter can not come from nothing. Energy is constantly moving towards a state of rest. These are basic Newtonian 8th grade physics. The \"Quantum Burp\" idea, is preposterous and unscientific, as it relies on nature to Break its own laws, which is not possible. On the other hand, a being outside of time/space/matter that was not bound by those laws, because he created them, would fit in the realm of science, albeit hard for our puny intellects to comprehend.\n #4 Occam's Razor(he mispelled it on his website. Hey, if y'all can point out my errors...) states that simplest solution is usually the right one, and should be embraced until refuted. Cosmological and biological evolution requires HUGE leaps of logic, suspension of known scientific laws, and denial of what even secular scientists admit is compelling evidence of a creator. They call there own theory \"Absurd in the highest degree\", \"unthinkable\", \"unlikely\", etc.\n Compare that to the simplicity of \"And God said, let there be\"...\n #5 Under false analogy. His assumption was correct!! Money DOES come from trees! Thats why its composed of complex cellulose structures! And the evolutionist argument is exactly like this...\"Yes, I can see that they both have the same structures, but I believe the cellulose structures appeared, and money evolved over millions of years. Just because the cell structures are identical, doesnt mean ANYTHING!\n LOL. And I still havent heard refutation of my earlier statements. A 160 IQ Creationist too much for ya?

If not, your analogy fails.\n \n \n#1 kiddies....\n The author states that it is contradictory, because Paley states that nature is disorganized and random, then later states that it is ordered and complex. Hello? Sarcasm?\n\n Can't be sarcasm, because that's the argument's way of distinguishing. Either the watch is designed because it is complex and the surroundings are not, or both the universe and the watch are complex such that they can't be told apart by this status. (Alternatively, you could try the \"designed universe and undesigned watch\" combination, but somehow I doubt you'd like that.)\n For further yuks, consider the ID movement. Remember that Paley's (original) claim was that the watch is different than its surroundings; now the IDists are saying it isn't. (When you're a creationist, you get to try anything and everything, because you're bounded by neither rationality nor reality.)\n \n \nSo, to get an idea of what your up against, take 400 pennies (approx the amount of genes of a very simple virus, which cannot even live without a host).

How about Vishnu, Ahuramazda, and Quetzalcoatl? Get real\n.\n This argument is astoundingly stupid. First of all, unicorns do exist. Unicorns, a so-called myth that comes from an ancient word reym(Rame). This does not refer to a horse with a single horn, but to a rhino, or in some cases, a wild bull. Secondly, a complex mechanism such as biological life, is a more complex machine than almost any machines we have built, therefore, there is evidence of intelligence. Let me put it a couple of different ways. If you were an archaeologist, and you dug up something as simple as a cup, it would be assumed that some intelligence had made the cup. If you wanted to contend that natural processes in the Earth made it, that would be fine, but you would have to prove it. And that is just a created object, something FAR different than a operating machine. Scenario two: If tommorrow, SETI announced that they had received a message in morse code that said\"Hello, we are aliens from outer space. We will come to visit you. Give us your location\", every atheist IN THE WORLD would instantly be jumping up and down saying \"we found life!\". But in reality, our Creator has left a much more detailed proof of his existence in our DNA. And yet they deny him. And why? Because they don't like his RULES.\n \nFunny, I don't seem to see any selection mechanism here. Can you explain it to me? What's that? You've instituted no selection mechanism? \"Better analogy\" my XXX.\n\n Once again, dirt isn't subjected to natural selection. But, for the sake of your argument; Natural selection can only redistribute genetic information that is already present in a creature, through a process called Chromosome Translocation. Even in Unbalanced Chromosome translation (missing or extra genes), there has never been a documented case of new material from an exterior source, being introduced into the genetic material. It is always a rearrangement of materials already present. What you need to realize, is that in order for natural selection to begin, there MUST be an operating biological system in place, capable of at LEAST: Taking in energy(eating), reproduction, \n and movement (at the very least, internal movement, although proliferation would require External as well.)\n Finally....\n \n(By the way, my degree is in biochemistry, so obviously I know nothing about these things.)\n\n SHOW ME THE MONEY....Please give me the name of the university you attended, your Professors name etc. and I will check out your claim.

Perhaps you could walk us through the calculation you used to arrive at your quoted figure? Why do you think the protein can only configure in one way?

In fact\n What's more, all the \"self-replicators\" being referred to in today's experiments, are actually sections extracted out of DNA, RNA and proteins from living things!....\n In fact, in all the abiogenesis lab experiments, not even a small protein --which demonstrably folds into a stable and discrete shape that would have a beneficial (& not deleterious) function in any actual living thing's structures or chemical reactions-- has ever formed from single amino acid units. And...\n \nWe have a 400 amino acid chain wherein the majority is junk. Clearly it hasn't assembled itself in the most efficient way\n.\n Actually I looked everywhere I could and this was the minimum I could come up with. \n Harold Morowitz (an evolutionist biochemist) has speculated what the bare minimum self-replicating living cell would include:\n five proteins required for cell-membrane production;\n eight proteins required for a very simplified form of energy metabolism;\n ten proteins for the synthesis of the nucleotide bases, and for DNA synthesis.\n eighty (80) proteins in an apparatus for the making of all the cell's proteins.\n So, in Morowitz's view, the simplest conceivable minimal cell would require 100 proteins.",

   "Neither does dirt. (For those of you who are unaware, abiogenesis is the belief that dirt suddenly came to life.)\n\n No, it's not. Try again. (See also below.)\n \n \nSecondly, a complex mechanism such as biological life, is a more complex machine than almost any machines we have built, therefore, there is evidence of intelligence.\n\n This is what you keep saying, but you don't back it up. The fact is that, compared to a designed system, evolution will come up with a more \"complicated\" system every time.\n \n \nIf you were an archaeologist, and you dug up something as simple as a cup, it would be assumed that some intelligence had made the cup.\n\n You're just completely ignoring the whole circular argumentation thing that I talked about earlier, aren't you? We know that people make cups. You are using the assumption that God makes complex things in order to support your point that God makes complex things. Do try to keep up.\n \n \nBut in reality, our Creator has left a much more detailed proof of his existence in our DNA. And yet they deny him. And why? Because they don't like his RULES.\n\n Our DNA explicitly spells out \"Hello, I am God and I exist?\" No, you lie. Your analogies suck. Regarding God's \"rules,\" take it to the religion or philosophy forum, and you'll get your XXX kicked there.\n \n \nNatural selection can only redistribute genetic information that is already present in a creature, through a process called Chromosome Translocation.\n\n This is a good place to point out that the concept of natural selection is not technically restricted to genetics. Look at what pandion said: natural selection is simply differential reproductive success. Imagine prehistoric RNAs with self-replicative activity. Those better at replicating themselves.. well, did so, and did so more efficiently than other oligonucleotides. At that point, we're off to the races. Is dirt self-replicating? No, so you have yet another disanalogy. (It's okay, we're getting used to it.)\n More importantly, you're still wrong. Genetic information is \"redistributed\" all the time in gametogenesis, and not all via chromosome translocation. \n \n \nEven in Unbalanced Chromosome translation (missing or extra genes), there has never been a documented case of new material from an exterior source, being introduced into the genetic material.\n\n I see you've never heard of transformation.\n \n \nWhat you need to realize, is that in order for natural selection to begin, there MUST be an operating biological system in place, capable of at LEAST: Taking in energy(eating), reproduction, and movement (at the very least, internal movement, although proliferation would require External as well.)\n\n For natural selection as defined as acting upon complete organisms, this is true. However, as I stated above, sets of self-catalytic molecules that existed before the first bona fide organism would still undergo selection due to differential reproductive success.\n Again, you seem to conflate the issue by combining evolution and abiogenesis, when you really should not. It is a common tactic when one's actual points are feeble in both number and application.\n \n \nSHOW ME THE MONEY....Please give me the name of the university you attended, your Professors name etc. and I will check out your claim. Other wise, QUIT LYING. Just state your case intelligently. You don't need a degree to make intelligent observations and arguments.\n\n Why should I give anyone, let alone someone with such a gigantic chip on his holier-than-thou shoulder, personal information? You can believe I'm lying, if you'd like, but it'd be softer on your overinflated ego to know that the person who kicked your XXX at least has a degree in the topic, so it's not like you got schooled by someone from off the street.\n Here's a brief recap: Notice that instead of providing all those statements that allegedly don't have scientific counters, you reproduced nothing. Notice that you've completely ignored entire sections of my response, only to use the same impotent argumentation that has already been undercut. Notice that after telling others to look into the \"complexity\" of molecular biology, you were 1) unable to come up with anything more than basic, and 2) still got those things wrong.\n \n \nWell, your [sic] just wrong.\n\n There's that \"160 IQ\" working. He's also screwed up the \"there\" homophones, too.\n Count Otto provided a good link for you to start, but you should probably read the entire section on abiogenesis here.\n \n \nThe odds of achieving a 101-amino-acid-specified-sequence protein in five billion years by shuffling the sequences of proteins contained in a layer around the earth one meter thick at a rate of 10^14 per second is only 1/10^45.\n\n Lucky for us, that's not what happened (or happens), even if your numbers were correct.",

Being unable to explain the specific lineage of an organism no more troubles the theory than does my being unable to recount every individual step I took today trouble my having a legitimate explanation for how I got to my computer right now. To find something as recent as a rabbit in Precambrian era rock, on the other hand, would mean that our current model that has mammals arising hundreds of millions of years after the Precambrian must be wrong. This would be like saying I made a post from my computer while I was still sleeping in the other room...\n \n Did I say that it falsified common descent? No; I said it would severely shake up evolutionary theory. You wanted something that would \"falsify [the] theory,\" and the rabbit-in-the-Precambrian would pretty much do so by requiring an extensive reworking (to which, frankly, I don't see any immediate solution... but then, I'm not an evolutionary biologist).\n \n \nUh, thats O.K., I will refrain from typological critiques.\n\n You can [sic] me all you want.

Gravitism would be the religious belief that there is a force called gravity that attracts masses to one another, religious because we can't \"scientifically prove\" that there is gravity...\n \n \nCreationists, Atheists, Intelligent design, theistic evolutionists, all take a scientific FACT, and draw there [sic] own conclusions..\n\n Not many creationists use fact, unless it's very selective fact acceptance. The vast majority of creationist argumentation is utter rubbish. ID proponents that do anything besides recycle decades-old creationist balderdash simply expose their ignorance of biological systems by proclaiming that certain systems cannot arise by evolution when many of their examples have had their evolutionary pathways deduced.

The hole in your argumentation is that you can't show that God created any organisms, let alone a specific example\n.\n \n I don't have to show god did anything. The debate is Evolution is Unscientific\". I only have to show some intelligence did it.\n \n \nOh man, don't tell me we have to do this again...\n Define complex.\n Define order.\n Define intelligence.\n\n Complex: A conceptual whole, made up of complicated and interdependent parts.\n Order: A system of function, based on laws of operation, that appear to have been assembled by an intelligence.\n Intelligence: A thinking entity, which must have the ability to design and build systems of reproductive, thinking machines, and must inherently have more reasoning and problem solving abilities than Homo Sapien.\n \n \n \nYou're making the very same mistake yet again. SETI doesn't look for \"complexity,\" they look for something like what a human would make that is distinguishable from the background\n\n \n http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&b=178905#a3\n \n Wrong.\n \n \nWe have lots of silica in us, huh? But, as T.Q points out, between you and me, only one of us believes that we came from dirt, and that person isn't me. When you get back to reality, let us know. (That, or you can check out the RNA World hypothesis like I asked you to, but don't expect people to be holding their breaths.)\n\n \n New a little about it already. Checked on it some more. It says you think we came from dirt.\n \n \nSo the people who've studied this subject at length are ineligible voters, but people who aren't against you are automatically more qualified? And you whine about common sense...\n \n\n No. Lets see you go into a room full of Creationists/ ID people and see who they think is winning. Same thing if I were debating at NSF meeting. C'mon. your smarter than that...\n \nOh, I see the problem. You're not reading my posts. This explains why you haven't said a word about your ignorance of meiosis. This explains why you keep making the same stupid mistake of using your conclusion as an assumption within your argumentation. This explains why you haven't looked into the RNA World hypothesis.\n \n\n Lets see...\n Cytosine undergoes hydrolysis much too easily, therefore any prebiotic formation would be VERY implausible.\n \n Large amounts of formaldehyde is produced making nucleotides, which is incompatible with making sugars. This means they must be synthesized separately, then brought together.( i.e. Lab conditions...)\n \n Phosphate must be introduced. In nature, however, phosphate in solution is extremely rare because it is so readily precipitated. After being introduced, the phosphate must combine with the nucleoside and the correct hydroxyl must be phosphorylated.\n For the nucleotides to form RNA, they must be activated themselves. Activated purine nucleotides form small chains on a pre-existing template of all-pyrimidine RNA. However, this does not happen in reverse because the pyrimidine nucleotides do not stack well.\n Additionally, the ribose must all be the same enantiomer, because any nucleotides of the wrong chirality act as chain terminators.\n \n \n \nAnd I think it's hilarious that you think this makes some kind of point, Mr. I-Claim-to-Have-an-IQ-of-160. You shouldn't rely on those stupid internet IQ tests, buddy; apparently you're not smart enough to know that they're lousy. We know all we need to about your edumacation when you keep screwing up the there/they're/their and your/you're homophones.\n\n \n Literary ability has nothing to do with IQ. By this reasoning, Einstein was an idiot cause he couldn't tie his shoe.\n \n \nSame questions to you regarding God and creation ex nihilo. While you're busy babbling, do get around to the RNA World hypothesis and supporting facts.\n \n\n \n \nYou must've missed the conversation with wabbit about definitions. No matter. As soon as you reject common sense in favor of a general purpose dictionary not intended for use in specific scientific disciplines, you're in big trouble.\n\n I didn't get that definition from a dictionary. It was a list of scientific definitions.\n \nNevertheless, I'm a nice guy, so I'll repeat the point you're missing: Suppose God created the first life; does this prevent evolution from happening? No. Suppose the first life arose naturally; does this mean evolution must have happened? No. They are separate and independent.\n \n\n Then tell the writers of the textbooks to quit putting the \"primordial soup\" story in the introduction to evolution. \n \n \nYes, we use transformation in the lab, but that doesn't mean that transformation takes place only in the lab. Life forms can take in genetic material from other sources without the assistance of humans. \n \n Show me a quasi advanced species that has demonstrated addition of foreign \n genetic materials resulting in a totally new non-inherited physical trait.(And then show me thats its beneficial, so that NS can occur)\n \n \nWhat do you mean by \"NEW\" genetic material? Is not genetic material from genus x being transformed into a member of genus y (assuming the same gene did not previously exist in both) \"new\" to genus y? Are not mutations \"new\" genetic material? Are not duplications \"new\" genetic material? Are not duplications followed by mutation \"new\" genetic material?\n\n \n Your first statement is absolutely ridiculous. It does not even belong in this discussion. That info would have still been passed from one parent or the other. Mutations are not new genetic material. In order for this to be the case, cells would have to incorporate into their DNA/RNA completely foreign material. Otherwise, its just a rearrangement f what is already present within the host, and does not provide for large scale change.\n \n \n \nWhy would I need to do this? Does evolution require that this difficulty be remedied? No, 'fraid not. But as you must not have any relevant questions, I can see why you ask...\n\n \n Yes, this is extremely relevant, and shows me how little you know on the subject. Ok, here u go. I'll put this in laymens terms. DNA recombination wont occur between most large animals of different chromosomes, and even in the few cases the offspring are sterile. How do you account for the large difference in chromosomes among mammilian populations when they supposedly come from a common ancestor? Mutations of this kind are singular, and do not usually reciprocate to siblings. And even if they did, how would they know only to mate with each other? Then you still have the XY problem. Additionally, chromosomes of different order(such as human and chimpanzee) result in a totally unbridgeable interbreeding barrier.\n \n \n \n \nNo, it's not. Differential reproductive (or, shall we say, \"replicative\"?) success. trebor's \"filter,\" if you will.\n\n \n There has to be a filter in place for it to \"Filter\" anything. The chemicals themselves are naturally resistant to each other, and the process of assimilating arduous, therefore your \"bound to happen\" idea doesnt cut it.\n \n \n \n No, that's \"in the beginning God and dirt\" or \"in the beginning dirt.\" What do you think William of Ockham would say to that?\n \n Hmmm.... It's much simpler to say \"in the beginning God\" then to say \"In the beginning Dirt. Because Im not saying in the beginning God and dirt. See, in one sentence I explained Stellar evolution, chemical evolution, abiogenesis etc. Look at how complicated your answer is! Have to look at mine first...\n .\n \n \n \nJust like those crazy evolutionists want to use facts instead of lies.\n..\n \n Just because someones facts don't say what you want them to say, doesnt mean they're lies...\n \n\n Which it has, via direct observation...\n\n \n Quote examples.\n \n Right. Lucky for us, we have more than enough evidence for that, too.\n\n \n Quote examples.",

   "First, learn how to use the quote feature. I don't want anyone mistaking your rubbish for something I've said.\n \n \n \nDid you just say \"deduced\"? LOL kind of like imagined, because there's no lab tests that reproduced it.\n\n Have you ever produced a me in the lab? You haven't?! Then I must have been popped into existence fully formed by God! (Either that, or I'm \"imagined,\" which would make you qualified for the mental ward.)\n One guy who did a lot of research on the evolution of the blood clotting cascade is named Doolittle. Behe had no response to the information at the Dover trial. You should look into it. You could also look at Nick Matzke's ideas on the bacterial flagellum, as if Miller and many others haven't perturbed Behe's idea beyond plausibility.\n \n \n \nI don't have to show god did anything. The debate is Evolution is Unscientific\". I only have to show some intelligence did it.\n\n If you're going to use an analogy, then you do have to show that God did something that we can use as a basis for comparison. If you're taking a different approach, then you needn't worry. Instead, you seem to be trying to take both, and you failing at both.\n \n \nComplex: A conceptual whole, made up of complicated and interdependent parts.\n\n No, Holmes; we were talking about complex as an adjective, not as a noun. That is, \"a complex biological system\" vs. \"an enzyme-substrate complex.\"\n \n \nOrder: A system of function, based on laws of operation, that appear to have been assembled by an intelligence.\n\n An absurd definition. This has nothing to do with either thermodynamic \"order\" or even putting playing cards in \"order\" from ace to king. More importantly, even if we think of \"order\" as \"a system of function,\" why must we conclude that an \"intelligence\" (your definition of which is eviscerated below) is the source of this \"system\"?\n \n \nIntelligence: A thinking entity, which must have the ability to design and build systems of reproductive, thinking machines, and must inherently have more reasoning and problem solving abilities than Homo Sapien [sic].\n\n Even ignoring your ignorance of binomial nomenclature, your definition here is equally absurd. According to you, not humans nor dogs nor dolphins -- nor anything natural -- can be intelligent. Frankly, I find your argument unintelligent. But so do you, apparently, so we agree on something.\n As a serious counter, though, consider (once again) genetic algorithms. Humans create genetic algorithms, and they reproduce based on laws of operation. This clearly counters the implication that such \"order\" and replication can only be produced by an \"intelligence\" greater than humans.\n In fact, when we take a look at your definitions collectively, you haven't clarified a single thing. Your argument is still that certain systems look designed (via some analysis which you do not explain), so they must be designed \"intelligently\" which -- by definition -- necessarily invokes the supernatural. You're simply defining the supernatural into existence. I can do the same with Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy.\n \n \n \nhttp://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&b=178905#a3\n \n Wrong.\n\n Did you even read that section? It says what I said: that they're not looking for major, complex signals of wide frequencies and combinations; they're looking for simple, narrow-band signals. Why? Because we know that natural phenomena make noisy signals, but humans make narrow-band ones.\n \n \nNew [sic] a little about it already. Checked on it some more. It says you think we came from dirt.\n\n No, it was clearly new to you. (Can I call you Mr. Homophone Genius?) As I (and others) have explained before, you're the only one in this conversation who thinks we \"came from dirt.\"\n \n \nNo. Lets see you go into a room full of Creationists/ ID people and see who they think is winning. Same thing if I were debating at NSF meeting. C'mon. your [sic] smarter than that...\n\n I'm smarter than creationists? Sure, but that's not saying much...\n The question is not which way the leanings are; the question is who is qualified. The answer is that these scientists are far more qualified that people like William Dembski and Phillip Johnson, yet creationists revere their uneducated statements and ignore the substantive, hard-hitting statements of qualified authorities like Miller and Gould.\n \n \nLets see... [snip]\n\n I see you have no problem with just copying and pasting from wikipedia. Why don't you copy and paste the much larger \"support\" section? I suppose that's because you don't really understand much at all, nor have you even looked into besides searching wikipedia and skipping to the section you thought you'd like.\n \n \nLiterary ability has nothing to do with IQ. By this reasoning, Einstein was an idiot cause he couldn't tie his shoe.\n\n I didn't call you an idiot. I was making it clear that your claimed IQ -- even were it correct -- means nothing here. Proclaiming yourself to be a genius, however, is an open invitation for people to expose your ignorance of any topic.\n \n \nI didn't get that definition from a dictionary. It was a list of scientific definitions.\n\n No, I'm serious. Find the threads where wascallywabbit is getting a thrashing on definitions. I particularly like this post (but I'm biased).\n \n \nThen tell the writers of the textbooks to quit putting the \"primordial soup\" story in the introduction to evolution. \n\n The college level textbook I've been repeatedly referencing in no way, shape, or form even suggests that the \"'primordial soup' story\" is strongly supported. It says that though there are differing ideas (panspermia, special creation, bubble theory), the jury is out. My textbook on evolutionary biology doesn't mention the origin of life at all.\n \n \nShow me a quasi advanced species that has demonstrated addition of foreign genetic materials resulting in a totally new non-inherited physical trait.(And then show me thats its beneficial, so that NS can occur)\n\n Now you're moving the goalposts. Here's what you said earlier in this thread:\n Even in Unbalanced Chromosome translation (missing or extra genes), there has never been a documented case of new material from an exterior source, being introduced into the genetic material.\nI said that transformation has occurred. You tried to blow it off as an unnatural thing made possible only by laboratory techniques. Well, you're wrong.. again. Here is a really old case that you should have been able to find, considering it's on wikipedia. (In fact, I can only suspect that you did find it, and that was the basis for your shifting the goalposts to \"quasi advanced\" species.) The fact remains that your previous statement about new material never being incorporated is false. Even better, this specific example is one with beneficial consequences.\n \n \nYour first statement is absolutely ridiculous. It does not even belong in this discussion. That info would have still been passed from one parent or the other....\n\n Hoo boy. Talk about ignorance. You see, when I said \"transformed,\" I actually meant \"transformed.\" (It's a little trick we use sometimes in language, using the words we actually want to use.) Transforming DNA from one genus to another is obviously not the slightest bit related to parental distribution of genetic material to offspring. Your apparent inability to understand conversation with these basic biological terms (especially after being adamant that you knew what transformation is) only further supports my supposition that you hardly know what you're talking about.\n \n \nYes, this is extremely relevant, and shows me how little you know on the subject.\n\n I, unlike you, know it's not a problem because genes still line up during meiosis even when the number of chromosomes is not equal.\n \n \nDNA recombination wont occur between most large animals of different chromosomes, and even in the few cases the offspring are sterile.\n\n Not always. Try again.\n \n \nHow do you account for the large difference in chromosomes among mammilian populations when they supposedly come from a common ancestor?\n\n How about I just link you to the Index to Creationist Claims entry on this? Here you go.\n And for your viewing pleasure, read this and this (search for the question submitted by Linjun Xu), and you might as well see this one, too (search for the question submitted by Jessica A. Curtis).\n \n \nThere has to be a filter in place for it to \"Filter\" anything.\n\n The filter is those things that induce differential reproductive/replicative success, should they be replicative efficiency, self-correction/repair mechanisms, whatever. What don't you understand about this?\n \n \nHmmm.... It's much simpler to say \"in the beginning God\" then to say \"In the beginning Dirt. Because Im not saying in the beginning God and dirt.\n\n Fine, you're saying, \"In the beginning, God. Later, dirt.\" Why is that simpler than, \"In the beginning, dirt\"? It's not. Stop pretending it is. We both have dirt; you have the superfluous entity. Razor it.\n \n \nJust because someones facts don't say what you want them to say, doesnt mean they're lies...\n\n You're denying that abiogenesis is separate from evolutionary theory? Yet you said nothing in response to my explanation of why? You may not be good with logic, but you've really got that projection thing down pat.\n \n \nQuote examples.\n\n Yawn.\n \n \nQuote examples.\n\n Ho hum.\n \n Shall we play again?",

   "evolution has been proven.\nNope. Evolution has been defined, observed and then explained by theories. But it has not been proven.\n \nEvolution is change over time.\nYou don't quite grasp the concepts. Your use of the word is why Darwin objected to using the word in reference to his theories. Yes, evolution means change, as in stellar evolution, planetary evolution, cosmological evolution and many other kinds of change that you may think of. But the primary meaning of the word indicates change in a particular, specified direction; along a particular path. But we are discussing biological evolution in which the word has come to mean so much more than just change and certainly not change along a specified path. Specifically, biological evolution is a change in the frequencies of alleles in a population over generations. Any other change is not biological evolution.\n \nscientists have seen this happen in labs with bacteria and fruit flies. they have seen that the people that live in the andes mountains blood is different than ours because of the oxygen way up there. and just recently i read an article about fish in the deep cave with no eyes, but when they studied there genome they found that they used to have eyes. but the gene was jsut \"turned off\". i am a christian and an evolutionist. so whoever was makeing the steriotype of athest/evolutionist is dead wrong.\nYes, evolution has been observed on many occasions. Even speciation has been observed. But that doesn't \"prove\" a theory. Such observations form part of the factual data that is explained by the theory.\n \noh and let me define the word theory for you. cuz a theory cant be \"proven\" it can only be falsified.\nThat much is true.\n \nthoeries are based on facts and observations. you see something then w/ your facts and observations you make a thoery.\nMuch too simplistic. First, you form an hypothesis that explains the observed facts. This is what you are calling a theory. It is only the beginning. The process of science is called the scientific method and the forming of an hypothesis is only the first step. Next you make a prediction of an observation that can be made only if the hypothesis is correct. You then have to devise an experiment that tests the prediction. If it is falsified, then you go back to forming an hypothesis. If it supports the hypothesis, if the test is strong enough, you might have a scientific theory.\n \ntheory----- a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural, in contrast to well-established propositions that are regarded as reporting matters of actual fact.\nThat is the common meaning of the word, not the scientific meaning. In science a theory is a set of statements (or principles or laws) devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. Scientific theories have been repeatedly tested by experiments and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.\n \n By the way, the word is spelled theory.",

   "Evolution is such a solid theory I am still surprised to hear it doubted. First of all, evolution only postulates that the current diversity of life is due to a decesnsion of life forms through common ancestors. This hypothesis requires information to be passed generationally, and then the slight distortion of that information. This is seen in the genetic make-up of all life. \n \n To give a short explanation of this, humans inherit nearly 3 biillion genetic \"letters\". Investigation into the mechanisms of DNA give an estimate of 60 mutations to each generation. Since all of physical life is determined from genetics, it follows that all that is neccesary for new kinds of life is the introduction of new genetic \"sentences\". Natural selection is then given the material neede to determine to best gene.\n \n Two other complications arise. Sixty out of 3 billion is quite small, and only a small portion of DNA is actually used for coding proteins. This requires long amounts of time to allow the species to gain new features and eventually evolve. These time constraints are consistent with the standard accepted cosmology. \n \n Some further evidence exists in that since mutations of non-coding DNA will not be eliminated by natural selection, there will exist a much great difference in non-coding DNA as compared to usable DNA. This is supported by observation.\n \n Study the science.\n \n All my information for this post came from Dr. Francis Collins' book The Language of God, and yes he happens to be a Christian.

   "If we are all gonna get so anal about the meaning of \"theory\" then how does Creationism or ID get called theories?\n \n I'm just wondering.\n \n The scientific method:\n 1. Observe some aspect of the universe. \n 2. Invent a tentative description, called a hypothesis, that is consistent with what you have observed. \n 3. Use the hypothesis to make predictions. \n 4. Test those predictions by experiments or further observations and modify the hypothesis in the light of your results. \n 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies between theory and experiment and/or observation. \n \n In popular usage, a theory is just a vague and fuzzy sort of fact and a hypothesis is often used as a fancy synonym to `guess'. But to a scientist a theory is a conceptual framework that explains existing observations and predicts new ones. \n \n A hypothesis is a working assumption. Typically, a scientist devises a hypothesis and then sees if it \"holds water'' by testing it against available data (obtained from previous experiments and observations). If the hypothesis does hold water, the scientist declares it to be a theory. \n \n Yeah... this is were a see Creationism having a hole in it's arguement to be called a Theory. At least with Evo you have some type of evidence. Even most ID(ers) believe Evo. But if the moment we as a species can not understand something and we start assuming it's GOD then we are in need of some help.\n \n If we could prove God then all would be solved... however that has yet to happen and so this debate will continue. \n \n Another thing I wonder: Why does the creator, \"the one who got the ball rolling\"... have to be the Western god? Personally the belief in brahman makes just as much sense. Same with Buddhist beliefs... all religion have about just as much \"evidence\" as one another to prove that \"they are the one.\"",

   "Is Evolution's Foundation Missing?\n \n WHAT is the essence of Darwin's theory of evolution? \"In its full-throated, biological sense, .#.#. evolution means a process whereby life arose from nonliving matter and subsequently developed entirely by natural means.\" Darwinian evolution postulates that \"virtually all of life, or at least all of its most interesting features, resulted from natural selection working on random variation.\"-Darwin's Black Box-The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, by Michael Behe, associate professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.\n \n Irreducible Complexity-Evolution's Stumbling Block?\n \n When Darwin developed his theory, scientists had little or no knowledge of the amazing complexity of the living cell. Modern biochemistry, the study of life at the molecular level, has revealed some of that intricacy. It has also raised serious questions and doubts about Darwin's theory.\n \n The components of cells are made up of molecules. Cells are the building blocks of all living creatures. Professor Behe is Roman Catholic and believes in evolution to explain the later development of animals. However, he raises serious doubts about whether evolution can explain the existence of the cell. He speaks of molecular machines that \"haul cargo from one place in the cell to another along 'highways' made of other molecules .#.#. Cells swim using machines, copy themselves with machinery, ingest food with machinery. In short, highly sophisticated molecular machines control every cellular process. Thus the details of life are finely calibrated, and the machinery of life enormously complex.\"\n \n Now, all of this activity is taking place on what scale? A typical cell is only one thousandth of an inch [0.03 mm] across! In that infinitesimal space, complex functions vital to life are occurring. (See diagram, pages#8-9.) Little wonder that it has been said: \"The bottom line is that the cell-the very basis of life-is staggeringly complex.\"\n \n Behe argues that the cell can function only as a complete entity. Thus, it cannot be viable while being formed by slow, gradual changes induced by evolution. He uses the example of a mousetrap. This simple apparatus can function only when all its components are assembled. Each component on its own-platform, spring, holding bar, trap hammer, catch-is not a mousetrap and cannot function as such. All the parts are needed simultaneously and have to be assembled for there to be a working trap. Likewise, a cell can function as such only when all its components are assembled. He uses this illustration to explain what he terms \"irreducible complexity.\"\n \n This presents a major problem for the alleged process of evolution, which involves the appearance of gradually acquired, useful characteristics. Darwin knew that his theory of gradual evolution by natural selection faced a big challenge when he said: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\"-Origin of Species.\n \n The irreducibly complex cell is a major stumbling block to belief in Darwin's theory. In the first place, evolution cannot explain the leap from inanimate to animate matter. Then comes the problem of the first complex cell, which must arise in one fell swoop as an integrated unit. In other words, the cell (or, the mousetrap) must appear out of nowhere, assembled and functioning!\n \n The Irreducible Complexity of Blood Clotting\n \n Another example of irreducible complexity is a process most of us take for granted when we cut ourselves-blood clotting. Normally, any liquid will immediately leak out of a punctured container and will do so until the container is empty. Yet, when we puncture or cut our skin, the leak is quickly sealed by the formation of a clot. However, as doctors know, \"blood clotting is a very complex, intricately woven system consisting of a score of interdependent protein parts.\" These activate what is called a clotting cascade. This delicate healing process \"depends critically on the timing and speed at which the different reactions occur.\" Otherwise, a person could have all of his blood clotting and solidifying, or on the other hand, he could bleed to death. Timing and speed are the vital keys.\n \n Biochemical investigation has shown that blood clotting involves many factors, none of which can be missing for the process to succeed. Behe asks: \"Once clotting has begun, what stops it from continuing until all the blood .#.#. has solidified?\" He explains that \"the formation, limitation, strengthening, and removal of a blood clot\" make up an integrated biological system. If any part fails, then the system fails.\n \n Russell Doolittle, evolutionist and professor of biochemistry at the University of California, asks: \"How in the world did this complex and delicately balanced process evolve? .#.#. The paradox was, if each protein depended on activation by another, how could the system ever have arisen? Of what use would any part of the scheme be without the whole ensemble?\" Using evolutionary arguments, Doolittle tries to explain the origin of the process. However, Professor Behe points out that there would be an \"enormous amount of luck needed to get the right gene pieces in the right places.\" He shows that Doolittle's explanation and casual language conceal tremendous difficulties.\n \n Thus, one of the major objections to the evolutionary model is the insurmountable hurdle of irreducible complexity. Behe states: \"I emphasize that natural selection, the engine of Darwinian evolution, only works if there is something to select-something that is useful right now, not in the future.\"\n \n \"An Eerie and Complete Silence\"\n \n Professor Behe states that some scientists have studied \"mathematical models for evolution or new mathematical methods for comparing and interpreting sequence data.\" However, he concludes: \"The mathematics assumes that real-world evolution is a gradual, random process; it does not (and cannot) demonstrate it.\" (Last phrase italics ours.) He earlier said: \"If you search the scientific literature on evolution, and if you focus your search on the question of how molecular machines-the basis of life-developed, you find an eerie and complete silence. The complexity of life's foundation has paralyzed science's attempt to account for it; molecular machines raise an as-yet-impenetrable barrier to Darwinism's universal reach.\"\n \n This raises a series of questions for conscientious scientists to consider: \"How did the photosynthetic reaction center develop? How did intramolecular transport start? How did cholesterol biosynthesis begin? How did retinal become involved in vision? How did phosphoprotein signaling pathways develop?\" Behe adds: \"The very fact that none of these problems is even addressed, let alone solved, is a very strong indication that Darwinism is an inadequate framework for understanding the origin of complex biochemical systems.\"\n \n If Darwin's theory cannot explain the complex molecular foundation of cells, then how can it be a satisfactory explanation for the existence of the millions of species that inhabit this earth? After all, evolution cannot even produce new family kinds by bridging the gaps from one family kind to another.-Genesis 1:11, 21, 24.\n \n The Problems of the Beginning of Life\n \n No matter how plausible Darwin's theory of evolution may appear to be in the eyes of some scientists, they must ultimately face the question, Even if we assume that forms of living things evolved by natural selection, how did life get its start? In other words, the problem lies, not in survival of the fittest, but in arrival of the fittest and the first! However, as Darwin's remarks on the evolution of the eye indicate, he was not concerned with the problem of how life began. He wrote: \"How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated.\"\n \n French science writer Philippe Chambon wrote: \"Darwin himself wondered how nature selected emerging forms before they were perfectly functional. The list of evolutionary mysteries is endless. And today's biologists have to humbly admit, with Prof.#Jean G\u00e9nermont of the University of South Paris in Orsay, that 'the synthetic theory of evolution cannot readily explain the origin of complex organs.'\"\n \n In the light of the tremendous odds against such endless variety and complexity of life forms, do you find it difficult to believe that it all evolved in the right direction just by chance? Do you wonder how any creatures could have survived in the battle of the survival of the fittest while they were still evolving eyes? Or while they were supposedly forming primitive fingers on a subhuman body? Do you wonder how cells survived if they existed in an incomplete and inadequate state?\n \n Robert Naeye, a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist, wrote that life on earth is the result of \"a long sequence of improbable events [that] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence, as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.\" That line of reasoning can probably be applied to every single creature that exists today. The odds are stacked against it. Yet, we are expected to believe that by chance evolution also produced a male and a female at the same time in order for the new species to be perpetuated. To compound the odds, we also have to believe that the male and the female not only evolved at the same time but also in the same place! No meeting, no procreation!\n \n Certainly, it stretches credulity to the limit to believe that life exists in its millions of perfected forms as a result of millions of gambles that paid off.\n \n Why Do the Majority Believe?\n \n Why is evolution so popular and accepted by so many as the only explanation for life on earth? One reason is that it is the orthodox view taught in schools and universities, and woe betide you if you dare to express any doubts. Behe states: \"Many students learn from their textbooks how to view the world through an evolutionary lens. However, they do not learn how Darwinian evolution might have produced any of the remarkably intricate biochemical systems that those texts describe.\" He adds: \"To understand both the success of Darwinism as orthodoxy and its failure as science at the molecular level, we have to examine the textbooks that are used to teach aspiring scientists.\"\n \n \"If a poll were taken of all the scientists in the world, the great majority would say they believed Darwinism to be true. But scientists, like everybody else, base most of their opinions on the word of other people. .#.#. Also, and unfortunately, too often criticisms have been dismissed by the scientific community for fear of giving ammunition to creationists. It is ironic that in the name of protecting science, trenchant scientific criticism of natural selection has been brushed aside.\"\n \n \n\n \n \n Now that's what I'm talking about. emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xgood ",

That C-14 cannot be trusted when we're dating ancient hominid remains? Why hasn't anyone told me this before?!?! I've been duped!!!\n \n Oh, wait, this is the same trite #### every creationist comes up with, and it's always wrong for the same reasons. C-14 is only accurate up to about 50K years. After that, it's useless. There are also strict criteria that need to be followed, both in collection techniques and samples that can be tested, or the results are inaccurate.\n \n As for other dating methods, if you understood physics, you would see why they are reliable.

But in the last 100 years with many new scientific discoveries, it seems that the theory of evolution is even more accepted today than then. \n \n If TOE is weak, why hasn't it gotten weaker? Why has evolution won so much support all around the world? Are the evidences against evolution today just the same as 100 years ago?\n \n 2. Can the TOE be nullified on philosophical bases? I mean, there are many philosophers and theologians who accept evolution, maybe even a majority. In other words, can just logic and inference determine if the TOE is valid or not, or where does scientific evidence fit in? The scientists claim that their facts and observations count more than word arguments (which they sometimes dismiss as apologetics).\n \n How would you answer these points?",
