   "The truth is that the principles are christian principles based upon who said them not upon whether or not they can be found in other religions.\n\n Not true. If they existed prior to the existance of Christianity or if they existed in other religions or cultures independant of Christianity, then they are not \"Christian principles\". Maybe they are principles of Christianity, just as they are principles of Buddahism or Shintoism or even humanism. They are principles of moral human conduct not based on Christianity. If the claim is made that they are \"Christian\" as opposed to pre-christian Greek or Roman (which societies also had laws against murder and theft), then that assertion needs to be supported.\n \nThe people who founded this country were, primarily, christian.\n\n Nonsense. Some of the people who settled this country were Christian. Many were mercenary. Several of the colonies were founded as comercial enterprises rather than islands of religious freedom. But on the other hand, we aren't discussing the settling of this country but the founding of this nation.\n \nSome were not but the majority were.\n\n That's not even true of the settling of this country, much less of the Revolutionary period. In 1776 actual practicing christians were 7-15% of the population.\n \nThat is why they came to this country, Religious freedom, to practice their christianity as opposed to being required to follow the king and his anglican ways.\n\n If by religious freedom you mean the freedom to impose their religion, sometimes under penalty of death, on everyone, you are correct. That is how it was. Many colonies were comercial ventures and only established the Anglican Church as the official church because their charters came from the English crown. Still, they supressed dissent. And of course there was Massachusetts Bay Colony that didn't see a problem with the torture and murder of dissenters. Only Rhode Island, founded by Roger Williams after his banishment from Plymouth Colony, never had an established state religion.\n \nIt is a generally true statement to say that this country was founded by christians on christian principles.\n\n Then the question now falls to you. Please name those Christian principles. Again, if they are principles that are true of any and every culture, then they cannot be claimed as Christian but only reasonable and rational. The foundations that you claim were oppressive at best and vicious and murderous at worst, all claiming to be \"christian.\"\n \nThe primary principle is the one that allows us to choose or not choose chritianity.\n\n Nonsense. That isn't now and never was a principle of christianity. For 2000 years christians and christianity have been more than willing to burn dissidents. The freedom to freely choose and freely practice a religion of choice, or to choose none, is and idea from the Age of Reason. Descartes, Rouseau, and Locke to name a few. Those ideas influenced many of the founding fathers. This country wasn't founded by the Pilgrims. It was founded in 1776 and in 1787 by more open minded and less religiously obsessed men. The freedom to choose or not choose a religion is based in humanism and the rejection of traditional authority by the philosophers of the Age of Reason.\n \nJesus died on a cross so that we could be free to choose him (or not).\n\n Lovely thought until you begin to look at the consequences in a \"christian\" nation of not choosing him.\n \nThere is no greater principle of christianity than free will. I believe it is unique to christianity.\n\n First, the christian idea of free will is a bit weak and not at all unique. Second, the \"free will\" has historically been the option to \"freely\" accept christianity or to die.\n \n So I guess you didn't want to actually address the question. Is the quote an expression of the christian principles of this nation?",

   "Sorry to just jump in the middle of this debate, but I just thought that I would throw a few ideas in here.\n \n The founding fathers were not very \"Christian\" at all, if you go by a fundamentalist's definition of what a Christian is.\n \n Ben Franklin was an atheist. The vast majority of the founding fathers were deists, which meant that they believed in God but not a personal God. They believed that God created the world and all of the universal laws that govern it, and then kind of sat back and watched. There was no personal relationship. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Jefferson Bible, in which he included all of the teachings of Jesus but excluded the miracles.\n The founding fathers were a product of the Age of Enlightenment, and it showed in their religious beliefs.",

But why are we talking about the Christian religion?\n \n As far as Christian Principles go, this country is based on them. The belief that God is going to protect us is a Christian Principle. For more just look at the rights given to us. They are a list of things you would expect to see in the Bible. The 10 commandments could almost be used in place of some of them.

Another would be how similar our rights are to the 10 commandments. OK, so it isn't close to an identical match, but I would guess that they played a role in the making of some of our first laws.

   "Do you have any evidence of that? Since the Constitution doesn't mention either God or Christ, how can it be based on principles of that religion?\n \n Cite the article of the Constitution that expresses that belief.\n\n \n I see where the area of our disagreement is then. Ideals and beliefs is what I was thinking of. You wanted stuff in writing. I agree with you then that our government is not based on Christian principles. However, I think our government left itself open to cultural influences and this inherently became part of our governments foundation.\n \n One thing though, could you explain why you responded to my quote \"The belief that God is going to protect us is a Christian Principle.\" in the way that you did? It doesn't seem to make sense. I simply stated that it is a Christian principle and your telling me to point out where it is in the constitution. I never said it was in there. As you can see, we just had different ideas where this debate was coming from.\n \n \nSo you have never read the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, right? Please point out where these Biblical rights are declared in the Constitution. Do you mean the principle of freedom of religion? The Bible declares that everyone is free to ignore the Bible and read the Koran? Is that it?\n \n Cite some examples.\n\n \n You got me there. I was in the mindset of extending the laws of the constitution into our legal system as well as our judicial system. Upon looking further into this, I see a few of the things I thought were in place there don't even hold true. A misconception on my part.\n \n \nYou seem to have a reading problem. I asked no such thing. I gave a quote that was given as an answer to the question. I asked if anyone agreed that that quote contained christian principles.\n\n \n As you could see in my post, I seen the entire topic had already shifted. I suppose I could have answered your original question but I was just going with the flow of the debate. If you wish to have your original post answered, here is my response\n \n --That all men are created equal\n I'd agree that is Christian principle. I'll get into this more later.\n --That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n I'd disagree that this is a Christian principle. It is a stretch in either direction however. I'd say this is more based on our idea of freedom which I don't think is a Christian principle either.\n \n With this answered I must revert back to your quote. You're quick to jump on me for having a reading problem when you misread my quote in this very post I'm responding to. You're a smart guy and I've never been at odds with your views before and always thought you were pretty classy in your debates. I guess I may have been mistaken.\n \n \nWhere is that principle stated in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence?\n\n \n You're in the pattern of asking this question as if all things our government was founded on are written down. I guess instead of trying to dig further into this I want to ask you if you think everything our government is founded on is written down. I think with normal people in charge and being a democracy, things go deeper than just what was written down.\n \n \nSilly.\n\n \n In what way? Our president will commonly refer to God in a protecting role. In God We Trust right? Do you think this statement means anything when it comes to what our government is founded on? Our leaders of today clearly believe that God will ensure our future. Was the original government founded on that same principle?\n \n \nActually, all cultures have similar laws. That's the point. They are commons sense.\n\n \n Well some are. I personally don't think Cuba is too based on common sense. Concerning them all being similar though, don't you agree ours has a Christian tint to it? It got there somehow. I would expand but it would just be a rehash of earlier statements.\n \n \nCorrect. It wasn't. The philosophy of most of the founding fathers was humanism and many were deists. The ideas of the Declaration of Independence were first expressed by the philosophers of the Age of Reason who rejected authoritarianism and dogmatism, especially that of religion. Notice in the quote that truth isn't revealed by god but self evident - they meant to thinking people. No sacred text to read to learn the truth. The equality of all men has never been a principle of christianity. If you think it is, cite the bible verse. In this country we have no one who is, by the grace of God, king. No one rules by divine right.\n\n \n Although I can't cite a Bible verse, I would still call it a Christian principle. If you consider that God exists, then you have to consider that he created each of us. That alone can be used to justify that we are all equal. It is just a point of view that you can take or leave and it's the one I latched onto when I was young. I think a lot of people would believe that God views all people as equals.\n \n But, I'm not saying that our government chose to use these words because of their Christian beliefs. I'm simply going to say that it is a Christian principle.\n \n \nYou're wrong because you can't even give me an example.\n\n \n Once again, a strange response to what was quoted. It would appear that your answering the question \"Have I proven myself to be correct as it pertains to your question?\" when really I asked whether you were looking for examples or not. Your response should have been \"You're wrong, I am asking a question, not looking for examples.\" That would have been a better fit.\n \n PS - I just want to give one example here to better spell out what I'm getting at. Lets say a bunch of despots got together and wrote a constitution and declaration of independence and said the government was founded on democracy and freedoms and these ideas were followed through with at first. As time went on they began to transform the nation into a communist police state, as was their initial intention. The constitution and declaration never changed. So was the government based on democracy and freedom or communism and control? You could debate this either way and I don't think either one is universally correct. I would say communism and control since I see the government as being based on the collective governments ideas and intentions and that was the real foundation of the government. You might debate that the initial foundation was written and put into place and then later changed over time; therefore the communist ideas were not the foundation.\n \n This is somewhat similar to what my belief is with our government as it pertains to Christian principles. They may not have written down things that concerned Christian principles, but the collective government shifted towards those ideas because they were already instilled in them, therefore I would debate that Christian principles were part of the foundation of our government even if it was only as ideas and intentions and the culture of the people of the US.",

   "This is worth remembering, because it is true. It's familiar territory, but..... Those of you that graduated from school after the early 60's were probably never taught this. Our courts have seen to that ! Did you know that 52 of the 55 signers of \"The Declaration of Independence\" were orthodox, deeply committed, Christians? The other three all believed in the Bible as the divine truth, the God of scripture, and His personal intervention. It is the same Congress that formed the American Bible Society, immediately after creating the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress voted to purchase and import 20,000 copies of Scripture for the people of this nation. \n Patrick Henry, who is called the firebrand of the American Revolution, is still remembered for his words, \"Give me liberty or give me death\"; but in current textbooks, the context of these words is omitted. Here is what he actually said: \"An appeal to arms and the God of hosts is all that is left us. But we shall not fight our battle alone. There is a just God that presides over the destinies of nations. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone. Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it Almighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.\" \n \n \n Was Patrick Henry a Christian? The following year, 1776, he wrote this: \"It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great Nation was founded not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For that reason alone, people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here.\" \n \n Consider these words that Thomas Jefferson wrote in the front of his well-worn Bible: \"I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. I have little doubt that our whole country will soon be rallied to the unity of our creator.\" He was also the chairman of the American Bible Society, which he considered his highest and most important role. \n \n On July 4, 1821, President Adams said, \"The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: \"It connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n Calvin Coolidge, our 30th President of the United States reaffirmed this truth when he wrote, \"The foundations of our society and our government rest so much on the teachings of the Bible that it would be difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically universal in our country.\" \n \n In 1782, the United States Congress voted this resolution: \"The Congress of the United States recommends and approves the Holy Bible for use in all schools.\" \n \n William Holmes McGuffey is the author of the McGuffey Reader, which was used for over 100 years in our public schools with over 125 million copies sold until it was stopped in 1963. President Lincoln called him the \"Schoolmaster of the Nation.\" Listen to these word of Mr. McGuffey: \"The Christian religion is the religion of our country. From it are derived our nation, on the character of God, on the great moral Governor of the universe. On its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free Institutions. From no source has the author drawn more conspicuously than from the sacred Scriptures. From all these extracts from the Bible, I make no apology.\" \n \n Of the first 108 universities founded in America, 106 were distinctly Christian, including the first, HarvardUniversity, chartered in 1636. \n \n In the original Harvard Student Handbook, rule number 1 was that students seeking entrance must know Latin and Greek so that they could study the Scriptures: \"Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies, is, to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life, John 17:3; and therefore to lay Jesus Christ as the only foundation for our children to follow the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.\" \n \n James Madison, the primary author of the Constitution of the United States, said this: \"We have staked the whole future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.\" \n \n Today, we are asking God to bless America. But, how can He bless a Nation that has departed so far from Him? Prior to September 11, He was not welcome in America. Most of what you read in this article has been erased from our textbooks. Revisionists have rewritten history to remove the truth about our country's Christian roots. \n \n You are encouraged to share with others, so that the truth of our nation's history will be told. \n \n This is a copy from a web sight.

Funny you should mention him in a discussion of christian principles and the foundation of this country. Henry was not in favor of freedom of religion. Henry favored the establishment of a state religion. he attempted to pass A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion. That bill would have taxed everyone for payment to \"societies of Christians.\" Madison wrote Memorial and Remonstrance to express the arguments against Henry's bill taxing all citizens to support christianity. Patrick Henry's bill was defeated.\n \n Madison, taking advantage of the spirit of the Assembly then introduced a bill that had been written by Thomas Jefferson in 1779. Patrick Henry had successfully defeated the bill on a previous occasion. This time, the bill, Bill for Religious Freedom was passed. Again, Patrick Henry opposed the \"Bill for Religious Freedom.\n \n That was in December of 1785. Shortly after that, Madison left for the Continental Convention whose purpose was to amend the Articles of Confederation. Instead, the convention wrote the Constitution.\n \n When the Constitution was presented to the Virginia Assembly for ratification, Patrick Henry led the opposition.
