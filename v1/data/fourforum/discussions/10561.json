Do you remember the 75 series? Sox vs. Reds? They came soooo close in that one too. Even if the Reds woulda lost, I'd still say that was one of the best World Series ever! :)",

Four years ago, it was all about the curse. They didn't win the series, they broke the curse. This time, they won the series.\n \n I know that doesn't make sense, but I'm a Sox fan. We don't have to make sense! emoticon_xhoho",

I was a big fan of Carl Yazstremski (YAZ) (in the 60s, gulp!). But as a young adult I moved to NY and they lost the WS in like the last inning (and I lost money on a bet), I got mad at them and became a Yankee fan.
