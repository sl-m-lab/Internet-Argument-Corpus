   "By 365gay Newswire\n 11.24.2009 1:14pm EST\n \n From Lambda Legal:\n \n (Atlanta) In the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today, Lambda Legal and co-counsel filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta, the Chief of Police and 48 individual officers of the Atlanta Police Department on behalf of 19 individuals who, on Sept. 10 at the Atlanta Eagle gay bar, were forcibly searched and detained.\n \n \"The illegal activity going on in the Atlanta Eagle that night was committed by the APD,\" said Greg Nevins, Supervising Senior Staff Attorney in Lambda Legal's Southern Regional Office based in Atlanta. \"If it is APD procedure for elderly men and wounded veterans to be thrown to the floor and harassed simply for being in a bar having a drink after work, then the APD should change its procedures.\"\n \n Dan Grossman, co-counsel in the case, has been working with victims of the raid since that night. \"I've listened to dozens of stories from patrons who were mistreated by police at the Atlanta Eagle that night,\" said Grossman. \"The Atlanta Police Department is not above the law. They do not get to search and detain people who are not suspected of any crime.\"\n \n On Sept. 10, the Atlanta Police Department dispatched 20 to 30 officers to the Atlanta Eagle, including its \"Red Dog Unit\" dressed in SWAT team gear, but inside the bar the APD found no public sex, no drugs, or illegal weapons. During the raid, patrons of the bar were forced to lie facedown on the floor while background checks were run on everyone. Eagle bar patrons heard antigay slurs; were forced to lay in spilled beer and broken glass; and one was forced to lie on the floor even though he had injured his back in the Iraq War. Not a single patron was charged with any crime.\n \n \"The Atlanta Eagle is one of my favorite bars. I usually go there to drink a beer, unwind, and watch a football game after rehearsing with the Gay Men's Chorus,\" said Mark Danak, a Lambda Legal client named in the case. \"But that Thursday night was a very serious experience that I will never forget.\"\n \n The lawsuit challenges the APD officers' actions, claiming violations of the U.S. and Georgia Constitutions and Georgia state law.",

   "Archie, Jazy's position merits consideration. If the raid was unduly violent due to the people being raided being gay, that's a serious issue.\n\n \n I agree 100%. But just because the cops placed these people on their stomachs after beer spilled on the floor, that doesn't translate to violent abuse in any way. Even Jason's Gay365 source failed to mention the ambulances which were called to that bar to tend to the injured. Could that missing fact be due to the fact that there were no injuries at all? You bet it is because if these militant jerks could have found any minor reason for claiming an injury, you know darn well that they would have done it. \n \n Just as important as the biased info they report is the info which is missing from this trumped up attempt at condemning the Police for just responding to undercover reports and eye witness accounts of what went on in that gay bar and goes on in most every gay bar around this country on such a regular basis.\n \n So Jason and Matthew can lie to themselves if they like, afterall, that defines their complete lifestyle and world view. But they mustn't lie to me because I will always point out the hypocrisy and double standards which they represent here. Here is more evidence of this national epidemic in their homosexual community, and it's from an expert source for drug abuse which is objective and sincerely concerned for the gay community. Here's an excerpt and a link: \n \n Partying to Death: Drug Abuse and Gay Nightlife CultureGay men in America currently enjoy more freedom and acceptance than at any time in our nation's history. But while not everyone in the gay community is willing to admit it, there is a significant \"party\" culture that inhabits the homosexual community in America and still lies outside the mainstream of American culture. While this is not a problem in and of itself, high levels of drug abuse and drug addiction are common among these nightlife scenes - where a more hedonistic spirit dominates the environment. [snip]\n \n Drug Abuse in Predominantly Gay Communities\n \n Gay communities such as New York City's Greenwich Village or Los Angeles' West Hollywood are home to a number of bars and clubs that cater exclusively to gay men. It is the safety and inclusiveness of these neighborhoods that seems to inspire such heavy drug use. Individuals who may have long been ostracized in their own small town come to the \"big city\" and find a welcoming environment where, for the first time, everyone is just like them.\n \n This comfort level leads individuals to release their inhibitions more than they generally would - which can lead to drug abuse. As a result, party drugs and stimulants tend to thrive in these areas.\n \n Another factor to consider is the collective use of drugs in the party scenes of these communities. When drugs are taken by an individual in isolation, there is still a stigma to the behavior that keeps many from using and therefore developing an addiction. In the gay nightlife scene, however, there is a \"community feel\" to the use of crystal meth and other drugs. This puts an inherent stamp-of-approval on the behavior that makes it difficult for many gay men to abstain or seek out drug rehab treatment.Partying to Death: Drug Abuse and Gay Nightlife Culture Featured Articles | Michael's House\n \n Now, Iuris, you know as well as I do that both Jason and Matthew are intimately involved in the gay community. Yet you can see how easily they come here and blatantly lie as they rely on the fact that since we straights don't actually hang out in gay bars then we have no first hand knowledge of their hidden culture. At every level of discourse regarding the unnatural, perverted and sick culture which defines the homosexual mind set, these people think nothing of spewing lies and deceptions in the knowledge that if they tell a lie enough times, for them it becomes the truth.",

   "This is very silly. Archangel is trying to paint the entire gay community with the same brushstroke. In fact, what we are looking at is a subset of nightlifers and a subset of that who use drugs.\n \n There are issues as to why this may happen, as is openly discussed by the article Archangel found online(not exactly the gay community hiding anything as Arch suggests). He doesn't get points for any huge expose.\n \n Predominantly straight nightclubs aren't scenes from a Disney movie for the Family Channel, either.\n \n Do all gay people spend a lot of time in nightclubs? No. Some not at all.\n\n \n Right Jake. Because I respond to excuses and justifications of the gay lifestyle by showing a pattern in your community, I must be unfairly generalizing, right? Well, let's see what a group of Gay Doctors say about the illicit drug use in the club scene.

No one has the legal right nor the clairvoyance to discriminate against anyone, that is plain to see.

I myself am a Christian and am an openly young Gay man! \n \n As a matter of fact I am participating in the 2010 Soulforce Equality Ride founded by Mel White. You see Matt? There are peoples of faith FIGHTING for the rights of all!\n \n Do not fight hatred with bitter hatred. You solve nor accomplish nothing Matt. I assume that you yourself have personal convictions for your deep feelings and I sympathize. However you must look at this from if not a perspective of one who is a champion for civil rights, but even only from being a Gay man that to deny ANYONE their rights is a detriment to not only that group, but to society as a whole.\n \n \n Is there discrimination from the pulpit? Yes. Are such things propagated and blown out of proportion to escalate the issue to the political stage? Yes. It is called manipulation Matt. Manipulation of good hearted people who know nothing of Gay people except from watching Will & Grace...\n \n We must be the bigger person Matt. Equal rights is not equal if you are only in it for yourself. I prey you remember the words of one of the prominent voices of LGBT activism Harvey Bernard Milk.\n \n Milk instilled that it is not JUST about the Gays. But ALL whom have no voice or are discriminated against! What would Milk say to your stance against rights of religious peoples? Here is an excerpt from a speech Milk gave: \n \n Harvey Milk, \"The Hope Speech\" (Excerpt)\n \n You see there is a major difference-and it remains a vital difference-between a friend and a gay person, a friend in office and a gay person in office. Gay people have been slandered nationwide. We've been tarred and we've been brushed with the picture of pornography. In Dade County, we were accused of child molestation. It's not enough anymore just to have friends represent us. No matter how good that friend may be.\n \n The black community made up its mind to that a long time ago. That the myths against blacks can only be dispelled by electing black leaders, so the black community could be judged by the leaders and not by the myths or black criminals. The Spanish community must not be judged by Latin criminals or myths. The Asian community must not be judged by Asian criminals or myths. The Italian community should not be judged by the mafia myths. And the time has come when the gay community must not be judged by our criminals and myths.\n \n Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible. For invisible, we remain in limbo-a myth, a person with no parents, no brothers, no sisters, no friends who are straight, no important positions in employment. A tenth of a nation supposedly composed of stereotypes and would-be seducers of children-and no offense meant to the stereotypes. But today, the black community is not judged by its friends, but by its black legislators and leaders. And we must give people the chance to judge us by our leaders and legislators. A gay person in office can set a tone, can command respect not only from the larger community, but from the young people in our own community who need both examples and hope.\n \n The first gay people we elect must be strong. They must not be content to sit in the back of the bus. They must not be content to accept pablum. They must be above wheeling and dealing. They must be-for the good of all of us-independent, unbought. The anger and the frustrations that some of us feel is because we are misunderstood, and friends can't feel that anger and frustration. They can sense it in us, but they can't feel it. Because a friend has never gone through what is known as coming out. I will never forget what it was like coming out and having nobody to look up toward. I remember the lack of hope-and our friends can't fulfill that.\n \n I can't forget the looks on faces of people who've lost hope. Be they gay, be they seniors, be they black looking for an almost-impossible job, be they Latins trying to explain their problems and aspirations in a tongue that's foreign to them. I personally will never forget that people are more important than buildings. I use the word \"I\" because I'm proud. I stand here tonight in front of my gay sisters, brothers and friends because I'm proud of you. I think it's time that we have many legislators who are gay and proud of that fact and do not have to remain in the closet. I think that a gay person, up-front, will not walk away from a responsibility and be afraid of being tossed out of office. After Dade County, I walked among the angry and the frustrated night after night and I looked at their faces. And in San Francisco, three days before Gay Pride Day, a person was killed just because he was gay. And that night, I walked among the sad and the frustrated at City Hall in San Francisco and later that night as they lit candles on Castro Street and stood in silence, reaching out for some symbolic thing that would give them hope. These were strong people, people whose faces I knew from the shop, the streets, meetings and people who I never saw before but I knew. They were strong, but even they needed hope.\n \n And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and more offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.\n \n So if there is a message I have to give, it is that if I've found one overriding thing about my personal election, it's the fact that if a gay person can be elected, it's a green light. And you and you and you, you have to give people hope. Thank you very much.",

   "Right Jake. Because I respond to excuses and justifications of the gay lifestyle by showing a pattern in your community, I must be unfairly generalizing, right? Well, let's see what a group of Gay Doctors say about the illicit drug use in the club scene. And just for clarification, my exposing of the problem in no way condemns or implicates every homosexual alive. But as usual, in order to oppose my valid criticisms, you guys must insinuate that I am offering a universal condemnation of all homosexuals. Just another extremist example of how you infer blanket condemnation in order to reject any criticism of your community. Here's an excerpt from the link:\n GAY AND LESBIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\n Gay Docs: \"Club Drug Epidemic, Severe Health Risk\"\n March 16, 2000\n \n San Francisco -- An organization of 2,000 physicians and medical students has urged the federal government to fund research, treatment, and education focused on the increasing and indiscriminate use of drugs, among them so-called \"club drugs.\"\n \"We cannot wait any longer,\" said Donald I. Abrams, MD, President of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA). \"We are seeing a severe increase in the abuse of methamphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, gamma-hydroxbutyrate (GHB) and nitrates (poppers). We are seeing the devastating results in our emergency rooms. Unfortunately, that's not the end of it,\" Abrams added. \"There is potential for even greater harm because we are not clear about the long-term effects.\"\n \n Abrams, an HIV specialist and leading researcher in the study of medical marijuana, said that GLMA has sounded the club drug alarm because the message isn't getting to the research community or to the people using the drugs who need to know what kind of dangers they face.\"\n \n Indiscriminate use of club drugs appears to be highest among gay and bisexual males in the LGBT population, based on the increase of acute episodes in emergency rooms, Abrams indicated. However, because of the lack of research data, even less is known about club-drug misuse among lesbian and transgender populations.Gay Docs: \"Club Drug Epidemic, Severe Health Risk\" - The Body\n \n \n \n Really? I thought you were committed to equality for the gay community? Isn't that the constant and persistent mantra I hear for your side? Then why in the world would you think that law enforcement protecting club patrons from a culture of illicit public sex and illegal drug use which could be harmful to the patrons health, a bad thing? Don't they deserve the same protections and oversight that is afforded straight clubs in your opinion? \n \n The hypocrisy and double standards which you amoral defenders of homosexuality exhibit in every debate as you pick and choose which benefits you want for this outlaw community is mind numbing. You seem to want equality as in all of the rights we have as straights, but none of the responsibilities to live up to the social standards which we must follow. Let's face it Jito, straight bars are raided all the time with no outcry from anyone about unfair treatment. But let the homosexuals be held to the same standards and it is bigoted homophobia once again. \n \n Why don't we just close down every single gay bar in america and force homosexuals to party as one people with the rest of america? Why do they require segregated clubs at all? What sick practices do they do which can't be done in straight clubs? Oh wait, that's what this story is all about, isn't it. Public sex and illegal party drugs.\n\n \n Arch buddy come on now. The article is discussing the LGTB community. Gay/Bi males being the top two of a list of 6 possible. If you look at straight club activities I bet males will drink and do drugs more than women. Are you suggesting that the drug problem in the US can be attributed to LGTB club goers? Or is it mostly straight America? You want the LGTB to stop being so sensitive about these types of situations, then stop making them from happening so frequently. \n \n I see this Gay Agenda nonsense or Homosexuals are or practice offensive acts and scratch my head in wonder. Are you so unsure of your ability to avoid temptation that you must cast the first stone. Homosexuals are a minority segment of the population who while not perfect tend to be responsibile members of society with no higher % of bad behavior than straights. Why is their \"Agenda\" so inferior to yours? The only things they ask for are the same things Christians have asked for whenever they were in they minority. They don't ask you to not be Christian, but you demand they not be Gay. \n \n To think that LGTB have not been subject to random and concerted acts of violence, humiliation and discrimination is naive on your part. When it happens to christians it's a problem, when it happens to children its a problem, when it happens to blacks, women, elderly and handicapped its a problem, when it happens to LGTB it's unfortunate (maybe), but they brought it on themselves or they are not deserving of the same protections religion is. \n \n Get a bible read only the words in red then compare to life and see if it's possible to get the to any closer to one another",

The point of my link is to show that gay bars and the homosexual community in general has an epidemic of party drug use in clubs. So since when should cops feel intimidated from doing their job when informants and undercover cops have verified that illegal activities have taken place there? Why do gays expect cops to look the other way when they demand that cops protect them from certain other crimes which they consider worth enforcing?",
