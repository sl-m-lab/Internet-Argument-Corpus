No one voted with the lawyers. The Constitution and the 2nd Amendment is the highest law of the land. You and I know that a repeal of the 2nd Amendment will never happen. There are not enough votes to make it happen. That is why these slimy lawyers are doing this. Do you are do you not agree that The People should vote to decide thier own destiny? If it yes then you do not want to lawyers to succeed. If it is no, then you are a tyrant in training.",
