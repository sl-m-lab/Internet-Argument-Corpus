If you love it, set it free.\n \n If after a few years you start reading the Bible again and going to church and then you decide that the Bible is totally correct and factual, then by all means, believe it again.\n \n But just give the other way (free thought) a chance for a while and see where it takes you (straight to HELL!!!)",

   "I really like that page that Evil Dave linked to:\n \n Here is something really nice:\n http://members.aol.com/darrwin/things.htm#oops\n \nAnother Genesis Oops\n \n Ben Walsh has been reading closely:\n The snake tells the truth--God lies.\n \n 2:9 \"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\"\n \n There are two trees, right. We've got that.\n \n 2:16-17 \"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\"\n \n God says the knowledge tree will kill. Fair enough.\n \n 3:4-5 \"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\"\n \n But wait, the snake says the knowledge tree will give knowledge! Let's conduct a little scientific\n experiment:\n \n 3:6 \"She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.\"\n \n And she died, right? That's what God said ...\n \n 3:7 \"And the eyes of them both were opened\"\n \n Oops.\n \n 3:14 \"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\"\n \n And this is the model for modern-day creationists, who get equally tetchy when you use inconvenient facts to prove them wrong. But just to be sure we're absolutely clear about what the tree of knowledge of good and evil does:\n \n 3:22 \"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever...\"\n \n OK, and for future reference you might choose better code words than \"the tree of life\" and \"the tree of knowledge of good and evil,\" but we'll leave that. What I really want to know is whom are You talking to in this particular passage?\n \n And Stephen Reese adds yet another Genesis Faux Pas:\n The 10th chapter of Genesis recounts what happened to Noah's sons and their descendants after the Flood as they repopulated the Earth. Gen 10:1 through 10:5 recounts Japheth's line and ends with the refrain \"divided in their lands; everyone after his tongue, after their families in their nations.\" Gen 10:6-20 recounts Ham's line and ends with the refrain \"after their familles, after their tongues in their countries and in their nations.\" Gen 10:21-31 recounts Shem's line, ending with the refrain \"after their families, after their tongues, in their lands after their nations.\"\n So they went forth multiplying and developing their own languages, cultures and nations, okay, so far, so good. And then at the start of chapter 11 (on the same page in my KJV!) \"And the whole earth was one language, and of one speech,\" - Genesis 11:1. OOPS! \n",

   "Dear Lord, help us emoticon_xangel. Please do some (any!) research on Christianity relating to Evolution etc... And lo!... not all Christians are fundamentalists (only a minority are) or consider Biblical literealism to be mandatory (the two oldest branches of Christianity don't consider it to be necessarily so, and neither does Protestantism [as a whole; no doubt, some branches within it seem to]); and furthermore, nor are inerrant and literalism inherently linked. Geez.\n\n i am aware of this. i invited thebootfitter on a very eye-opening discussion about this a few months back. it still baffles me how christians can accept that genesis cannot be a literal account of actual events, yet accept christianity s valid. i'm not saying that it doesnt happen, i'm just saying that i personally cannot see how it makes sense. i'll probbly start another thread and see if i can get another viewpoint on it",

   "For me the answer is quite simple. The foundation of Christianity is not Genesis. Christianity is based on the teachings of Christ from the Gospels and the interpretation of those teachings as contained in the early writings of the church fathers, those that were included in the New Testament. You are aware, I'm sure, that there are many writings that have come to light that were excluded from the \"Bible\" for one reason or another (interpretation). The exact form of our \"Bible\" wasn't actually defined until the 4th century by the concious decision of men who decided which books were the inspired word of God and which weren't. In other words, these men defined Christianity.\n \n If you wish to insist that the whole Bible, every word is the absolute truth then your religion is quickly reduced to nonsense. Bats aren't birds, grasshoppers don't have 4 legs, and the coney doesn't chew cud. If you then claim that we must interpret these things according to the knowledge of the people who wrote them, they you have abandoned a literal reading of the Bible. At that point it would be silly to insist that any of the obvious mythology and alegory of the Bible is literal.\n \n And if you do some research into the first two books of Genesis you will find that they are versions of Sumarian and Babylonian creation myths. That's why there are two versions of creation in the first two books.\n \n And if Genesis is a myth or an alegory, why does that negate man's need for salvation? Why does that make the rest of the Bible a lie?\n \n The difference is that you are interpreting the Bible the way you want it to be and declaring what you think is true and not true. If the Bible is really literally true, why does it say that the earth has 4 corners (it doesn't), that the earth is a circle (it isn't), or that it is fixed and immovable (it's not)? Which parts are literal and which aren't?",

   "I would like to pre-curse my statement by saying that I came across this thread while searching for another reference and that I personally believe in the likelihood of speciation. However, the true \"debate\" over \"evolution\" is a misrepresentation of terms and self proclaimed intellectuals that know very little about the nature of science and particularly evolution. Very few Christians [under 50] deny micro evolution; which is the identification of survival changes over time through breeding based upon survival changes within an environment. Micro-evolution is not a theory but a fact it happens and has been observed using plants and simpler life forms that breed and die quickly the most famous experiments dealing with fruit flies. Most often the Christians that do question \"evolution\" they question Macro-evolution also known as speciation (depending on what definition of speciation you use), which is the concept that at certain times evolution makes huge jumps in genetic shifts that result in \"new\" species (an over simplification and there are many theories in specie formation). There is an severe lack of conclusive evidence supporting speciation and is simply a theory or an educated guess based upon other evidence. The educational system through teaching the relationship between life forms has adopted the evolutionary paradigm as it creates nice squalor transitions when talking about biology. \n \n Over the years these \"educated\" people through the media as journalist and movie/television writers began sharing their preliminary understanding of evolution as indisputable fact. My favorite example has been from friends and Ross's inaccurate claims, as a paleontologist, about fossil records. Through the media's support of the presuppositions taught in high schools and under graduate institutions people all to often espouse their expertise in their knowledge of the certainty of evolutionary \"theory\" which is most always overwhelmingly lacking and incorrect. \n \n The Christian Churches of the 21st century are becoming less and less \"fundamental\" and for lack of a better word more \"liberal\" as new ways to spread the gospel catches up with the rapid pace of empiricalism (which is what apologetics is about). The vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and Christianity, such as this post, are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch (ie. People educated in the 40's and 50's when higher education was less common) or a very small percentage of Christians. Christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable (and non-observable) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of Christians you perpetuate falsehoods. \n \n Edited for minor grammatical mistakes",

First, You insinuate that there are no scientists/biologists that are creationists, which given the variedness of humanity is obviously flawed. Your lumping of creationist as \"semi-literate, rural, poor, and female\" is baseless outside your own bigotry; any statistical tendency, I would doubt, would be seriously far from the norm.

One example is a group of species, collectively called hemp nettles, that occurs in temperate parts of Europe and Asia. One hemp nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit (2n = 32), is a naturally occurring allopolyploid thought to have formed by the hybridization of two species, G. pubescens (2n = 16) and G. speciosa (2n = 16). This process occurred in nature but was experimentally reproduced. Galeopsis pubescens and G. speciosa were crossed to produce F1 hybrids, most of which were sterile. Nevertheless, both F2 and F3 generations were produced. The F3 generation included a polyploid plant with 2n = 32 that self-fertilized to yield fertile F4 offspring that could not mate with either of the parental species. These allopolyploid plants had the same appearance and chromosome number as the naturally occurring G. tetrahit. When the experimentally produced plants were crossed with the naturally occurring G. tetrahit, a fertile F1 generation was formed. Thus, the experiment duplicated the speciation process that occurred in nature. (Biology: Fifth Edition, Eldra Pearl Solomon, Linda R. Berg, and Diana W.

   "The emcompassment of a that statement is completely absurd. First, You insinuate that there are no scientists/biologists that are creationists, which given the variedness of humanity is obviously flawed.\nI thought my statement was pretty clear, and I didn't even invent words. There is no debate among scientists, especially biologists, that evolution occurs, including speciation. Any debate is concerned with details about how and why evolution happens rather than whether it does. There may be a few creationists, but their objections do not constitute a scientific debate. There is no creationist research that can be considered science. If a creationist publishes, their work is not applicable to evolutionary theory.\n \nYour lumping of creationist as \"semi-literate, rural, poor, and female\" is baseless outside your own bigotry; any statistical tendency, I would doubt, would be seriously far from the norm.\nActually, it was Gallup who came to those conclusions. Gallup does a poll every few years and the results are consistently the same. Creationists tend to be rural, more poorly educated, less affluent, and female. Gallup, a young earth creationist, has always been quite upset by the results of his polls, but at least he is honest enough to publish his findings without diddling with the numbers. There have been other polls.\n \nSecond, it is absurd to claim that there isn't various levels of debate about a subject within the scientific community.\nI notice that you had a \"first\" this time. Don't misrepresent what I said. There are debates about how and why evolution occurs, how fast it occurs, whether it is allopatric or sympatric, and a myriad of other things. But there is essentially no debate among biologists (and other scientists as well) about whether evolution occur. Polls have shown that among degreed scientists, about 95% accept evolution. That number is about 99% in the biological sciences and geology. Chemists (even biochemists and organic chemists) have the greatest number of creationists in their ranks.\n \nYou can do a google search and/or amazon search and find tons of reference to the contrary by accredited science educated people. I grant you they are in the minority, but it's far from being such a small minority that one can objectively simply dismiss their existence.\nActually, not many are \"accredited science educated people.\" There are few creationists who hold degrees in science. Most of your google hits will be to \"ministries.\" I even mentioned some with bogus degrees. Others don't have degrees in appropriate fields - hydraulics engineering, law, chemistry, computer science, math, etc. Their disagreement doesn't constitute a debate about science.\n \nMy goal when defining terms was to give a simple definition without using jargon.\nBut you made your definitions circular. In other words, you made them so simple that they became meaningless.\n \nI simply meant that micro evolution acknowledges (identiifies) that certain phenotypes (survival changes) adds to the likelihood that those phenotypic characters (based on survival changes) survive and/or become dominate.\nNope. Evolution is a process so it doesn't \"acknowledge\" or \"identify\" anything. A phenotype is not a \"survival change.\" A phenotype is the physical appearance of an organism determined by the complex action of its genes with each other and with the environment. You have also misused the word \"dominate.\" Perhaps you are unaware that the word \"dominate\" has specific meaning in biology, and that meaning does not indicate that it is more numerous. For example, the allele that causes the dark morph of Biston betularia is dominant, and yet dark morphs comprise less than 5% of the population.\n \n Wouldn't it have been better to use the terminology that evolutionary biologists do rather than misuse a word? After all, you purport to be discussing evolutionary biology.\n \n Microevolution is, by the way, evolution below the level of species. No need to make up circular and confused explanations. Evolution is, of course, a change in allele frequencies in a population of organisms over time, i.e., from generation to generation.\n \n You also seem to have conflated the simple definition of evolution and one to the better tested theories about one of the mechanisms that cause evolution. Offering a confused and incorrect definition of natural selection does not clarify the discussion. It only makes it quite clear that you haven't bothered to learn the basics.\n \nI agree that it wasn't as clear as it could of been.\nCircular definitions rarely are.\n \nHowever, my goal was to speak to an audience that could infer my meaning with at least a basic understanding of the concepts, but various levels of understanding of the terminology.\nThen you failed in your goal. There could be no understanding of your meaning or terminology since your definition was circular.\n \nI do not try to use jargon in an attempt to alienate people from the discussion and accept the fact that people of various levels of education and skills can still provide valid critical analysis.\nBut shouldn't you at least define things correctly? If necessary, then offer correct definitions of the terms. How is it jargon that alienates people to tell them that microevolution is evolution below the level of species. Now if it is necessary (and I think that it probably is) for your understanding, I can define the meanings of the terminology - allele, frequency, population, generation, organism, and species.\n \nWhile, I agree that speciation doesn't require huge jumps what part of it was an over simplification did you not understand?\nThen why did you say that speciation did require huge jumps if you didn't mean it? If you were trying to make something clearer, how does offering incorrect assertions do it?\n \n Oh, I understood what you were intending to say. It's just that you are wrong and confusing. Firstly, you state that it depends on the definition of species without defining species as you use it. Secondly, you do claim that evolution makes \"huge jumps\" without supporting that assertion in any way. Thirdly, you claim that these \"huge jumps\" are in \"genetic shifts,\" which doesn't even make sense. Now, I might understand if you said that the \"huge jumps\" were \"genetic shifts.\" However, it all reduces to nonsense because you haven't defined \"genetic shift\" either.\n \n And your purpose was not to alienate people by using jargon? There, I have provided the critical analysis that you sought.\n \nGreat give me an example of an observation of one species evolving into/from another in a complex organism (by complex I mean contain at least two tissue varieties)\nDamEtel has given you one below. See comments there.",

What sort of \"verification\" are you looking for. What does that mean?\n \n Well, even though I suspect that you won't understand, here are some links to polls that give you the information.\n \n PUBLIC BELIEFS ABOUT EVOLUTION AND CREATION from ReligiousTolerance.org\n \n A CBS News Poll, while more concerned with who voted for whom, concluded that \"Support for evolution is more heavily concentrated among those with more education...\" \n \n AIG, in discussing several similar polls, concluded that \"Education was negatively related to belief in creationism-fully 69.4 % of those with high school education or less did not believe that evolution was the best possible explanation for life, as did 46 % of those with graduate or professional degrees. The majority of all persons sampled (52.7 %) disagreed with the theistic evolution world view, and 19.1 % of all people surveyed stated they believed that God created the cosmos from 5 to 10 thousand years ago (13.2 % of professionals agreed with this position). Also, 44.5 % with a high school education or less believe the Bible is the 'Word of God' and fully 63.3 % of the college graduates believe the Bible is 'the inspired word of God,' but only 14.8 % who have graduate or professional degrees agreed with this statement.\"\n \n A poll by the People For the American Way Foundation concluded that \"Young Americans, those aged 18 to 24, are much more Evolution oriented than are seniors.\" and that \"Americans with greater educational attainment show more of an Evolution orientation than do those with less education.\"\n \n And finally, you should consult this information from the NCSE. There is a link to the most recent Gallup poll (2004) at the bottom. Of course your \"high academic environment\" has a subscription to the Gallup site, otherwise you might reconsider as to whether it is really a \"high academic environment.\" No subscription would indicate third rate.\n \nYes I am familiar with the use of the word dominate.\nApparently not, otherwise you wouldn't have used it in a context that would tend to cause confusion while professing to eliminate jargon. If you meant \"more numerous,\" why didn't you say so?\n \nMy use of it is contestant within its context.\nWhat? You don't make sense again. Do you mean \"consistent?\" Please explain since I have never heard (and can't find) any use of \"contestant\" in that context.\n \nDominate often contains the connotation of numerous, but is not part of the actual meaning of the word by most lexicons I am aware.\nThen what were you trying to say. Use of that word can only be confusing in a discussion of biology since you were not referring to the biological concept of dominance. If you were, you were dead wrong, as I have previously pointed out.\n \n Please, if your intent is to eliminate jargon that might \"alienate people from the discussion\" then stop inventing words and using non-standard meanings that only confuse. Say what you mean. It appears to me that you are trying to use big words in order to make yourself sound educated. You defeat that purpose when you misuse the words.

   "I have no idea what you are talking about. \n\n \n You and your lil helpers make that clear all the time. The amazing part is, you often label Christians as \"closed minded\", and several times in the past you've urged me to learn more details about science. When I bring up the relationship between science and politics, you hold your ears and shut your eyes and insult. Are you not closed minded?\n \n \nI made an observation about your arguments and, from the review, those that are apparently contained in the book you linked. Creationists frequently claim that science is religion, implying that religion is something worthy of scorn. \n\n \n It doesn't imply that it's worthy of scorn at all. It implies that its all equally covered by the first amendment.\n \n \nWhile that may be true, we never see the assertion supported with any sort of facts to show that it is true. It seems that the ploy is that if something like the silly religion of science can be taught to children in public school science classes, then why shouldn't the sillier religion of fundamentalist christianity (I have only seen the argument from fundamentalist chrisitans) also be taught.

Somehow, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism, native American religions, and even main-line Christianity should be excluded. \n\n \n Your links didn't concern fundamentalism, they concerned science organizations giving political advise to the government, as you stated here:\n \n \nThe purpose of the National Academies is to advice the U.S. government on the scientific and technological issues that frequently pervade policy decisions. \n\n \n That's mainly what the book I linked is about.\n \n \n \nBut the topic is about the teaching of science. So you admit that your book is off topic. Please try to stay on topic. \n\n \n I didn't admit that it was off topic, it just isn't only about teaching. It's about scientific influence in government, and it includes classrooms.\n \n \n \nHow silly. We are talking about science. If you actually knew anything about the philosophy of science you would realize that it doesn't even consider morality and rights and that it has no political agenda, liberal or otherwise. \n\n \n You know better than that, I don't know why you're in denial.\n \n http://ideas.repec.org/p/ebg/essewp/dr-05006.html\n \n \n.....it gives more solidity to the foundation of political theory and political economy, by anchoring them in biology; it opens the path towards a unification between two social sciences and their immediate juxtaposed science, biology.\n\n \n That's not even in the book I referenced - it took about 30 seconds to find it somewhere else on the web. \n \n This is from the book;\n \n \nThose who fear encroaching scientism often invoke visions of a brave new world of eugenics and made-to-order designer babies. But there are more realistic fears, fears that no longer are \"merely\" religious. Science will undoubtedly make new breakthroughs, perhaps developing a cure of better treatment for at least some forms of cancer, perhaps diabetes, Parkinsons's disease, and spinal cord injury.\n \n But it will also grow in political and economic stature, gaining its own set of constitutional \"rights\" to both research and funding, arrogating to itself alone the power to make morally troublesome decisions. Increased funding on speculative research will inevitably harm the poor, pushing aside spending on healthcare and education and eventually creating therapies that only the wealthy can afford. Human subjects, many desperate for a cure, will find themselves imperiled in clinical trials that have not been adequately researched in animals. The human body will become a commodity in which women sell their eggs and a handful of companies owns human genes, stem cells, and body parts. The unborn, including some near viability, will exist to serve those who already are born and indeed will be created for that purpose alone. \n \n The galileo prototype of the scientist martyred by religion is now purely a myth. Science long ago won its war against religion, not just traditional religion, but any faith in a power outside the human mind. Now it wants more. \n\n \n The links you provided were subtle hints of that. As are many legal and political controversies going on in the U.S. today, the likes of which were unheard of only 50 years ago. Yet we have the same Constitution.\n \n \n \nPlease take the time to educate yourself before you speak. Otherwise you make yourself appear foolish.\n\n \n Have you ever heard of California's Proposition 71? It has plenty to do with biological science and politics. It's in the book - we could discuss it. \n \n Also, way back in 1968, 2600 scientists, including four Nobel laureates, published a petition in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the liberal Catholic magazine 'Commonweal' urging Catholics to withhold contributions from collection plates. Their problem? - the Pope's stance on birth control. It's in the book too. Do you belive it? Science \"doesn't consider morality and rights and has no political agenda\"? Really?",

(it shows in the quote I posted of her above) My position is more of a constitutional, traditional one.\n \n \nYou claim that they want to change the values of society. There are some issues involving abortion, euthanasia and genetics that make you uncomfortable. These issues, however, do not affect the 'values' of a society, any more than their treatment reflects those values. \n\n \n I think they do affect the values, so we can agree to disagree on that, fine. But sometimes political decisions need to be made on it one way or the other, and it's the voters and their elected represenatives that need to make them, not the scientific community.\n \n \nI have heard so many people proclaim the mantra 'Culture of Life' in reference to these issues, but I have never understood what they mean. Do we live \n in a culture of death? \n\n \n I don't know either - it probably has to do with abortion, not one of my strongest passions. The opposite probably wouldn't be a culture of death, it would be a culture of....chance, a cosmic accident, or maybe a culture of science, where science is the god, all the rest of us are a level below it. \n \n \n \n \nDo we value the concept of 'life' any less, on an individual basis, if we legalise abortion, or euthanasia, or explore biotechnology? Do we become, collectively, a more callous, uncaring society because of these things? I don't believe we do. \n\n \n I believe we may become a more corrupt, immoral society because of those things. So we disagree again. And again, the constitutional process, not the scientific community, should make the political decisions.\n \n \nThe reasons behind the ethics of a society are surely far deeper, historical reasons, which are descended from the root of the society far back in time and have evolved along lines prescribed by that history. \n\n \n History yes, the latest scientific assumptions about human nature, NO. \n \n \n \nScience is not setting out to deliberately change society because of some kind of anti-spiritual agenda.

If you believe certain applications of this applied knowedge are deemed unacceptable by your God, it does not mean that there is an atheistic/scientific agenda to \"redefine morality and rights\". \n\n \n As is referenced in the book, one Professor Peter Singer of Princeton, (a humanist) proclaimed that \"the ten commandments must be replaced with new ones\". Is it just a coincidence that legal battles are going on in the U.S. about their public display? I believe that \"certain applications of this applied knowledge\" are applied politically in ways not acceptable by the constitution. \n \n \nThe controversial aspects of scientific knowledge are the predictable end products of a philosophy of logical deduction, not a deliberate attempt to undermine mysticism/religion. The fact that the two philosophies contradict seems to threaten religion far more than it does science. \n\n \n It threatens science FINANCIALLY. The book shows it and documents it.\n \n\n \"...and advance a liberal political agenda.\"\n \n Right, so now you're conflating atheists and scientists with 'liberals'. Just what is a 'liberal'? Are they all under one big liberal umbrella, in cahoots with the atheists, scientifically planning the ethical corruption of society? \n\n \n The same umbrella, pretty much, yes. \"no faith outside the power of the human mind\". Science has the highest human mind, and knows what's best for the unwashed masses.\n \n \nWhat is this 'agenda' exactly? How does it threaten you? What actual damage do you believe it would do to society, if this agenda (whatever it is) was comprehensively carried out? \n\n \n I quoted it above from the book. The quote ended with \"now it wants more\" One major thing it does to our society, (when the human mind is the only source for the political decisions we make) is complicate legal matters. If there's one thing Proposition 71 did in California, it enriched a LOT of lawyers.\n \n \nYour comments suggest that you live in a black and white, good versus evil world where people are either with you or against you, where you in fact fall foul of one the important Christian values: not to judge others. I cannot argue with your faith, but I can with your interpretation of it. The world is not divided into 'us' and 'them', the world is divided into a multiplicity of conflicting fragments, which one person can never hope to fully comprehend or categorise. \n\n \n In politics, there are often only two choices - black & white, us & them. One choice has to be made. There is a world of difference between judging someone, and taking exception to their political stance. \n \n \nThere is no 'atheist scientific liberal' agenda, everyone has their own agenda, and these agenda reinforce each other when they happen to agree, eventually giving us the dual philosophies of science and religion. However, science by its very nature is convergent; the methods used demand the highest degree of consensus and unanimity. Religion, although it strives for the same collective goal, has no method for doing so, and seems only to diverge and fracture more with time.\n\n \n Then why doesn't science stay out of politics?

   "Would that have been because they were literate, or because they were landowners? Common sense tells us the answer. Today, a foreign born college science professor who rents an apartment has much more political clout than just about any landowner. The way today's academic grants are made, combined with the recent eminent domain decision by the supreme court leaves little doubt of that. Anyone who thinks this type of 21st century politics has any resemblence to the founding fathers' intent and thinking has a more skewed notion than I do.\n \n Is that the only example you can give of their distinction between literates, and illiterates? Can you give any examples from the text of the Constitution?\n \n\n Instead of shifting the topic from the intent of the founding fathers, maybe you should do some reading on what their thoughts on the subject were. They were, to a man, fearful of the \"rabble\". Their responses to this fear differed and was subject to great debate in drawing up the constitution. The reason senators have 6 year terms instead of 2 year terms like representatives was mainly to insulate them from the shifting whims of the \"rabble\".

You responded by changing the subject to religion, and not responding to the view the founding fathers had regarding education. Changing the topic is not going into more detail. \n\n \n The constitution makes no reference to education, concerning terms of senators or represenatives, or any of the workings of government. The senate is a level above the house, hence the longer terms. Concerning your \"shifting terms of the rabble\" reference, the concern was about \"mob rule\" - a majority taking advantage of a minority. A thing called greed. Greed and education, are not related. Since you missed what I said concerning the view of the founding fathers regarding education, I'll repeat what I said; The founding fathers views on education would correspond with their worldviews. \n \n \n \nWhat has been said about Jefferson (or any other person of that time) that has been distorted, as you claim?\n\n \n Mainly this ever increasingly famous paragraph, in a courtesy note he wrote to the Danbury Baptists in 1802;\n \n \nBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people, which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between church & state. \n\n \n \n \n This is brief, considering how thorough it is. It does not waste words.\n \n \nDreisbach's book points out that following this one letter, Jefferson's metaphor slipped into obscurity in both public and private papers. It was not until 1947 that it was rediscovered by Justice Hugo L. Black in a Supreme Court case, Everson v. Board of Education. In that decision, which concerned the use of state funds to transport children to religious schools, Justice Black cited the \"wall of separation,\" and characterized it as \"high and impregnable.\"\n \n \"Black's wall differs from Jefferson's wall,\" says Dreisbach. \"Jefferson's wall explicitly separated the institutions of church and state, while Black's wall separates religion and all civil government. Moreover, Jefferson's wall separated church and the national government only.\"\n \n By incorporating the First Amendment non-establishment provision into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Black's wall separates religion and civil government at all levels -- national, state and local. This interpretation of the wall created an instrument of the federal judiciary to invalidate policies and programs of state and local authorities, Dreisbach adds.\n \n Key Principles\n \n When asked to comment on the book's \"bottom line\" and the ramifications of Justice Black's 1947 interpretation of the wall, Dreisbach responded thus:\n \n \"The wall metaphor mischievously redefines constitutional principles in at least two important ways:\n \n \"First, the phrase emphasizes separation between church and state -- unlike the First Amendment, which speaks in terms of the non-establishment and free exercise of religion. Second, a wall is a bilateral barrier that inhibits the activities of both the civil government and religion -- unlike the First Amendment, which imposes restrictions on the civil government only (specifically on Congress). Therefore, the wall unavoidably restricts religion's ability to influence public life, thus dangerously exceeding the limitations imposed by the Constitution.\n \n \"Today, the wall is used to separate religion from public life,\" continues Dreisbach, \"thereby promoting a religion that is essentially private and a state that is strictly secular.\n \n \"The 'high and impregnable wall' constructed by the modern Supreme Court inhibits religion's ability to inform the public ethic, deprives religious citizens of the civil liberty to participate in politics armed with ideas informed by their spiritual values, and infringes the right of religious communities and institutions to extend their ministries into the public square. The wall has been used to silence the religious voice in the public marketplace of ideas and to segregate people of faith behind a restrictive barrier.\" \n\n \n http://www.crosswalk.com/news/1218043.html\n \n In 1947, the ACLU was 27 healthy years old. It has taken full advantage of Hugo Black's judicial activism.",

   "Christianity has changed? Was the Bible re-written?\nNot that I know of. Only the interpretation by certain cults has changed, yours being one, apparently. Fundamentalist christianity was a knee jerk reaction to science - evolution, old earth, old universe. Yes, christianity has changed. Some cults have become worshipers of the Bible. Whether you like it or not, fundamentalist christianity was a reaction to scientific advancements in learning about our universe. Your religion is little more than 100 years old. It always was what it is now - anti-science.\n \nYet humanism still does not recongnize [sic] a Creator. Deism still does.\nAnother example of your failure to educate yourself. Perhaps if you weren't so centered on creationist sources you wouldn't look like such a fool. Humanism doesn't recognize a creator in the same sense that plumbing doesn't recognize a creator. Humanism allows for a deity and a creator but does not require either.\n \nThey cannot be the same. Deism is still more closely related to Christianity, since they both believe in a Creator.\nGo back and read what I said again. If no one is watching you can follow with your finger and move your lips as you read. I didn't say that humanism and deism are the same. I said that Washington, Jefferson, Paine, Madison, Monroe, and Franklin were both humanists and deists. It really doesn't matter that you don't understand the historical significance, or that humanism allows for a deity. Trying to apply your faulty understanding of modern definitions to the late 1700s is obscene.

   "Not that I know of. Only the interpretation by certain cults has changed, yours being one, apparently. Fundamentalist christianity was a knee jerk reaction to science - evolution, old earth, old universe. Yes, christianity has changed. Some cults have become worshipers of the Bible. Whether you like it or not, fundamentalist christianity was a reaction to scientific advancements in learning about our universe. Your religion is little more than 100 years old. It always was what it is now - anti-science. \n\n \n I wouldn't call it knee jerk - it was reaction to about 50 years of steadily increasing Darwinism and it's many different paths, most of which sought to promote atheism in government, to worship law and science, and allow morals in politics to be relative to those two things. If morals aren't absolute, if they are relative to ever changing laws & science, then morals are confused. To deal with confused morals, anti Christianity must seek more and more laws, resulting in less liberty. There is a reason most atheists are Democrats, and there is a reason the ACLU has such a preoccupation with controlling courts, empowering lawyers, filing lawsuits, and erasing public Christianity. You helped prove that when you declared that the Declaration is not a legal document. Since there's no moral absolutes with atheism, (or humanism, or agnosticism, or secularism, etc etc) law is the supreme good. \n \n \nAnother example of your failure to educate yourself. Perhaps if you weren't so centered on creationist sources you wouldn't look like such a fool. Humanism doesn't recognize a creator in the same sense that plumbing doesn't recognize a creator.

I said that Washington, Jefferson, Paine, Madison, Monroe, and Franklin were both humanists and deists.

   "Where is the legal substance in the passage \"the First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state ?\"\nAsked and answered. In the opinion by Justice Black (330 U.S. 1(1947)) cited by Marc. There is a better quote from that decision. \nThe \"establishment of religion\" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect \"a wall of separation between church and State.\" \n\n \nWithout defining the words \"church\" and \"state\" the phrase \"between church and state\" does not provide any legal substance such as might be a guding principle that could be of practical use to resolve legal disputes regarding what is, and what is not, \"an establishment of religion.\"\nThen you didn't read the link that Marc provided. Read the quote above and your objections will be answered. It makes it fairly clear that \"church\" means any religion or religious practice, and \"state\" means any government or subdivision of government. The above provides very solid \"legal substance\" since it was a decision of the Supreme Court on the question of church/state separation and whether a law violated that principle. In subsequent cases, the reasons stated by the justices for their decision are taken as precedents in other cases.\n \nHow does the phrase from the letter enable us to distinguish between what belong to the church and what to the state?\nIt doesn't. We determine that from the intent of the First Amendment as defined by the Supreme Court. Besides Everson, the Supreme Court has gone further in defining how determine the line between the two. One of those cases was [/i]Lemon v. Kurtzman[/i] (403 U.S. 602 (1971)). In that case the Court specified a three part test of the constitutionality of laws in regard to the First Amendment. A law should not violate any one of the three parts of the test. It's quite well known. It's known as the Lemon Test. Every lawyer in the country has read that decision in their Constitutional Law class.\n \nDoes prayer belong to the Church or to the State?\nChurch.\n \nWhat about the Ten Commandments?\nChurch.\n \nWhat about the recommendation to believe in God and that the nation is under him?\nChurch. But still christians have managed to use government to force their religion on everyone. Examples are the motto on our money and the Pledge of Allegience. Those things actually have no legal standing and are both of recent introduction. Even though such professions are trivial and meaninigless, they seem to make christians feel good.\n \nThe legal substance of the religion clauses is found in whatever the word \"religion\" in the first clause means. How did the Court define the word \"religion\" and where did it find its meaning? It was not in Jefferson's letter.\nAsk Justice Black. I don't think that the meanings of those words are that ambiguous. Most people have a pretty good idea of what you mean when you say \"religion.\"",

   "Please show me where in Jefferson's metaphor the Everson Court found the principle that neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Don't waste your time because you can't! \n \n The Everson Court found the principle in James Madison's \"Memorial and Remonstrance\" of 1785 and the Virginia Statute For Establishing Religious Freedom that he brought in the Virginia General Assembly in 1786 and convinced the Assembly to pass it into law. I quote from the Everson opinion as follows:\n Virginia, where the established church had achieved a dominant influence in political affairs and where many excesses attracted wide public attention, provided a great stimulus and able leadership for the movement.\n \n The people reached the conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with the beliefs of any religious individual or group.\n \n The movement toward this end reached its dramatic climax in Virginia in 1785-86 when the Virginia legislative body was about to renew Virginia's tax levy for the support of the established church. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the fight against this tax.\n \n Madison wrote his great Memorial and Remonstrance against the law. In it, he eloquently argued that a true religion did not need the support of law; that no person, either believer or nonbeliever, should be taxed to support a religious institution of any kind; that the best interest of a society required that the minds of men always be wholly free, and that cruel persecutions were the inevitable result of government-established religions. Madison's Remonstrance received strong support throughout Virginia, and the Assembly postponed consideration of the proposed tax measure until its next session. When the proposal came up for consideration at that session, it not only died in committee, but the Assembly enacted the famous \"Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty\" originally written by Thomas Jefferson. The preamble to that Bill stated, among other things, that\n \n Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either . . . ; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern. . . .\n \n And the statute itself enacted\n \n That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief. . . \n ************************************\n \n Show me where in Jefferson's metaphor you find the principle that neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. \n \n Show me where in Jefferson's metaphor you find the principle that neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. \n \n Show me where in Jefferson's metaphor you find the principle that no person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. \n \n Show me where in Jefferson's metaphor you find the principle that no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. \n \n Show me where in Jefferson's metaphor you find the principle that neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa.\n \n ***********************************\n \n You have been victimized by William Rehnquist's hogwash about Jefferson's letter being a source of substantive law. It was a \"tub to the whale\" to divert your attention from the fact that most of the substantive First Amendment law was derived from the writings of James Madison who has always been, and forever shall be, one of the greatest men who ever served this nation, and the supreme authority on the meaning of religion clauses.",

   "Dear Pandion:\n \n The point is that the Supreme Court's doctrine of Separation of Church and State was not derived from a letter by Thomas Jefferson, and that those who seek to unite Church and State do not want to deal with the fact that James Madison has always been the primary authority on the meaning of the First Amendment.\n \n That is why, to decide the 1878 case of Reynolds v. U.

We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted. The precise point of the inquiry is, what is the religious freedom which has been guaranteed.... \n \n Before the adoption of the Constitution, attempts were made in some of the colonies and States to legislate not only in respect to the establishment of religion, but in respect to its doctrines and precepts as well. The people were taxed, against their will, for the support of religion, and sometimes for the support of particular sects to whose tenets they could not and did not subscribe. Punishments were prescribed for a failure to attend upon public worship, and sometimes for entertaining heretical opinions. \n \n This brought out a determined opposition. Amongst others, Mr. Madison prepared a \"Memorial and Remonstrance,\" which was widely circulated and signed, and in which he demonstrated \"that religion, or the duty we owe the Creator,\" was not within the cognizance of civil government. \n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/reynoldsvus.html",

   "Dear Pandion:\n \n The point is that the Supreme Court's doctrine of Separation of Church and State was not derived from a letter by Thomas Jefferson,...\nOf course it wasn't. Jefferson said the following; \"...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.\" Clearly it was not Jefferson's intent to establish a new constitutional principle, but only to explain the principle that had been established by the American people through ratification of the First Amendment.\n \n...and that those who seek to unite Church and State do not want to deal with the fact that James Madison has always been the primary authority on the meaning of the First Amendment.\nWell, Madison actually proposed the first draft of the First Amendment and was present and took part in the revisions that eventually were ratified. One would assume that he understood the intent.\n \nThat is why, to decide the 1878 case of Reynolds v. U. S., when the Supreme Court had to define the word \"religion\" in the establishment clause and find the guiding principle of religious liberty, it turned to James Madison's great \"Memorial and Remonstrance\" of 1785.\nThat may be why the Court chose to reference Madison's text, but those words, \"...that religion, or the duty we owe the Creator,...\" were actually composed by George Mason as the last article of the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776. The wording of the paragraph was twice slightly modified, first by committee, and then by Madison before passage. It should be noted that Madison placed the words, \"that religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence\" in quotation marks in Memorial and Remonstrance, simply because it was a quote. Madison used it because the members of the Virginia legislature would have been quite familiar with those words from Article XVI of the Virginia Declaration.\n \n So the definition used by the Supreme Court was not the definition of James Madison, but that of George Mason from the Virginia Declaration of Rights from some 9 years previous to Memorial and Remonstrance. However, it seems that the Court may not have been aware of this and didn't notice the quotation marks.",

For example: The extistance of God(s), the number of Gods, the divinity of Christ, infant baptism etc. Since the governemnt cannot take cognizance of these disputes and decide which opinion is correct, there is no way the government can set up a church or religion that has any type of doctrine or mode of worship.\n \n FVf",

If Williams' degree is not in a field that details thermodynamics, then we ought to be wary of his claims about the second law. On the other hand, if my friend who has a PhD in physics tells me about the second law of thermodynamics, I can be pretty confident he knows what he's talking about. (Or I can pick any of my numerous textbooks and look it up, or I can simply draw on what I learned in my advanced courses, and I can conclude that the author of the page you cite understands next to nothing about thermodynamics.)\n For example, Ross's statement is grossly misrepresented. When applying the second law to an open system, one still must define a system boundary and keep track of energy input and output. Otherwise, it would be as if you shined a heat lamp on a piece of paper and were stunned because the paper \"inexplicably\" heated up with no internal energy source...\n Pointing out a fallacy is not a fallacy. \"'Logical fallacy' accusations\" are worth plenty when they're done correctly. Mentioning that a site is a fundamentalist site is poisoning the well (if one views being fundamentalist as negative), but not accepting the site's arguments because it is a fundamentalist site is just plain bias.

It says that \"outside sources can increase order for a time (through the expenditure of relatively large amounts of energy......) Once the force is released, processes return to their natural direction - greater disorder.\" \n \n The amount of energy, or forces required to freeze water or burn something aren't comparable to the energy or forces required to cause \"descent with modification\" over a very long period of time. \n \n \nThen, when you consider that the earth represents an open system which is constantly getting an influx of energy from the sun as fast as it is disipated into space, how can you assume that everything is always running down in terms of either energy or order? \n\n \n Because that's all nature shows us. Doesn't science tell us that the sun is running out of energy?\n \n From the link;\n \n \nCompare a living plant with a dead one. Can the simple addition of energy make a completely dead plant live?\n \n A dead plant contains the same basic structures as a living plant. It once used the Sun's energy to temporarily increase its order and grow and produce stems, leaves, roots, and flowers - all beginning from a single seed.\n \n If there is actually a powerful Evolutionary force at work in the universe, and if the open system of Earth makes all the difference, why does the Sun's energy not make a truly dead plant become alive again (assuming a sufficient supply of water, light, and the like)?\n \n What actually happens when a dead plant receives energy from the Sun? The internal organization in the plant decreases; it tends to decay and break apart into its simplest components. The heat of the Sun only speeds the disorganization process. \n\n \n And;\n \n \nIf Evolution is true, there must be an extremely powerful force or mechanism at work in the cosmos that can steadily defeat the powerful, ultimate tendency toward \"disarrangedness\" brought by the 2nd Law. If such an important force or mechanism is in existence, it would seem it should be quite obvious to all scientists. Yet, the fact is, no such force of nature has been found. \n\n \n \"Steadily\" is the key word. The sun is steady, but as we see by what it often does to speed the disorganization process, it's energy can't be the above referred to \"force of nature\" that continues to elude science. \n \n \nWhat I see are pockets of decreasing emtropy along side areas of increasing entropy.

To put it simply: In the real world, the long-term overall flow is downhill, not uphill. All experimental and physical observation appears to confirm that the Law is indeed universal, affecting all natural processes in the long run.5 \n\n \n So you don't agree? Can you explain why it's wrong? Not by asking questions - not by ad-hom attacks, but by one or two concise paragraphs about thermodynamics? If you can't, then what good is your education? How much do you really know about it if you're unable to have a civilized discussion with anyone except someone with at least as much knowledge about it as you? \n \n \n \nSpecify the problems without making up stuff, please. \n\n \n From the link;\n \n \n \nNaturalistic Evolutionism requires that physical laws and atoms organize themselves into increasingly complex and beneficial, ordered arrangements.6 Thus, over eons of time, billions of things are supposed to have developed upward, becoming more orderly and complex.7\n \n However, this basic law of science (2nd Law of Thermodynamics) reveals the exact opposite. In the long run, complex, ordered arrangements actually tend to become simpler and more disorderly with time. There is an irreversible downward trend ultimately at work throughout the universe. Evolution, with its ever increasing order and complexity, appears impossible in the natural world. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSo you were confused by simple questions from about the 5th week of a sophomore introductory course in thermo? So you actually don't know anything about thermo and are just talking out of your...hat? I thought so. Your ignorance is apparent. \n\n \n No, I showed a link that didn't attempt to confuse with irrelevent questions.\n \n \nOr maybe it was a case of someone claiming to speak with knowledge on a topic about which he knows nothing. At least you able to see the mocking of your profound ignorance. You can't answer even basic questions and still you talk on about atheism. Thermodynamics has nothing to do about religion, atheism, or government. It is the pinicle of stupidity to claim that it does. \n\n \n Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the efficiency of energy transfer and exchange. In naturalistic evolution (atheism) energy would have to be transfered and exchanged. \n \n \n \nYou might look into the history of Christianity in the world to see what a pile you just wrote. Christianity does not tolerate religious liberty. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights was opposed by the Christian minority of this country. \n\n \n Maybe the actual pile was your version of American History. Different historians probably have differing views of the intensity of the opposition Christianity had in those days to the Constitution. What's your history source? Most of Christianity in the U.S. today tolerates religious liberty just fine.",

   "It says that \"outside sources can increase order for a time (through the expenditure of relatively large amounts of energy......) Once the force is released, processes return to their natural direction - greater disorder.\"\n\n Uh, in case you didn't notice, the \"force\" (in this case, energy from the sun) isn't \"released\" (stopped).\n \n \nBecause that's all nature shows us.\n\n No, nature shows us that apparent \"violations\" of the second law of thermodynamics are due to inappropriate application of the second law of thermodynamics. And you, as we have been trying to point out, are applying the law incorrectly.\n \n \nCompare a living plant with a dead one. Can the simple addition of energy make a completely dead plant live? [snip]\n\n\n Are you actually agreeing with this argument, or are you simply pretending to be unbelievably ignorant?\n \n \nIf Evolution is true, there must be an extremely powerful force or mechanism at work in the cosmos that can steadily defeat the powerful, ultimate tendency toward \"disarrangedness\" brought by the 2nd Law. If such an important force or mechanism is in existence, it would seem it should be quite obvious to all scientists. Yet, the fact is, no such force of nature has been found.\n\"Steadily\" is the key word. The sun is steady, but as we see by what it often does to speed the disorganization process, it's energy can't be the above referred to \"force of nature\" that continues to elude science.\n\n It doesn't elude science at all; it only eludes the author's understanding, not to mention your own.\n \"Steadily\" or even \"steady\" appear nowhere in an accurate presentation of the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, \"steady\" light shined upon a young plant increases the \"organization process,\" so your assertion doesn't stand.\n \n \nIncreases that we can see (the way living things grow up from infancy) are always temporary, as we can see how they all eventually lead to death. Those increases aren't comparable to the claimed undesigned order of the human body.\n\n If you want to have a serious scientific conversation about the second law of thermodynamics, you should quit using words like \"order\" and start using words that actually mean something. (Or you can actually define what you mean by \"order\" in a scientifically meaningful way.)\n \n \nThe several people who had input in what that link says have an in depth education in thermodynamics.\n\n No, the author or authors of that article quite clearly don't understand thermodynamics. If they did, they wouldn't have written something so blatantly incorrect. (Unless, of course, they have no problem with the lying for Jesus approach.)\n \n \nAnd they were operating the entire time (billions of years?) that it took all claims of naturalistic evolution to take place. And they never got in the way?\n\n Exactly! (In fact, they're what made it all possible!) Glad to see you're catching on.\n \n \nAbout the only exceptions that I know of for sure are claimed by atheist scientists after they have emerged from behind the locked doors of their labs and spent millions in taxpayer money to search diligently for \"exceptions\". Then the New York Times and others who have a political interest in the matter trumpet it for all of the world to see.\n\n Please provide examples of these exceptions to the second law of thermodynamics.\n \n \nThus, in the long term, there is an overall downward trend throughout the universe. [snip]\n\n So you don't agree? Can you explain why it's wrong? Not by asking questions - not by ad-hom attacks, but by one or two concise paragraphs about thermodynamics?\n\n This statement is accurate when interpreted as it is actually written. \"Overall\" means \"as a whole,\" not \"in any particular segment\" of the universe.\n Here's a basic analogy, so pay attention: Electrical energy flows into your residence. You use some of it to power a refrigerator. The heat from the interior of the refrigerator gets pumped out into the living area of the residence. Inside the refrigerator, entropy decreases. Inside the living area, entropy increases. Overall, entropy increases. Therefore, there can exist localized decreases in entropy so long as overall entropy increases.\n Now, do I need to give an example of this at the molecular level, or can you manage to grasp the basic concept and apply it correctly?\n \n \nNo, I showed a link that didn't attempt to confuse with irrelevent questions.\n\n No, as demonstrated by your ignoring my earlier post, you simply refuse to acknowledge facts that you don't like. Care to ignore this post, too?\n \n \nThermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the efficiency of energy transfer and exchange. In naturalistic evolution (atheism) energy would have to be transfered and exchanged.\n\n In theistic evolution (theism), energy would also have to be transferred and exchanged. In taking communion, energy is transferred and exchanged. I could go on. Thermodynamics applies to classical systems regardless of location in the universe or religion of an experimenter. As pandion said, to claim otherwise really is the pinnacle of stupidity. (But I see you did it anyway.)",

   "pandion and Walking-fish have contributed perfectly explanatory posts regarding the second law of thermodynamics. marc9000 has utterly failed to counter their points, and in most cases ignores the statements that damn his position. In fact, when challenged to defend his knowledge of the topic at hand, marc9000 hand-waved the challenge away. When such disregard for civil discussion of a subject is shown, I certainly feel no obligation to pander to that person's ignorance of said subject.\n \n I wrote in post #120,\nWhen applying the second law to an open system, one still must define a system boundary and keep track of energy input and output. Otherwise, it would be as if you shined a heat lamp on a piece of paper and were stunned because the paper \"inexplicably\" heated up with no internal energy source...\n\n This, in a nutshell, resolves one of the alleged \"problems\" that marc9000 insists exists. Note that marc9000 did not respond to this at all.\n \n In my previous post, I demanded that marc9000 provide a reasonable definition of \"order\" before continuing to use it. It is a common creationist tactic to avoid using meaningful terminology, because actually affirming oneself to a viewpoint opens the individual to a position where, upon utter demolition of that position, he or she is indisputably refuted.\n I also provided a typical analogy that explains the other alleged \"problem\" that marc9000 insists exists, and I provided it in the very context that he quoted and subsequently misinterpreted -- purposefully or not -- such that anyone giving a good-faith effort to understand ought to be able to do so. We shall see if marc9000 responds.\n \n \nRather than just saying something like \"You really don't know what the 2nd Law means do you?\" just explain exactly how it has been misunderstood.\n\n We can't explain \"exactly how it has been misunderstood\" because marc9000 specifically refuses to clarify what he means. To illustrate, note that marc9000 refused to answer pandion's questions regarding exactly what the second law of thermodynamics actually says, claiming that it has nothing to do with the \"problems\" the law poses for evolution! Anyone who claims that the meaning of the second law of thermodynamics has nothing to do with whether the law poses a problem for evolution has earned absolutely no respect from me.\n \n \nIf you're going to call someone ignorant rather than stupid, explain where they are mistaken and elaborate as to why the truth of the matter supports your position.\n\n I do not use \"ignorant\" and \"stupid\" interchangeably. Ignorant means \"uneducated regarding the facts\" or \"purposely ignoring pertinent information.\" Stupid refers to a lack of intellectual or deductive ability.\n For example, if marc9000 doesn't understand the second law of thermodynamics because he has never actually looked into it, he is ignorant of it. If marc9000 asserts that secularism is the same as atheism, even though he has been thoroughly refuted on this point, that's stupidity. If marc9000 denies the existence of millions of theistic evolutionists, in order to cling to his ridiculous notion that evolution is necessarily atheistic, that's both ignorant and stupid.",

Thermo Test. If you are afraid to embarrass yourself, the email me at dr_gallo@hotmail.com with your answers.\n \n If you can't answer the questions, then why should anyone give your opinions about the 2nd Law any weight? Unless you are willing to hang in for about 5 weeks of essay (with a foundation in calculus), why does what you think about the 2nd Law matter? You don't even understand why creationists don't understand. Either stupidity or ignorance, intentional and otherwise.\n \n Please note that our resident ignorant creationist has declared that elementary questions about the 2nd Law are efforts to scoff at religion and his god. There was no effort to answer the questions or to explain why the 2nd Law is violated by evolution. There was only the assertion that the 2nd Law required some intervention by some un-named, unknown, invisible, supernatural intelligence. Sorry. Empirical data does not support any such assertion. Contrary to the assertions of out resident creationist, there are no exceptions to the 2nd Law - otherwise it wouldn't be a law.\n \n Creationism is such fun - you get to make it up as you go.",

If you insist on using \"disorder\" as the meaning of entropy, then you must also have some method for measuring order or disorder. You have none.\n Thermodynamics defines entropy as \"unusable heat energy\"; therefore, this is the definition that should be used for discussions regarding thermodynamics.\n If you choose to use \"disorder\" and \"unusable heat energy\" interchangeably such that the method for measuring each of them are the same, then you have resolved your problem of a definition.

   "Well we can see it certainly confuses you. \n\n \n I knew that one was coming. When pandion / gallo asked for a definition of the word \"entropy\" in his link, there's no question that no matter what definition was given, he would be able to attack it. Otherwise, he wouldn't have asked the question. \n \n \nWhile the dictionary definition may indeed refer to disorder, it is important to use definitions that are meaningful in context. If you insist on using \"disorder\" as the meaning of entropy, then you must also have some method for measuring order or disorder. You have none.\n Thermodynamics defines entropy as \"unusable heat energy\"; therefore, this is the definition that should be used for discussions regarding thermodynamics.\n If you choose to use \"disorder\" and \"unusable heat energy\" interchangeably such that the method for measuring each of them are the same, then you have resolved your problem of a definition. However, you should not use \"disorder\" in the common vernacular for the purpose of this conversation.\n\n \n This isn't strictly a conversation about thermodynamics. It's about both thermodynamics and evolution. While you'd like to keep them completely separate, the fact is that they both happen in the same universe, and would be subject to the same physical laws.\n \n \n \nIf by \"relatively large,\" you mean merely \"greater or equal,\" then yes. There's no magical ratio of \"large enough\"; the second law of thermodynamics merely says 1:1 is the best that can be done. \n\n \n Greater, yes - equal, no. If 1:1 could be done, we would have perpetual motion, and we don't. \n \n \n \nActually, you brought up the conspiracy theory, and I thought that would be an appropriate way to make it clear that your insinuation is ridiculous.\n\n \n It only made clear that you know, or pretend to know, nothing about politics. \n \n \nMore importantly, I have much more education than you in both evolution and thermodynamics. You can't even define \"entropy\" in an appropriate way, so I am justified in not giving you the full onslaught of technical terms and mathematical examples.\n\n \n I'm not looking for technical terms and mathematical examples. I'm wondering how thermodynamics and evolution can happen under the same laws in the same universe, and if evolution is as true as it's claimed to be, it shouldn't take a special education to put it into words that just about anyone could understand. I realize that I'm not the first to wonder about this - I'm sure scientists have spent a lot of time & money trying to come up with an explaination. About all I see is anger & name calling here, and it's on the increase, which is probably a good sign. I've checked talkorigins - they also delve into a lot of irrelevent nuts & bolts details about mathematical formulas, and make assertions that inspire more explaination, without giving it. \n \n \n \n \nNot at all, we just realize that trying to teach people like you who are totally ignorant of thermodynamics is often futile. \n\n \n If that were true, you wouldn't be posting here. But as I said, thanks for posting - it helps make my points. \n \n \n \nBut we've already shown that the author/authors of the link don't understand thermodynamics (again, unless they're lying for Jesus).\n\n \n Here are a few examples of how you've \"shown\" it. \n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by CA.net\n Compare a living plant with a dead one.

Then there was this one;\n \n \nNo, the author or authors of that article quite clearly don't understand thermodynamics. If they did, they wouldn't have written something so blatantly incorrect. (Unless, of course, they have no problem with the lying for Jesus approach.) \n\n \n Equally impressive. Could you possibly quote a paragraph from that link, then refute it using the same type of terminology and temperament that they use?\n \n \n \nRight, I presuppose the existence of the sun entirely on faith.\n And you say I don't know what I'm talking about...\n\n \n So the sun, and the sun alone, provides all the energy needed for evolution to occur? Let me know, then I'll have more questions.\n \n \n \nNope, but nobody besides you insists that there has been no energy input. \n\n \n I haven't insisted that. I'm just trying to find out what the source for evolution is, and if the material affected by thermodynamics has that same source. \n \n \n \nAh, but I already have explained, using the refrigerator example. Normally I'd ask you to put two and two together at this point, but I'm not confident in any of your mathematical skills. \n\n \n That question was asked of pandion, not you. And it was asked about common ancestor evolution, not refrigerators. You showed that refrigerators require more energy than they produce. Not relevant.\n \n \n \nThere has been input of usable energy. Lots and lots and lots of it, for four and a half billion years. Said energy input allows for decreases in entropy.\n\n \n The sun and the sun alone? The same sun that can't manage decreases in entropy concerning thermodynamics?\n \n \n \nWe already have proved it wrong. See above.

However, \"disorder\" and \"randomness\" can be formally defined in a way that is consistant with the realities of entropy: a system that is more \"disordered\" or more \"random\" is - \"a system with a lower amount energy available to do work\" or \"a system in a more probable state\".\n \n [....]\n \n In classical thermodynamics, entropy, when multiplied by a specific temperature, can be understood as a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system at a specified temperature that cannot be used to do thermodynamic work; i.e., work mediated by thermal energy.\n\n I am on very sturdy footing; you are the one who is demonstrably using a less-than-ideal definition.\n \n \nThis isn't strictly a conversation about thermodynamics.

If 1:1 could be done, we would have perpetual motion, and we don't.\n\n A realistically accurate observation.

How sure? Only the \"scientists\" who don't understand thermodynamics would do such a thing.

The entropy of the battery decreases. But this is not a violation of the second law of thermodynamics because the input of usable energy to the battery (or the panel, however you chose to define your system) was more than the decrease in entropy. Usable energy was lost (i.e., turned to unusable energy, i.e. entropy increased) within the panel, within the wiring, and within the battery. Therefore, overall, there was an increase in entropy, yet the battery experienced a decrease in entropy.\n \n \nIf that were true, you wouldn't be posting here.

Another way to look at this is that usable energy is a possible \"entropy sink,\" allowing for decreases in entropy.\n The same concept applies to \"common ancestor evolution\" and modern biology. Plants absorb usable energy from the sun to reduce their own entropy (i.e. store usable energy). You or some animal eats the plant, which carries the usable energy from the plant to you or the animal. Or you may eat the animal that ate the plant, and you get the usable energy.

That is the important issue.

As the battery example showed, the radiation can indeed \"manage decreases in entropy concerning thermodynamics.\" \n\n \n And that radiation doesn't pick and choose where it increases or decreases entropy. It can do both in thermodynamics, and it can do both in evolution. What it does to water, it will do to a partially devoloping life. Arrangements will become simpler.\n \n \n \nBecause one can define a bounded system and account for energy flow across the boundary. \n\n \n So the 2nd law applies to both open and closed systems.

Like a student in an atheist science classroom, I was being indoctrinated into thinking that water freezing, clouds organising themselves - several other things where order seems to increase, were exceptions to the rule, and that was why evolution was possible. I now have even more doubt that common ancestor evolution is possible - more doubt that truthful theistic evolutionists exist.",

This prompts me to ask: Just which universe are you living in, anyway?\n \n \nYou and several others here don't seem very anxious to apply the same laws to both of them.\n\n Your simply stating it over and over doesn't make it true. I'm perfectly willing to apply the concepts of thermodynamics to any classical system.\n \n \nYour entire refrigerator scenario wasn't essential to the disscussion at hand. \n\n It most certainly was, and for the very reason I explained: the refrigerator takes usable energy and uses it to locally reduce entropy. Why do you refuse to acknowledge this?\n \n \nBecause evolution is thousands, or millions of times more complicated than the development of a zygote.\n\n But \"evolution\" is not a classical system. You can apply the second law of thermodynamics to any of the physics responsible for evolutionary mechanisms, but applying it to evolution as a whole would require more \"accounting\" than one could even conceive of accomplishing.\n \n \nI'm sure because of the constant songs & dances I see whenever the word thermodynamics is brought up to anti creationists, whether it's at talkorigins, or this thread.\n\n It's not \"song and dance,\" it's an attempt to explain something to someone who is obviously grossly undereducated in thermodynamics. You are the one dancing around my points, like the concept of local reductions in entropy.\n \n \nSo what? There was nothing in there about evolution. Are you trying to separate them yet again?\n\n Not at all; the concepts I described apply to biological systems as well.\n \n \nSuppose Tiktaalik roseae crawls out of the water on the beach for the first time. (see the thread \"another gap filled\" if you don't know what I mean) Now suppose at the exact same time, a shiny peice of 20 gauge cold rolled steel is layed on the beach a few yards away. The piece of steel is going to completely disintegrate in a year or two. How is Tiktaalik roseae going to mutate, naturally select, create new genetic information, develop new organs etc. etc, without the exact same solar energy that destryed that piece of steel destroying it long before all those time comsuming processes have a chance to take place?\n\n First, let us clarify: The very same Tiktaalik organism will not itself evolve. Evolution occurs among a population, not a single animal.\n To answer your real question, I've explained this already: Tiktaalik organisms ate plants, which provided them with usable energy with which to dispel entropy. It's the very same thing that keeps you from falling apart.\n \n \nNo, I haven't noticed. I've noticed some insults, name calling, and largely irrelevent examples about refrigerators and batteries, but no corrections.\n\n You insist the examples are irrelevant, but they are not. They illustrate the concepts which you refuse to understand.\n \n \nBut you noticed when I corrected you - I about fell out of my chair when you acknowldeged it.\n\n We call it intellectual integrity. Maybe you and CA.net should try it sometime.\n \n \nYet you still can't refute it.\n\n I never said I can't refute it. In fact, I did it with one line. Apparently you need more explanation, however.\n \n \nWhy is it not measured that way? Entropy applies to both living and non-living things. If it exists in both those things, is measurable in both those things, and both those things receive their energy from the same thing, why can't changes in entropy in both those things be compared? \n\n Here's a comparison that answers your question: Which has more entropy, a living human or a dead bacterium? The living human contains more entropy, but it is alive. Therefore, measuring entropy cannot tell us the \"alive or dead\" status of a structure. That is to say, there is no necessary correlation between amount of entropy within something and whether that thing is alive or dead.\n \n \nCould it be that it isn't measured that way because science doesn't want to measure it that way?\n\n No, that could not be it. Try again.\n \n \nAnd the sun can also destroy. It has to do careful picking and choosing for evolution to be true. It doesn't.\n\n Neither the sun nor the radiation from the sun \"has to do careful picking and choosing\" for anything. The effect of the radiation is determined by with what the radiation interacts. Life is able to harness the energy and use it for beneficial processes. Steel is not.\n \n \nNot when the answers come from different angles, with no good faith efforts to teach, only good faith efforts to insult.\n\n So you're insulted by my efforts to answer your questions?\n \n \nNutrition - living - reproducing, they're not even comparable to mutation, natural selection, new genetic information, new organs, especially in possibly more hostile climates that the earth had if it's as old as evolutionists claim it is.\n\n They're all biochemical reactions, and that's the common thread. Evolution is a natural result of imperfect replication. Perhaps it would help if you tried looking at the process of evolution as being mostly baby steps instead of trying to figure out where organs came from.\n \n \nAnd that radiation doesn't pick and choose where it increases or decreases entropy. It can do both in thermodynamics, and it can do both in evolution. What it does to water, it will do to a partially devoloping life. Arrangements will become simpler.\n\n Ever heard of photosynthesis? Look up the biochemistry of Photosystem I and Photosystem II, please. As I explained earlier, life is able to harness the energy.\n \n \nSo the 2nd law applies to both open and closed systems. As the link I put up said, it is \"some of the best science we have today.......the science of thermodynamics has been noteworthy for it's [sic] stability. In many decades of careful observations, not a single departure from any of these laws has ever been noted.\"\n\n Yes, I have no problem with this. The problem is with your misunderstanding of thermodynamics as a whole and your apparent inability to comprehend the difference between a localized decrease in entropy and a \"violation\" of the second law of thermodynamics.\n \n \nLike a student in an atheist science classroom\n\n Statements like this just make you look like a crackpot conspiracy theorist.\n \n \nI was being indoctrinated into thinking that water freezing, clouds organising themselves - several other things where order seems to increase, were exceptions to the rule, and that was why evolution was possible.\n\n They are not exceptions to the rule, but they are examples of the processes that make evolution possible. Entropy can decrease locally provided an energy source.",

Why do you refuse to acknowledge this? \n\n \n I acknowledge that the refrigerator takes usable energy and uses it to locally reduce entropy, but I refuse to acknowledge it's relevance because it is a step that is in between the source of energy and the reduction in entropy. Any complex reduction in entropy we see has to have that step. Evolution does not have that step!\n \n \n \nBut \"evolution\" is not a classical system. You can apply the second law of thermodynamics to any of the physics responsible for evolutionary mechanisms, but applying it to evolution as a whole would require more \"accounting\" than one could even conceive of accomplishing. \n\n \n So you won't (or more accurately, can't) apply the concept of the second law of thermodynamics to evolution as a whole. Why didn't you say that 4 or 5 posts ago? That's what I meant by song & dance.\n \n So evolution as a whole requires \"more accounting than one could even conceive of accomplishing.\" This may be a breakthrough! Is it vague? Does it not have \"statistics\"? No overall mechanisms? Is this why it's considered \"non-classical\"? Is creation/ID also \"non-classical\"? Are there different degrees of non-classical? There certainly must be, if evolution as a whole is considered science, while creation/ID is not. \n \n This certainly would explain something about the title of this thread, \"teaching evolution to fundamentalists\".

An important thing about the concept of thermodynamics is that time greatly aids in the entropy increasing process.\n \n \n \nYou insist the examples are irrelevant, but they are not. They illustrate the concepts which you refuse to understand. \n\n \n I can't understand them because you have yet to name a natural unit, comparable to the refrigerator or photovoltaic panel, that harnesses energy to decrease entropy, and protect the decrease from the ever present natural process of increase. \n \n \n \nI never said I can't refute it. In fact, I did it with one line. \n\n \n In checking back through the posts, this is your \"one line\". \n \n \nAre you actually agreeing with this argument, or are you simply pretending to be unbelievably ignorant? \n\n \n That's not a refutation. \n \n \n \nHere's a comparison that answers your question: Which has more entropy, a living human or a dead bacterium?

That is to say, there is no necessary correlation between amount of entropy within something and whether that thing is alive or dead. \n\n \n But there would be a correlation in the amount of energy it would take to change the entropy in something alive, or dead. Evolution is about changes, increases in entropy in something dead is also about changes, and they both involve energy from the same source (the sun). If the entropy involved in those [NATURAL] changes are comparable, (common sense tells us they are) then evolution would be as impossible as a direct violation of the second law. \n \n \n \nNo, that could not be it.

Here's what part of the CA.net link says about that;\n \n \n....To put it simply: in the real world, the long-term overall flow is downhill, not uphill. All experimental and physical observation appears to confirm that the law is indeed universal, affecting all natural processes in the long run. \n\n \n If an evolutionist doesn't want to apply the law in some cases, and a creationist wants to apply it to all systems equally, which one appears more honest?\n \n \n \nEvolution has several of those steps; they are the steps between photosynthesis and reproduction. \n\n \n But what is the mechanism for those steps? The refrigerator is the mechanism in your example. Not only is it complex and intelligently designed, but it needs specially designed energy (electricity) to work. If it's left outside to do nothing but absorb sunlight for energy, it will do absolutely nothing (except quickly deteriorate, as the second law says.)\n \n \n \n \nIf you want to quantify the entropy levels of the early earth and the modern earth for comparison purposes, feel free; you will be hard pressed to come up with any coherent model.

This does not mean that any faith is involved. \n\n \n It's not accountable, it's not a system, and overall, it's not testable, repeatable, nor observable. But it seems that nothing can keep it from being regarded as neutral, utilitarian science.\n \n \n \nI already told you to learn about the photosystems. You might want to look into reaction coupling, too, but that may be too much to ask of you. \n\n \n Looks like sunlight is about all it takes for evolution, the same sunlight that has so much to do with destrution, concerning the effects of thermodynamics.\n \n \n \nThe same way you can have kids, who have kids, who have kids, who have kids...\n\n \n You're comparing the human reproduction process to organic compounds evolving into the first true cells, which evolved into still more complex cells, far more complex than any machine ever dreamed up by man, including these computers we're using?\n \n \n \nThat wasn't my \"one line.\" My one line was, \"Entropy is not measured by 'aliveness' or 'deadness' of organisms.\"\n\n \n Equally, not a refutation.

A correlation between something alive and something dead, when exposed to unrestricted amounts of energy from the sun. A live animal left in a car in direct sunlight on a hot sunny day, along with a dead animal. They both will become equal in only a few days.\n \n \n \n \n \nin genetic information.\n \n \n Non-sequitur. Metabolism in your own body is also about changes involving the same ultimate source, yet you do not fall apart. \n\n \n Genetic information and metabolism aren't completely comparable. Metabolism involves building up and breaking down. Neither natural selection nor mutations introduce any new genetic data into the organism's DNA. They only select out the disfigured, weak, or unfit individuals of a population. It cannot produce new genetic information.\n \n \n \nScientists measure entropy all the time. If you don't know this, you didn't look at much evidence. \n\n \n You were the one that told me that entropy is not measured in terms of aliveness or deadness.

   "Pardon my intrusion, I am new to these forums, however I felt the need to point out that the following is a perfect example of BAD inductive reasoning and very poor logic.\n \n \n \n As to entropy and evolution:\n \n It seems that some people have a lack of understanding of the methods for speciation proposed by evolution. They are conveniently outlined here.\n \n All of these (minus polyploidy, which is a result of non-disjunction) are rooted in mutation. This a direct result of errors in self-replication at the biochemical level, which is examined via the DNA replication biochemical pathway.\n \n An examination of the free-energy change during the extension of a DNA strand is available here.\n \n What you appear to ignore marc is that you are trying to quantify free-energy change for the entire evolutionary process from the past 4+ billion years. This is why the accounting required would be vast. If we however look at a simpler system, example the free-energy change during correct and incorrect base-pairing within the enzymatic context of DNA replication, you will notice that at no point are the Laws of Thermodynamics violated. The data provided above (I don't know if you will have full access to the article, hopefully you do) should clarify that point.\n \n I was wondering marc, if evolution violates the Laws of Thermodynamics (as you seem to believe it does), why are the observable and testable examples of evolution in a modern context? Read HIV, Avian Flu, any lab E. Coli, Drosophila melanogaster experiments, etc.\n \n Would not the Laws of Thermodynamics say, \"What a tic, you can't do that!\" and step in? You argue that by said law, evolution is impossible. Empirical evidence has proven the contrary.\n\n \n There are a lot of things in a modern context. Two scientists, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey, carried out an experiment in which they attempted to simulate early earth conditions according to evolutionists. Though several things were added or left out to attempt to achieve the desired results, their experiment proved in no way how amino acids formed on early earth. Yet evolutionists often still refer to it as an answer as to how amino acids formed on earth. Fancy that! \n \n All things in modern context are products of imperfect humans, often with pre determined results. It's often said about the Holy Bible. If it's uncertain, science can also be uncertain.",

   "\n Genetic information and metabolism aren't completely comparable. Metabolism involves building up and breaking down. Neither natural selection nor mutations introduce any new genetic data into the organism's DNA. They only select out the disfigured, weak, or unfit individuals of a population. It cannot produce new genetic information.\n \n\n Marc, Marc, Marc. I must take you to task over the above statement, which quite simply is false. DNA mutations are the mechanism that produces the specie diversity over which natural selection occurs, right? A mutation of genetic material is a change in one or more base pairs of the DNA from the parent generation to the replicated child generation, right? A chromosome looks one way, gets replicated, and then if the replication looks different, that equals a mutation. In the following I will even play along with your notion that DNA = data or information (though personally I think this is a fallacious argument).\n \n Mutations can arise from a variety of ways (all of which are observable, repeatable, and testable which seems to be near and dear to you):\n \n Recombination. A piece of a chromosome (chromotid) gets swapped between chromosome pairs during replication. This is quite common, especially during meiosis, and is nature's way of 'shuffling the deck' of heritability. Net information gain = 0 (usually).\n \n Transposons. Genetic material in DNA will be replicated twice and the duplicate will be reinserted elsewhere in the chromsome. This is not uncommon, and with the sequencing of the human genome it is believed that 25% of the \"promoters\" non-coding portions of DNA are the result of transposons, and the majority of the \"junk\" portion is genes damaged by transposons. Net information gain = the informational amount of the original transposal genetic sequence, usually many hundreds (or more) of DNA base pairs.\n \n Retro-viral insertions. Virii have no replication mechanism, and insert their genetic material into the host cell's DNA to allow the host cell to do the replication for the virus. It is estimated that 8% of the human genome is the product of retro-viral insertions. Net information gain = the genetic material of the virus, usually thousands of DNA base pairs. Retro-viral insertions are easily observed by researchers.\n \n Replication errors. RNA physically climbs the DNA ladder rungs (bases) as it replicates the DNA. Occasionally it may skip a rung, or slip and re-replicate a rung, or mis-match a base. This has been physically observed, and for human reproductive cells, occurs over 100 times on average. This is a point mutation. Net information gain = 0. Over 1.4 million point variations have been identified in the human genome, with more to come.\n \n There is a protein (HSP90) which assists RNA in correctly replicating DNA. When an organism is under stress (nutritional, heat, cold, etc.) HSP90 is diverted from this task, and the replication error rate increases. Organism under stress = higher rate of mutations = greater specie diversity. Just what one would expect for adaptation via selection when a specie's habitat changes.\n \n Whether a mutation is negative or positive depends on the outcome. Many times a mutation is lethal (1 in 4 human fertilized eggs spontaneously aborts). Sometimes it is beneficial. Human hormonal controls and the immune system seem to be the products of tranposal insertion.\n \n These DNA mutations are what provide diversity within a species. \n \n An interesting note on retro-viral insertions in the human DNA. Quite a bit of the 'junk' portion of DNA is composed of once functioning genes that have been damaged by retro-viral insertions. For example, suppose you had a gene consisting of a sequence: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP (this sequence would actually be hundreds or even thousands of letters long). And you also knew a particular virus had a sequence of 1234567890 (this sequence too would be hundreds of characters long). And you observed in a 'junk' portion of DNA the sequence ABCDEF1234567890GHIJKLMNOP. You can conclude (because in actuality we're talking many thousands of characters) this was once the gene which was damaged by that virus' insertion of its genetic material. \n \n Now suppose you observe several instances of these retro-viral insertions (with different genes and virii) in the human genome, and then observe the exact same sequences in the mouse genome! Amazing but true. You could argue that similar strings of genes implies similar designs of species. However, you cannot resort to similar design where we have damage to the \"designed\" DNA by a virus or viruses. If this damage is identical between species - human and mouse - the best explanation is that an ancestor to both humans and mice was infected with a retrovirus which damaged a particular gene.",

Or do you look at the natural and see a pattern and then try to explain the whole?\n\n \n There is no soul. There is only a continuum of conciousness.

   "Evangelical churches; something of a catchall term, there is an Evangelical Wing of the Anglican church, as opposed to the Traditional wing of the church. This seems to include those who take a more literalist view of the bible and has recently been in conflict with leadership over issues such as female priests, female bishops, acceptance of homosexual people, homosexual clergy, teaching of creationism in CofE schools, and presumably several other rows less well covered by the media. \n Presumably linked to the Low Church rather than the more Catholic style High Church.\n Also applies to such groups as the Southern Baptists, Patrick Henry College and other groups.\n Evangelical denominations seem to be characterised by their use of rock style music, technical lighting effects, and people having some form of fit or seizure when touched by a preacher.\n Known for political activism and attacks on anyone and anything that doesn't conform to their interpretation of the Bible. Seem overly fond of the King James V translation.

   "And in relation to mutating into something....it should be seen. And that would take an eyeball, me thinks.\n\n \n And it does, an eyeball and a microscope. Mutation in the physical sense is a very very small part of evolution. Evolution at the cellular level is far more important. You cannot see with the unaided eye the evolution of the flu virus as it changes its morphology every time we come out with a new vaccine, but we know it happens, there is evidence to prove it. Viewable evidence if you have the right tools (i.e. a cell biology lab).\n \n \nI think to disprove God would be the goal if I were an athiest or evolutionist.\n\n \n Why? What for? I don't care if you think God exists or not. What I do care about is young-earth creationist/literalists directly contradicting what years of empirical evidence has shown to be VERY VERY LIKELY. I will admit that there is always some possibility of error, but the more data is collected, the greater the possibility that what we say is correct. Sure some greater being could have created the universe by saying these are the laws of nature and just watched it happen. We can't prove or disprove that hypothesis, but we can prove that evolution does occur and is still occuring and will continue to occur.\n \n \nIf evolving physical bodies were the norm and we could see it...then what?Christians would argue and say, \"God made it that way.\" ...right?\n To evolve into something else would even further the intelligence behind the maker, my opinion of course.\n\n \n Exactly and I don't care if they do, as long as they acknowledge that the mechanism can be elucidated by science. Instead of decrying how things work and chalking it up to \"miracles\" why not protest willful ignorance. Many scientists don't have problems with rationalizing their work with spirituality. It only becomes a problem when religion tries to dictate a literalist interpretation of sacred texts, using them as evidence against the empirical testable evidence presented by science.\n \n \nI know I'm not like other Christians, sorry. I make allowances for there being more, really I do.\n But for me, evolving things just do not change my observable and otherwise belief in a designer/creator.\n\n \n Good for you, faith is a good thing and an important part of humanity.\n \n \nMy apologies for wanting my cake and eating it too.\n\n \n No apology required, I was nit-picking and understood what you meant. Nothing like a debate forum though to undermine your opponents case by deliberately trying to make them look like a hypocrite.\n \n \nAn example would be if over a long period of time the need to change to fit our surroundings continued to press upon the physical, which leads to the spirit of man impressing upon the genetics and instructing or reconstructing them over generations to produce the needed abilities to deal with the changing enviroment.

Is conciousness presupposed by a soul, or mind, or nervous system? As I have pointed out, viral strains evolve all the time? Is this guided by some unconcious?\n \n In the thread are humans still evolving, I point out that evolution in the standard sense has seemed to have stalled out with humanity and instead natural selection places pressure on our ability to solve problems with technology and social-behavioural interactions.

   "I think it is an issue for this discussion, though it's probably an area that we have to move on from, and agree to disagree.\n\n No, it's not an issue for this discussion, because we're not discussing quantum systems.\n \n \nAll experimental and physical observation appears to confirm that the law is indeed universal, affecting all natural processes in the long run.\n\n CA.net is simply wrong. Look at two atoms of hydrogen. See how long it takes for the electron in each to collapse into the proton at the center. Go ahead.\n They won't, because the law doesn't apply to them. It's not because they are already at a state of maximum entropy -- allow the two to interact and they will bond -- but because nothing says they ought to.\n As my physicist friend puts it: \"Look at the atom. It's a perpetual motion machine.\"\n \n \nIf an evolutionist doesn't want to apply the law in some cases, and a creationist wants to apply it to all systems equally, which one appears more honest?\n\n When one person knows what he's talking about, and the other doesn't, which one appears more correct?\n \n \nBut what is the mechanism for those steps? The refrigerator is the mechanism in your example. Not only is it complex and intelligently designed, but it needs specially designed energy (electricity) to work.\n\n Sorry, I don't have time to recite complex biochemistry to you. I already pointed you toward the photosystems, and it's up to you to acknowledge their existence.\n \n \nIf it's left outside to do nothing but absorb sunlight for energy, it will do absolutely nothing (except quickly deteriorate, as the second law says.)\n\n No, the second law doesn't say that. As an example, look at the photosystems. They don't \"quickly deteriorate.\"\n \n \nIt's not accountable, it's not a system, and overall, it's not testable, repeatable, nor observable.\n\n Evolution is not reasonably accountable (mostly because you wouldn't dare quantify the entropy of the earth), and it's not a proper physical system, but that doesn't mean it's not testable, repeatable, or observable. I can kick your XXX (again) on these three topics in another thread if you like, but let's stick to your second law claptrap for this one.\n \n \nLooks like sunlight is about all it takes for evolution, the same sunlight that has so much to do with destrution, concerning the effects of thermodynamics.\n\n See, the irony here is that you're being sarcastic, but that's correct. See how powerful natural selection is?\n \n \nYou're comparing the human reproduction process to organic compounds evolving into the first true cells,\n\n Evolution is totally separate from abiogenesis. Quit the strawman XXXX and stick to the topic at hand.\n \n \nwhich evolved into still more complex cells, far more complex than any machine ever dreamed up by man, including these computers we're using?\n\n How are you defining \"complex\"? (And don't forget, 3.7 billion years is a long time.) \n \n \nAll your one line said was \"No. We can't / we won't.\"\n\n No, my one line said that CA.net's argument that sunlight doesn't bring dead organisms back to life is pointless for discussion about thermodynamics. That is very much a refutation of that line of argumentation. Besides, it's not like I haven't previously shown that the author(s) of that page know(s) very little of thermodynamics.\n \n \nI see now that entropy has only a marginal application to our discussion. You seem more concerned with entropy's existance after something has developed. This discussion is about changes in entropy during a development process. The effects of thermodynamics is change, evolution is about change. \n\n I have no idea what the main point of this passage is. Discussion regarding the second law of thermodynamics most certainly means that entropy is a crucial component. I have absolutely no qualms about applying the law to any classical system regardless of \"development\" or whatever you think you're talking about.\n \n \nYou said this;\n \nThat is to say, there is no necessary correlation between amount of entropy within something and whether that thing is alive or dead.\nWe're discussing how entropy changes, not how it simply exists. A correlation between something alive and something dead, when exposed to unrestricted amounts of energy from the sun. A live animal left in a car in direct sunlight on a hot sunny day, along with a dead animal. They both will become equal in only a few days.\n\n How does this have anything to do with my statement? I stand by my statement: there is no necessary correlation between amount of entropy within something and whether that thing is alive or dead. You tried giving counterexamples that were clearly false.\n There are a number of problems with your model. Most organisms are not \"exposed to unrestricted amounts of energy,\" but this is really the least of your concern. More importantly, animals are consumers, not producers; they do not get their energy from the sun. On the other hand, if you leave some plants in a car with the windows down, it will live happily, and if you leave a zebra in a field with grass to eat, it will live too, despite being exposed to lots and lots of light.\n Furthermore, your example neglects to feed the animal in the car. Food serves as a sink for entropy (that is, a source of usable energy). By removing this sink, your example becomes inapplicable to all organisms that are able to eat.\n \n \nNeither natural selection nor mutations introduce any new genetic data into the organism's DNA. \n\n Mutations most certainly do, but we can discuss that in another thread too, if you dare.\n \n \nThey only select out the disfigured, weak, or unfit individuals of a population. It cannot produce new genetic information.\n\n It also selects for those better equipped to survive. And repeating your claim about no new information won't make it true.\n \n \nYou were the one that told me that entropy is not measured in terms of aliveness or deadness. There seems to be restrictions in how it's measured, if the established naturalistic philosophy could come into question.\n\n If you care to find a textbook on thermodynamics that measures entropy in aliveness or deadness, then I'll retract the statement and apologize. Otherwise, try reading a textbook yourself to understand. Entropy is a state function relating heat (transfer) and temperature.\n \n \nYou make it sound so simple. The frailty of life, the destructive processes that we can find no exception to anywhere else in the universe, make it seem quite unlikely.\n\n Maybe to you, but then, you don't really understand any of these processes that you think make it unlikely.\n \n \nI'm getting an education in how those who represent science seem to arbitrarily define what a \"system\" is, and what testable, repeatable, and observable really are.\n\n There's no arbitration involved. And again, I'll kick your XXX on evolution being testable, repeatable, and observable in another thread at your request.\n \n \nThe reproduction of isn't, but the evolving of is, if there's no creation or ID involved.\n\n No, the evolving of it isn't random or chance. An antonym of \"random\" is \"selective\"... Natural selection isn't random, it's selection!\n \n \nThe sun often treats alive things and dead things in exactly the same way.\n\n The sun doesn't care what's receiving the radiation it's emitting; the things the radiation hits, however, are capable of doing different things with it. I've told you this already, but you apparently didn't comprehend it.",

I think that was the original goal to walk in fellowship with him and learn of the mysteries of life. Then again I have only my own witness to this fact and no real proof so to speak. Although I will say that I have several people who will tell you verbatem that God answers me, helps me, heals me, and always reveals himself in my life, (very definable) especially when needed (definately tested and proven real) each event is a small story of facts with things that did happen. Things that only a God could do. But I admit he is vague to most...even most Christians.\n \n Of course I do not try to explain God \"into\" science. I find if I ask, he reveals answers.\n But they do not always come as a science, at least not as we know it.\n \n I believe God started out with more than< enough stars, galaxies, etc. and he flung them into space. A treasure box filled with concentrated space stuff. And what we see is the result of that flinging. Not real scientific BUT the idea of starting with more than <what you see, fits the ability of a God and is a whole paradigm shift in how we look at it all..\n \n I guess what I'm trying to say is too many people try to come up with something from nothing.... I believe it is the other way around.\n \n I believe he is so much bigger, and his ways and thoughts so much beyond ours...that in his mercy he does not tell us everything. We could not contain it all. He reveals some and then he watches to see what we think of it...laughs.\n \n There really is no need to argue about it all on one hand. Think about it... the more we can look at things from different views and speculate and calculate how things are the more we learn and find out.\n \n It is just the , \"There is no God thing\" or the, \" It has to be God thing\" that gets in the way. We should be able to hold our opinions and whatever pans out one way or another does. But I do not believe the part describes the whole, wholly. (is that the right spelling?-bother)\n \n I do not think from our vantage point we could possibly explain it all in a theory.\n But we do have some good ones. All of which have holes!\n But Hugh makes some good points on time & dimensions I think.",

   "Yes, I'm aware of some people pointing out his tendencies to, well let's just say be unreliable. Although sometimes even people who are off in some area make good points.lol\n \n I can agree on adaptability with the enviroment, to a degree.\n \n uh...variation..okay, filter..humm..okay, could you elaborate?\n \n .\n\n \n \n The 'filter' is a set of curcumstances and rules that 'choose' for characterisitics. In the case of evolution, the characterisitc that is 'chosen' for is the ability to reproduce. The 'variations' that are not\n as able to survive to reproduce , or are infertile do not pass their genes on.\n \n These rules can cause complexity over time. There is no evidence that any other factor is involved to cause the so called \"design\" for life.\n \n \n This makes variation 'non-random' so to speak.",
