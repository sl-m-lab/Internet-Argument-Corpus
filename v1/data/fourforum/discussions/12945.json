Try to follow this.\n Does abstinence help to prevent an unplanned pregnancy?\n Is it a form of birth control?\n YES!\n \n Quite frankly, YOU look at it as something more important, and YOU want it presented to reflect YOUR values...\n But quite frankly, that's actually selfish...\n You're thinking of your personal goals, rather than what is best for the students being educated.\n \n \n \nIt's like saying that, if we want to deal with the problem of speeding, we should not have an approach that says \"we simply shouldn't speed\", but that we should also buy radar detectors, radar jammers, and anything else that will deal with the consequences of our failures.\n\n Talk about a poisoning the well example...\n Speeding is illegal and dangerous to people. Both the people who speed, and others on the highway.\n \n Teen-age sex is not illegal.\n While it can be dangerous with issues like pregnancy and STDs, research shows that fewer kids get pregnant, and that the STD rates are actually similar cause the \"abstinence only\" crowd typically goes about having MORE RISKY SEX that isn't coitus...\n There is no danger to others.\n \n Unlike speeding without getting caught, having sex WITH PROTECTION IS SAFER, and thus effectively destroys your attempted analogy.\n We want the kids who are doing something risky to DO IT SAFER, instead of just ignoring the fact that they're doing it anyways.\n \n \n \nPeople are not automotons--believe it or not, they can choose to not have sex if they want.\n\n This is a pointless truism. It addresses nothing that I said.\n In fact, one would think it would be more applicable to YOUR side of the fence, cause people who insist on \"abstinence only\" education need to get it through their head that people are not automotons, and that they DO choose to have sex despite what they have been educated on, except that WITHOUT the additional relevant education it results in a WORSE situation.\n \n \n \nThe stats that say abstinence doesn't work are flawed because they approach abstinence as a birth control method, in the same way they do, say, condoms.

I'm not an abstinence-ONLY advocate when it comes to education. Nevertheless, there's no such thing as abstinence that DOESN'T work. It always works. In fact it's the one form of birth control that does; condoms may fail, for instance.

At this stage, the \"focus on the daughter\" is justified by the daughter's own activism on the issue.\n The right-wing organization has made Palin's daughter a spokes-person for \"abstinence only\" education.\n Bristol Palin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n It is absolutely hilarious and pathetic how you are trying to complain that we are \"focusing on her daughter\", but the right have made her a focus of their movement. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n You want to \"question motives\"???\n Question HER motives for why SHE PUTS HERSELF in the middle of this, and you run around insisting nobody should look at her... emoticon_rolleyes",
