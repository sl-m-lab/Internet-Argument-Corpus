   "i've alwase considered the differance between determanism and fate to be that fate is a mystical idea that there is some uknowable set path for the future to unvold in, while determanism is based uppon the idea that any given person's actions are theoreticaly predictable, if you know what all of the influences on that person are.\n \n if it is to be considerted theoreticaly possible to predict the actions a somebody based on all of the infulences on that person, then all of those influences must exist before action is taken. In the example given of the apartment complex - the beliver in determanism belives that the apartment that is chosen will depend upon something pre-existing and predictable. i would imagen that in the case of this apartment complex, certan things would be considered - what floor the room is on, whether it is near the stairs, that sort of thing. supposing all of those things are considered and there are still several identical options remaing then the determanist claims it is still theoreticaly possible to know beforhand what sort of person this is, that is makeing the desition, do they have a favorate number? are they the type to just choose the first untaken number, or the highest, or was there some subconcious influences experanced prior to their choosing that lead them to say \"eh, twenty... one.\" It is fair for the determanist to claim that even if a person makes a desition just based on what they want or what sort of person they are, then those things are still predictable, and have influences of their own that made them what they are.\n \n i dont buy it, because creativity denys predicatbilty. Creativity is the force by witch people create ideas, and thus it is an important factor in desition makeing. And it is not predictable - it denys predictablity. to illustrate this point, consider the interaction of creativity to mathematics - witch is an otherwise knowable and predictable system. for example, the number pi comes from the creative idea to mesure the circumfrance of a circle, by seeing how many times the diamiter of a circle could wrap around the outside of a circle. the result is a number witch can not be fully calculated because its next number can not be predicted. Or, try arrangeing differant numbers of things into a square, and you will be able to do it sometims, but not other times, when you can and cant do it is predictable, because a square is a mathematical idea - a thing with four equaly distant sides, it can be described in terms of numbers. also you can arrange any number of rocks into a rectangle, if you include a rectangle that is just one rock high or wide, but if you have the creative idea to limit the shape you wish to create to a rectangle that is at least two rocks high or wide, then the instances when you wont be able to do it becoem totaly unpredictable (prime numbers)",

   "Ok, here's something entirely different. Try to wrap your minds around it just a bit before attacking the messenger, please? This will all be common 'world-view' in a couple hundred years.\n \n 'Existence' is made of 'moments'. These are Planck moments, 'timeless' in their 'duration', as they are too 'quick' to qualify as 'time' (an 'illusion').\n \n The difference is that all 'moments', although 'appearing' to be sequential, leading to the eroneous perception/conception of a linear temporal paradigm, are not sequential but mutually arrisen simultaneously. All 'moments' of 'existence', 'ever', are Here/Now. All at once; more like a magnificent tapestry than one 'moment' turning into another, 'causing and effecting' all over the place. 'Even the terms 'cause and effect' have become obsolete. Cause and effect are now considered to be 'mutually arrising aspects of the same 'event''. Ordering the moments are arbitrary and fallacious.\n \n As all 'moments' of existence are already a 'done deal', as there is no 'motion', nothing turning into something else, no 'decisions' of what to 'do' or which way to 'go' (as there is no 'doing' or 'going')... all concepts of 'free-will' and 'freedom' itself are vain ego delusions. The vanity of the ego imagining a 'self' that is 'in charge' of 'things', 'doing', 'choosing'... \n Vanity, vanity. \n \n As we are dealing with 'egos' there will be 'knee-jerk' reactions to defend/attack to preserve and inflate the delusions that the ego feeds upon. Please try to understand the 'material' before 'killing the messenger'. Understanding does not mean that you must accept. \n \n Actually, you have no choice in the matter.\n \n Some food for thought might be derived HERE and HERE from Benjamin Libet regarding 'choice to act' and 'action', actual experimental 'evidence' to ponder.\n \n Another site that might be interesting is God Has No Free-Will.\n \n Later...",
