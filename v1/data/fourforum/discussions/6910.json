   "The Violinist Argument: this was brought up in the 'I think abortion is OK to an extent' thread. Personally I don't believe in an absolutely rights-based system, but I'm interested in this in terms of the arguments used and whether they're logically sustainable.\n \n Here is the argument that was set out in full:\n \n The details of Judith Jarvis Thompson's argument are important, so I will quote her illustration in full. Entitled \"A Defense of Abortion,\" it first appeared in 1971 in the Journal of Philosophy and Public Affairs.[1] \n \n I propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. How does the argument go from here? Something like this, I take it. Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body; everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed; an abortion may not be performed. \n It sounds plausible. But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you-we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist now is plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you. \n \n Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says, \"Tough luck, I agree, but you've now got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him.\" I imagine you would regard this as outrageous,[2] which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago.\n \n Judith Jarvis Thompson correctly shows that an additional step is needed to bridge the gap between the premise that the unborn is a person and the conclusion that killing the unborn child is always wrong. What's needed is the additional premise that taking the life of a person is always wrong. Killing, however, is sometimes permissible, most notably in self-defense. \n \n The reasoning in the violinist illustration is very tight. Thompson accurately represents the pro-life position, and then offers a scenario for us to consider. The analysis employs two powerful techniques of argumentation: an example that appeals to moral intuition followed by a logical slippery slope. \n \n The logical slippery slope works like this. When one thing is immoral, and a second is logically similar in a morally relevant way, the moral quality of the one \"slips over\" into the other. For example, murder is immoral, and some think capital punishment is similar enough to murder to make capital punishment immoral too. \n \n Thompson is counting on a certain moral intuition-our sense of justice-rising to the surface when we consider the plight of the kidnapped woman used as a host against her will to support the life of a stranger. \n \n She then asks us to consider if having an abortion is a meaningful parallel to unplugging the violinist. Both circumstances catch the woman by surprise. Both the violinist and the unborn child are attached to her body, which both need in order to survive. Both will release her in nine months. \n \n Thompson's view is that disconnecting the violinist is morally justified even though he'll die, and there seems to be merit to this appeal. To stay connected would be heroic-\"a great kindness,\" in her words-but, like all acts of heroism, it is voluntary and not morally required.[3] If that's the case, then it's moral to abort a child, even if he or she is a fully human person, just like the violinist. If the first is morally acceptable (unplugging the violinist), and if the second (having an abortion) is similar to the first in a relevant way, then the second should be acceptable also. \n \n A recent book, Breaking the Abortion Deadlock: From Choice to Consent,[4] uses the same approach. Author Eileen McDonagh points out that if a woman's liberty is being threatened in some fashion-if she is being attacked, raped, or kidnapped-then the law gives her the latitude to use lethal force to repel her attacker. \n \n Pregnancy, McDonagh argues, is this kind of situation. \"If a woman has the right to defend herself against a rapist, she also should be able to use deadly force to expel a fetus,\" she writes.[5] In pregnancy, a woman is being attacked by another human being-from the inside, not from the outside. Therefore, she has the moral liberty to repel her attacker by killing the intruder. \n \n It does seem obvious that a woman ought to be allowed to protect herself from an attacker and use lethal force to do so, if necessary. If this is true, then we must concede the legitimacy of abortion, which, McDonagh claims, is parallel in a relevant way. \n \n \n Parallels that Aren't Parallel \n \n The key question in any slippery slope appeal is whether the two situations are truly similar in a morally relevant way. If not, then the illustration is guilty of a logical slippery slope fallacy. The analogy fails and the argument falls apart. \n \n Are there important differences between pregnancy and kidnapping? Yes, many. \n \n First, the violinist is artificially attached to the woman. A mother's unborn baby, however, is not surgically connected, nor was it ever \"attached\" to her. Instead, the baby is being produced by the mother's own body by the natural process of reproduction. \n \n Both Thompson and McDonagh treat the child-the woman's own daughter or son--like an invading stranger intent on doing harm. They make the mother/child union into a host/predator relationship. \n \n A child is not an invader, though, a parasite living off his mother. A mother's womb is the baby's natural environment. Eileen McDonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing. One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there. \n \n Thompson ignores a second important distinction. In the violinist illustration, the woman might be justified withholding life-giving treatment from the musician under these circumstances. Abortion, though, is not merely withholding treatment. It is actively taking another human being's life through poisoning or dismemberment. A more accurate parallel with abortion would be to crush the violinist or cut him into pieces before unplugging him. \n \n Third, the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship. This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration, also echoed in McDonagh's thesis. Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child. \n \n The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger. McDonagh's view is even worse. She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense. \n \n This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson's illustration. What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that? And what would we think of her if she did? \n \n Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless. This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents. They have consistently ruled, for example, that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted. \n \n If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life (through abortion) before it is born, how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he's born? Remember, Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. If her argument works to justify abortion, it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child. After all, a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn. \n \n Thompson is mistaken in presuming that pregnancy is the thing that expropriates a woman's liberty. Motherhood does that, and motherhood doesn't end with the birth of the child. Unlike the woman connected to the violinist, a mother is not released in nine months. Her burden has just begun. If Thompson's argument works, then no child is safe from a mother who wants her liberty. \n \n In the end, both Thompson's and McDonagh's arguments prove too much. They allow us to kill any human being who is dependent upon us, young or old, if that person restrains our personal liberty. \n \n The simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body. Liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy, not civilization. At any given moment, each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community. The most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child. This is one of the reasons the public outcry against Susan Smith was so intense. \n \n \n Susan Smith Morality \n \n Susan Smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children. She believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage, so she placed them in her car, fastened their seat belts, and drove them into the lake. \n \n Smith's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all: the responsibility a mother has for her own children. Yet wouldn't Susan Smith be exonerated by Thompson's and McDonagh's logic? These children were kidnappers and interlopers, trespassing on Smith's life, depriving her of liberty. Why not kill them? Those boys were attacking her. It was self-defense. \n \n Last year, a couple in New York was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to Florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves. If McDonagh's and Thompson's arguments work, these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house. Those children were invading their privacy, trespassing in their home, stealing their food. \n \n This argument is frightening for two reasons. First, it must reject the notion of parental responsibility in order to succeed. Second, in spite of that weakness, people in high places think it's compelling. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing in the North Carolina Law Review, has admitted that Roe v. Wade was deeply flawed, and instead quoted the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in support of abortion. Women get pregnant, she argued, men don't. Abortion gives women a shot at equality. She then cited Thompson for support. \n \n The responsibility a mother has toward her child supersedes any claim she has to personal liberty. If it doesn't, if Thompson's and McDonagh's arguments succeed, then release Susan Smith. Release the deadbeat Florida tourists. If parenthood is an act of heroism, if mothers have no moral obligation to the children they bear, if child-rearing is a burden \"above and beyond the call of duty,\" then no child is safe, in the womb or out.",

It is very rare for a pregnancy to have such an effect on the mother so as to completly remove her freedom from her. The sense we get from Thomson is that the donor has had all her freedoms removed from her as a result of a kidnapping.

   "Cone and I completely disagree about handing control of a woman's biology to a government, but in this case, Cone is completely correct. The analogy is skewed. Someone wakes up one morning and aliens have attached another person (a famous violinist) to them. If she detaches the famous violinist, the violinist will die. As Cone points out, (not in these exact words - I put it in mine) this woman is a victim. This famous violinist analogy is closer to that of a rape victim's relationship to a fetus within her than a woman who is pregnant due to consensual sex. To equate pregnancy from consensual sex with victimization is not only a stretch, it is demeaning. It subtly infers that a woman is victimized, not by ignorance, not by religious self-righteousness, not by controlling know-it-alls, but by her own reproductive anatomy.\n \n Accepting Thompson's basic assumptions, if the pregnancy is due a rape (or any form of nonconsensual act), that is one thing. If the pregnancy is due to a consensual act, that is a completely different matter. Morality would assume that you take responsibility for your action. Does that mean that you must proceed in a specific way? No. You always have freedom of choice. But in the instance of rape, the woman is simply a victim and not responsible. In the instance of pregnancy due to consensual acts, then the woman must bear some responsibility. Fulfilling that responsibility may mean carrying the fetus to term; it also may mean terminating the pregnancy. It is an awesome responsibility.\n \n Bottom line is that the only pregnancy to equate Thomson's violinist analogy to is a pregnancy due to a non consensual act. If that is the case, it is not morally incumbent on the woman to accede to this situation and she is under no obligation to bear a rapists child.",

I think these two situations might produce wholly different, and perhaps opposite, moral intuitions.\n\n \n Consent is a different argument which we can persue the meat of (mmm... meat) once we nail down what is and is not analogous, methinks. I don't recognize irresponsibility as consent.\n \n I don't believe using those words interchangeably does this argument justice. It requires moral intuition as well as moral reasoning. This is an argument, not an emotional appeal. If one makes judgment solely based on gut level reaction, one is not considering the argument fully.\n \n \n\n No, it would not change the pro-life stance, which is not what I was saying. I was saying that that it might change the reaction we get when reading Thomson's argument. Thomson tries to get us to empathize with the donor, and from that position, make our moral choice. But, if who we are relating to has full functionality and little negative effects as a result of the relationship, I think our reaction (perhaps not yours, but probably other people) to Thomson's argument would be different.\n\n \n I don't believe that other people would have such a different reaction to those two situations as you suggest. You yourself admit changing the situation between those two situations would not change the pro-life stance and it would not change the pro-choice stance either that I know of. Yes, in one there is more restricted movement but no ill-effects whatsoever and in the other there are significant ill-effects but less restricted movement. They are different but the differences do not make them disparate.\n \n \n \n\n But that's just it. A negative impact in Thomson's argument is that the donor must rest in a hospital for nine months. She therefore cannot enjoy the same freedoms she enjoyed before and this being a direct result of the violinist. What I was trying to point out is that this really isn't analogous to pregnancy at all.

The sense we get from Thomson is that the donor has had all her freedoms removed from her as a result of a kidnapping. Something about that doesn't seem just, and so many make their moral choice accordingly. However, pregnancy presents no such removal of freedom, and thus no equivalent sense of injustice.\n\n \n This, however, is in no way a point in the argument. They must work within the bounds of what is analogous to pregnancy. It is also bound by realism and what we can empathize with. If the analogy was \"you have a mystical connection where the violinist lies in bed and you randomly throw up in the mornings\" it would not be something one can empathize with easily. The physical connection is required to give an accurate analogy, and an unconscious adult violinist is also required so his/her opinion is not included and there is no question he/she has full rights. Given the bounds with which this argument must work within, the argument presented is the most analogous one can have.\n \n I would further argue that the Violinist argument purifies the moral issue, and faces the pro-life assertion head-on. There are no health issues to cloud it, the violinist is a person with full protection of the law (as pro-life wish the fetus to be), and all the woman must do is lie comfortably and support the other's life for 9 months with no effort required or special circumstances on her part. It is a simple and clear matter of moral rights and a matter between her rights to her body and the violinist's life, and if you agree with her moral right to disconnect the violinist in this situation it is a short and necessary (imo) step to agree with her moral right to disconnect the fetus.\n \n \n\n Yes. The issue of abortion is a moral one. However, when making an argument about morality, appealing to intuition can have as many different results as the people who are intuiting. That, I think, is a problem because what Thomson takes for granted is immoral, may not in actuality be so.\n\n \n Agreed, morality does vary from person to person. Some would say that no matter what abortion is wrong even if it would kill the mother to continue the pregnancy (they do exist, I have met them). In general, though, this is not the case and people would generally agree on the morality of the Violinist.\n \n This argument does require a certain degree of rationality. They are analogous enough, imo, that if one is agreed to then the other is necessarily agreed to (which is the point of analogies). Only the irrational would agree to one analogous situation while disagreeing with the other. There have to be differences between the two that make one allowed and the other disallowed. You, however, don't believe either is morally justified, so this is rather pointless.\n \n \n\n This question of morality, I think, ultimately is made as a result of an intuition (Remember, I use intuition and gut reaction interchangably) about what is right, wrong, just, etc.\n\n \n Rationality and consistency are also required for a moral argument however, not a gut level reaction.\n \n \n\n I understand this is the argument. What I do not understand is why this is true.\n\n \n Because the argument is one has a moral right to disconnect any person who is connected to one's body against one's will. You can disagree with the argument but it has no time frame limit, so an arbitrary limit imposed (such as 9 months) cannot invalidate it.\n \n \n\n Answered part of this above. Would proven consent change your outcome about \n aboriton in the circumstance where consent has been proven?\n\n \n Yes. If the intent on the part of the woman was to become pregnant it would definitely change my view on abortion in that case. If a woman intends to take a shower with water, she consents to getting wet. If the woman does not intend to get wet (perhaps she is 'showering' with powder just to absorb sweat) getting her wet on the assumption that she consented to getting wet is not correct. She did not consent to getting wet in that instance, though she did intend to 'shower' (shower does not equal getting wet, as sex does not equal getting or remaining pregnant). This is not meant as a deep or very analogous situation to abortion or pregnancy, just on how I generally view consent.\n \n \n\n The ill-effect of the connection in the argument is the restraint of all freedom. Do you not agree that this is a consequence of Thomson's scenario? And if so, would you also agree that the donors freedom is restrained in a much more significant way then a pregnant woman's freedom is?\n\n \n Significant way? Definitely not.\n \n \n\n I do think that the donor in Thomson's hypothetical is morally obligated to continue supporting the violinist for the nine months. So, no, I do not think the donor has the moral right to disconnect the violinist, at least in the first part of the scenario where it is known that in nine months the violinist will be fully recovered.\n\n \n Then you are very far from what the majority of people believe, imo. Most believe that the woman would be under no moral obligation to support the violinist, and would in fact be immoral to force her to support the violinist though it would be a great kindness on her part to agree to (and it is moral to be very kind, there is just no obligation to be kind. Otherwise it is not kindness).\n \n Happy Turkey Day :)",

   "Surprised? Yes. But...\n\n \n Then all we would be doing after this is quibbling about degrees of surprise. Some women are surprised by being pregnant, but this does not change the pro-life stance that abortion is wrong. Therefore it is legitimate for the Violinist argument have the violinist come out of left field so to speak. I do not agree with every part of the argument (certainly I do not accept the fetus as a person as both pro-life people and this argument do), and this section is a weaker point (given there is no possible way to anticipate the violinist), but it does not invalidate the argument as you suggest. Imo, of course.\n \n \n\n It is simply not analogous to a consensual act.\n\n \n Pregnancy is not a consensual act. Sex can be, but sex (or what the woman may have done that led to the violinist to be connected to the woman) is not part of the argument because it does not matter to the argument. It deals solely with after the connection (pregnancy) is made.

   "This, however, is in no way a point in the argument. They must work within the bounds of what is analogous to pregnancy. It is also bound by realism and what we can empathize with. If the analogy was \"you have a mystical connection where the violinist lies in bed and you randomly throw up in the mornings\" it would not be something one can empathize with easily. The physical connection is required to give an accurate analogy, and an unconscious adult violinist is also required so his/her opinion is not included and there is no question he/she has full rights. Given the bounds with which this argument must work within, the argument presented is the most analogous one can have.\n\n Assuming you are right that the hypothetical is the most like situation possible, that in no way implies that it is therefore analagous. I still think it evident that the violinst argument, if it applies to pregnancy at all, can only reasonably apply to pregnancy as a result of rape. I find it hard to extend it past that.\n \n \nAgreed, morality does vary from person to person. Some would say that no matter what abortion is wrong even if it would kill the mother to continue the pregnancy (they do exist, I have met them). In general, though, this is not the case and people would generally agree on the morality of the Violinist.\n\n I do not believe that general moral consensus always equivocates to actual moral rightness.\n \n \nBecause the argument is one has a moral right to disconnect any person who is connected to one's body against one's will. You can disagree with the argument but it has no time frame limit, so an arbitrary limit imposed (such as 9 months) cannot invalidate it.\n\n I'm still wondering how we arrive at the conclusion that one has a moral right to disconnect any person who is connected to their body against their will? How do we know this to be true?\n \n \nYes. If the intent on the part of the woman was to become pregnant it would definitely change my view on abortion in that case. If a woman intends to take a shower with water, she consents to getting wet. If the woman does not intend to get wet (perhaps she is 'showering' with powder just to absorb sweat) getting her wet on the assumption that she consented to getting wet is not correct. She did not consent to getting wet in that instance, though she did intend to 'shower' (shower does not equal getting wet, as sex does not equal getting or remaining pregnant). This is not meant as a deep or very analogous situation to abortion or pregnancy, just on how I generally view consent.\n\n I wonder about this scenario: One adult desires to play a practical joke on one of his friends. He points a loaded firearm in which he thought the safety was engaged, and fires the gun at his friend with the intent to scare him. However, because he was mistaken that the safety was engaged, firing the gun results in the death of his friend. Is the irresponsible practical joker then not responsible in the least for his friend's death? I mean, he consented only to firing a gun that had the safety engaged, not to firing a gun that didn't.\n \n \nThen you are very far from what the majority of people believe, imo. Most believe that the woman would be under no moral obligation to support the violinist, and would in fact be immoral to force her to support the violinist though it would be a great kindness on her part to agree to (and it is moral to be very kind, there is just no obligation to be kind. Otherwise it is not kindness).\n\n If I may give my opinion as well (this is not meant to sound insulting in the least), I believe your position to be far from what the majority of people believe (not intended to be arrogant or namecalling or any such thing, just an observation). From what I understand, your position does not allow a distinction to be made in the case of rape or the case of irresponsibility. This seems to be a distinction that most people recognize. \n \n \nHappy Turkey Day :)\n\n I had to work emoticon_mad",

The issue of the violinst is not whether she has a moral obligation to consent to being connected, but what her obligation is after being connected. Thus, I think with your example we could say something like the following:\n \n Suppose you wake up one day to find out the government has been witholding 80% of your paycheck without your knowledge (highly unlikely that one would not notice this, but let's assume this for the sake of argument). Then suppose you find out that the government has used this money to deliver much needed food to poor and starving communities. The question then becomes: does one have the moral right to demand from the beneficiaries of your paycheck that they return the food they were given to you since it was your money that paid for it?

   "I think you are missing the key points. The kidnapping and connection is pregnancy, not sex. The sex is not a part of the argument, whether consensual or non-consensual.\n \n In pregnancy, the woman has no control and no say over whether or not the sperm meets the egg, which is how this is analogous. What she may or may not have done to prevent this from happening is not part of the argument because it does not matter to the argument. The Violinist argument deals solely with the morality of disconnecting someone who will die if disconnected, when one was connected against ones will.\n\n I see your point, yet I think it falls short of something that I believe seems to be so fundamental, that is, that the circumstances do seem to matter to the majority of people (which seems to be how we are evaluating morality, though I find that a bit troublesome). The circumstances of the connection to the violinist seem to matter as does the circumstances surrounding the origin of a pregnancy. The vast majority of people have opposite moral views of someone who desires to obtain an abortion because they were raped, and someone who desires to obtain an abortion because they have been irresponsible or some other similar scenario (choice of child's gender, for instance). I guess I should have asked this before, but do you think that most people believe this?\n \n \nI don't believe in an objective \"moral rightness\", so I suppose we are at an impasse here.\n\n Yes, this makes it difficult. However, I have given my best effort at trying to evaluate the scenario in a way that makes sense to you. I may not be doing a good job at it, but I'm giving it a shot.\n \n \nI misunderstood your question before :P I generally don't think of morals in terms of 'true' or 'false'. To answer your question, it is not true. It is not false. It is an opinion (at least, the moral situation is. Legally it can be true or false). \n \n The reason this is the argument is that it is a situation a great many people can agree with the morality on. Otherwise it would be useless to use.\n\n I find these two thoughts to be somewhat confusing. I understand you believe there is no moral objectiveness. So then, what does it matter if a majority of people can agree on a certain moral scenario? I guess what I'm asking is, if there is no way to evaluate the rightness of a scenario, what weight is to be given to the fact that the majority of people think X is right and Y is wrong? So in this case, what weight is to be given to the fact that most people think that disconnecting the violinist is morally permissable, and what benefit is it to cite such a fact in the first place?\n \n \nThis fellow is responsible for being irresponsible, given he did not intend to shoot his friend. The scope of his irresponsibility is great, but he could not be charged with murder, nor is he morally a murderer.\n \n How about this scenario: A stunt calls for the stuntman to be shot at with blanks. There are other guns on the set with live rounds that look identical. The stuntman intellectually knows that there might be a mistake but thinks \"it won't happen to him\". Does he consent to be shot?\n\n In your first response, we can hold somebody responsible for something they did not consent to happening. No, we likely wouldn't charge him with murder, but we would likely charge him with manslaughter. This is a far cry from Thomson's argument as you have explained it, which says that we cannot expect the pregnant woman to endure any responsibility for her child regardless of the circumstances (excluding rape cases here).\n \n For your second response, he does not consent to being shot, nor does the person firing the gun consent to killing him. However, this does not seem to keep us from feeling that somebody ought to bear some responsibility for a potential foul up. Again, this is a far cry from Thomson's claim that we shouldn't expect a pregnant woman to bear any responsibility for her actions.\n \n \nThere is a distinction, but it does not change the morality. The person connected will die either way and either way they became connected to you without your knowledge or desire (unless you consented to be connected).\n\n Again, I think in most people's minds it does. Also, if you consent to being connected and then three months into the ordeal you change your mind, what are your obligations?\n \n \nI feel your pain, I had to work the day after :P\n\n Me too.

   "I am going to kinda summerize a few things here.\n \n Sigma,\n \n It seems that you believe the circumstances of of how the pregnancy happened or the health issue circumstances are irrelevant to you when it comes to this arguement. But all of these things are relevant to the issue of abortion and to ignore them in an arguement would be a strawman arguement in a way. Surely positions change based on circumstances and when ignored you could make an arguement for anything. But like I said, it is just a strawman in the end. For example, if you are aruging that Katie shouldn't have been hit by a car and your arguement is \"hitting people with cars is wrong because it hurts/kills them so therefore the driver that hit Katie is in the wrong\"...this doesn't logically follow because we don't know the circumstances in which Katie got hit by the car. Maybe she jumped in front of it, maybe she jumped from an overpass and the car hit her on the way down, etc. By ignoring how she got there you present a false case. Such is the same with the violionist arguement. By ignoring key important circumstances you create a false illusion of what abortion is. Since the whole arguement is a justifcation for abortion I feel that in order to present a fair arguement you need to have it account for all the circumstances directly involved in an abortion.(or atleast a specific one)\n \n And this is why this arguement fails",

The circumstances of the connection to the violinist seem to matter as does the circumstances surrounding the origin of a pregnancy.\n\n \n The argument does not care what the woman may have done short of consenting to being connected, the argument only concerns itself with the morality of disconnecting the violinist after he is connected. This is a valid objection to have however, and one I share. Whether this significantly affects how analogous the situations are in terms of morality is something we can pursue once we determine what is or is not analogous.\n \n \n\n The vast majority of people have opposite moral views of someone who desires to obtain an abortion because they were raped, and someone who desires to obtain an abortion because they have been irresponsible or some other similar scenario (choice of child's gender, for instance). I guess I should have asked this before, but do you think that most people believe this\n\n \n This is not a valid complaint. The argument is determining the morality of disconnecting someone who is connected to you, not the morality of aborting because of a choice in gender. Whatever the reason the woman has for disconnecting the violinist, the question is does she have a moral right to. Since the pro-life argument doesn't recognize any reason as valid (when sex is consensual), parsing reasons is not valid.\n \n \n\n I find thoughts to be somewhat confusing. I understand you believe there is no moral objectiveness. So then, what does it matter if a majority of people can agree on a certain moral scenario?

So in this case, what weight is to be given to the fact that most people think that disconnecting the violinist is morally permissable, and what benefit is it to cite such a fact in the first place?\n\n \n It's a rhetorical device to convince another party. I am trying to convince you of something by starting with common ground, something we can agree on. This is an ultimate failure since you disagree that one can disconnect the violinist in the first place, but you are the only one who is coherent enough to debate, it seems ;)\n \n The point of this, and analogies in general, is to start with something more solid or more sure and then move into more murky territory. The only weight it would assume is the weight the other party (in this case, you) give it. I'm not sure I answered your question.\n \n \n\n In your first response, we can hold somebody responsible for something they did not consent to happening. No, we likely wouldn't charge him with murder, but we would likely charge him with manslaughter. This is a far cry from Thomson's argument as you have explained it, which says that we cannot expect the pregnant woman to endure any responsibility for her child regardless of the circumstances (excluding rape cases here).\n\n \n I'm not sure this is the case. The Violinist argument only concerns itself with whether or not that responsibility extends to supporting the violinist for 9 months. I would argue that every person has a responsibility to save someone else if they are able, but this does not conflict at all with the Violinist argument since it does not ask if there is any responsibility, just the responsibility to save them when you are forced to have them connected for 9 months. Certainly the person in your scenario is responsible for his own irresponsibility, but that responsibility only extends so far since his intent was not to kill his friend. Not convicting him of murder is an expression of this, since without intent he is not fully responsible for the consequences. Intent changes the morality.\n \n \n\n For your second response, he does not consent to being shot, nor does the person firing the gun consent to killing him. However, this does not seem to keep us from feeling that somebody ought to bear some responsibility for a potential foul up. Again, this is a far cry from Thomson's claim that we shouldn't expect a pregnant woman to bear any responsibility for her actions.\n\n \n Would you agree that the actor firing the gun bears no responsibility for the death of the stuntman? There would be an investigation to make sure there was no criminal negligence or intent involved, but the actor could bear no responsibility even given he intellectually knew there was a chance (albeit a small one) the gun he held might hold live rounds. Only those who are emotionally invested, such as the wife of the stuntman, would place the blame on the actor firing the gun. Since we are removed from the situation, we can say that the actor bears little to no responsibility.\n \n There was a news story today that I heard. A girl was extremely allergic to peanuts and her boyfriend had eaten a peanut butter sandwich earlier in the day. After kissing, the girl went into shock and died. It would be similar to the scenario I posed. The boy could not be morally held accountable even though he is responsible, in a sense, for her death. There was no intent or desire on his part to harm her.\n \n The chances of this happening are very small, but of course the pro-life argument does not change when the chances of something happening do.\n \n \n\n Again, I think in most people's minds it does. Also, if you consent to being connected and then three months into the ordeal you change your mind, what are your obligations?\n\n \n If you consent to a time frame, you are morally obligated for that time frame. Legally I would say you should still be able to disconnect, but morally not.\n \n \n\n Me too. Mass consumerism for the loss.\n\n \n You got the bad end of the stick :(",

The claim is that one has a moral right to disconnect a violinist who is attached to you against your will in the manner described. The claim is not a strawman. Why someone would not want to be connected is irrelevant to the argument; in fact it is never brought up. This would apply to every situation because there is no limit on the claim made.

In your example, however, a third \"mugger\" is exerting influence on the situation, which causes it to not work as an analogy.\n\n \n Oliphant, you are laboring under a misconception, the same one Steve currently has and Cone had a few posts back. The argument does not apply solely to rape. It does not apply to sex at all. It applies to pregnancy. Look at the Violinist argument. No part of it applies to sex. Let me repeat myself: The Violinist argument at no time provides an analogy to sex, whether consensual or non-consensual. The analogy of being forced to be connected to the violinist is pregnancy, not sex. Whatever the woman did or did not do before the violinist was attached to her is not part of the argument. Pregnancy is non-consensual, because whether the sex was consensual or not, the woman cannot choose whether it results in pregnancy and the zygote never has a choice. This is true whether or not you believe \"consenting to sex is consenting to pregnancy\". Your example still forces the woman to be connected, just as the Violinist argument does.\n \n You make the implication that it is immoral to force a woman to be connected to another because you object to the Violinist example by saying I have a \"third party immoral act[or]\". I am very interested in your response. Is it immoral to connect the woman to someone else against the woman's will? Is there any situation where it would be moral to do so?\n \n \n\n First, I have not deviated from any argument, I posited my own separate from whoever you were arguing with at the time. Second, it is applicable because it proves why the violinist analogy is not.\n\n \n First off, this thread is about the Violinist argument. Second, you have not shown why this argument is not analogous. The objection you gave above was the result of a misconception. Thirdly, your example does not serve our moral intuitions as well as the Violinist argument. A magic park is not something one can empathize with.\n \n If you wish to show the Violinist is not analogous, making up your own is not the way to go. First, it would behoove you to state whether or not you agree with the claim of the argument as-is, that it is morally allowable for the woman to disconnect the violinist. You can assume a situation where the argument makes no distinction, such as assuming she was walking in a park where she knew there was a chance she would be kidnapped by a group that is trying to save violinists. The Violinist also claims that it is analogous to pregnancy. To show this to be invalid, you would have to state a difference, and this difference would have to be what allows one but disallows the other (if you believe the violinist could be morally disconnected). For example, if you cite the fact that the woman in the Violinist argument merely lies in bed for 9 months with no ill-effects, the fact that the pregnant woman does not have to lay in bed for 9 months would mean that abortion is not justified. It would further mean that if the pregnancy situation were the same as the situation of the violinist, abortion would be justified. Do you understand? \n \n For you it seems this third party is the difference that justifies one but not the other. Or perhaps the difference is that you believe the woman who is pregnant consented to being pregnant, and that difference justifies disconnecting the violinist but not the fetus. But of course I don't know if you believe one is justified, so I cannot make this assessment. Once we nail down what you believe the differences are that justify one but not the other, we can debate whether these differences actually are significant differences.\n \n \n\n Now, the reason that this \"magic charm\" point, which reduces the chances to a low number that is NOT zero, does not work is because it is self-fulfilling logic, as I said before. The type of people who will take the risk are those who believe that they are lucky enough to get away with it. Simply because their personality is a reckless one does not validate the consequences (allowing the violinist to die).\n\n \n That is opinion, one that the majority of people would not share. The majority of people would believe that the chances of something happening changes the morality, and the majority of people would believe one would not have to share their body against their will, even if they took a chance.\n \n I said effectively zero, not just zero.\n \n \n\n Which is precisely why I am arguing that it is NOT against their [a women's] will. This is why the original violinist argument does not work: it paints the picture of a person who just wakes up one day and, lo and behold, was, through no action of their own, attached to a violinist. However, as my argument shows, she does consent by taking the risk of \"walking in a park.\"\n\n \n Pregnancy will happen (or won't happen) without any urging or action on the part of the woman after she has sex even with perfect use of 2 or more birth control devices, which is what the Violinist paints. So the woman, as in the Violinist argument and as in pregnancy, can indeed wake up one day surprised that she is pregnant. There can be no expectation that it would have happened, and no desire for it to happen, no action on the part of the woman to encourage it and still have it occur. Like I said above, you have a misconception over what the Violinist argument actually says.\n \n Taking a risk does not equal consent, not does it disallow changing the consequences if one can.",

   "Steve, the argument doesn't fail at anything, it makes a claim. The claim is that one has a moral right to disconnect a violinist who is attached to you against your will in the manner described. The claim is not a strawman. Why someone would not want to be connected is irrelevant to the argument; in fact it is never brought up. This would apply to every situation because there is no limit on the claim made. This is not a strawman because there is no argument this is trying to defeat, it is simply stating a claim. You can disagree with the claim, but it is not a strawman. It states this is analogous to pregnancy and abortion, but this is not a strawman, this is another claim. I described to you the procedure in this sort of argument if you wished to show this is invalid.\n \n\n Yeah, it tries to make the claim that it is morally ok to disconnect the violionist (and thus compare to abortion). But it assumes its own conclusion is true when making the arguement. The argument goes \"you are connected to violionist...you don't want to be...since you don't morally have to be forced to support this person for 9 months it is morally ok to disconnect him.\" So the argument never really establishes why you are not morally obligated, it just says you are not. Even so, if the argument was made, it still can't be tied to abortion without the similiar circumstances, otherwise you are just comparing apples and oranges. \n \n \n\n The claim is that one would not be morally obligated, but she does not beg the question because she does not use that as justification for the claim. \n \n\n Sure it does. If you say \"no one would want to be plugged up to the violionist therefore it is ok to disconnect\" then you have begged the question. She appeals to different circumstances and thus creates a strawman also. When she talks about \"9 years or life\" supporting this violionist you appeal to something different then abortion. You are not in bed for 9 months, 9 years, or life. The timing and circumstances matter because the reason why someone wouldn't want to be plugged up to the violionst may or may not be for the reasons the author assumes. This is where the argument is flawed which is what I keep saying. If you asked 100 people whether they would like to be attached to a violionst in bed for 9 months or have a child (also 9 months lets assume) what do you think the 100 people will say (assuming they can't say neither but can say indifferent). It surely wouldn't be 100 people saying indifferent and the author assumes that to be true.\n \n \n \nWhen discussing abortion, yes, we assume the woman in question does not wish to remain pregnant. It is valid to assume the woman in question does not wish the violinist attached or at least mention, as this argument does, that the woman is not obligated to stay connected if she does not wish to be.\n Once again the two are too different to say \"just because you wouldn't want to be attached to the violionst means you abortion is ok\". It makes no sense. What if the person knew he had a chance at being connected to the violionist if he went over to his house and the person did it knowingly and then got connected. This would be more similiar and I think he would be obligated to stay connected to him. The argument doesn't make the case for why you wouldn't be obligated in this kind of scenario.\n \n \nIt is not morally ok to remove yourself because you don't want to be attached. The reason it is morally ok to remove yourself is not really addressed by the argument.\n Then what is the argument? You just admit here that she begs the question. She assumes these things to be true to reach her conclusion that you are morally ok to remove yourself. So its not really an argument with any merit..its just an opinion supported by nothing with a meaningless strawman analogy.\n \n \n \n \nIt was an example. If you believe the woman is justified in removing the violinist with the Violinist argument as-is, but do not believe the woman is justified in removing the fetus in the situation I described to you, you would have to show what the differences between those situations are and those differences would have to justify one but not the other.\n\n It is her argument, she is the one that is supposed to be relating the two and she didn't do this. The burden of proof is on the one making the argument, not the one countering it.",

The claim says \"The woman is not morally required to allow the violinist to remain attached to her\" or \"The woman is morally allowed to disconnect the violinist\", depending on how you want to look at it. It is not really saying \"The woman is not morally required because...\" or any such thing. It doesn't try to justify this belief at all because the author is assuming the reader would agree. It isn't assuming it's conclusion is true because it doesn't really have a conclusion. Remember, after she outlines the violinist situation she says \"I imagine you would regard this as outrageous, which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago\"\n \n \n\n Even so, if the argument was made, it still can't be tied to abortion without the similiar circumstances, otherwise you are just comparing apples and oranges.\n\n \n You are absolutely right here. We are trying to establish if the situations are analogous. \n \n \n\n Sure it does.

It surely wouldn't be 100 people saying indifferent and the author assumes that to be true.\n\n \n Actually, I think more people would be willing to have a violinist attached to them, were it as it was described in the Violinist argument. This just strengthens the case that one can disconnect in pregnancy, if the two situations are found to be analogous.\n \n I fail to see why the reasons the woman may want to be disconnected matter. Can she morally disconnect the violinist for some reasons but not others? Remember, there are no health issues, all the woman must do is lie in bed with no ill-effects. If it is morally ok to disconnect the reasons don't matter according to the argument.\n \n \n\n Once again the two are too different to say \"just because you wouldn't want to be attached to the violionst means you abortion is ok\". It makes no sense. What if the person knew he had a chance at being connected to the violionist if he went over to his house and the person did it knowingly and then got connected. This would be more similiar and I think he would be obligated to stay connected to him. The argument doesn't make the case for why you wouldn't be obligated in this kind of scenario.\n\n \n For the situations to be analogous, the person being attached cannot be a party to it. Otherwise you get into messy scenarios.\n \n So do you believe the scenario you posed? If you knew that a friend of yours is sick and was desperate enough to attack someone, attach himself to them and such, went over to his house and he attached himself to you that you would not be able to morally disconnect yourself from him?\n \n \n\n Then what is the argument?

So its not really an argument with any merit..its just an opinion supported by nothing with a meaningless strawman analogy.\n\n \n It is an opinion.
