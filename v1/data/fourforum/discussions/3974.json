   "Support Our Troops - Bring 'Em Home!\n \n The shooting of an unarmed, wounded Iraqi in a mosque accidentally recorded by an \"embedded\" reporter is extremely damaging to every American and indeed every American military man and woman. Remember that the Iraqis did not kill, rape, or torture our most famous prisoner of the Iraq War, Jessica Lynch. Injured from the wreck of her vehicle, she was well-treated by the Iraqis in a hospital by doctors and nurses!\n \n Why all the lies about \"liberating\" Iraq? The Iraqis see us not as liberators, but as foreign conquerors and occuppiers, as of course we are, all spin put aside.\n \n Recently, there has been repeated talk about how many of those among the \"insurgents\" are foreigners. Think of that, how dare these \"foreigners\" be in Iraq to oppose the occupation of their country? In reality, our best estimates are that less the 5 percent of the insurgents are from outside of Iraq, and most of them are from neighboring countries who came to aid Iraq just as many Americans would go to the aid of Canada if it were invaded.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=145\n \n \n A Letter from an American Soldier in Iraq\n \n First off, I am a patriotic American and no pacifist.

The attackers won't be in the ME, they'll be in the US.
