   "No secret that in Sweden, that is a EU member, some web-server hosts the renowned source of Chechen separatists Kavkaz Center.com. It is a real scandal that a European state hives a web service connected with global terrorism, saturated with xenophobia and antisemitism that was providing instructions to the recent unrest in France, Denmark and other EU states! Yet, that's not really it! Now separatists and terrorist of Chechnya and the lot of their so-to-say representatives and all that who open them up with opportunities to popularize terrorism, islamism and antisemism, are trying to drive a wedge between EU members. Thanx to them, Poland that was once too careless and incautious to accept Chechen refugees, is now growing into a whipping boy of the whole EU by efforts of moderators and owners of Kavkaz Center. The fact that Chechens happen to be the Problem #1 among other refugees in Europe, starts to be the fault of Poland that \"wasn't sensible enough to let them have sports halls, personal libraries and Chechen TV channels\"... How do you like this? I bet Europe must bless Poland for absorbing the Chechen wave. You should see what hot stuff these \"refugees\" are! Every second is a gangster, every third is a bandit - mature shahids! And this being so, they expect us improve their conditions!... Huh! If Swedish authorities are so tolerant towards Chechen terrorists that even let them have a server inland, why don't they receive a few hundreds of these cut-throats from Poland and accommodate them in some resorts and give them full worthy occupation (considered that Chechens are very fastidious) and endure their constant mass presence? That will be much better indeed than allowing Europeans form a negative image of Poland as a breading-ground of \"Chechen threat\"!",
