   "Defense Dept. Rejects Recognition of Same-Sex Partners of Education Personnel - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n The Defense Dept. has rejected a policy proposed last month to recognize the same-sex partners of gay teachers because it conflicts with DOMA, the Stars and Stripes reports:\n \n Dodea \"Stars and Stripes reported last month that the Department of Defense Education Activity and two teachers unions had signed off on giving same-sex teaching couples the same consideration as married heterosexual teaching couples when requesting joint transfers to new schools. The policy, which also extended the benefit to unmarried but committed straight couples, was disapproved during a routine DOD labor agreement review, according to the statement...The transfer benefit would have been a way to help gay teachers and would not have cost the Department of Defense or DODEA any additional money, said Xavier Flores, the Japan representative for the Federal Education Association, which signed the policy change with the Overseas Federation of Teachers in mid-January.\"",

I can't find it for the life of me.)\n\n \n Your disengenuity is noted. Here&#8217;s an example of a targeted liberal court. \n Nineth Circuit Court of Appeals, California.\n \n\n U.S. Supreme Court looks over 9th Circuit's shoulder\n This term, justices reversed, at least partially, 94% of the Western appeals court's rulings. Part of the reason, experts say, is the court is perceived as liberal and partial to the underdog.\n June 29, 2009|Carol J. Williams\n From prisoners' rights to environmental protection, laws set by the West's powerful appeals court were overturned in 15 of the 16 cases reviewed this term by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n The reversals affect a broad range of civil rights and business practices challenged in the nine states and two Pacific territories covered by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The justices shot down four rulings seen as protecting nature against industrial hazards and five cases asserting claims by convicts that their rights were abused.\n Judicial analysts attribute the high reversal rate at least partly to the 9th Circuit's reputation as a liberal-dominated bench, even though more recent conservative appointments have diluted that influence. Experts, including former law clerks, say the Supreme Court justices are more inclined to look over the shoulders of the 9th Circuit judges they suspect of favoring the underdog.\n The high court historically reverses the majority of all cases it reviews -- 76% so far this term, with three decisions still pending. Legal analysts say that's because they seek to correct what they see as erroneous interpretations by lower courts or to settle conflicting views among the circuits about a law's meaning.\n \"Pretty much all courts have a generally high reversal rate before the Supreme Court,\" said Adam Samaha, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. \"The justices have a practice of taking a case for purposes of changing what happened below.\"\n --\n Long-running trend\n But the 9th Circuit's record this term, with 94% of its cases reversed at least in part, extends a long-running trend of being disproportionately overturned. The 9th Circuit -- the only one in which a majority of judges were appointed by Democratic presidents -- has had a larger-than-average share of its cases overturned in eight of the last 10 years.\n \"It's true that the 9th Circuit is slightly more liberal, generally speaking, than the Supreme Court, and that probably accounts for the more frequent reversal rate the 9th Circuit has,\" said Jeffrey L. Fisher, who teaches at Stanford Law School. But he attributes the appeals court's dominance of the high court docket to the unique issues emanating from the diverse region it covers.\n \"A lot of important policy cases involving interesting and difficult questions come out of the 9th Circuit. The West is known for its experimentation, the initiative process -- things that bring constitutional questions to the fore more often,\" Fisher said.\n \n U.S. Supreme Court looks over 9th Circuit's shoulder - Los Angeles Times\n\n \n Got any other requests for proof, MrWrong?",

   " I live in California, and I follow the same-sex marriage news here avidly. And FYI...\n \n a) it was the VOTER-ELECTED LEGISLATURE here that initially approved same-sex marriage in this state, prevented only from becoming law by the now-wildly-unpopular El Gubernator--whose veto was then overturned by by our \"tattered\" (still waiting for evidence on that, JP) Supreme Court, which is what fired up OVERWHELMINGLY RELIGIOUS right-wing extremists to get Prop 8 on the ballot, and consequently for OUT-OF-STATE Mormons to practically bankrupt themselves pumping money into a fear-mongering propaganda-based campaign. (That what you meant by \"legitimate\" means?)\n \n\n \n \n The people spoke. They don't want illicit, gay sex marriage in Californication. Neither does God want it.",

   "The people spoke. They don't want illicit, gay sex marriage in Californication. Neither does God want it.\n\n \n Oh shut up! Your side filled the airwaves with relentless ads portraying Gays as a threat to families, a threat to children, and a threat to anything good and wholesome in this country!\n \n It was akin to the Nazi's propaganda against the Jews in my book. Not on that level of severity, but with the same undertones. Blame the Gays.\n \n 54% does not constitute a majority of voters Easy because that is what it came down to. 54%. \n \n The same bigoted prejudice was spewed by Anita Bryant in the 70's where Harvey Milk stood against such injustice, fought, and won to keep gays job's from being ripped away from them....\n \n And it is comforting to know that in your baked out head you can still hear the mind of God inside..........emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Let's be real here. Your son isn't the product of gay parents. He's the product of straight parents. \n\n \n Now those are fighting words. You know good and well that getting laid hardly makes you a parent. My son's biologial father was good for his sperm and nothing else - and I certainly did not need to make the fool mistake of marrying the man to aquire that. His contribution to my son ended with genetics. The fact that my son will grow into productive, tax-paying member of society is the result of a single woman and a gay man and has nothing to do with marriage.\n \n \nBut I did. You just didn't accept the answer. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/391853-post17.html\n\n \n No, you told me how being a good parent is beneficial - and I have no argument with that. But one does not need marriage (or heterosexuality) to acheive this. Now answer the question, HOW IS YOUR MARRIAGE A BENEFIT TO ME?",
