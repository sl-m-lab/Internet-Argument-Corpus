   "An interesting op-ed comparing Reagan and Obama on gay-related issues. There are couple of posters here who always get all bent out of shape when someone dares suggest conservatives haven't been as bad to gays as some liberals would suggest. Nevertheless, some might enjoy reading it even if you don't agree with everything. (or if you do.) [Ostrich-head-sand alert: written by an unabashed self-proclaimed conservative; so if you're unable to stand hearing a different viewpoint than spoonfed Matthews, Maddow or Moyers, better change the channel. emoticon_xangel emoticon_xgood]\n \n Why Reagan Was a Better Friend to Gays Than Obama\n by John T. Simpson\n \n I really thought my Republican platform piece here at BH would have been my last for awhile. Plenty for readers of all stripes to chew on. And I got too many other things to do. The reason for my reluctant return is yet another critical issue the Obamamedia and our LibDem government are completely flat-lining on: the officially sanctioned exterminations of LGBTs in Iraq, and on our dime. Not to mention State&#8217;s cold and lame response. More on that later. Too much more, actually.\n \n First, the one of the main points of this fact-based opinion piece. And I know I&#8217;m going to catch hell from the Streisand and Brolin crowd on this one! Ronald Reagan was a hero to gays, and Obama has not been to date. I know, I know. The Evil Ronald Reagan, who practically invented AIDS? Reagan, the Adolf Eichmann of the Gay World? Not true. Not by a country mile!\n \n In fact, Ronald Reagan was a better friend to gays and lesbians in his age than Barack Obama has been to gays in his. But don&#8217;t even go by what I say. I&#8217;m a right wing extremist, and very biased to what I believe. I admit it. Who isn&#8217;t these days? The press? LOL! But here are some irrefutable facts on The One and The Gipper I thought I&#8217;d throw out there. A gay buffet for thought, if you will. With swimming pools. And movie stars.\n \n You may not know this, but like former presidential candidate Barack Obama, then-candidate Ronald Reagan faced a polarizing gay-related California ballot referendum of his own in 1978. It was called the Briggs Initiative, better known as Prop 6, and would have banned all gays and lesbians from teaching in California schools.\n \n This, in an America not nearly as tolerant of homosexuals or gay issues back then as now. Just ask &#8216;em. I remember. I read the far left Boston Phoenix. It was free, why not? And I knew ### haters. Too many, actually. But I digress. Back to 1978 California, presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, gays and the Briggs Initiative, better known as Prop 6.\n \n As Prop 6 appeared to be gaining steam as the vote neared, with State Senator John Briggs stoking fears of gay teachers in the classroom with the full backing of California&#8217;s right wing, gays and lesbians were terrified that Prop 6 might actually become law. In their darkest hour, they turned to a most unlikely hero and savior: former California governor and conservative Republican Ronald Reagan, then gearing up for his 1980 presidential run.\n \n After hearing the group&#8217;s concerns, candidate Reagan not only agreed with them, but became the bill&#8217;s most public detractor, even penning a scathing op-ed against it in the now-defunct Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, in which he said the following:\n  &#8220;Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual&#8217;s sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child&#8217;s teachers do not really influence this.&#8221;\n Ronnie also stated that the same laws regarding the safety of schoolchildren applied to ALL teachers in the state. How&#8217;s THAT for progressive thinking from a conservative Republican, in an America not eight years removed from the Stonewall Riots? With former two-time Governor Reagan&#8217;s stern and vocal opposition, Prop 6 lost by a million votes. And John Briggs lost his race for governor in the primaries.\n \n In taking the bold stand he did, candidate Reagan completely alienated the right wing in California, which blamed him for both the Prop 6 defeat and John Briggs&#8217; primary loss. It was an act of political courage on Reagan&#8217;s part that might not only have cost him electoral vote-rich California, but the Presidency itself.\n \n As it turned out, Ronald Reagan took California by a handy seventeen points in his 1980 landslide pummeling of Jimmy Carter, sending the President back to his peanut farm in Georgia (if only he had stayed there). And you can bet a lot of grateful gays and lesbians remembered Ronnie&#8217;s championing their cause, and pulled the lever for The Gipper. But despite all that, Ronald Reagan was a conservative of his time. Tolerance did not mean acceptance.\n \n Again, from the Independent Gay Forum:\n  Reagan: &#8220;My criticism is that [the gay movement] isn&#8217;t just asking for civil rights; it&#8217;s asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can I.&#8221;\n \n Aside from his tolerant personal attitude, Reagan&#8217;s actual record on civil liberties for gays was surprisingly good. Cannon reports that Reagan was &#8220;repelled by the aggressive public crusades against homosexual life styles which became a staple of right wing politics in the late 1970s.\n Though liberals may harangue Ronald Reagan as I&#8217;ve indicated, the fact remains. When gays and lesbians desperately needed him as they faced REAL institutionalized homophobia, Ronald Reagan was there for them, and in a major way that turned the tide completely in their favor. In fact, the openly gay Log Cabin Republicans were spawned from this huge political victory.\n \n Now let us move on to candidate Barack Obama and his wishy-washy stand on Prop 8, the gay California ballot referendum of his time:\n  &#8220;I&#8217;ve stated my opposition to this. I think [Prop 8 is] unnecessary. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that&#8217;s not what America&#8217;s about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don&#8217;t contract them.&#8221;\n The main point that seemed to escape candidate Obama at this time was that they WERE playing around with the California Constitution. I believe candidate Obama missed an opportunity here to take a bold stand on gay issues like Reagan did, and speak out against Prop 8 from the liberal Democrat POV. He was, and is, a very charming and charismatic candidate and President. No denying that. He could have used that charisma and charm to sway many minds over, and with a very simple statement that could have swung the Prop 8 vote the 3 points it needed to pass.\n \n Example:\n  &#8220;Though I myself oppose gay marriage, I cannot let this Constitutional ban go unchallenged. Amendments that restrict rights instead of expanding them are un-American. Therefore, I oppose the passage of Proposition 8, and I hope you will, too. I will further state that I only support this measure as civil procedure.\n \n &#8220;Churches and individuals that are morally opposed to gay marriage should not be compelled under legal threat or duress to participate. That is their right under freedom of religion. I would no more want gays invading the rights of churches, than I would want churches invading the rights of gays.&#8221;\n But, no. What we got was candidate Obama wetting his finger and sticking it in the air. Just like Bill Clinton with his poll-driven morality, trying to have it both ways. Not much Hope For Change there with regard to Democratic presidents, it would seem. Even in office, the Obama Administration has been wishy-washy on pushing gay issues like Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell. But I don&#8217;t really care about that. Obama and gay advocates can hammer out DADT, among many other issues.\n \n But even as a straight man, I am VERY concerned about the officially-sanctioned extermination of LGBTs in Iraq on our dime, what I now call the Gay Holocaust in Iraq. What else do you call a specifically targeted pogrom, with the express goal of exterminating a segment of the population? If this were merely a death squad issue, that would be matter for the Iraqi government.\n \n Unfortunately, the Iraqi government is neck-deep in the gay butchery themselves. Interior Ministry police hunt down gays in Baghdad, raid parties, hunt them online by using fake foreign IP addresses (as Iran does), then tortures and exterminates them in the worst possible ways. Just as Iraqi Spiritual Leader Ali al-Sistani declared they should be, in his 2006 fatwa of death against Iraqi LGBTs. Though removed from his website after controversy, the fatwa is still in full effect.\n \n Allow me at this point to question the spirituality of a religious leader favoring any pogrom, or stating that ANYONE should die in the &#8216;worst possible ways&#8217;.\n \n Here is one former Mahdi Army member who now makes a career of being a gay death squad &#8217;surgeon,&#8217; cutting out the cancer of homosexuality the Americans brought with them to Iraq. His words, not mine. Also, one particularly subhuman technique of killing gays, now quite popular with Iraq&#8217;s most pious Shiite extremists, is to super-glue a gay man&#8217;s anus shut, pump him full of a diarrhea-inducing compound, and have a few laughs as the victim suffers unbelievable agony before dying. The Iraqi tribes also now have carte blanche to exterminate any Iraqi LGBTs they find.\n \n Unfortunately, this Gay Holocaust of Iraqi LGBTs, which has already claimed nearly 500 innocent lives in the most gruesome of ways since the 2003 invasion, and is now ramping up in violence and horror by the day, enjoys wide public support in Islamic Iraq. Just take a look at this recent report, also from Common Ills:\n This morning AFP is reporting that signs are going up around the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad threatening to kill a list of people alleged to be gay. The posters are put out by the Brigades of the Righteous and AFP translates the posters as stating, &#8220;We will punish you, perverts&#8221; and &#8220;We will get you, puppies&#8221; has been scrawled on some posters &#8212; &#8220;puppies&#8221; being slang for gay males in Iraq. The Australian carries the AFP report here. These posters are going up around Sadr City. Where is the United Nations condemnation? Where is the White House, where is the US State Dept?\n Very good questions, to which you may not like the answers. I know I don&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s State&#8217;s response to this worsening gay horrorshow in Iraq, again from the Common Ills blog:\n  Noel Clay, a State Department spokesperson, said U.S. officials &#8220;condemn the persecution of LGBTs in Iraq,&#8221; but he couldn&#8217;t confirm whether the violence they&#8217;re facing in Iraq is because of their sexual orientation. Clay noted that while homosexuality is against the law in Iraq, the death penalty is not the punishment for homosexual acts.\n Now I don&#8217;t know who Noel Clay is, but I do now know that Inspector Clouseau is Einstein by comparison. I&#8217;m finding too much evidence. I don&#8217;t even have to look! How dangerously stupid is Noel Clay, to be in that lofty position as State and be so ignorant of the facts? Is he just stupid? Or worse, is it willful ignorance?\n \n To be fair, this gay horrorshow started on President Bush&#8217;s watch. He should have done far more to nip it in the bud in 2006 after Sistani&#8217;s fatwa. In my mind, that will remain a black mark on his record. He should have put a stop to it, instead of letting it fester to the point it is today. All that said, this issue is now fully the Obama Administration&#8217;s and Congress&#8217; problem lock, stock and barrel.\n \n So where is President Obama? Secretary Clinton? Madame SOS said she would stand with ALL the Iraqi people! Where is she on this issue, so near and dear to gay hearts? Nothing on State&#8217;s main or Iraq pages. Even Queerty, a major gay blog, is slamming Hillary on this issue. How bad is that? Where is our Gay Rights Hero President on our American tax dollars subsidizing a Gay Holocaust?\n \n What are we fighting for there? Freedom? What are we defending Iraq from? Islamist extremism? Starting to look like a lost war to me! And I supported President Bush every step of the way on this war, even when he was getting hammered for it by everyone! I believed the Iraqi people deserved a shot. For the first time in six years, I&#8217;m not so sure anymore.\n \n I look at it this way. Either the Iraqi government and people can put a stop to this Auschwitz-like Gay Holocaust in Iraq, or I say withdraw and let Al Qaeda in Iraq take over. Certainly wouldn&#8217;t make life any worse for Iraqi LGBTs. And they can ALL share in the terror they enjoy so much! Hell, I&#8217;d even be willing to help and support Al Qaeda do just that! But only this once. You know. Like a Christmas armistice. Wouldn&#8217;t be the first time we helped Al Qaeda fight terror.\n \n A brilliant strategy on fighting the war on state-sponsored Islamist terror too, if you think about it. Not only would Iran lose its considerable Iraqi Shiite power base, a supreme Sunni Al Qaeda in Iraq would be a mortal foe, and would no doubt be plotting 9/11s for Tehran and elsewhere in the Islamic Republic. As a bonus, Iraq Shiite extremists like the &#8217;surgeon&#8217; and all his gay-butchering Islamist Nazi pals would be the first to be hunted down and exterminated by a supreme Al Qaeda in Iraq. They could ALL enjoy some open-air surgery and super-glue enemas!\n \n How Joker-like blackly comic great would THAT be?\n \n Considering Iran has now seemed to have successfully exported their own Gay Holocaust to Iraq, how Joker-like great would all that be, too! I say let a Sunni extremist Iraq and Shiite extremist Iran turn each others&#8217; nations into bombed-out wastelands of terror. And without the loss of one American life or dime. It&#8217;s one idea, anyway. Another hor d&#8217;ouevre for thought. And it couldn&#8217;t happen to nicer guys. Unless, of course, the Iraqi people decide to refrain from their most-popular anti-gay pogrom and join the civilized. Otherwise, I see no point in defending them any longer.\n \n It sure would be nice to see others speaking out against this taxpayer-funded gay horrorshow in Iraq. Like our Gay Hero President, for example. Knowing Ronnie as I do, I&#8217;m sure he wouldn&#8217;t stand for this kind of abomination in any nation being rebuilt with American taxpayer dollars, or protected by American soldiers.\n \n Congress, State and The White House really need to hear about this LGBT horrorshow in Iraq, loudly and repeatedly. Short of war, there&#8217;s nothing we can do about Iran&#8217;s Himmler-like extermination of gays. War works for me, though. But Iraq is ours. We broke it, we fix it. And you could not have much more severe of a breakage in Iraq than a Gay Holocaust. This is 100% Obama&#8217;s and the current government&#8217;s problem now. Those gay anal super-glueings started on their watch.\n \n Time to stop it. Like right now.\n \n Also, since Hollywood pretty much propelled Obama into office, why don&#8217;t you get on the horn to the gay and human rights chumps at AMPAS? See if they can give their best bud and Gay Rights Hero Obamamessiah a shoutout. Then again, considering AMPAS&#8217; and Hollywood&#8217;s own deafening silence on Roxana Saberi and Iran&#8217;s Gay Holocaust, maybe we&#8217;d better wait until the next Oscars for them to champion &#8220;gay rights for everyone&#8221; again, like Penn and Black so tearfully pleaded for.\n \n That stuff looks SO good on TV, doesn&#8217;t it? Just like President Obama and his so-called championing of gay rights, which appears to be totally MIA on EVERY gay rights issue. Hell, I&#8217;m a Reagan Republican, and I have a better record on this issue than all of them combined! I don&#8217;t care that they&#8217;re gay! They&#8217;re innocent human beings, and they&#8217;re being horribly tortured and brutally exterminated! Do you have to be Jewish to be totally repulsed by Auschwitz?\n \n Based on Reagan&#8217;s record, I believe The Gipper would have put a stop to that shite and ordered American troops to hunt down the death squads, as American GIs once hunted down the SS &#8216;werewolves&#8217; in postwar Berlin. I also believe he would have pummeled al-Maliki&#8217;s Shiite government over the issue as well. Which only makes the silence by the Obama Administration and Congress on this issue more profoundly deafening. O Gay Rights Hero President, where ARE you?\n \n Oh and if any of you ObamaBots believe anything I&#8217;ve said here is fantastic or untrue, look it up yourselves. I&#8217;m tired of spending hours researching and linking stuff I already know inside out. Plenty out there on all this gay horrorshow stuff, in both Iran and Iraq. Too much, actually. The Internet&#8217;s glutted with it! You just have to look. And not the other way, as even the Invisible Press seems content to. Look at how few in the MSM are reporting on this abomination. Gay blogs, mostly, along with the BBC and some S.F. TV affiliates.\n \n The rest I leave to you. And our Gay Hero President and Congressional gay rights champs. Ya, As if. Too busy saying Israel needs a tougher line. Um, excuse me?\n \n ######n, I miss Ronald Reagan. He stood up even for those he totally disagreed with. This bunch won&#8217;t even stand up for those they profess to champion! I guess that part I must leave to you, Dear Readers. Won&#8217;t you speak up for those who can&#8217;t, to those who should be and aren&#8217;t?\n \n Do it for Ronnie! This is the ULTIMATE in taxpayer issues!\n \n And somebody wake up Perez Hilton. Bigger problem here than Miss California, methinks. See if she can&#8217;t get the Prop 8 crowd as rabid on the horrific slaughter of Iraqi and Iranian gays as they are with the Mormon Church and us! I&#8217;ve sent him a dozen emails on this stuff. Crickets! My Gay Hero.\n \n And just to show I&#8217;m not partisan or picking on Perez here (which is just too easy to do), the Log Cabin Republicans linked above need a shoutout, too. I&#8217;ve been cc&#8217;ing them on all my Perez Hilton emails. None too pleased with their response, either. Time to step it up. Hell, they&#8217;re the gays here! Why do I and only a handful of REAL gay advocates have to be the ones screaming to the skies about all this gay horrorshow stuff?\n \n Hmm. Interesting question, indeed.\n \n (http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jtsimpson/2009/05/08/why-reagan-was-a-better-friend-to-gays-than-obama/ )",

   "I really thought my Republican platform piece here at BH would have been my last for awhile.\n\n I can't help but think this is one of the items the article GLARINGLY overlooked.\n The PLATFORMS of these people and the party they ran on.\n Republican platforms typically have a few anti-gay equality / tolerance measures included.\n Democrat platforms are more accepting.\n \n But the author doesn't even bring this up in his candy-coating of the Republican stance, trying to doll up Reagan in gay drag while ignoring what Reagan's REAL criticism was truly about...\n \n \n \nYou may not know this, but like former presidential candidate Barack Obama, then-candidate Ronald Reagan faced a polarizing gay-related California ballot referendum of his own in 1978. It was called the Briggs Initiative, better known as Prop 6, and would have banned all gays and lesbians from teaching in California schools.\n\n Yes, yes.\n That was an incredible affront to gays.\n Yet, let's not lose perspective on this.\n \n The author of this article wants to paint Reagan as some gay saint, but the truth of the matter is that THIS REFERENDUM was a no-brainer.\n If Reagan HAD supported the referendum, that would have been vile and thoroughly condemnable.\n So, the fact that he didn't somehow makes him the good guy???\n I don't think so.\n \n Reagan didn't choose the abominable path, and for that he should get credit.\n The credit TO WHICH IS DUE.\n Suppose you have somebody who recognizes that internment camps for Jews is wrong. Does that automatically make him a Jewish hero?\n NO! It means he recognized a WRONG decision and didn't choose it.\n What we essentially have here is trying to paint Reagan as a hero for the moral equivalent of NOT STEALING.\n It means Reagan didn't support the side of evil oppression.\n That's not the same thing as doing a laudable good, like giving a significant chunk of money to charity.\n There is a difference between choosing to NOT do something vile, and choosing to do something GOOD.\n \n \n \nIn taking the bold stand he did, candidate Reagan completely alienated the right wing in California, which blamed him for both the Prop 6 defeat and John Briggs' primary loss. It was an act of political courage on Reagan's part that might not only have cost him electoral vote-rich California, but the Presidency itself.\n\n The author has a flare for dramatic exaggeration to absurd extremes.\n If Reagan supposedly did alienate California Republicans, then WHY did 80% of the Republicans vote for him in the Californian Republican primary???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n The author exaggerates Reagan's opposition, and the author exaggerates Reagan's risk.\n \n \n \nReagan: \"My criticism is that [the gay movement] isn't just asking for civil rights; it's asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can I.\"\n Aside from his tolerant personal attitude, Reagan's actual record on civil liberties for gays was surprisingly good. Cannon reports that Reagan was \"repelled by the aggressive public crusades against homosexual life styles which became a staple of right wing politics in the late 1970s.\n\n Quite frankly \"asking for recognition\" is part of the \"code\" whereby some people denigrate the fight for gay and lesbian EQUALITY as something other than what it is.\n The funny part of all this is that it WAS the 80's. Gay sex was STILL ILLEGAL in a LOT of states. We were fighting AGAINST legislation that was designed to discriminate against us, not FOR legislation that was designed to protect us from discrimination.\n \n \n \nThough liberals may harangue Ronald Reagan as I've indicated, the fact remains. When gays and lesbians desperately needed him as they faced REAL institutionalized homophobia, Ronald Reagan was there for them, and in a major way that turned the tide completely in their favor.\n\n This is absolutely pathetic Reagan worshipping.\n There is NO SIGN of important Reagan contribution against Prop 6.\n The truth is that GAYS fought against Prop 6, and THAT is why it was rejected.\n \n A Reagan \"editorial\" is quoted, but LOOK at what is quoted!\n There is no scathing indictment of the legislation as the evil that it was.\n Instead, Reagan safely repeats \"scientific opinion\" (yeah, he called it \"opinion\") that gay was something that people were at an early age and not \"caused\" to become.\n That is not a \"scathing\" indictment of anything. The author could not even quote an IMPORTANT part of the editorial which shows Reagan blasting away at the legislation for what it was. Vile Oppression.\n \n \n \nNow let us move on to candidate Barack Obama and his wishy-washy stand on Prop 8, the gay California ballot referendum of his time: \"I've stated my opposition to this. I think [Prop 8 is] unnecessary. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them.\"The main point that seemed to escape candidate Obama at this time was that they WERE playing around with the California Constitution. I believe candidate Obama missed an opportunity here to take a bold stand on gay issues like Reagan did, and speak out against Prop 8 from the liberal Democrat POV.\n\n Trying to compare Prop 6 to gay marriage support is like comparing a mole-hill to a mountain.\n To be even-handed in this would be to compare a PROP 6 rejection with a PROP 6 rejection.\n And you can bet dollars to donuts that Obama would be a LOT more vocal on an issue like \"Prop 6\" than Reagan's editorial side-comments...\n \n \n \n \"Though I myself oppose gay marriage, I cannot let this Constitutional ban go unchallenged. Amendments that restrict rights instead of expanding them are un-American. Therefore, I oppose the passage of Proposition 8, and I hope you will, too. I will further state that I only support this measure as civil procedure.\n \"Churches and individuals that are morally opposed to gay marriage should not be compelled under legal threat or duress to participate. That is their right under freedom of religion. I would no more want gays invading the rights of churches, than I would want churches invading the rights of gays.\"\n \n\n Let's not kid ourselves.\n Obama DID come out against Prop 8. Unequivocally.\n You can see it in his words there, unlike \"Reagan's\" editorial whereby the best the author can do is quote the scientific facts and call it \"opinion\".\n \n \n \nBut even as a straight man, I am VERY concerned about the officially-sanctioned extermination of LGBTs in Iraq on our dime, what I now call the Gay Holocaust in Iraq.\n\n \"officially sanctioned extermination\"???\n The funny thing is Jyoshu has questioned the validity of these reports, and here he quotes an author condemning Obama on the issue...\n A bit of hypocrisy, eh?\n \n Hey JYOSHU.\n I take it that by posting this article, you are revoking any possibility of questioning the validity of the reports on attacks on gays in the Middle East?\n \n Nah. I don't expect an honest response...\n \n With that said, what's going on in Iraq is awful. But to say it is government sanctioned is absurd. The articles show it is RELIGIOUSLY motivated, carried out by the militia.\n \n \n \nUnfortunately, this Gay Holocaust of Iraqi LGBTs, which has already claimed nearly 500 innocent lives in the most gruesome of ways since the 2003 invasion, and is now ramping up in violence and horror by the day, enjoys wide public support in Islamic Iraq.\n\n Where the heck does the \"nearly 500 innocent lives\" come from?\n And \"since the 2003 invasion\"?????\n \n The article gives no justification for these number claims.\n \n Furthermore, let's compare APPLES to APPLES here.\n Gays being killed \"since the 2003 invasion\" stretches into BUSH'S presidency.\n Where was Bush's action on this???\n \n And gays being killed in the Middle East IS NOT NEW. Killing gays isn't some new law that was recently dreamed up...\n It occurred under Reagan as well.\n Where is the condemnation for his lack of action?\n \n \n \n Noel Clay, a State Department spokesperson, said U.S. officials \"condemn the persecution of LGBTs in Iraq,\" but he couldn't confirm whether the violence they're facing in Iraq is because of their sexual orientation. Clay noted that while homosexuality is against the law in Iraq, the death penalty is not the punishment for homosexual acts.\n\n Quite frankly, this is yet another example demonstrating how it is NOT THE GOVERNMENT that is taking action here.\n This author takes WAYYY too many liberties with the truth.\n \n \n \nTo be fair, this gay horrorshow started on President Bush's watch. He should have done far more to nip it in the bud in 2006 after Sistani's fatwa. In my mind, that will remain a black mark on his record.\n\n Oh wow. So he admits it.\n Now how about a similar question for REAGAN???\n \n \n \nSo where is President Obama? Secretary Clinton? Madame SOS said she would stand with ALL the Iraqi people! Where is she on this issue, so near and dear to gay hearts?\n\n I agree something should be done.\n But what?\n \n The author claims \"500 deaths\", which I guess is the number Jyoshu will now embrace? ( emoticon_emb )\n Just kidding. Of course I don't expect Jyoshu to do that... emoticon_frazzled\n \n But regardless, let's strip the \"gay\" away from this issue and say that they are killing \"group X\".\n What's the ratio between action and U.S. reaction?\n Saddam had ethnic cleansing in his country numbering in the THOUSANDS, and the U.S. essentially did little.\n I agree that what is going on in Iraq is awful, but to instantly condemn Obama for it is missing context here. We DO NOT EVEN KNOW what has or has not been done, as the first step would probably be quiet overtures to the country on the subject, underneath the public radar.\n \n \n \nWhat are we fighting for there?\n\n Don't get me started on that.\n Bush's \"war\" in Iraq is one of the reasons Republicans are in the crapper these days.\n \n \n \nI believed the Iraqi people deserved a shot. For the first time in six years, I'm not so sure anymore.\n\n The author is FINALLY waking up to that???\n Better late than never.\n A friend was telling me about a book the other day about a spectrum in governments between \"dictatorship\" and \"pure democracy\".\n The book hypothesized that in a lot of cases, the people get the government they can handle. I think Iraq WAS a prime example, and while Saddam was incredibly bad, he did \"keep the trains running on time\".\n Look at the U.S. track record. We get involved against Iran, backing Iraq and we get Saddam. We get involved against Russia in Afghanistan and we get Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.\n Iraq is the latest problem that will blow up in our face there.\n \n \n \nI look at it this way. Either the Iraqi government and people can put a stop to this Auschwitz-like Gay Holocaust in Iraq, or I say withdraw and let Al Qaeda in Iraq take over.\n\n That has got to be one of the STUPIDEST things this author has said.\n Every evidence points to a RELIGIOUSLY LEAD gay killing, and now this author wants the religious ZEALOTS instead???\n \n Jyoshu, you really picked a winner with this article... emoticon_xagree\n \n ====================================================\n \n Yeah. And predictably this author COMPLETELY IGNORES the real arguments on the table.\n One of the reasons Reagan is criticized was for his SLOW REACTION to \"GRID\".\n When it was a GAY disease, Reagan dragged his feet and didn't even mention it until VERY late in the disease presence game...\n \n And as for Obama, WHY is there no mention of the Obama platform regarding gays?\n Obama is going to sign ENDA. Obama has taken a tough stance on gays in the military. HATE Crime legislation.\n \n The author gives NO mention of that at all.\n Obama has been in office over 100 days (not by much), and this author is giving HARD blame for something he describes as \"500 LGBT deaths since 2003\".\n A casual side-comment on shaking a fist at Bush, but NOWHERE NEAR the paragraphs of vitriol against him... emoticon_emb",

Don't you check before raging? \n\n Are you actually addressing what I wrote?\n I questioned the source of your *500 LGBT deaths since 2003* due to the \"Gay Holocaust of Iraqi LGBTs\".\n I did look in your article. I saw no substantiation for where you got these numbers.\n \n \n \n2. Obama \"took a tough stand on gays in the military.\" DADT, you mean? Ya, right! As if. LOL! That's why his own NYT slammed him for gay rights issues yesterday. Not FOX, FI.

I have seen some people be IMPATIENT when the truth is that he just finished his first 100 days, and he's got much more pressing issues to deal with.\n Like the ECONOMY.\n \n DADT is something he should deal with, but people complaining now are the equivalent of the kid kicking the back of the seat saying \"are we there yet\" after the car just pulled out of the starting drive-way...\n \n \n \n3. I didn't say Reagan was a gay saint. He only tolerated gays. But he stood up for them when they needed him.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n You give ONE issue, with ONE editorial, quoting a measly two sentences from that editorial.\n That is hardly \"standing up\" for gays when we needed him...\n And if you want a REAL way he should have stood up for us?\n AIDS!\n \n But your article was an attempt to bash Obama and praise Reagan, so you picked and chose your context.\n \n LOOK at today's government and how it gets AHEAD OF THE ISSUE with swine flu.\n NOW THINK back to AIDS, and think about how many gay people died before the government even really acknowledged it existed???\n \n \n \nWhere was Obama on Prop 8? Flip-Flop!\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n The first quote you gave shows Obama is AGAINST amending the constitution for banning gay marriage. (Hint: That's what Prop 8 WAS)\n The second quote you gave shows Obama saying he opposes Prop 8.\n \n I don't know about you, but that is CONSISTENCY! emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nThat's linked, too. He wafflled. Fact. Said he'd support same-sex marriage in 1996, and would protest any attempts to ban it. Did he last year? Uhmm... \n\n Yeah.\n And what was Reagan's stance on gay marriage?\n \n Like I said, you try to praise Reagan and bash Obama, but fail to admit Obama is going to do more to further our cause than Reagan even wanted to consider doing.\n Being tied to an editorial that states the scientific evaluation (which he had the gall to call \"opinion\") is nothing.\n Granting equal rights protection? THAT will be something.\n \n \n \nThe rest of your stuff is just off.\n\n Meh!\n I guess I should have said that about your whole piece, and not bothered wasting my time with it.\n You're obviously not prepared to discuss my comments...\n \n \n \nBut I can see I struck a major nerve. That's great! Was meant to. Comments are skyrocketing, and the Big Hollywood Team loves the business! So I get to write at least one more there. I'm BH's Howard Beale, see?\n\n Yeah. I \"see\".\n Some people write the controversial over what is real or accurate, cause it's designed to annoy people and garner interest.\n Kind of like Howard Stern, who isn't note-worthy in a real way other than being vulgar and saying things to annoy.\n \n \n \nAs to the validity of my reports, if Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, The BBC, major gay blogs and many other major news outlets don't work for ya, I can't help you.\n\n emoticon_ic\n Wow. That's quite the trick.\n You invoke all those names, but where did I ACTUALLY QUESTION what THEY said???\n That's quite a sleazy trick you tried to pull just there.\n My bone of contention was in your misrepresentation. If you have the cajones to actually ADDRESS what I said, go for it.\n Somehow, I can see you're not interested... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nClinton let Rwanda rage on. Will Obama allow this crime against humanity to rage on his watch, too? \n\n Rwanda.\n How many deaths did Rwanda have?\n Statistics on Rwanda | Rwandan History | Resources | Survivors Fund\n Shows 800,000 to 1 million deaths for 100 days, with 250,000 and 500,000 women being raped.\n \n Now compare that to the Iraq situation with your numbers (you gave no source for the numbers I could see) giving 500 deaths since 2003.\n emoticon_angry\n \n You're talking about a mountain and a mole-hill. I agree Obama should do something about Iraq, but the SCALE of the issue is ridiculously small compared to other things in our lives.\n \n \n \nJust like he is Darfur? If you don't believe me, ask Mia Farrow. She's on a 21-day hunger strike over Darfur. What's he doing to stop it? \n\n Ahh yes. The last bastion of the desparate.\n I ask you to substantiate your numbers on Iraq, and you try to change the subject to Darfur...\n Perhaps he'll take Bush's course of action on Darfur.\n If I looked, would I find equally scathing commentary skewing Bush on the issue for HIS \"action\" on the issue while he was President?\n \n \n \nSorry, Bush is watching Ranger games in Texas. It's all in Obama's court now, guys.\n\n Yes. It is.\n But the issue (which I'm not surprised you don't recognize or refuse to admit) is intellectual honesty and a lack of hypocrisy.\n Too often, detractors of Democrats show INCREDIBLE hypocrisy in demanding one thing from the Democrat, but giving their own guy a pass when it comes to the same issue.\n \n \n \nDon't you care enough about innocent human beings slaughtered on our dime in Iraq, and the violence ramping up as we speak? I'd be hammering McCain just as much if he were ignoring it!\n Okay, well, maybe not as much.\n\n And there you have it. emoticon_xgood\n Admitting the hypocrisy!\n \n \n \nBut McCain didn't don the mantle of Gay Rights Hero. Obama's President now. Name one gay issue he's addressed. DADT? What about gay marriages becoming legal in Maine? No big cheer? Not a peep! \n\n Just passed his first 100 days in office, and people like you are jumping up and down that he hasn't done EVERYTHING yet... emoticon_xdonno\n IMO, the economy is MUCH more important.\n I see no reason why Obama should comment on every single state out there. It's pointless.\n We know it's a good thing. We don't need to check with him on the subject.\n \n \n \nBut hey, that's for gay advocates and Obama to hammer out. Not my problem.

That what I really don't like here! \n\n You're quick to point to Rwanda.\n How about you point to ANY point in history where America saw \"500 die in 6 years\" and we IMMEDIATELY jumped on the issue at the six year point???\n \n You're failing to recognize context here.\n Again, I agree Obama should do something, but the SCALE of his response should be proportional to the problem.\n How many people did Saddam exterminate and we didn't invade the country until trumped up \"WMD\" charges came through?\n \n Don't let the door hit your butt on your retreat out...",

   "One thing that kills me about the author of this article is how aggressive he is for attacking Obama on an unsubstantiated *500 LGBT deaths* in Iraq since 2003, but he is silent as the AIDS grave on Reagan's inaction on AIDS.\n \n So, if the author wants to look at deaths, let's look at deaths...\n \n \nReagan's communications director Pat Buchanan argued that AIDS is \"nature's revenge on gay men.\"\n \n With each passing month, death and suffering increased at a frightening rate. Scientists, researchers and health care professionals at every level expressed the need for funding. The response of the Reagan administration was indifference.\n \n By Feb. 1, 1983, 1,025 AIDS cases were reported, and at least 394 had died in the United States. Reagan said nothing. On April 23, 1984, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced 4,177 reported cases in America and 1,807 deaths. In San Francisco, the health department reported more than 500 cases. Again, Reagan said nothing. That same year, 1984, the Democratic National Convention convened in San Francisco. Hoping to focus attention on the need for AIDS research, education and treatment, more than 100,000 sympathizers marched from the Castro to Moscone Center.\n \n With each diagnosis, the pain and suffering spread across America. Everyone seemed to now know someone infected with AIDS. At a White House state dinner, first lady Nancy Reagan expressed concern for a guest showing signs of significant weight loss. On July 25, 1985, the American Hospital in Paris announced that Rock Hudson had AIDS.\n \n With AIDS finally out of the closet, activists such as Paul Boneberg, who in 1984 started Mobilization Against AIDS in San Francisco, begged President Reagan to say something now that he, like thousands of Americans, knew a person with AIDS. Writing in the Washington Post in late 1985, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, stated: \"It is surprising that the president could remain silent as 6,000 Americans died, that he could fail to acknowledge the epidemic's existence. Perhaps his staff felt he had to, since many of his New Right supporters have raised money by campaigning against homosexuals.\" \n \n Reagan would ultimately address the issue of AIDS while president. His remarks came May 31, 1987 (near the end of his second term), at the Third International Conference on AIDS in Washington. When he spoke, 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS and 20,849 had died. The disease had spread to 113 countries, with more than 50,000 cases. \n\n Reagan's AIDS Legacy / Silence equals death\n \n So I find it odd that the author would try to compare Obama to Reagan, criticize Obama for Iraq LGBT deaths, which would have started UNDER BUSH. While Obama has over 100 days in office, if the author's statistics are to be believed, Bush had 4-5 years with this problem...\n \n But then, when Reagan had gay deaths WITHIN the U.S., GREATLY SURPASSING the unsubstantiated number the author threw out there, the author is silent.\n :xbanghead\n \n I can't help but wonder how many people could have been saved with the proper education on the disease's transmission, instead of allowing the religious bigotry (even WITHIN the Reagan administration) to humiliate and denigrate people who caught the disease.",

   "Speaking of Red and Blue States - Beware, this is long:\n \n Dear Red States:\n We've decided we're leaving. We intend to form our own\n country, and we're taking the other Blue States with us. In case you aren't\n aware, that includes California , Hawaii , Oregon , Washington , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , Illinois and all the Northeast. We believe this split will be beneficial to the nation, and especially to the people of the new country of New California. \n\n \n Dear Blue States:\n \n Thank you very much!! This is a dream come true for us!! First things first - we need to get busy with the WALLS!!! These will be on the same order as the old Berlin wall, only with the latest ideas in maximum security. Probably some kind of double wall with a buffer zone mine field or something. The most important thing for the original U.S. - to keep \"New California\" citizens OUT. The walls security features could probably vary somewhat depending on location. For your citizens protection, it would probably be best to have maximum height in two areas; the area all around the southern half of Illinois, and the area just south of DC. If any or your people managed to wander into those old U.S. areas of Virginia, or Missouri/western Ky, it probably would not be pretty what would happen to them. \n \n Would you be able to share in half the cost of these walls? Maybe ALL the material cost - we would build them. (blue state people aren't too keen on physical labor, are they?)\n \n After the walls are done, then you'll have to confront your next major problem - the nation of New California consists of 4 unconnected land masses, resulting in some transportation problems. Ferrying/flying across Lake Michigan shouldn't be too much of a problem, and if you talk nice to Canada, they may rent or lease you an area to travel from Michigan to New York. (you don't get Ohio or Indiana) But that thousand mile stretch between Minnesota and Washington state/Oregon is going to be a major problem for you. Again, maybe Canada could help. The northern U.S. states could possibly lease you some airspace for flyovers, but a ground corridor would be completely out of the question, I'm sure you understand. \n \n \nTo sum up briefly: You get Texas , Oklahoma and all the slave states. We get\n stem cell research and the best beaches. We get the Statue of Liberty. You\n get Dollywood. We get Intel and Microsoft. You get WorldCom. We get Harvard. You get Ole Miss. We get 85 percent of America's venture capital\n and entrepreneurs. You get Alabama . We get two-thirds of the tax revenue;\n you get to make the red states pay their fair share.\n\n \n Since it won't be possible for the walls to be built overnight, surely you realize that a population balancing rush will happen quickly. All the illegals throughout the southern U.S. will be told that their free ride is about over, and they will flock to New California in droves. Most entrepreneurs in your area will head south, where they can find people who are actually willing to work for them. \n \n \nSince our aggregate divorce rate is 22 percent lower than the Christian Coalition's, we get a bunch of happy families. You get a bunch of single\n moms. \n\n \n I've no doubt you'll have lots of new experiences with families. \n \n \nPlease be aware that Nuevo California will be pro-choice and anti-war, and we're going to want all our citizens back from Iraq at once. If you need\n people to fight, ask your evangelicals.

Will you promise not to come crying to us if someone in the middle east flies planes into YOUR buildings? \n \n \nWith the Blue States in hand, we will have firm control of 80 percent of the\n country's fresh water, more than 90 percent of the pineapple and lettuce, 92\n percent of the nation's fresh fruit, 95 percent of America's quality wines, 90 percent of all cheese, 90 percent of the high tech\n industry, most of the U.S. low-sulfur coal, all living redwoods, sequoias and\n condors, all the Ivy and Seven Sister schools plus Stanford, Cal Tech and MIT. \n\n \n If you take Obama, Biden, Specter, Al Gore, and Sean Penn, we'll consider all that a good sacrifice. But without Texas and Alaska, and nothing to offer the middle east, where are you going to get your oil / energy? \n \n \nwith the Red States, on the other hand, you will have to cope with 88 percent of all obese Americans (and their projected health care costs), 92\n percent of all U.S. mosquitoes, nearly 100 percent of the tornadoes, 90 percent of the hurricanes, 99 percent of all Southern Baptists, virtually 100 percent of all televangelists, Rush Limbaugh, Bob Jones University, Clemson and the University of Georgia. We get Hollywood and Yosemite, thank you.\n Additionally, 38 percent of those in the Red states believe Jonah was actually swallowed by a whale, 62 percent believe life is sacred unless we're discussing the war, the death penalty or gun laws, 44 percent say that\n evolution is only a theory, 53 percent that Saddam was involved in 9/11 and\n 61 percent of you crazy bastards believe you are people with higher morals\n than we lefties. \n\n \n Will New California have any state governments at all, or just one massive federal government? \n \n \nFinally, we're taking the good pot, too. You can have that dirt weed they\n grow in Mexico.\n Peace out,\n Blue Statesemoticon_xgood\n\n \n Yes, you can even legalize it. We won't have much of anything from Mexico - we're going to guard the border. Mexicans and Mexican stuff will all be channeled into southern New California. (it's western-most division)",

   "What a fantastic response !!\n\n \n Thanks, I didn't spend a lot of time with it - just some quick fun. Years ago on another forum, I half jokingly speculated on what it would be like if the U.S. did an east/west split, with a Berlin type wall running north to south, splitting the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, to make the land masses about equal. Liberals in the west, conservatives in the east. A lot of north easterners, and Texans, would have to move! :p What kind of governments each would have is interesting to speculate on! :)",
