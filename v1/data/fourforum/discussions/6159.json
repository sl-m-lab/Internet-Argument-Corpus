   "I've got an analogy that gives me a lot of direction on this abortion issue. One thing that most people would agree on is that it is practically impossible to close the book on the status of an embryo/fetus. Heated, endless argument shows that the issue is difficult. We don't see a lot of bickering over the issue of whether an apple is going to fall to the ground or toward the sky because the answer is simple and obvious. \n \n Here's the analogy: What is the correct hunting policy? I am a hunter who sees something stirring in the bush. Neither my companion nor I can tell for sure whether it is game or a human being. Should the policy be that hunters be left free to choose whether to take a shot in this situation, or should the policy be that no shot can be taken unless the hunter has established with certainty that the target is indeed game?",

   "I think you state this the wrong way. You support the womens \"right\" to ignore a consequence of an action she chose (in most cases) to do OVER someones life. Can we apply this to all things in life? A women hits someone guy with her car on purpose....I suppose she can just drive off. emoticon_xclown\n\n \n Hmm. Not quite. A better analogy is: If she throws a party, and one of the guests decides to stay, should she be required to care for him? Or can she force him out, even if it means killing him? I'd say yes.\n \n As I've said before, I'm all for requiring all possible measures to be taken to ensure the life of the baby, but not at the expense of the mothers right to do with her own body as she chooses. I believe she should have the right to expel the baby at any time she chooses. What happens to the baby after that is not her responsibility.\n \n \nAs for number \"2\" the fetus is not her body. Even if it uses her body it still isn't part of it.\n\n \n Nope. And it has no right to use her body, either.\n \n \nI still would argue against there even being this right though. Even if it did exist the right would end when it effects someone else.\n\n \n Well, when we talk about rights as allowable behaviour, then yes we do have this right. And it doesn't end when it affects someone else.\n \n GALTON:\nAs if valuing human life over other life forms is morally arbitrary like wearing a green shirt today instead of a red one. If you consider the value of your life to be as low as a dog's, I can't stop you, but that sort of belief will make it easy for an enemy of yours to kill you.\n\n \n I like to use this hypothetical question when talking about the value of life:\n \n Which would upset you more (be honest now): having your much loved pet dog of ten years being hit by a car, or hearing that the death toll from some earthquake in some developing nation has risen from 6 to 7?\n \n I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I would be more upset about my dog being killed, than learning about the death of another human. In fact, I've yet to meet a single person who would be equally upset, or more upset at the human death.\n \n \nThis is not even an honest argument. The mother put him them of her own free will in all but about 1% of cases.\n\n \n It is important to note that unless the couple is attempting to get pregant, then the woman is not deliberately 'putting the baby there' of her own free will any more than having a party is inviting squatters into your home. Sex can be recreational, as well as for procreation. Whether or not it should be recreational is another debate we shouldn't get into here.\n \n \nThis IS THE essential issue in the abortion debate. If it were known that the fetus were indeed a person the same as you or I, there would be no debate. I have yet to find a thread at this forum that argues for the right to choose to murder.\n\n \n Legal killing is not called murder. The USA has laws in some states allowing people to kill to protect their property, yes? Why is it that killing someone to protect your VCR should be legal, but protecting your personal autonomy at the expense of someone elses life is a terrible, inconcievable idea?",

For example, the \"mother's recklessness\" argument only works so long as rape is not entered into the debate. \"Sanctity of life\" fails when we encounter a risky pregnancy.\n \n Far as I'm concerned, I do not believe in natural law, so any rights and duties are decisions made by the society to ensure coexistence of the members within the society. It is in the interest of the society that new members be added to it (at least for the time being), so childbirth is to be encouraged and abortion discouraged. It is against the interest of the society to force women who do not wnat their children to seek illegal abortions, which more than double the negative effects, so abortion should be allowed. So long as people seek children to adopt, pregnant women are to be encouraged to give birth to the child and allow it to be adopted. And so on.",

But she can't.\n \nLet me guess, you're a lawyer right? When I observe this level of sophistry, I can't help but wonder what the motives are. Your line of argument is that if a person does not control every element going into an event, then the event is not the person's doing. When I drive drunk, my defense will be that I do not control the fact that a spark causes gasoline to explode, thereby pushing my car forward, therefore the act of the person getting run over is not my doing. Now if I had control over chemical processes and could stop a spark from setting off gas, then it would be my doing, but I simply do not have that kind of control. \n \n \n\n Well, to be completely technical it depends on the type of support.

This is untrue. In fact, the opposite is true.\n \nYou are the one who started your analogy using the term guest and then later brought up the term intruder, so I didn't insist anything about the guest--I was following your switching. You harp on this invitation thing because you want to drive home that the fetus' presence in the womb was not wanted, so \"the uninvited guest can ethically be ejected.\" But the truth is that you control whether the fetus ends up in your womb or not; in fact, you can control PERFECTLY the absence of a fetus from your womb by not having sex. So the presence of a fetus in you womb is under your control; if it is there, nobody did it but you. It may be unwanted but it is your doing and therefore your responsibility so all this hogwash about supporting it being voluntray does not apply. \n \n \n\n Just because I support a persons right to choose doesn't mean I would make the same decision. I love kids, and would never encourage someone to have an abortion. But if they chose to have an abortion anyway, I would fully respect that choice.\n\n Oh, but you already have encouraged people to get abortions, and with great energy and perseverance. Do you think the many, many posts you have made in this thread alone do not work to convince people that abortion is not bad; in fact, it is serving justice by \"ejecting uninvited guests from your home.\" You have an unjust situation when you have a squatter; in fact, it might be trespassing, the violation of a law. The trespasser might indeed be considered a criminal. So ejecting him is sort of a public service, isn't it? That sort of sophistry might work really well on me, when I have got myself in a jam and am trying to rationalize an abortion. Yeah, yeah, what \"Adept\" said.

   "\n If the technology existed to raise fetuses outside the mother's womb so they didn't die, that would be different. As it is, \"removing the fetus from your body\" is just another way of saying killing it.\n\n \n So if the technology existed, but no one was willing to pay for its use, so the fetus died anyway, would abortion still be murder? Maybe the technology already does exist, in the form of cryogenically freezing the fetus until a later date.\n \n The \"technology\" certainly exists to save starving Africans when you withdraw your support, and yet they still die - but somehow, because someone somewhere has made the scientific discovery on how to keep them alive, that makes it not murder?\n \n Frankly I don't find this distinction compelling at all.\n \n And this is typical in a pro-life position, continually adding arbitrary criteria to what abortions constitute murder, so that it doesn't generate absurd results.\n \nIf I have sex knowing that doing so will eventually produce a fetus in my womb by no volition of his own, when that happens I am in no position to call the fetus a \"thief\" or to punish his robbing of my resources by capital execution. \n\n \n Unless the technology exists to keep the fetus alive outside the womb, apparently.\n \n \nThat humans are more valuable than animals is obvious and does not merit debate.\n\n \n Actually that does merit a great deal of debate, as the assertion that objective \"value\" exists is an extremely contentious position. In my view value is subjective, and so while humans might be more valuable than animals *to you*, other people may and do value animals more highly. Now it's all very well and good to declare that you are right and they are simply wrong, but I don't believe that's at all supportable. This was the classic mistake of the classical economists, belief in objective value, and at least their theory of it, which was based on the amount of labour put into something, had some correlation to real world prices.\n \n The whole deal about \"community values\" is a crock as well. The Hindu value cattle, the Egyptians cats. Community values is another way of saying \"values shared by the majority\", and majoritarianism holds no moral force. But why even appeal to it? In many communities abortion is acceptable.\n \n \nNot wanting to provide support is no justification for killing someone. \n\n \n Unless they're African, apparently. Oh wait, there's that whole technology thing again. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Not providing support to someone, even if it results in their death, is not killing them. They die, yes, and they would have lived if you had supported them, yes, but this is not killing. To fail to give is not the same as to take.\n \n Additionally, the idea that a woman \"chooses\" to become pregnant despite attempting to not become pregnant is absurd to me. That's like saying you \"chose\" to fail your maths test even though you made every effort to study for it.\n \n The argument from the \"uncertainty\" of the fetis' status as a person or not is weak for two reasons\n 1) It is also uncertain whether animals, especially higher order animals, have the same moral status as humans. See contemporary moral philosophy for this, Singer's work especially. The fact this view is unpopular does not make any difference. And it will never be \"proven\" one way or another whether they are \"people\", it simply comes down to philosophy. Perhaps the similarity between the \"meat is murder\" and \"abortion is murder\" slogans and groups should tip you off to this.\n \n 2) Punishing someone for killing something which may or may not be a person contradicts the principle of innocent until proven guilty. If it is killing persons we wish to outlaw, punishing people because we aren't sure whether they killed a person or not is unjust. Sure, you can say that the inherent unknowability raises the possibility of letting crimes slide, and it does, but it is still wrong to commit injustice in the hopes of preventing a possible evil, and is identically unjust to punishing people for murder who eat meat.",

   "GALTON: So, the main issue it now seems you take with my posts is that the baby is an invited guest in the mothers womb, and thus should not be ejected?\n \n Your position, if I may...\n \n 1 - All babies (excluding rape) are deliberate conceptions.\n \n 2 - Because of (1), the baby has a right to the mothers body and resources.\n \n 3 - Because of (2) the baby should not be ejected from the mothers body and left to die.\n \n Now, my position in contrast...\n \n 1 - There is no such thing as a deliberate conception (excluding IVF and the like)\n \n 2 - Regardless, no one ever has a right to another persons body and resources. Even if the conception was deliberate.\n \n 3 - Because of (2) the baby may be ejected from the mothers body and left to die, if she wants.\n \n Where I would take issue with your points are:\n \n Responsibility does not equal consent. If you are hit by a truck as you cross a pedestrian crossing, you are partly responsible since you were there. But you did not consent to being hit by a car. If you are attacked in an alley, you are partly responsible since your actions led you to be in that place, but you did not give your consent to be attacked. These are all things that you know might be possible outcomes of your actions. But just knowing they might happen doesn't mean you consent to it. \n \n Further, I would argue that having given consent should not be a binding contract beyond the social norms of care of duty. A mother can give her child up for adoption, or give her child to social services. She has a duty of care to do everything reasonably expected to ensure the child has a carer, then she is no longer responsible for it. I suspect you agree. However, where we obviously differ is in our definitions of reasonable. I do not think it is reasonable for a woman to be forced to carry another person inside her body against her will. You think it is.\n \n So, apparently, we have two points to argue.\n \n 1 - Does knowledge of a possible outcome of action equate to consent of that particular outcome?\n \n 2 - Is it reasonable to expect a woman to carry another person inside her body against her willl?",

   "So if the technology existed, but no one was willing to pay for its use, so the fetus died anyway, would abortion still be murder? Maybe the technology already does exist, in the form of cryogenically freezing the fetus until a later date.\n\n The point is that if you remove a fetus from your womb knowing that it is going to die, you are killing it. \n \n \n\n The \"technology\" certainly exists to save starving Africans when you withdraw your support, and yet they still die - but somehow, because someone somewhere has made the scientific discovery on how to keep them alive, that makes it not murder?\n \n\n The causal connection between any behavior of mine and saving starving Africans is neglible. with respect to abortion, a woman has total control over whether her fetus is going to be killed. \n \n \n \n\n Frankly I don't find this distinction compelling at all.\n \n\n What distinction? The \"saving the starving Africans\" scenario and abortion. The distinction is about as strong as one can find--one involves an a high level of control, the other involves no control. \n \n \n\n And this is typical in a pro-life position, continually adding arbitrary criteria to what abortions constitute murder, so that it doesn't generate absurd results.\n \n\n I had no need whatsoever in my argumentation to make the point about technology. Actually, I was being generous and saying that there is indeed the possibility in the future that a woman may be able to remove a fetus from her womb without killing. I will make sure and not be generous again.\n \n \n\n Actually that does merit a great deal of debate, as the assertion that objective \"value\" exists is an extremely contentious position. In my view value is subjective, and so while humans might be more valuable than animals *to you*, other people may and do value animals more highly. Now it's all very well and good to declare that you are right and they are simply wrong, but I don't believe that's at all supportable. This was the classic mistake of the classical economists, belief in objective value, and at least their theory of it, which was based on the amount of labour put into something, had some correlation to real world prices.\n \n The whole deal about \"community values\" is a crock as well. The Hindu value cattle, the Egyptians cats. Community values is another way of saying \"values shared by the majority\", and majoritarianism holds no moral force. But why even appeal to it? In many communities abortion is acceptable.\n \n\n Of course one cannot prove in an ultimate sense that values are right or wrong. If you value animals equally with humans, no one can prove that you are wrong. My desire is that people be convinced that abortion not be allowed, and fortunately for my goal, almost 100% of people agree that animals are of inferior value. And fortunately for my golas, almost 100% of people are not going to be persuaded by these pro-choice attempts to muddy the waters with arguments about animals being equal to humans. They may be persuaded by other arguments, but not arguments like: We slaughter animals and animals are arguably as valuable as humans so how can oyu have a problem with slaughtering fetuses. It's all good. \n \n \n \n\n Not providing support to someone, even if it results in their death, is not killing them. They die, yes, and they would have lived if you had supported them, yes, but this is not killing. To fail to give is not the same as to take.\n \n\n The sophistry of these pro-choce arguments is mind boggling. You have a fetus in your womb. When you have a doctor do the procedure, you are killing it. In reality, there isn't aven this \"removal of support\" you guys talking about. The abortionist takes specific actions to kill the fetus--simple as that. \n \n \n\n Additionally, the idea that a woman \"chooses\" to become pregnant despite attempting to not become pregnant is absurd to me. That's like saying you \"chose\" to fail your maths test even though you made every effort to study for it.\n \n\n Just because there are some factors outside your control, does not mean that you did not cause something to happen. Most cause and effect that I can think of involving humans involves factors that the humans do not have control over. You can use your argument to argue that humans do not choose to do anything, that they have no responsibility for anything. Funny how a person who quotes Von Mises all of a sudden doesn't recognize agency but only can see the additional factors. \n \n \n\n The argument from the \"uncertainty\" of the fetis' status as a person or not is weak for two reasons\n 1) It is also uncertain whether animals, especially higher order animals, have the same moral status as humans. See contemporary moral philosophy for this, Singer's work especially. The fact this view is unpopular does not make any difference. And it will never be \"proven\" one way or another whether they are \"people\", it simply comes down to philosophy. Perhaps the similarity between the \"meat is murder\" and \"abortion is murder\" slogans and groups should tip you off to this.\n \n\n Are you speaking of proving that animals are people or fetuses are people? The former is absurd, and if you are arguing the latter, you are arguing precisly what I am arguing. \n \n \n\n 2) Punishing someone for killing something which may or may not be a person contradicts the principle of innocent until proven guilty. \n \n\n You are again arguing against an argument I was not making. My question was should we be against abortion, given that we do not know for sure that fetuses are not human beings. The point is attitude toward abortion, not what should we do if we decide we are against it. A person might be against abortion because it might be killing humans beings and decide the proper approach is simply to try to educate people about this possibility. You are assuming responses to abortion that I am not positing with this question.",

I trust that you, in all consistency, will support 3rd trimester abortions where death is uncertain and oppose sponsorship withdrawals that will lead to certain death.\n \n \n\n I had no need whatsoever in my argumentation to make the point about technology.\n\n \n Then don't do so. If you are unprepared to back up an argument about there being a moral distinction between ceasing foreign aid and having an abortion, please don't bother making it.\n \n \nOf course one cannot prove in an ultimate sense that values are right or wrong. If you value animals equally with humans, no one can prove that you are wrong. My desire is that people be convinced that abortion not be allowed, and fortunately for my goal, almost 100% of people agree that animals are of inferior value.\n\n \n So in other words, you are willing to substitute weight of numbers for any actual argument, how very honest of you. It certainly convinces me of the integrity of the pro-life position that it is reliant on threat of force rather than moral argumentation.\n \n \nYou have a fetus in your womb. When you have a doctor do the procedure, you are killing it.\n\n \n Only some abortions kill the fetus, others remove it from the womb, it usually dies of natural causes.\n \n \n\n Just because there are some factors outside your control, does not mean that you did not cause something to happen.\n\n \n Yes a person \"causes\" something to happen, at least in part. The chain of causality that resulted in something happening passed through their actions. That does not mean they \"chose\" for it to happen. A man chooses to buy a lottery ticket - whether that ticket is drawn on Thursday night and he wins, or not, is not his choice.\n \n \nYou can use your argument to argue that humans do not choose to do anything, that they have no responsibility for anything. Funny how a person who quotes Von Mises all of a sudden doesn't recognize agency but only can see the additional factors.\n\n \n If you have read Mises, you will recognise that people choose their actions, they do not choose the results of those actions.\n \n \nAre you speaking of proving that animals are people or fetuses are people? The former is absurd, and if you are arguing the latter, you are arguing precisly what I am arguing.\n\n \n Oh it's \"absurd\" is it? That's certainly a compelling argument. I have a counter \"arguing that feti are people is absurd\", I hope you're just as convinced as I was.\n \n \nYou are again arguing against an argument I was not making. My question was should we be against abortion, given that we do not know for sure that fetuses are not human beings.

I just hope you do recognise that punishing people for things that \"might have\" or \"could be\" wrong is unjust.",
