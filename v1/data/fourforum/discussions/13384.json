   "Karen Armstrong has a new book out -- The Case For God. Is anyone reading it? Thoughts?\n \n Here is a review by Simon Blackburn.\n \n -----------------------\n \n This is an eloquent and interesting book, although you do not quite get what it says on the tin. Karen Armstrong takes the reader through a history of religious practice in many different cultures, arguing that in the good old days and purest forms they all come to much the same thing. They use devices of ritual, mystery, drama, dance and meditation in order to enable us better to cope with the vale of tears in which we find ourselves. Religion is therefore properly a matter of a practice, and may be compared with art or music. These are similarly difficult to create, and even to appreciate. But nobody who has managed either would doubt that something valuable has happened in the process. We come out of the art gallery or concert hall enriched and braced, elevated and tranquil, and may even fancy ourselves better people, though the change may or may not be noticed by those around us.\n \n The Case for God : What Religion Really Means\n by Karen Armstrong\n 384pp, Bodley Head, \u00a320\n \n Buy The Case for God at the Observer bookshop\n This is religion as it should be, and, according to Armstrong, as it once was in all the world's best traditions. However, there is a serpent in this paradise, as in others. Or rather, several serpents, but the worst is the folly of intellectualising the practice. This makes it into a matter of belief, argument, and ultimately dogma. It debases religion into a matter of belief in a certain number of propositions, so that if you can recite those sincerely you are an adept, and if you can't you fail. This is Armstrong's principal target. With the scientific triumphs of the 17th century, religion stopped being a practice and started to become a theory - in particular the theory of the divine architect. This is a perversion of anything valuable in religious practice, Armstrong writes, and it is only this perverted view that arouses the scorn of modern \"militant\" atheists. So Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens and Harris have chosen a straw man as a target. Real religion is serenely immune to their discovery that it is silly to talk of a divine architect.\n \n So what should the religious adept actually say by way of expressing his or her faith? Nothing. This is the \"apophatic\" tradition, in which nothing about God can be put into words. Armstrong firmly recommends silence, having written at least 15 books on the topic. Words such as \"God\" have to be seen as symbols, not names, but any word falls short of describing what it symbolises, and will always be inadequate, contradictory, metaphorical or allegorical. The mystery at the heart of religious practice is ineffable, unapproachable by reason and by language. Silence is its truest expression. The right kind of silence, of course, not that of the pothead or inebriate. The religious state is exactly that of Alice after hearing the nonsense poem \"Jabberwocky\": \"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas - only I don't exactly know what they are.\" If Alice puts on a dog collar, she will be at one with the tradition.\n \n Armstrong is not presenting a case for God in the sense most people in our idolatrous world would think of it. The ordinary man or woman in the pew or on the prayer mat probably thinks of God as a kind of large version of themselves with mysterious powers and a rather nasty temper. That is the vice of theory again, and as long as they think like that, ordinary folk are not truly religious, whatever they profess. By contrast, Armstrong promises that her kinds of practice will make us better, wiser, more forgiving, loving, courageous, selfless, hopeful and just. Who can be against that?\n \n The odd thing is that the book presupposes that such desirable improvements are the same thing as an increase in understanding - only a kind of understanding that has no describable content. It is beyond words, yet is nevertheless to be described in terms of awareness and truth. But why should we accept that? Imagine that I come out of the art gallery or other trance with a beatific smile on my face. I have enjoyed myself, and feel better. Perhaps I give a coin to the beggar I ignored on the way in. Even if I do so, there is no reason to describe the improvement in terms of my having understood anything. If I feel more generous, well and good, but the proof of that pudding is not my beatific smile but how I behave. As Wittgenstein, whose views on religion Armstrong thoroughly endorses, also said, an inner process stands in need of outward criteria. You can feel good without being good, and be good without stretching your understanding beyond words. Her experience of \"Jabberwocky\" may have improved Alice.\n \n Silence is just that. It is a kind of lowest common denominator of the human mind. The machine is idling. Which direction it then goes after a period of idling is a highly unpredictable matter. As David Hume put it, in human nature there is \"some particle of the dove, mixed in with the wolf and the serpent\". So we can expect that some directions will be better and others worse. And that is what, alas, we always find, with or without the song and dance.\n \n Review: The Case for God by Karen Armstrong | Books | The Guardian\n \n ----------------------",

   "Karen Armstron is just as Biblically and spiritually challenged as the liberal Bishop Spong. She's another twisted favorite of the anything goes, Cafeteria Christianity establishment. Here's just a few examples of her discredited theology:\n \n Karen Armstrong\n \n Do not expect any original research or argumentation from Armstrong. The findings of liberal Biblical scholarship and of the likes of the Jesus Seminar are taken as indisputable fact, and the argument progresses from there without skipping a beat. It's all in there to some degree: JEDP, the Jesus Seminar, dating Proverbs to the 3rd century BC without explanation or analysis, much less dealing with of competing views; a false interpretation of Ps. 82 (which happens to match one I refute by the Mormons in The Mormon Defenders), political correctness, and anachronism. In light of that most or all of what Armstrong assumes to be true about the Bible is refuted via links or material on this page, we merely refer readers to Encyclopedia index (see sidebar) and offer our usual Whitman's Sampler of bitter chocolates:\n \n &#61623; It is clear from her introductory words that Armstrong grew up in a religiously strict environment and desired a touchy-feely religion, but is upset because, well, she didn't experience God the way she wanted -- what she got was a holy being; what she wanted was a health tonic. What she got what was the Bible; what she wanted was a Dilbert calendar. \n \n &#61623; And by golly, she found one. Armstrong offers up a full slate of statements like these over many pages: \"These myths were not intended to be taken literally, but were metaphorical attempts to describe a reality that was too complex and elusive to express any other way.\" [5] We want to ask: How does Armstrong know this? How does she know that Exodus or Enuma Elish were \"not intended to be taken literally\"? Has she interviewed any ancient people and asked? Of course not -- it's merely assumed that there was some unknown \"too complex and elusive\" reality that these folks were trying to describe, because otherwise we'd have to deal with the idea that they believed these things were actually true, and that's what leads to political incorrectness. No genre proofs, no interviews, just assumption based on Armstrong's preconceived view of the world, and that she herself would never have written such a thing to be taken literally. At any rate, it is clear that Armstrong also assumes that if you don't agree with this, you're not grown up yet. \n \n &#61623; Recounting the salvation history of the Bible and the atonement, Armstrong complains, \"there must have been an easier and more direct way to redeem mankind.\" [309] If there was, Armstrong does not lay it out; like some recent skeptics we have dealt with, she merely looks at scenario A-1, says, \"God could have done better\" and leaves it at that. At the back of such objections lies a presumption, \"I know better than God and could have done it better\" -- as if any person has the capacity to lay out a perfect alternate history and know there was a \"better way.\" Not even Harry Turtledove claims that kind of genius. It's like the skeptics who say Abraham was a bad choice for God to make -- really? So who do they know who was a better choice? Do they have a list of names from the 18th century BC along with full resumes and character references? Such objections assume to possess omniscience in the service of declaring that omniscience bungled the job. \n \n &#61623; The Trinity is a top subject for Armstrong. Though she knows about the Wisdom literature, she doesn't see the application to the Trinity, which she assumes is the product of Nicaea, along with the divinity of Jesus. The Trinity, she says, \"only makes sense as a mystical or spiritual experience\" , which I suppose would be true of someone who'd rather not do the relevant homework. The Trinity makes sense to me in light of the Wisdom tradition, and I'd say if you want a mystical or spiritual experience of equal quality to what Armstrong proposes, get up and spin yourself in circles until dizzy. But if you want to understand the Trinity, read the relevant literature. \n \n &#61623; Political correctness extends only to certain persons: We are advised that Arius, the defender of the heretical view that Jesus was a created being and not eternal divinity, \"passionately believed\" what he taught, while Athanasius, who taught the eternal divinity of Christ, \"managed to impose his theology\" on others and was an unhappy camper. Armstrong's favoritism is about as subtle as Dan Rather's. Those who \"passionately believe\" what is wrong are just fine, because they have passion and that's what counts. Don't even think of condemning them! \n \n &#61623; We are told that it was only at the end of the 2nd century that Christianity gained any converts intelligent enough to articulate its views . Apparently Armstrong has not read Wayne Meeks' The First Urban Christians showing that Paul had more than the usual expected number of converts from the wealthy/literate Roman upper and middle class. She also doesn't read about the Romans, who she says had not \"inherited the Greek hostility to Jews.\" Tell that to Tacitus, Celsus, and Lucian, and other Romans who referred to the Jews in derogatory terms. Armstrong's sociology is rather dismal for an Oxford teacher. \n \n &#61623; The ancient pagans did not worship idols; the idols were \"a focus that had helped people to concentrate on the transcendental element of human life.\" Yes, I am sure that's what they had in mind when they sacrificed infants and had sex on the altars to explain to Baal that they needed some rain. Try that on your next date's father and mother, teenagers! (Armstrong is only half right anyway: the idols were intended to be focal points for the gods depicted to come down and be present.) \n \n &#61623; (According to Armstrong) Prophets who condemned false religion were doing so because they were full of insecurities, secretly knowing that their own god was as made up as that of others . I hear a genetic fallacy in the room... \n \n &#61623; Using JEDP parsing as a basis (a theory which Armstrong admits has been seriously disputed, but which she uses anyway, because no one has come up with anything better --- this is like saying we should use the garbage bag with only 8 gaping holes because we haven't found any with less!), Armstrong divides up the OT, then argues on the basis that those who wrote one part would not agree with the other parts written by other people (as on the subject of God's anthropomorphism -- apparently it never occurs to Armstrong that close and distant terms of relationship are not mutually exclusive over time). \n \n &#61623; As needed, things like the denunciation of the Pharisees are declared \"inauthentic\" because they are offensive. (Never mind the ancient use of riposte.) \n \n So, what more needs be said? Armstrong offers only another fortress of political correctness in the wasteland of postmodernity. I can see why certain people think her work the cat's meow, but from the looks of it, all she has is more begged questions to offer.\n \n Karen Armstrong. critique",

   "\"Bring me my enemies before me and slay them\"\n\n \n It's a very old argument. \n \n Did they mean it or was it figurative? Has Christianity been involved in the butchery of masses upon masses of people over the centuries? Or was it *something else* that \"pulled all those triggers\"? Is that the true face of Christianity or a perversion? After all, Hitler went to church and was photographed often with churches in the background. Did the Pope really like him, or he just couldn't help himself? What about Yugoslavia? It can go on for many pages.\n \n Anyway, I've yet to pick up the book, but I'll forward to any remarks from anyone who also decides to read it. I suspected that Karen Armstrong would be eventually winding up in the direction discussed by this book critic.\n \n It's interesting to me that she's so hated by the right-wing, but apparently in this book, she presents just about the only legitimate challenge to the more militant atheists. I doubt any of her critics here at 4forums will read her latest before criticizing. I know Easyrider has never read anything she's written.\n \n Lastly, I am intrigued by her views on silence, however sardonically the journalist weaves it in. Buddhism figures influential in Armstrong's thinking and Buddhists are quite silent on the subject of God. And there is a relationship there, of course, as well, to Jewish views on the name of G*d. She's quite a scholar so it should be filled with all kinds of comparitive stuff.\n \n (Besides the ever self-important face of Christianity.)\n \n But I like the way she finds common ground across so many faiths.
