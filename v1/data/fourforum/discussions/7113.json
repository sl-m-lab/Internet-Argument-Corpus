   "Yesterday I was working in my home office and my wife was watching TV with the kids. She fell asleep. The kids got hungry and got on the refrigerator and got out the spaghetti sauce. Our 3 yr old got the lid off. She decided it was nothing that she wanted to eat, so she gave it to the 18 month old who will eat anything. \n \n Of course, he got it EVERYWHERE. All over himself, the kitchen, the living room, and even smeared it all over the walls. An interesting fact that I did not previously know... Did you know that if you cover your hair with spaghetti sauce, it turns it bright orange? I am not talking a pleasant orange hue. I mean bright, clown orange. And it does not wash out.\n \n My mother in law suggested that we use vinegar mixed with water to try to get it out. That changed it from clown orange to a neon orange...it kind of reminds me of highway cones. \n \n Does anybody know if there is any way to get this color out of the kids hair? He is usually blond. We have kind of ruled out dye due to his age.\n \n Any ideas? This is going to be an interesting christamas if we cannot change his hair back.",
