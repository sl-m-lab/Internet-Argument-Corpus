What do you think the chances are of California's Highest Court blocking the admendment?\n \n \n(San Francisco, California) Gay rights advocates have asked California's highest court to keep off the November ballot a citizens' initiative that would again ban same-sex marriage.\n \n Lawyers for Equality California filed a petition Friday arguing that the proposed amendment to the California Constitution should be invalidated because its impact was not made clear to the millions of voters who signed petitions to qualify the measure before the state Supreme Court legalized same-sex unions.\n \n \"This court has recognized that gay and lesbian couples have a fundamental right to marry and, as of June 16, such couples have been getting married across the state,\" the petition states.\n \n \"Rather than effecting 'no change' in existing California law, the proposed initiative would dramatically change existing law by taking that fundamental right away and inscribing discrimination based on a suspect classification into our state Constitution.\"\n \n The petition also claims the so-called California Marriage Protection Act should be disqualified because it would revise, rather than amend, the state Constitution by altering its fundamental guarantee of equality for all - in essence writing a law the state high court has already found unconstitutional into the constitution.\n \n \"If enacted, it would alter the underlying principles on which the California Constitution is based and make far-reaching changes in the nature of our basic government plan, by severely compromising the core constitutional principle of equal citizenship (and) ... by destroying the courts' quintessential power and role of protecting minorities,\" it states.\n \n Unlike a constitutional amendment that can be approved by voters, a constitutional revision requires convening a Constitutional convention or the appointment of a commission to recommend changes to the Legislature and voters, according to the petition submitted by same-sex marriage supporters.\n \n \"For good reason, there's a strict process for making revisions to our Constitution, and it's more involved than simply collecting petition signatures,\" said attorney Stephen Bomse in a statement posted on the Web site of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, another petitioner in the case.\n \n \"That process is in place to safeguard our basic form of government, especially the most basic principle of equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n The petition names Secretary of State Debra Bowen and the measure's sponsors, a coalition of religious and social conservative groups called ProtectMarriage.com, as defendants.\n \n Since Bowen's office already has certified the amendment for the fall election, a spokeswoman says she can remove it only through a court order.\n \n \"She has a ministerial duty to certify any initiative when they qualify through the petition process, and she can't remove an initiative without a judge's order,\" said Kate Folmar, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state.\n \n The last time the state Supreme Court was asked to decide if a proposition should remain on the ballot was 2005, when it did so twice. In both decisions, the propositions were allowed to stay on the special election ballot.\n \n In both 2005 cases, the state Supreme Court overturned lower courts who had taken the propositions off the ballot. The propositions were a redistricting initiative backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and another that would have re-regulated the state's electricity market.\n \n The Arizona-based Alliance Defense Fund, which represents the measure's sponsors, called the petition a desperate move it would fight.\n \n \"This is just another attempt to force a radical political agenda upon the people of California,\" said Defense Fund senior counsel Glen Lavy. \"The opponents of marriage are willing to use any means necessary to impose their will.\"\n",

Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?\n \n \n\n \n The problem with comparing the right to murder with the right to marry is that murder has never been recognized as a right. Marriage has been recognized as a right by the U.S. Supreme Court, and some people are now being denied that right. Keeping murder illegal is not denying any specific group the rights that others have. Murder is illegal for everyone. \n \n In contrast, the laws that ban same-sex marriage target a specific group of people and single them out for discrimination, by disallowing members of this group from marrying their chosen spouse legally. Such laws disadvantage legally the families formed by same-sex spouses, by barring them from obtaining the rights and benefits that families formed by opposite-sex spouses have under the law. \n \n No one has the right to murder. Heterosexuals who form families have legal rights and protections in most states that are denied to gay people who form families.\n \n The issue is not dictatorship versus majority rule. No one is calling for a dictatorship as far as I can see. The issue facing gay people and any minority group is protecting minorities from being denied equal rights and equal protections by the majority. The majority have agreed, broadly, to protect the interests of minorities from the tyranny of the majority by writing provisions for the protection of minority rights into the U.S. constitution and into state constitutions. Each state constitution differs, of course. \n \n It strikes me that a question being raised in California is whether the withdrawal of this protection for minorities in the state constitution through the proposed anti-marriage amendment is a revision of the state constitution or merely an amendment to the state constitution.

The majority established what our Constitutional rights are. Whether they possess the moral right to do so is not the question. And coming from you, I'm not sure it is a question that could even be answered given that you do not adhere to moral absolutes.\n \n 3). Simply not true. If enough people consent, any right can be added to, or removed from, our Constitution. Yes, even the beloved 14th Amendment could be legitimately repealed.\n \n 4). A simple yes or no will not suffice if you are really interested in my view. Whether I would comply is not the issue at hand. Whether I would call the amendment unconstitutional is the issue. And I would never call your hypothetical Constitutional Amendment unconstitutional for the simple fact that it violates every principle of logic and reason to hold such a view.

   "These words:\n \n Marriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations.

   "\n 1). Problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right. It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process. But let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that the right to marry is a constitutional right. \n \n\n Based on reading many of your posts, I can't help but think that you define \"illegitimate\" as \"not adhereing to conservative philosophy\". Do you have any legal basis for calling this ruling illegitimate? \n \n \n\n I would firstly say that this right is certainly not as clear of a constitutional right as is the right to amend constitutions, which is expressly spelled out such that no one could possibly dispute it \n\n \n The ablilty to amend the constitution isn't a right, it's a process which the people can participate in. If you don't understand the difference, look at the difference in language used in the California constitution. Article 18 spells out the amendment process:\n http://info.sen.ca.gov/.const/.article_18\n No mention of rights, or inherent qualities of people, or anything to suggest that this is anything more than a decleration of a legal proceeding. If amending the constitution is a right, then then US President has a \"right\" to serve from 4 to 8 years. Which is to say, it isn't a right at all. Simply put, not everything in a constitution is a right, some of it is simply the elucidation of how the government is to be run. And if a legal reason can be found to thwart an attempt to amend or revise the constitution, then there is no question of \"rights\" being denied.",

   "I would firstly say that this right is certainly not as clear of a constitutional right as is the right to amend constitutions, which is expressly spelled out such that no one could possibly dispute it (that is, of course, unless a certain minority happens not to like how the constitution might be amended).\n \n I would secondly say that saying that one has a constitutional right to marry is not the same thing as saying that one has the right to marry a person of the same gender. The word marriage, as codified in statutes, is not open to interpretation, and no court that I'm aware of has said that the meaning of the term marriage, as enacted in statutes, is something other than the union of one man and one woman. What some courts have done is to say that such a definition violates some part of the Constitution.\n \n \n\n \n The issue in this recent challenge to the November referendum in California has nothing to do with whether there is a right to amend the state constitution, or whether the right to amend the constitution is more clear than the right to marry. At issue, from what I have read, is whether the proposed constitutional amendment is not an amendment at all but a revision of the California constitution. My own response to that question is I don't know. \n \n The statutes dealing with marriage have been different in the different states. One of the interesting developments in recent years has been the rush by people in many states to amend their marriage statutes so that they explicitly say that marriage is between one man and one woman. This has happened in the last 10 years, as a result of people getting into a panic about the possibility that same-sex marriage might be recognized legally. Whether same-sex couples could marry legally was ambigious and open to interpretation in states that did not explicitly limit marriage to one man and one woman in their laws. That ambiguity prompted a rush to suddenly \"define\" marriage in many states as between one man and one woman only. And not all states have done this. \n \n New York is an example of a state whose marriage laws have been and still are ambiguous on the subject of same-sex marriage. New York is now in the odd position of recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other states and countries while not permitting same-sex couples to marry in New York. To be legally married in New York these days, a same-sex couple can go to California, have a legal marriage, and return to their home in New York and be legally married there.",

Substantive due process has not always been used to further what we might regard as liberal beliefs. Probably the most outrageous use of substantive due process by the Supreme Court was the ruling in Lochner v. New York in 1905, in which the Supreme Court struck down a maximum hours law passed by the state of New York on the ground that it violated the rights of the bakery owners and bakers to \"liberty of contract.\" The Supreme Court had moved to the position that due process is not only procedural; it is substantive, a concept that is still hazy in my mind. They regarded liberty of contract as a substantive right protected by the 14th amendment. It was, of course, a \"right\" that served to shield business owners from state regulations aimed at protecting workers, thus, in effect, writing laissez-faire into the U.S. constitution. In more recent years, of course, long after the belief in \"liberty of contract\" as a substantive right had disappeared, a more liberal Supreme Court turned to the doctrine of substantive due process to rule in favor of a right to privacy, which is also nowhere named in the U.S. constitution. This led the Court down the path to ruling for a woman's right to abortion, which angered conservatives as much as the Lochner decision had angered progressives. \n \n The real issue, of course, is whether the constitution protects rights that it does not specifically name or list, and if it does, how do we determine what those rights are. It's clear to me that the framers, Madison notably, did intend for the constitution to protect rights not specifically listed. Indeed, one argument of those who opposed including a bill of rights was that to include a bill of rights might lead people to think that the constitution protected only the specific rights listed, and since the list of rights would not be exhaustive, the protections of rights by the constitution would thus be limited and incomplete. It turns out that there is a longstanding argument about what rights the constitution protects and whether rights not enumerated are indeed protected by the constitution. \n \n One of the rights that has been at issue over the course of our constitutional history is the right to vote. The constitution does not specifically name voting as a right that is constitutionally protected, except in certain specific kinds of cases. Post-Civil War amendments now prevent the states from denying the right to vote on the basis of race and sex, and there can be no poll taxes, and states cannot deny the right to vote because of age to people 18 and over. In the past, the Supreme Court has ruled that voting is not a right protected by the constitution. In the 1870s, the Supreme Court ruled that women were indeed citizens, but their right to vote was not protected by the constitution, as who had the right to vote was up to the states and the right to vote was not guaranteed by the U.S. constitution, with the exception that the constitution then prohibited states from denying the right to vote on the basis of race. Over time, the Supreme Court has moved in the direction of ruling that voting is a right protected by the U.S. constitution. But the constitution itself does not explicitly guarantee to all citizens the right to vote. States differ today, for example, in whether they grant voting rights to convicted felons who are either imprisoned or have served their sentences.\n \n So is voting a constitutionally protected right or not? It is if the Supreme Court says it is, but many find this idea unsatisfying, leaving the determination of constitutionally protected rights up to the judicial branch. \n \n The right to marry is similar to the right to vote in that the right to marry has been granted by, and its boundaries determined by, the states. But then there have been cases before the Supreme Court, most notably Loving v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court declared that marriage is a fundamental right and is a right protected by the constitution. \n \n I personally find the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to be a more compelling basis for the guarantee of equality under the law than the hazy doctrine of substantive due process. In denying same-sex couples the right to marry, states are denying to a class of persons the equal protection of the laws. Whether the U.S. Supreme Court will ever rule that way is unclear; I doubt they will rule that way anytime soon. But they may do so in time, as same-sex marriages become accepted in some states and the popular view of same-sex marriage continues to shift in its favor, and as justices more sympathetic to equal marriage rights are appointed to the Supreme Court. Phyllis may argue that this is no way to win equal marriage rights, and that it should be up to voters to decide whether to grant equal marriage rights, either on the state law or in the form of an amendment to the U.S. constitution. Phyllis usually argues based on what she thinks should happen according to her view of the constitution and the separation of powers. But we all know that this is not always, or even often, what does happen. \n \n My take on Phyllis' position is that she is not necessarily opposed to same-sex marriage, but she has a particular view of how the constitution should be interpreted and how the different branches should adhere to separation of powers. To Phyllis, the important thing is not necessarily whether same-sex marriage becomes legal, but how that takes place. Phyllis, please correct me if I am misrepresenting you here. \n \n My sense is that Phyllis objects to what she perceives to be efforts by supporters of marriage equality to win using any means possible, whether the means fit a particular constitutional theory or legal approach or not. Of course, the opponents of same-sex marriage will also use any means possible to block same-sex marriages; they often argue against \"unelected judges making law,\" but they do that only when those \"unelected judges\" rule in ways they don't happen to like. They applaud when the \"unelected judges\" rule in favor of positions they hold. \n \n People who are fighting for equal rights under the law are going to use whatever means they can to win (short of violent revolution and street fighting, we hope). People who are fighting to block equal rights under the law are going to use whatever means they can to win. If that battle produces what some regard as weird constitutional rulings, that's life. Telling people not to pursue legal avenues because the rulings might end up violating Phyllis' or someone else's ideas about correct constitutional interpretation or separation of powers is not going to have much effect. This is a battle over rights that really matter to people. For gay people, whose lives and families are profoundly affected by the outcome of this battle, the outcome matters far more than the specific constitutional basis on which the Supreme Court may rule, though the latter is still important for everyone, gay people included.",

   "I must say, this was an impressive post. I'll insert a few comments, mainly with respect to my views.\n \n \nMy understanding of what Phyllis wrote is that she regards the doctrine of substantive due process as illegitimate, not because it isn't politically conservative, but because it is an invention of the Supreme Court, a reading into the 14th amendment of an idea that the framers of the amendment never intended to be there and that they probably never even imagined.\n\n Bingo.\n \n \nProbably the most outrageous use of substantive due process by the Supreme Court was the ruling in Lochner v. New York in 1905, in which the Supreme Court struck down a maximum hours law passed by the state of New York on the ground that it violated the rights of the bakery owners and bakers to \"liberty of contract.\"\n\n Actually, I would say the most outrageous use of substantive due process also happens to be the first time it was used: Dred Scot v. Sanford. Regardless, I disagree severely with the Lochner decision, even though that case actually resulted in what could be called a \"politically conservative\" policy. But, for the same reason that I disagree with Lochner, I also disagree with any other case so far as it relies on substantive due process. For me, the Supreme Court's decisions should not be judged correct or incorrect, good or bad, on the basis of the political result that follows from the decision. They should be judged correct or incorrect, good or bad, on the basis of whether they have interpreted the Constitution correctly.\n \n \nThe real issue, of course, is whether the constitution protects rights that it does not specifically name or list, and if it does, how do we determine what those rights are.\n\n If I recall, we had a huge discussion on this previously. Maybe I'll try to dredge up that discussion and link to it. I think the basic disagreement came down not to whether the Constitution protects rights it does not specifically list, but rather how it does so. You argued, I believe, that these unenumerated rights are protected by the Constitution itself, whereas myself and Steeeeve (I believe) argued that they are protected by leaving them to the several states through their democratic process.\n \n Needless to say, I'll see if I can locate that thread and link to it for any interested in these opposing views.\n \n Update: Here's a link to the thread where a quite extensive and thorough discussion of unenumerated rights: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10016&page=10, beginning with post #146 and following.\n \n \nSo is voting a constitutionally protected right or not? It is if the Supreme Court says it is, but many find this idea unsatisfying, leaving the determination of constitutionally protected rights up to the judicial branch.\n\n Not merely unsatisfying. For me, it comes down to being under the tyranny of 5 judges, or not. That is the way I would articulate my feelings on an improper Supreme Court ruling; it is that significant. My view is that if the Supreme Court decides that something is not protected by the Constitution when it really is (and vice-versa), they subject the people to the collective will of 5 people (which is only 4 more than a king).\n \n \nThe right to marry is similar to the right to vote in that the right to marry has been granted by, and its boundaries determined by, the states. But then there have been cases before the Supreme Court, most notably Loving v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court declared that marriage is a fundamental right and is a right protected by the constitution.\n\n I should say that I only disagree with Loving's use of substantive due process. It's Equal Protection analysis, I think, was applied correctly, and was all that was necessary, to decide that case.\n \n \nPhyllis may argue that this is no way to win equal marriage rights, and that it should be up to voters to decide whether to grant equal marriage rights, either on the state law or in the form of an amendment to the U.S. constitution. Phyllis usually argues based on what she thinks should happen according to her view of the constitution and the separation of powers. But we all know that this is not always, or even often, what does happen.\n\n My whole argument is that it is what ought to always happen. I could, I suppose, acknowledge that the Court has not always decided it's cases according to the original meaning of the text it is interpreting. Then I could, I suppose, conclude that I therefore should not worry about the Court's method of interpretation, and focus only on getting the results that I want. I just cannot do that because I am convinced that this method of interpretation is illegitimate. \n \n \nMy take on Phyllis' position is that she is not necessarily opposed to same-sex marriage, but she has a particular view of how the constitution should be interpreted and how the different branches should adhere to separation of powers. To Phyllis, the important thing is not necessarily whether same-sex marriage becomes legal, but how that takes place. Phyllis, please correct me if I am misrepresenting you here.\n\n Bingo. I await with great anticipation the inevitable reply that my view is insincere. That it is only a way of masking my bigotry against gays. That only a bigot would believe that same-sex marriage is not protected by the Constitution. That only a bigot would support the citizens' right to amend their state constitution in order to define marriage. That I have only come up with a clever way of masking my own personal prejudice. I do not suggest that you will make that jump, but I would not be surprised if others do.\n \n \nOf course, the opponents of same-sex marriage will also use any means possible to block same-sex marriages; they often argue against \"unelected judges making law,\" but they do that only when those \"unelected judges\" rule in ways they don't happen to like. They applaud when the \"unelected judges\" rule in favor of positions they hold.\n\n I do not disagree that some (perhaps most) do this. But I do not. I recognize the difference between saying that the Constitution says X, and that the Constitution ought to say X. Sometimes an appropriate interpretation of the Constitution results in political ends that I happen not to like. Let us take abortion, for example. I oppose abortion and think that it ought to be prohibited. But if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, this would not outlaw abortion; it would merely leave it up to the several states' determination. Undoubtedly several states would, in the event of Roe's reversal, simply re-enact abortion policies that are as minimally restrictive as they currently are under Roe. I would disagree with these states' decision, but I would not therefore say that the Court should hold that abortion is prohibited by the Constitution in order to achieve my political ends. Rather, I would support an amendment to the Constitution.\n \n \nTelling people not to pursue legal avenues because the rulings might end up violating Phyllis' or someone else's ideas about correct constitutional interpretation or separation of powers is not going to have much effect. This is a battle over rights that really matter to people. For gay people, whose lives and families are profoundly affected by the outcome of this battle, the outcome matters far more than the specific constitutional basis on which the Supreme Court may rule, though the latter is still important for everyone, gay people included.\n\n The problem is that if one endorses a view of the court that is based solely on achieving political results, then one has absolutely no basis upon which to disagree with the Court when it decides cases on that basis. So, if you accept that the court may impose its political views through its decisions, those decisions may presently turn out in your favor. But some day the court might change and start ruling based on a different ideology.\n \n So today, the Court might rule that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and 10 years from now (because the makeup of the court has shifted) it might also rule that abortion is prohibited by the Constitution. And because you do not much care about \"the specific constitutional basis\" upon which the Supreme Court decides its cases, you really won't be able to complain. Indeed, unless you have a theory about what constitutes proper judicial decision making, you cannot even say that any decision the courts make is incorrect. Otherwise, when one says that the court decided X vs. Y incorrectly, what are they even saying?",

But the supreme court seems to often get a free pass on consideration of the power (and exertion of political views) they have for some odd reason.\n\n \n It's not an \"odd reason.\" The reason the Supreme Court has the power that it has is because of judicial review. The Supreme Court is the final judge of what is and is not constitutional, short of the people amending the constitution through the process laid out in the constitution. It's the job of the Supreme Court to say what the law is, what the law means. The Supreme Court rules on what the constitution actually says, what its meaning is, though not arbitrarily or in a vacuum. The Supreme Court rules on cases that come before it on whether laws passed by the other branches or by the states are constitutional or not. That's the nature of judicial review. \n \n Thomas Jefferson hated judicial review and thought that it meant judicial tyranny. But mostly people of the founding generation accepted judicial review as a given, even though the power of judicial review is never explicitly mentioned in the constitution. \n \n My question to you, when you say that many libertarians and conservatives have a problem with a supreme court of such power, is whether you or the conservatives and libertarians you describe oppose judicial review itself, or whether you or they oppose specific decisions that the U.S. Supreme Court has made. \n \n There is a difference between decrying specific decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and decrying the fact that the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review. Remember too that both conservative and liberal Supreme Courts have exercised the power of judicial review, and both conservative and liberal Supreme Courts have issued rulings that many people have found outrageous and based on political beliefs rather than on a correct interpretation of the constitution. \n \n My own position on this is that there is no such thing as a correct interpretation of the constitution; there are simply different interpretations. There are different philosophies or schools of how the constitution should be interpreted. \"Original intent\" is just one philosophy or school of interpretation. I have my own views of how I think the constitution should be interpreted, but mine is just one viewpoint on this, and I continue to read about other schools of interpretation. I find some validity or merit in each of the schools of interpretation. \n \n I don't know of anyone who argues that the Supreme Court should make its rulings based on the justices' political beliefs rather than on their interpretations of the constitution. But one person's correct interpretation is usually another person's ruling based purely on political beliefs. To folks who are more liberal, various rulings by the Supreme Court, such as Bush v. Gore for example, look more like political rulings than legitimate interpretations of the constitution. And to folks who are more conservative, other rulings by the Supreme Court look more like political rulings than legitimate interpretations of the constitution. \n \n I have to go take my daughter to 4th of July events now, but I'll write more later.",

I certainly understand that there is a place for the court. I'm not against the idea of a judicial branch of government. However, the problem I have is that there really isn't a form of checks and balance on it, unlike Congress and administrative branches, and therefore I think its power should be very restrained. You certainly know more about the history of the court than I do, but from what I can tell, the court wasn't really as active earlier on as it has been in the last few decades. I wonder if perhaps people didn't really use it as a strategy of activism nearly as much then as they do now--as a means for an end.\n \n The issue here is judicial activism versus judicial restraint, as two ideological ends of a spectrum, and of course reality always falls somewhere in between. The court is the only branch of government by which unelected officials hold potentially enormous power. And it so happens that those unelected officials don't have 'term limits'--they are there until they die or resign. The argument is often made that they are only throwing out laws that are unconstitutional, and in theory this is true, but it doesn't always play out in society and culture in that way. Their decision sometimes has enormous impact on the culture itself and determining standards that our society goes by. And ultimately it just comes down to someone's interpretation of the constitution. I realize that we have to have a court, but IMO, because of the nature of judicial review, it's one case where it needs to be conservative. The court should be restrained as much as possible, only going as far as they need to, and because such restraint is in order, my opinion is that it is the one branch where conservatism is the most crucial. My view is that it is the branch of government that poses the most danger in terms of going too far and the people having little recourse to do anything about it. (as you can probably tell, I'm a big believer in judicial restraint.)",

It turns out that there is a longstanding argument about what rights the constitution protects and whether rights not enumerated are indeed protected by the constitution. \n\n \n Thanks for this post, it was comprehensive, and there isn't much I'd dispute there. There is clearly always going to be disagreement about what constitutes a human right, how one identifies it, and how it should be protected. Now, maybe the founders should have paid a little more attention to this deeply philosophical question, and specified how rights should be protected (I think it would be impossible to specify everything one might consider a right within the constittion), but they left it vague, and the Supreme Court has legally evolved into the body that performs this function.\n \n I really see nothing wrong with that: it's a fait accompli, and it is an English tradition for law (common law) to evolve extra-legislatively. Phyllis's claim that there is a judicial tyranny, however, is invalid, or at the very least, grossly exaggerated. If We the People don't like a Supreme Court decision, there is the possibility of amending the Constitution to reverse it. One could even, as FDR threatened, stack the court, though obviously, that's not a good precedent!\n \n If I were American, I'd probably argue that the Supreme Court should be expanded from nine to some larger number of justices, and their appointment be somehow made less directly political (or at least less influenced by the presidency), but I think that the principle of judicial review of laws is sound, otherwise you get a tyranny of the majority. While one can always point to specific court decisions which were arguably bad, none of them are necessarily permanent. The court generally acts responsibly and does defer to the extent it can to the legislature (in fact, the conservative justices are much more prone to block the will of the legislature than the liberal ones!)\n \n The only folk I'd trust less than judges to determine the constitutionality of a law are the legislators. The system works enviably well, for all the drawbacks, and emasculating the courts would make the situation considerably worse.\n \n As to how to define a human right, that's a much more difficult philosophical problem, and beyond my feeble ability to resolve in a nutshell. I just suggest that we always use reason to augment emotion, and err on the side of acknowledging individual rights rather than denying them, especially when for some reason or other, religious or otherwise, we dislike or disapprove of the people who claim a right. The burden of proof should rest with those who deny a right, rather than those who assert one, on the minomalist basis that anything that isn't expressly forbidden should be permitted. Any mistakes we make are likely to be less painful that way.",

   "From what I read, the power of judicial review is granted to the court only by precedent rather than the constitution itself. I certainly understand that there is a place for the court. I'm not against the idea of a judicial branch of government. However, the problem I have is that there really isn't a form of checks and balance on it, unlike Congress and administrative branches, and therefore I think its power should be very restrained. You certainly know more about the history of the court than I do, but from what I can tell, the court wasn't really as active earlier on as it has been in the last few decades. I wonder if perhaps people didn't really use it as a strategy of activism nearly as much then as they do now--as a means for an end.\n \n The issue here is judicial activism versus judicial restraint, as two ideological ends of a spectrum, and of course reality always falls somewhere in between. The court is the only branch of government by which unelected officials hold potentially enormous power. And it so happens that those unelected officials don't have 'term limits'--they are there until they die or resign. The argument is often made that they are only throwing out laws that are unconstitutional, and in theory this is true, but it doesn't always play out in society and culture in that way. Their decision sometimes has enormous impact on the culture itself and determining standards that our society goes by. And ultimately it just comes down to someone's interpretation of the constitution. I realize that we have to have a court, but IMO, because of the nature of judicial review, it's one case where it needs to be conservative. The court should be restrained as much as possible, only going as far as they need to, and because such restraint is in order, my opinion is that it is the one branch where conservatism is the most crucial. My view is that it is the branch of government that poses the most danger in terms of going too far and the people having little recourse to do anything about it. (as you can probably tell, I'm a big believer in judicial restraint.)\n\n \n I would argue to you that the Supreme Court was just as \"active\" in striking down laws that it regarded as unconstitutional in earlier periods of American history as it has been recently, and indeed was probably more \"active\" in doing so in various periods in the past than it has been recently. The idea that the Supreme Court has gone off on a wild hair and has failed to exercise judicial \"restraint\" in recent decades is simply not supported by evidence. \n \n I understand your argument for judicial restraint, by which you appear to mean judicial deference to laws passed by the other branches. But whether judicial deference is appropriate really depends on the situation, and on the laws that are under consideration. What you seem really to be calling for is for the Supreme Court to be careful in its rulings, and I think most people would agree with you on this. I think the Supreme Court justices of today would argue that they are being careful, and the justices of the past, if we could bring them back from the dead, would argue that they also were careful in their rulings. Most would probably also argue that they were doing their constitutional duty by striking down laws that they judged unconstitutional.\n \n Contemporary conservatives tend to be the ones decrying the judicial \"activism\" of the Supreme Court in the post-WWII period. During the New Deal, of course, it was progressives who decried the judicial \"activism\" of the Supreme Court, which struck down important New Deal laws, to the point where FDR hatched his scheme to add new justices and expand the size of the court. And during the first decades of the 20th century, the Lochner era, progressives were also very upset by a Supreme Court that struck down laws aimed at protecting workers. I think if you look at the whole history of the U.S. Supreme Court, you'll find that Courts that embraced conservative principles like laissez-faire were just as activist in striking down laws passed by the other branches as were Courts that embraced liberal principles like the right to privacy and the rights of prisoners. Conservative Supreme Courts have been just as willing and eager to strike down laws as unconstitutional as have liberal Supreme Courts. \n \n I personally do not have a problem with the \"power\" of the Supreme Court. I think it's right and good that we have a Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of laws when the constitutionality of laws is challenged. I think that's right and good even when I strongly disagree with the rulings of the Supreme Court, and I do disagree with many of their rulings. \n \n Thomas Jefferson was furious at the idea that the Supreme Court would assume the power of judical review, and he hated Chief Justice John Marshall. He saw Marshall as reading a Federalist view of governmental power into the constitution and of the courts into the constitution. Indeed, we still feel Marshall's influence today. He made the Supreme Court powerful. Before Marshall, the fledgling Supreme Court was the weakest branch of government, and there was the possibility that the Supreme Court would end up being largely irrelevant as a player in U.S. history. It was Marshall who changed this, by asserting the power of judicial review and using that power to shape a strong Court acting as a check on the other branches. Was Marshall a liberal by today's standards? Mostly no. Was he a judicial activist? Most certainly, by the standards of his time. \n \n You are right that the Supreme Court makes rulings that have huge effects on people's lives. Whether those effects are good or bad depends on which people we are talking about and what the outcome of the ruling is. Look at the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which was one of the most significant rulings in the history of the Supreme Court. This certainly was not an example of judicial restraint or deference to state legislatures. The ruling overturned 50 years of precedent. The ruling led to \"massive resistance\" by white Southerners. White Southerners hated the Supreme Court and insisted they would never comply with such a tyrannical ruling. And the ruling ushered in a new era of equality under the law for African Americans, which is quite clearly what the framers of the 14th amendment intended with that amendment and which had been largely ignored by the Supreme Court prior to the Brown decision. (There is a great film about the career of Charles Hamilton Houston and the NAACP legal strategy that led up to the Brown case. It's called \"The Road to Brown.\")",

   "The problem is that if one endorses a view of the court that is based solely on achieving political results, then one has absolutely no basis upon which to disagree with the Court when it decides cases on that basis. So, if you accept that the court may impose its political views through its decisions, those decisions may presently turn out in your favor. But some day the court might change and start ruling based on a different ideology.\n \n So today, the Court might rule that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and 10 years from now (because the makeup of the court has shifted) it might also rule that abortion is prohibited by the Constitution. And because you do not much care about \"the specific constitutional basis\" upon which the Supreme Court decides its cases, you really won't be able to complain. Indeed, unless you have a theory about what constitutes proper judicial decision making, you cannot even say that any decision the courts make is incorrect. Otherwise, when one says that the court decided X vs. Y incorrectly, what are they even saying?\n\n \n I have not argued, and I have not heard anyone argue, that the Supreme Court should issue rulings to achieve certain political results. And I do not think that most Supreme Courts have been driven by the goal of achieving particular political results. I would say that the significant differences between the liberal and conservative justices are not so much that they have different political beliefs, but that they subscribe to different theories of constitutional intepretation. Mostly I think that Supreme Court justices have tried faithfully to interpret the constitution, though of course people's individual views and philosophies shape how they interpret. I have not seen a history of Supreme Court justices willy nilly issuing results-driven rulings, though there probably have been a few. \n \n While I agree with you that the Supreme Court should not issue results-driven rulings, I think it's important to note that different parties in legal cases play different roles. Parties to lawsuits are in a different position than are the justices ruling on the cases, and the goals and priorites of parties in a lawsuit are different from the concerns of the justices ruling on the case. Parties to lawsuits are seeking results; in an adversarial system, their goal is to win the case. They are results-driven. In the Loving v. Virginia case, the Lovings were seeking to win their case and overturn the Virginia law banning and criminalizing inter-racial marriage. It was not their responsibility to ensure that the Supreme Court ruling followed a particular theory of constitutional interpretation. Their lawyers certainly made a constitutional argument. But the nature of the ruling, and its constitutional impact, were the responsibility of the Court, not of the plaintiffs in the case. \n \n Ultimately, how the Supreme Court interprets the constitution, and what philosophy of interpretation the Supreme Court members use, is the responsibility of the Supreme Court. And it's the responsibility of the President who appoints justices and of the U.S. Senators who question and then approve the President's choices to get a grasp on what judicial philosophy a nominee to the Supreme Court embraces. It's not the responsibility of gay plaintiffs, or any plaintiffs, to put aside our claims for equality or our legal challenges to laws because such challenges might result in the Supreme Court making a constitutional ruling on what some may regard as the wrong basis.\n \n I agree with you that the Supreme Court should not be results-driven or driven by the particular political beliefs of the justices, though I think they should consider the likely impact of their rulings on real people. I agree with you that the Supreme Court needs a guiding theory of how to interpret the constitution. There are different theories. For the plaintiffs in a case, and for people who may be directly affected by a Supreme Court ruling, the theory of constitutional interpretation is likely to be less significant, especially in the short run, than the actual result of the ruling. For me as a gay person, the result of the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas was certainly more significant in an immediate sense than the constitutional basis for the ruling, though the latter is important also in the long run. In the short run, the results of the ruling were and have been profound. Results in terms of people's real lives do matter, especially to the people directly affected by a ruling. The long run impact of the constitutional basis of the ruling will become apparent over time. \n \n Different people play different roles and have different priorities. If I were on the Supreme Court, my role and my priorities would be different than they are for me as a private citizen who happens to be gay and a mother. For me now, the results, especially the immediate results, really matter. It's not my job or my responsibility to determine the constitutional basis on which those results are achieved. If I were on the Supreme Court, the constitutional questions would be central and the highest priority. \n \n Ultimately it does matter to all of us on what basis the Supreme Court makes its rulings, especially in the long run. It does matter. But different people play different roles in the process, and in our adversarial system, the parties to a lawsuit get to be results-oriented. They are out to win. It's up to the Supreme Court to ensure that the ruling is based on a solid and valid theory of constitutional interpretation; that's not the duty of the plaintiffs. And whatever rulings the Supreme Court makes, different Americans will continue to subscribe to different theories of constitutional interpretation, and thus some people will disagree with the Supreme Court, whether because their theory differs from that of the Court majority or because they dislike the specific results of a particular ruling.",

   "This discussion we have been having is in some respects an argument over priorities. In court cases involving people's rights, is the highest priority securing the rights in question? Or is the highest priority ensuring that the Supreme Court adheres to a particular theory of constitutional interpretation? \n \n I think that Phyllis regards the latter as more significant than the former. I regard the former as more significant than the latter. Different people and different justices have different theories of constitutional interpretation, and theories of constitutional interpretation change over time. I think that Supreme Court rulings must focus on interpreting the meaning of the constitution, and not simply be political opinions issued on the basis of nothing. But I also recognize that different justices have different theories of how to interpret the constitution. We don't have a Supreme Court where some justices interpret the constitution and other justices issue political opinions. We have a Supreme Court where all of the justices seek to interpret the constitution in ways they believe to be correct. They do that sometimes using different theories of constitutional interpretation, different approaches. \n \n Part of the reason that I regard securing rights as so important is that this is part of my own theory of constitutional interpretation. I believe that a major purpose of the constitution is to safeguard people's rights. In that sense, I agree with Leszek. In the case of gay rights, we are talking about safeguarding the rights of a minority against the denial of equal rights by the majority.",

   "\n Actually, I would say the most outrageous use of substantive due process also happens to be the first time it was used: Dred Scot v. Sanford. \n\n \n There has been debate among constitutional scholars over whether the ruling of Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case relied on substantive due process (at the federal level, since this was before the ratification of the 14th amendment). Robert Bork argues that the Dred Scott ruling did rely on substantive due process (and the late John Hart Ely made that argument before him). But some scholars argue that any reference to a notion of substantive due process amounted to just a brief mention near the end of Chief Justice Taney's lengthy opinion and that Taney's ruling was not based on this doctrine.\n \n This is off topic for this thread, but I thought I would mention that there is not a consensus on whether the ruling in Dred Scott was based on substantive due process.

   "To Jyoshu,\n \n It just occurred to me to suggest an example to you of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent \"judicial activism\" or lack of deference to legislatures in a direction that conservatives have generally applauded. I am thinking of the recent ruling on gun rights, in which the Supreme Court struck down the DC gun ban. This is a clear example of the Supreme Court stepping in and using its power of judicial review to strike down a law that the Court majority judged to be unconstitutional. I do not hear conservatives or libertarians howling that this is an example of judicial tyranny. Why? Because they mostly agree with the ruling. \n \n This is why I find the conservative complaints about \"activist judges\" and \"judicial tyranny\" to be mostly disingenuous.

They only complain when the judges strike down laws that they support. But in both kinds of cases, the judges are simply doing their duty and exercising the power of judicial review. \n \n My own thinking about the gun case is that I dislike the probable outcome of the ruling; it could have a potentially very negative result, in my view. I wish we could simply eliminate the second amendment entirely, which is not politically feasible. I am not sure whether the ruling was constitutionally sound or not; I suspect that, if we use the \"original intent\" theory of constitutional interpretation, we will find that the framers of the amendment probably did regard gun ownership as an individual right. But whether I or anyone else agrees with the ruling or not, I do not regard the ruling as \"judicial tyranny\" or as unwarranted \"judicial activism.\" It's simply the Supreme Court doing what it does and coming to a majority ruling that I think will have a negative outcome in the society. \n \n One can disagree with Supreme Court rulings without regarding them as \"tyranny.\" One can disagree with examples of judicial review without decrying the Supreme Court as an institution or claiming that \"activist judges\" are undermining the will of the people. In the case of the gun ruling, the Supreme Court undermined the will of the people of DC to enact a gun ban. Because conservatives tend to agree with the ruling, they don't howl about the Supreme Court undermining the will of the people or exercising tyranny. \n My own position is that this ruling is not \"tyranny\" at all; it's just a ruling that I think could have an unfortunate result.",

In the case of gay rights, we are talking about safeguarding the rights of a minority against the denial of equal rights by the majority.\n\n \n Absolutely. If the rights of the people aren't protected judicially, then legislatures will always be tempted to wear them away.\n \n One might argue there should be a better way of doing it, or the Supreme Court should be more reflective of We the People, but it's really hard to see how to improve the system as it has developed, expect by tinkering with the way justices get appointed. If you didn't have a Supreme Court, you'd need to invent one, because you cannot trust legislators.\n \n The Constitution is not a mathematical formula that gives clear right-or-wrong answers. It's a human document that in many instances has to be interpreted because its language or scope is not definitive (and it's deliberately not definitive in many cases). Neither is it clear that courts or legislatures should slavishly obey the so-called \"intent\" of the founders in the ambiguous cases -- what, they all had the same monolithic intent??? they were always unanimous and right??? -- even if the intent could be objectively determined, which is a highly dubious proposition in most practical cases. The founders do not rule; neither does Jefferson or Madison. One might give their opinion weight, but it shouldn't be regarded as prescriptive or final in cases of genuine ambiguity, nor should it be maintained against rational sense.\n \n Any interpretation that allows government to detract from the rights of the people, as defined by the people, has to be viewed with grave suspicion. If the Constitution doesn't exist principally to protect the rights of the people, what is the point of it at all? You might as well just have a dictator for all the good it is. All arguments to the contrary are, in my cynical view, merely a smokescreen to protect the privileges of powerful and established interests such as the opponents of equal rights.\n \n Note: this is not to argue that interpreting the Constitution should be politically results oriented, if one means specific, political outcomes. For example, you couldn't interpret it to mandate that everyone should receive the same wage irrespective of talent or effort. But you certainly can rationally interpret it as meaning that everyone should be treated equally before the law, because if you do not have that, then again, there is no point in having a constitutionally limited government at all.",

They are relatively few, and they tend to be the intellectual crowd who have bothered to study and think about theories of constitutional interpretation. Most of the howling from conservative activists is NOT over theories of constitutional interpretation, though they may claim it is. Most of the howling by conservative activists has been over the result of the Supreme Court's rulings. That is probably true for us liberals as well. The difference between liberals and conservatives has been that, in recent years anyway, liberals have not been inclined to attack the courts as \"tyrannical\" when they don't agree with the rulings. I have not heard liberals denouncing the Supreme Court as \"tyrannical\" in the wake of the recent ruling on gun rights, for example, though they may disagree with it. Many conservative activists have tended to applaud the Supreme Court for \"activist\" rulings they agree with and have denounced the Supreme Court as \"tyrannical\" for \"activist\" rulings whose outcome they dislike. \n \n This may simply be an example of inflated rhetoric designed to mobilize conservative supporters. But I find it problematic that people attack the Supreme Court itself over differences that amount to differences of constitutional interpretation. We might recall that in the wake of the Brown decision, supporters of racial segregation in the South denounced the Supreme Court using similar rhetoric and went so far as to pledge \"massive resistance\" to the Supreme Court's ruling. Remember the Southern Manifesto? White Southerners declared that they would never comply with the court decision, a pledge that led to some significant violence, both in resistance to school desegregation and in resistance to other Supreme Court desegregation rulings, such as the ruling in Boynton v. Virginia. We also see in the violence over the school busing cases in Boston, for example, resistance to court rulings. To attack the Supreme Court as \"tyrannical\" because you object to a particular ruling can lead some people to refuse to comply with the law and can even lead to violence, as we have seen in the past. Sandra Day O'Connor, as she was retiring, expressed much concern and dismay over the rhetorical attacks on the Supreme Court by people who disagreed with some of the Court's rulings. \n \n You may find the right to own guns to be much clearer in the constitution than the right to privacy. And it's true that the constitution actually spells out a right to bear arms, while it does not spell out a right to privacy. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has over time found a right to privacy in the constitution, and they did so before the decision in Roe v. Wade. That you disagree with the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Griswold case is fine. That you declare the Court to be \"tyrannical\" for its reasoning in the Griswold case, simply because you disagree with the ruling, is, I think, inaccurate and unfair.

Perhaps those who howl should not be defined as conservative or liberal, but simply of the sort that howl, regardless of whether or not they are conservative or liberal.\n\n \n Liberals certainly did howl over the ruling in Bush v. Gore, that it was a terrible ruling. But they did not, for the most part, denounce the Supreme Court as a \"tyrannical\" institution, and they did not vow to defy the Supreme Court, as had the opponents of school desegregation in the 1950s. Al Gore, while disagreeing with the ruling, accepted it and conceded the election, though he continues to view the Supreme Court ruling as wrong.\n \n The distinction I drew in my previous post, on which I elaborated at some length, is that liberals for the most part, in recent years, have not attacked the Supreme Court as an institution. They have criticized particular rulings by the Supreme Court. That's different from attacking the Supreme Court as an institution, from insisting that the rulings of judges represent \"tyranny\" and that the judges have overstepped their bounds by exercising judicial review over acts of Congress or state legislatures. \n \n Things were different during the New Deal era, when liberals who supported the New Deal did attack the Supreme Court as an institution. That was an era when the Supreme Court began striking down regulatory laws passed by Congress and by the states that were the heart of the New Deal. Liberals at the time referred to the 4 justices whose rulings they most despised as \"the Four Horsemen of Reaction.\" And it was FDR who hatched the plan to try to expand the Supreme Court, supposedly to assist judges who were old, but really to get the Court to rule in favor of the New Deal. There was an effort by liberals then to circumvent the Supreme Court and thus to try to undermine its power. The effort failed, because most people including Democrats did not support this effort. But then the problem for FDR went away when one justice, Owen Roberts, suddenly began to switch his rulings from striking down New Deal laws to upholding them. This was called \"the switch in time that saved nine.\" We don't know just why Roberts switched his rulings, but it was very significant historically and led to what is often called the constitutional revolution of 1937. With that \"revolution\" the Supreme Court began to give Congress wide latitude to regulate business based on the commerce clause rather than striking down one federal regulatory law after another.\n \n In recent years, conservative activists have been howling not simply that specific rulings that that they dislike have been wrong, but that \"unelected judges\" have been undermining \"the will of the people\" and thus acting as \"tyrants.\" Conservative activists have been attacking the Supreme Court as an institution, as well as state supreme courts, whenever they rule in ways that these activists disapprove of. \n \n Listen to what many opponents of same-sex marriage said about the Massachusetts supreme court after the ruling that the state must recognize same-sex marriages there. Many of these conservative activists don't even live in Massachusetts, and yet they denounced the state supreme court there as \"tyrannical.\" Then when the effort to amend the Massachusetts constitution failed, these same conservative activists turned around and denounced the state legislature in the same extreme language, denouncing them for undermining \"the will of the people,\" even though the legislators were elected by the people of Massachusetts and even though they followed the procedures for voting on the proposed constitutional amendment that were laid out in the state constitution. \n \n One can disagree with, even abhor, a specific court ruling without claiming that the court is \"tyrannical\" or that it has acted beyond its legitimate authority. Conservative activists go too far when they make such claims. And it's been conservatives who have been doing this in recent decades, not liberals, for the most part. That's not to say that only conservative activists have ever done this, but they are mostly the ones doing this now. \n \n Simply put, what activists of any political viewpoint usually care most about is not the constitutional basis of the Supreme Court's rulings; it's the outcome of the rulings themselves. That's clear when you look at which rulings activists support or oppose. To me, the ruling in Bush v. Gore was bizarre and not based on anything that is explicitly stated in the constitution. If conservative activists are so concerned with theories of constitutional interpretation, why did they not denounce this ruling? It's because they liked the outcome of the ruling. The fact that the ruling was based on a bizarre reading of the constitution that even the justices said should not be regarded as precedent did not seem to bother conservative activists, because they really didn't care about that. They cared about the result, which went in their favor. \n \n The approaches toward constitutional interpretation are not what primarily concern most conservative activists or liberal activists. It's not the method or theory of interpretation they care about; it's the content of the ruling. This has always been true.

Both liberals and conservatives care about the outcomes of Supreme Court rulings, and most probably care far more about the outcomes than they do about the theory or approach to constitutional interpretation.

   "Liberals certainly did howl over the ruling in Bush v. Gore, that it was a terrible ruling. But they did not, for the most part, denounce the Supreme Court as a \"tyrannical\" institution, and they did not vow to defy the Supreme Court, as had the opponents of school desegregation in the 1950s. Al Gore, while disagreeing with the ruling, accepted it and conceded the election, though he continues to view the Supreme Court ruling as wrong.\n \n The distinction I drew in my previous post, on which I elaborated at some length, is that liberals for the most part, in recent years, have not attacked the Supreme Court as an institution. They have criticized particular rulings by the Supreme Court. That's different from attacking the Supreme Court as an institution, from insisting that the rulings of judges represent \"tyranny\" and that the judges have overstepped their bounds by exercising judicial review over acts of Congress or state legislatures. \n \n Things were different during the New Deal era, when liberals who supported the New Deal did attack the Supreme Court as an institution. That was an era when the Supreme Court began striking down regulatory laws passed by Congress and by the states that were the heart of the New Deal.

You seem to simply chalk up 'conservative' opposition to the court as being rooted in no more than disagreement with the ruling. I think the reason it often happens to be conservatives who say these things is that conservatism, by its nature, will be wary of a ruling that enacts enormous change on the way society subsequently does things. You keep citing the Bush/Gore case in 2000 as an example of something that conservatives should have been in an uproar about for the sake of consistency, but the SCOTUS really didn't change anything in terms of the way our nation does things--we still vote and hold elections for instance. And they weren't even really deciding an election--they were deciding whether or not recounts should go on and on, when recounting had already taken place in fact. the election took place, regardless--it's not like the court was taking away elections, or ending the practice of voting.

While it's true that the outcome of the SCOTUS decision effectively ensured Bush would indeed take office, the oft-used accusation that the supreme court decided the election is not really true. Do I think the SCOTUS should have intervened? No, not really. I would have preferred they not and let the system take care of itself. (And gee, I'm a libertarian/conservative. Imagine that.) But no one was willing to relent and some were calling for recount after recount with no indication of a willingness to end it. I think there are reasons conservatives decry SCOTUS more than liberals: because it's the conservative position that would more likely oppose a branch of government going too far. It's conservatism, after all. Naturally they aren't going to howl over cases where the court rules in a way that STOPS government from going too far.\n \n Furthermore, so what if it is only when it's a ruling that conservatives don't like? Naturally it is when a ruling is undesirable than the issue is noticed. That doesn't mean those who criticize the court are wrong in their assessments that the court sometimes goes too far.

The court is not above reproach, and not above people expressing their opinion of it, even if those opinions are strong ones.\n\n \n This is a well-written post. I appreciate your thoughtful contributions to this discussion. \n \n The reason I brought up Bush v. Gore is that your argument earlier, and that of Phyllis as well, was that the Supreme Court moves toward being tyrannical when it makes rulings that are based on the justices' desired political outcomes and not on a clear and consistent theory of constitutional intepretation. The majority opinion in Bush v. Gore is an example of a ruling, applauded by most conservatives, of the Court NOT applying a clear and consistent theory of constitutional interpretation and appearing to be basing its ruling on a desired political outcome, though I am not certain that the 5 justices in the majority had that as their motivation. In this case, conservatives who had howled over the Court being results-driven in its rulings simply smiled and nodded, because they liked the political outcome. \n \n Now you have changed the standard by which you evaluate the Supreme Court from whether the rulings are rooted in a clear and consistent theory of constitutional interpretation to the impact of their rulings on society and whether their rulings change how we as a society do things. Does that mean you would oppose the Brown decision? Certainly the Brown decision led to \"enormous change in how our society subsequently does things.\" Does that make the ruling wrong? \n \n There are situations where we should change how we do things, because sometimes how we do things is contrary to our own constitution, our own set of fundamental principles on which have agreed and have included in the constitution. Whether a Court ruling brings change should not be, in my view, the standard by which we evaluate the Supreme Court. The standard should be whether the ruling reflects a valid interpretation of the constitution. I have said before that there is more than one valid way to interpret the constitution, and there is, in my view, no one exclusively correct way to interpret the constitution. I can disagree with a ruling by the Supreme Court and still acknowledge that the Court majority has faithfully tried to interpret the constitution, even when I disagree with their interpretation. \n \n The constitutional principle on which I think equal marriage rights rests is the principle of the equal protection of the laws, which is explicitly named in the 14th amendment. The constitutonality of laws that discriminate against gay people should not, in my view, be judged by the Supreme Court on the basis of whether striking down those laws will bring \"enormous change in how our society subsequently does things.\" That's not a constitutional principle. The constitutionality of laws that discriminate against gay people, including laws that bar gay people from marrying our spouses legally, should be judged on the basis of whether those laws deny to gay people the equal protection of the laws, as spelled out in the 14th amendment. \n \n If you are going to evaluate the Supreme Court on whether its rulings reflect a valid interpretation of the constitution, then you should stick with that, and not change your standard to whether its rulings bring \"enormous change in how our society subsequently does things.\" The latter standard, which you introduce here, is purely a results-based standard, having nothing to do with the constitution.",

The court is not above reproach, and not above people expressing their opinion of it, even if those opinions are strong ones.\n\n \n I should also respond to this part of your post. The standard for evaluating the Supreme Court's rulings should not be whether the Court has gone \"too far.\" What does going \"too far\" mean? That sounds, again, like a results-based standard, not a constitutional standard. \n \n The standard for evaluating the Supreme Court's rulings should be, in my view, whether the rulings reflect a valid interpretation of the constitution. \n \n As for whether the Court rules in a way that stops government from going \"too far,\" you probably mean the other branches of government here, as the judiciary is part of the government. Again, what does government going \"too far\" mean? In the Court's exercise of judicial review, the standard for evaluating Court decisions should be, again, whether those decisions reflect a valid interpretation of the constitution. By that standard, the legislative and executive branches go \"too far\" when they go beyond the authority granted to them by the U.S. constitution. How far that authority goes is a matter of how one interprets the constitution. \n \n That was precisely the issue that emerged when the Supreme Court struck down New Deal legislation as unconstitutional by interpreting Congress' power under the commerce clause very narrowly. With the constitutional revolution of 1937, the Supreme Court changed its majority position and began to grant Congress wide latitude to regulate under the commerce clause. That was an example of conservatives seeking to rein in the power of Congress, by arguing that the New Deal was Congress and the executive going \"too far\" and of liberals seeking to preserve the New Deal by arguing that the constitution granted Congress broad powers to regulate under the commerce clause. \n \n But there have been other cases in which conservatives have sought to expand the powers of the President and Congress while liberals have urged the Supreme Court to limit those powers as unconstitutional. A recent example of this is the Court ruling on the rights of prisoners held at Guatanamo. An earlier example from history is the case of Shenck v. United States, in which the plaintiff, who had been arrested, convicted, and imprisoned under the Espionage Act, argued that Act was unconstitutional because it violated his right to free speech. He had been arrested for handing out pamphlets calling on men to resist the draft. Liberals were divided over this case, while conservatives tended to support the government's position that it had the power to pass such a law. In that case, the Supreme Court sided with the government, ruling that the passing out of anti-draft leaflets and other anti-war activities represented a \"clear and present danger\" and could therefore be outlawed by Congress. Since that time, the Supreme Court has come to take a narrower view of what speech activities constitute a threat sufficient to be deemed illegal.\n \n My point here is that both liberals and conservatives have taken positions supporting expanding government powers, and both liberals and conservatives have taken positions supporting limiting government powers. Which position they have taken depends on the specific question before them. And whether the President or the Congress have gone \"too far\" is a matter of constitutional interpretation. \n \n The argument that the Court sometimes goes \"too far\" does not make sense, unless you clarify what going \"too far\" means. If by this you mean that the Supreme Court has issued a ruling that appears to have little or no relationship to what is in the constitution, that sometimes happens, but probably not very often. And conservative Supreme Courts have made rulings that appear to many to stray from the constitution just as often as liberal Supreme Courts have. Conservative activists don't denounce those rulings because, according to you, they don't notice them. I think they certainly notice them, but they don't choose to denounce such rulings because they favor the outcome of the rulings. \n \n Yes, the Supreme Court is not above reproach. But critics of the Court should at least try to be accurate and fair. I have no problem with people saying, \"That was the wrong ruling for these reasons. The Court made a terrible ruling in this case.\" But when people accuse the Court of going \"too far,\" whatever that means, or of overstepping its constitutional authority, or of being \"tyrannical\" or of being wholly politically motivated simply because the critics disagree with a Court ruling, then those critics have gone too far. They have made accusations and denunciations of the Supreme Court that are false and irresponsible and without merit. For critics to be taken seriously by those who disagree with them, they have to make valid arguments, truthful arguments.\n \n I strongly disagree much of the time with certain members of the Supreme Court, because I have a different view from theirs of how properly to interpret the constitution. But I see them as faithfully trying to interpret the constitution; I do not regard them as scoundrels or as people acting purely for political motives. I disagree with their philosophy of constitutional interpretation. That's a lot different from the claims of some loud conservative activists who denounce the Supreme Court and who claim that the liberals in particular on the Court are concerned only with political results. That irresponsible charge is no more true of liberals on the Supreme Court than it is of conservatives on the Supreme Court. I see all the justices trying their best to interpret the constitution. That they differ in their opinions reflects the fact that there are different ways to interpret the same constitution.",

   "It's fairly obvious that modern conservatives -- actually, closer to right-wing radicals -- believe they get to operate by one set of rules, while holding liberals to a much stricter one. That's why conservatives NEVER complain about Supreme Court decisions they like, but wax hysterically about \"activist judges\" on the rare occasions the Court hands down a decision they dislike.\n \n It's also clear that conservatives do not believe in any concept of human rights defensible in a US courtroom. That alone is enough reason for me not to be a conservative, and lament the death of true conservatism in the US... the days when disgree with conservatives though one might, you at least knew they stood for some things you could agree with, such as respect for human rights.\n \n The Goldwater conservatives are dead and gone, and we are stuck with the Bush conservatives -- a sorry lot.",

Good to hear from you again. \n \n My issue with your argument here is that what you regard as \"correct\" is just your interpretation of the constitution, your belief about what is the \"correct\" way to interpret the document. Justices on the Supreme Court differ on what is the \"correct\" way to interpret the constitution. The constitution itself is silent on how it should be interpreted. \n \n Justice Scalia makes an argument for interpeting based on original intent and a narrow reading of the text of the document. In his approach, if the framers did not specifically intend the 14th amendment to prohibit discrimination against women, then the amendment does not prohibit discrimination against women. Justice Breyer argues for a model called \"active liberty,\" with a view toward understanding the purpose behind each of the provisions of the constitution. It's a model of interpretation similar to that of the late scholar John Hart Ely. Breyer has a fairly recent book out on his view of constitutional interpretation. Both of these approaches have problems. To determine the purpose behind a constitutional provision is a matter of judgment, and the judgment falls to the justices. But determining the original intent of the framers is often a matter of judgment as well, because their intent is often not clear from either the text of the constitution or from the debates that took place at the time of the framing. We see this from our own heated discussion of the intent behind the 9th amendment. \n \n So what is the \"correct\" approach to interpreting the constitution? Good justices can and do differ on how they view the \"correct\" approach. If the Court adopts Justice Breyer's approach, does that really make the Court tyrannical? Or if the Court adopts Justice Scalia's approach, does that really make the court tyrannical? I think not. While I may prefer one approach over another, I think that either approach is valid. They are just different. I can think an approach wrong and a ruling wrong without seeing the approach as invalid or the ruling as tyrannical. An approach to interpreting the constitution can be valid even though I disagree with it. That's what I mean when I say that there is more than one valid way to interpret the constitution. There is no absolutely right way to interpret the constitution, and I accept as valid ways of interpreting the constitution with which I happen to disagree. Those ways do not represent tyranny; they are just different ways of interpreting the same document. \n \n Remember that the constitution itself is silent on how it should be interpreted.",

She of course will have to clarify her views and correct me where I misunderstand her views. \n \n Where I differ from Phyllis is that I see a range of approaches to constitutional interpretation as valid, even though I disagree with some approaches. Because the constitution itself never says how it should be interpreted, it's up to the justices to develop the approach to interpretation that they believe is most consistent with the constitution itself. I think so long as the justices are faithfully seeking to interpret the meaning of the constitution, they are using a valid approach, even though different justices use different approaches, and even though I personally may dislike or disagree with a particular approach. \n \n I also think that a Supreme Court ruling can be wrong, in my judgment, without being \"illegitimate.\" The Supreme Court consists of human beings who have to make judgments on complicated questions, based on a document whose specific meaning is often unclear. Often the justices have to find a balance between rights that appear to be in conflict. They come to their positions with different philosophies of constitutional interpretation. \n \n I think that to insist that only one approach to interpeting the constitution is the \"legitimate\" approach, and that other approaches are \"judicial tyranny,\" is to impose on the constitution a doctrine of interpretation that is not there. The constitution does not say that there is only one \"legitimate\" approach to interpreting it. The constitution says nothing at all about how it is to be interpreted. \n \n If some folks want to impose on the Supreme Court what they regard as the one \"correct\" method or approach to interpreting the constitution, then I recommend they propose this method of interpretation as a constitutional amendment. If they don't, then these folks are demanding that the Court adhere to their personal beliefs about constitutional interpretation without any basis for those beliefs in the constitution itself.",

She of course will have to clarify her views and correct me where I misunderstand her views. \n \n Where I differ from Phyllis is that I see a range of approaches to constitutional interpretation as valid, even though I disagree with some approaches. Because the constitution itself never says how it should be interpreted, it's up to the justices to develop the approach to interpretation that they believe is most consistent with the constitution itself. I think so long as the justices are faithfully seeking to interpret the meaning of the constitution, they are using a valid approach, even though different justices use different approaches, and even though I personally may dislike or disagree with a particular approach. \n \n I also think that a Supreme Court ruling can be wrong, in my judgment, without being \"illegitimate.\" The Supreme Court consists of human beings who have to make judgments on complicated questions, based on a document whose specific meaning is often unclear. Often the justices have to find a balance between rights that appear to be in conflict. They come to their positions with different philosophies of constitutional interpretation. \n \n I think that to insist that only one approach to interpeting the constitution is the \"legitimate\" approach, and that other approaches are \"judicial tyranny,\" is to impose on the constitution a doctrine of interpretation that is not there. The constitution does not say that there is only one \"legitimate\" approach to interpreting it. The constitution says nothing at all about how it is to be interpreted. \n \n If some folks want to impose on the Supreme Court what they regard as the one \"correct\" method or approach to interpreting the constitution, then I recommend they propose this method of interpretation as a constitutional amendment. If they don't, then they are demanding that the justices adhere to their beliefs about constitutional interpretation without any basis for those beliefs in the constitution itself.\n\n \n Well, all I can do is read Phyllis's posts and come to conclusions about what she means or implies. Sometimes, one reads between the lines, and it does seem to me the right gets exercised about results more than process. Maybe Phyllis is a conservative exception, but I just don't see it. I don't mean to get you involved in a discussion with or about Phyllis, however..\n \n As for your point about a court decision being wrong but not illegitimate, it's well taken. It depends also on the context. A court decision may be unjust -- for example the Hardwick sodomy case in Georgia -- but it may still be legally correct.",

I have criticized it over and over and over as being illegitimate. I have various times demonstrated my belief that whether a judicial decision is correct depends not on my personal individual political beliefs, but rather my conviction that there is a correct way to approach constitutional interpretation; that there is a particular goal which all interpretation is supposed to attain. That goal, I have contended, is simply to discover the original meaning of the text of the Constitution, and then apply that original meaning to individual cases. Legitimacy and correctness do not depend upon whether the decision results in \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" policies, but simply whether the court has interpreted the document according to the meaning of the text when it was adopted.\n \n Hence, for example, I reject the doctrine of substantive due process as illegitimate, and believe that any case that relies upon that doctrine as incorrect whether the case resulted in \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" policies in practice. Thus I have said that although I believe that we should adopt a policy and law that significantly prohibits abortion, the Constitution does not prohibit abortion even if Roe v.

Do stop accusing me, then, of holding the very opposite. Your repeated distortion of my view has led me to really question your intellectual integrity and honesty.\n\n \n I think you've been quite clear and consistent in articulating your position about constitutional interpretation. I see no reason for someone to regard your motivation as seeking a particular kind of result from constitutional interpretation. I think you are right that the constitution is neither conservative nor liberal; the framers sought to make the constitution neutral in that regard. The framers sought to enable the people, through the legislative branches, to enact laws that reflected their political views and priorities for the society, while at the same time protecting the rights of the people from abridgement by the majority, which they sought to secure with the Bill of Rights. Some of the framers initially believed that they could create a harmonious republic free of factionalism, a republic where different political parties would not exist and people would mostly agree on what policies would best serve the republic. This turned out to be wishful thinking. The framers also sought to make the constitution neutral on the issue of slavery, allowing slavery to exist, but also allowing for legislative action in the future to abolish slavery if that was what the people wanted to do. That turned out to be wishful thinking also, as legislative efforts to end slavery failed, and the constitution failed as an instrument to allow for peaceful change from slavery to freedom. That was the one time the constitution failed to enable the people to bring about change peacefully. \n \n With the ratification of the Reconstruction amendments, and of subsequent amendments protecting people's rights, I think the constitution gradually became more directly protective of people's liberties and less reliant on legislatures. If there was a broad trend brought about through constitutional amendments, it's that the constitution became more of a bulwark protecting liberty and the rights of the people against infringement by the majority. That new direction came about, I think, as a result of the tragic Civil War and Reconstruction eras and the recognition by Republicans in Congress at the time that legislative action alone does not always protect the rights of the people. It was not Supreme Court interpretation that brought about this change; it was constitutional amendments. Indeed, the Supreme Court of the late 19th century was reluctant, I think, to apply the Reconstruction amendments for the purposes for which the framers of the amendments envisioned them. The Supreme Court did not begin to interpret these amendments, especially the 14th and 15th amendments, as the framers had envisioned them, to protect the rights of ordinary people, until the mid-20th century, beginning with the Brown decision. In that sense, the Supreme Court lagged behind the framers of the 14th amendment and the people who passed and ratified the amendment. The Supreme Court did not catch up and interpret the amendment as the framers had intended, I think, for nearly a century. \n \n Yours, Phyllis, is one of the approaches to constitutional interpretation that I regard as valid. It is not the only approach that I regard as valid. That's because justices and scholars of good will, people who honestly seek to interpret the constitution as they understand it, can and do use approaches different from yours to interpret the constitution. Those approaches I regard as valid also.\n \n I am getting sleepy now, and I fear my analysis may be starting to make less sense. So I will say, \"Good night, all. Good night to Phyllis.\"",

I've never said one way or the other. Why?

I have gone to great lengths to argue this, even stooping so low as to make numerous replies to your numerous dishonest posts.\n \n \nWell, all you are doing is setting your opinion about approach and interpretation against that of the judges who considered the case.\n\n Yes, that is correct; that is all I have done.

Does anyone claim to know what the founders thought about them?\n\n There is nothing in the Constitution about \"equal rights\" for anyone. What the Constitution commands is the \"Equal Protection of the laws,\" which simply means that all the laws must be equally applied to everyone, including gays. It does not mean that everyone gets the same \"stuff\". The 14th Amendment establishes procedure, not substance.\n \n \nBut you only do this when you don't like the decision. When the Constitution says \"equal protection\", for example, you take up arms against decisions that extend this to gays.

Texas -- then it isn't an argument about whether the court is interpreting the meaning of the words correctly, it's one about the results of the decision.\n\n I have no idea really where you are getting this from. Of course \"equal protection of the laws\" applies to gays. I agree that the meaning of the text is crystal clear. It is crystal clear that \"equal protection of the laws,\" is, just like \"due process of law,\" a procedural guarantee and not a substantive one. It is interesting that you cite Lawrence v. Texas as an example of applying the clear meaning of the equal protection clause. It is interesting due to the fact that this case was decided not on Equal Protection grounds, but rather upon Due Process grounds.\n \n My disagreement with any court decision is not ever going to be based on whether it results in \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" policies. My disagreement with any court decision has been, and will always be, based upon whether the Court properly defined the original meaning of the legal text they are construing, and whether they properly applied that proper definition. When evaluating judicial decisions, results do not matter to me at all, except whether the result is consistent with the original meaning of the text.\n \n Here I've repeated my view again. There's really no excuse for you to get it wrong again.\n \n \nAnd here you neglect other issues of privacy and the right of people to be free from undue government interference. If the Constitution doesn't prevent the government from enacting draconian measures that restrict people's personal freedoms, then what use is it at all? Government doesn't have constitutional authority to enact any damn thing it pleases with respect to restriction of human rights.\n\n Government may exercise any authority delegated to it by the Constitution. Sorry, but the right to use contraceptives or have abortions simply cannot be found in the Federal Constitution, and thus both of these issues are left to the states.\n \n \nAs for your personal remarks, I do not believe I am misinterpreting your views at all.\n\n It does not matter what you believe about this. In this instance, my view trumps yours simply because it is my view. If one seriously questions an author's meaning, it is not only a common courtesy, but common sense, to defer to the author when possible. And it is emphatically possible in this case, where the author in question is me. But then again, your questions do not appear to be serious at all, so I guess common courtesy and common sense do not apply to you.\n \n Not only have I repeated and clarified my views, I have explicitly told you that you have been misinterpreting my views.

   "As I intimated earlier, it isn't fair to involve third parties in a disagreement, and hence cause them to choose sides. I'm not going to debate your view of Phyllis's opinions with you, and you are perfectly entitled to think and say what you want. :)\n\n \n My thinking here is that we should debate Phyllis on her terms, meaning the process that should be used to interpret the constitution and what impact this particular approach to interpretation might have on cases involving challenges to state or federal laws that are alleged to discriminate against gay people. \n \n As I think I have said clearly, I disagree with Phyllis' preferred process, the approach to constitutional interpretation that she regards as \"correct.\" I think this approach, the approach that looks to me to resemble the one championed by Justice Scalia, leads to a narrow and crabbed view of the constitutional protections for individual liberty and would overly limit the Court's power to apply the constitution to protect individual liberties from abridgement by majorities through the legislatures. \n \n I have said that while I think this is a wrong approach to constitutional interpretation, I see it as a valid approach. The distinction matters, because it means that while I do not agree with rulings that are based on this approach, I do not find those rulings \"illegitimate.\" They are legitimate because they have been made by the Supreme Court, chosen through the process laid out in the constitution, and there are different ways that justices, people of sound mind and good will, can interpret the constitution. Justices can make rulings that I regard as wrong without those rulings being \"illegitimate.\" \n \n I think you grasped what I was saying in drawing the distinction between a ruling that I think is wrong and a ruling that is \"illegitimate.\" Phyllis, as I understand her, sees just one \"correct\" way to interpret the constitution, and she has written that rulings not based on this approach to interpretation are \"illegitimate.\" That's like saying a law passed by a legislature that one disagrees with is \"illegitimate,\" because the legislators applied a philosophy of lawmaking that one sees as incorrect. There are different ways to approach lawmaking, and there are different ways to approach constitutional interpretation. Since the constitution is silent about how it should be interpretated, the question of how to interpret the constitution is entirely a matter of.....interpretation! Just as a law passed by a legislature may be, in one's view, wrong but still legitimate, a ruling by the Supreme Court may be, in one's view, wrong but still legitimate. \n \n Conservative activists go too far when they beat up the Supreme Court as \"tyrannical\" or its rulings as \"illegitimate\" simply because they disagree with those rulings. Good people can and do disagree. That doesn't make either the process or the results of a particular ruling \"illegitimate.\" This kind of over-the-top bashing of the Supreme Court as an institution is harmful, because it is saying, in essence, that unless the Supreme Court rules the way we want them to, using the process we view as the only \"correct\" one, they are tyrants and scoundrels. That kind of thinking let to white Southerners defying the Supreme Court's rulings on desegregation and using violence to prevent desgregation. \n \n I am not suggesting that Phyllis is a conservative activist who beats up the Supreme Court or who would ever refuse to abide by a Court ruling or would use violence in defying the Supreme Court. I don't know Phyliis personally, and I don't see any reason based on what she has written here to think that this is what she would do. I do think that the use of terms like \"illegitimate\" help feed the claims of those who say when it comes to the Supreme Court, \"My way or the highway.\" Terms like \"illegitimate\" applied to rulings serve to feed those who trash the Supreme Court as an institution simply because they disagree with the Court's approach to constitutional interpretation and/or the specific outcomes of Supreme Court rulings.",

Matthew's view of how to interpret the constitution, and I think probably Lesek's as well, is to view a major goal of the framers of these amendments as seeking to protect individual liberty against the tyranny of the majority. I have argued in a previous post that since the Civil War, and probably because of the experiences with states so blatantly denying the newly freed people any rights at all, constitutional amendments have been ratified protecting people's rights. The Reconstruction amendments were not applied as their framers intended by the Supreme Court for nearly 100 years after they were ratified. It was only with the appearance of the Warren Court that the Court majority began to rule that the constitution required equal treatment for all under the law. Steeeve and Phyllis have argued that equal protection does not mean equal treatment, but I think they are wrong about that. I think the framers of the 14th amendment clearly meant equal treatment under the law. They saw and were furious over the unequal application of the law to African Americans. Southern states were in the process of creating one body of laws for whites and a different body of laws for blacks. \n \n The equal protection clause requires equal application of the law, not an equal result of the laws. But discrimination by the states IS the unequal application of the law, treating one class of people differently from another under the law. It was the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment to stop the southern states from denying equal treatment under the law to African Americans and to anyone. \n \n Since the Civil War, a major goal of several constitutional amendments has been to ensure that the states, through their legislatures, do not deny to minorities equal treatment under the law. It was the Warren Court that first began to interpret these amendments as meaning what their framers actually intended. Modern conservative critics sometimes like to complain that the Warren Court went off on a wild hair inventing rights that the constitution does not protect. I think that's not true. The Warren Court began applying especially the 14th amendment as its framers intended: to ensure that people, notably minorities, are treated equally under the law. \n \n I think that Matthew, in his argument for guaranteeing equality, accurately captures the goal of the framers of the 14th amendment, and of other amendments as well. Since the Civil War, the constitution has shifted through amendments more toward protecting the rights of minorities from the tyranny of the majority. The constitution does leave to the states the decisions about many matters. But the constitution does not leave all decisions to the states; the constitution explicitly prohibits the states from denying to any person the equal protection of the laws. The constitution does not merely leave the protection of rights not explicitly named to the states for protection; the constitution, with the ratification of the 14th amendment, demands that the states treat all people equally under the law. \n \n Interestingly, a case can be made for Matt's argument about the constitution protecting equality using the original intent approach to interpreting the constitution, which is the approach advocated by Phyllis. I think it was the original intent of the framers of the 14th amendment to protect equality, in a broad sense, which is why they wrote the amendment using broad language. When the Supreme Court rules for equality and against discrimination on the basis of the 14th amendment, they are being consistent with the intent of the framers of the amendment, in my view.",

Whether they regarded due process as more than just procedural, protecting specific substantive rights, is less clear, I think. But I think it's a distortion of the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment to argue that they meant anything other than that the laws should treat people equally. They were furious about the discrimination aimed at the newly freed people in the southern states. \n \n Since the Civil War, a major goal of several constitutional amendments has been to ensure that the states, through their legislatures, do not deny to minorities equal treatment under the law.

The constitution does leave to the states the decisions about many matters. But the constitution does not leave all decisions to the states; the constitution explicitly prohibits the states from denying to any person the equal protection of the laws. That's not a procedural right; the framers of the amendment meant to stop the states from treating minorities as less than equal citizens and by a different set of laws than the majority white population. This was also true of the privileges and immunities clause, which was subsequently interpreted into irrelevance in the Supreme Court ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases. \n \n I think it's wrong for conservative activists to attack the Warren Court for allegedly abandoning the intent of the framers; I think they followed the vision of the framers of the 14th amendment and other post-Civil War amendments. This of course gets us back into the question of substantive due process and the incorporation of most of the Bill of Rights and application of those rights to the states. Did the framers of the 14th amendment intend to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states? There are scholars who say yes, they did. Did they believe in certain substantive rights that the constitution protects, even though these rights are not named in the constitution? There are scholars who say yes, the framers of the 14th amendment did believe in substantive rights, fundamental human rights, that they intended to protect with the broad language of the 14th amendment. \n \n Interestingly, a case can be made for Matt's argument about the constitution protecting equality using the original intent approach to interpreting the constitution, which is the approach advocated by Phyllis.

One school takes the position that the rights of the people are best left to the protection of the states, and that rights not specifically named in the constitution do exist but are up to the states to protect; they are not protected by the U.S. constitution. The other school takes the position that the rights of the people, especially minorities and people who are different from the majority in some way, must be and are protected by the U.S. constitution against abridgement by the states and by majorities. The specific constitutional basis for the latter school in modern constitutional interpretation is the 14th amendment and several other amendments, but most notably the 14th amendment. I personally agree more with the latter school than the former. It looks to me like Phyllis and Steeeve and Jyoshu agree with the former school, though they would have to clarify whether I am correct about this or not. Our debate over the 9th amendment that we had some time back was really a debate over this question of whether the constitution protects rights not specifically named in the constitution. Remember that debate over what Madison meant in his writings about protecting rights? That was an excellent debate that we had in here, and it was mostly without the personal attacks that folks sometimes slip into. \n \n Anyhow, since the 9th amendment has been left largely dormant in constitutional interpretation (some scholars have argued for reviving its use as a basis for the constitution protecting all rights), the 14th amendment has become the primary constitutional basis for the protection of individual rights broadly. That reflects, I think, an important change in the purpose of the constitution after the Civil War. I think that the impact of the Dred Scott ruling, the Civil War itself and the battles over emancipation, and the the struggles during Reconstruction over how the newly freed people would be treated legally in the South all had a profound effect on the reshaping of the constitution from that point forward. The 3 Reconstruction amendments, and especially the 14th amendment, represented a new purpose for the constitution in protecting the rights of minorities against the tyranny of the majorities in the states. No longer would the constitution leave the protection of individual rights to the states; it was clear from the behavior of the southern states during Reconstruction that the states themselves, reflecting the will of white majorities, were trampling the rights of minorities, not protecting them. The 14th amendment gave the U.S. constitution, and thus the federal government, a new purpose in protecting minorities against the tyranny of majorities in the states. It was written in broad language intentionally, to protect all of the rights of minorities, not just the rights listed in the Bill of Rights. That is how I read the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment. But right away, that purpose came into question. Did the 14th amendment then protect the right to vote of all citizens? Some of the Republicans in Congress argued that it did, while others said it did not....voting was still up to the states to determine. So the Republicans in Congress turned around and passed the 15th amendment to prevent states from denying the right to vote on the basis of race. \n \n In the subsequent decades, the Supreme Court did almost nothing to apply the 14th amendment to protect the rights of African Americans from state abridgement; in fact they did the opposite, allowing states to enact segregation laws. They also did nothing to apply the 15th amendment to protect the rights of African Americans to vote; they allowed states to enact disenfranchising laws like poll taxes and literacy tests and grandfather clauses. It was not until the late 1940s and especially the 1950s and early 1960s that the Supreme Court began to apply the 14th amendment as the framers had intended it: to protect the rights of minorities. \n \n The Supreme Court did, however, in the latter decades of the 19th century and into the 20th century, eventually apply the doctrine of substantive due process as an interpretation of the due process clause of the 14th amendment. This controversial doctrine was first applied in cases involving state laws to strike down laws that protected workers. The doctrine of substantive due process was applied to state cases to protect a specific liberty not named in the constitution: liberty of contract, which was the basis for the broader doctrine of laissez-faire. Liberty of contract was, according to the Supreme Court, an economic liberty. The 14th amendment's due process clause, said the Court, prevented the states from interfering with the freedom of employers and employees freely to contract as they chose. To write a maximum hours law or a minimum wage law impinged on the liberty of both employers and employees, a liberty that the constitution protected with the 14th amendment. Thus, in what came to be called the Lochner era, the Supreme Court began to strike down state laws that protected workers, thus applying the constitution to protect the right of \"liberty of contract.\"\n \n Progressives abhorred the Lochner ruling, because it seemed to prevent the states from doing anything to protect workers from exploitation from employers. But the interpretation of the 14th amendment as protecting \"liberty of contract\" as a \"substantive right\" protected by the 14th amendment was an important acknowledgement by the Supreme Court of the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment: to use the constitution, specifically the 14th amendment, to protect the \"fundamental rights\" of the people from state abridgement. The Supreme Court no longer recognizes \"liberty of contract\" as a constitutional right to be protected from state regulation, as it did in the Lochner era. The Lochner era ended when the Supreme Court changed course in 1937 and began giving Congress and the states wide latitude to regulate business in the public interest. But in the Lochner ruling, for all of its enshrining of conservative economic doctrine in the constitution, there lay an acknowledgement by the Supreme Court that the constitution protects, through the 14th amendment, rights of the people not specifically named in the Bill of Rights, and that it was no longer the exclusive role of the states to protect these unenumerated rights. \n \n While we can debate the merits and limitations of the doctrine of \"substantive due process\" till the cows come home, I think it's important to recognize that the Supreme Court, in applying the 14th amendment to protect the rights of minorities from their abridgement by state majorities, has acted consistently with the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment. The framers intended the 14th amendment to do precisely what the Supreme Court ruled that it does in the Brown decision and in other 20th-century civil rights cases involving not just African Americans but other minorities as well. The Supreme Court has applied the 14th amendment to protect the rights of the people, broadly, against state abridgement of those rights. One can argue over whether the framers of the amendment intended the due process clause to apply to specific \"substantive rights,\" and one can argue over what the framers intended for the privileges and immunities clause, which was essentially interpreted into non-existence by the Supreme Court ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases in the late 19th century. But I think if we use Phyllis' approach to constitutional interpretation, which is to go back to the intentions of the framers, we can go back not to Madison but to the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment, and of the 13th and 15th amendments as well, to see constitutional justification for the Supreme Court to rule to protect the rights of minorities, including rights not specifically named in the constitution itself, from abrogation by the states.\n \n The 14th amendment provides the foundation for the Supreme Court potentially, one day in the future, to strike down state laws that ban same-sex marriage as a violation of the equal protection of the laws, the same rationale they used to strike down laws that ban inter-racial marriage. Whether the Supreme Court will actually do this, I cannot say. But the constitutional foundation for doing it is there, and I think the opponents of same-sex marriage know it is there, which is why some of them want to amend the U.S. constitution to prevent same-sex spouses from marrying legally. The Supreme Court doesn't even have to apply the doctrine of \"substantive due process.\" All they need to do is to apply the constitutional principle of the equal protection of the laws.",

   "Btw, as an addendum to my previous post, it's not necessarily true that states will abridge the rights of gay people or that the Supreme Court will, one day, apply the 14th amendment to strike down state laws banning same-sex marriage. While more than half the states now ban same-sex marriage either by statute or by state constitutional amendment, some of the largest states in terms of population have moved in the other direction and have moved to protect the rights of gay people, including the right to marry or to have civil unions supposedly equivalent to marriage. While many states have been abridging the rights of gay people, some states have not, and they are highly populated states. Meanwhile, the record of the Supreme Court has been promising, but the makeup of the Supreme Court has recently shifted. The promising Supreme Court rulings have been Romer v. Evans, in which the Supreme Court ruled that a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring the enactment of laws that protected people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was unconstitutional under the 14th amendment. That was a very significant ruling, because the Supreme Court affirmed that the rights of gay people are protected from state abridgement by the 14th amendment; we are not strangers to the protections that the 14th amendment provides. The other significant and positive ruling was, of course, the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas striking down the previous Supreme Court ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick. Lawrence v. Texas affirmed that gay people do have the right to privacy, and there are those who dispute that there is a right to privacy. But the Supreme Court has found the right to privacy protected by guess what? The 14th amendment. \n \n Can you tell that I am in love with the 14th amendment? After I finish my current book project, which has been slowed by my raising a child, I may write a book on the origins of the 14th amendment.\n \n Oh, time to rouse the kiddo and get her off to camp.",

   "Again I ask them the question they have refused to answer: If the Constitution doesn't protect the rights of minorities against majority tyranny, then what is the point of it?\n\n I haven't seen this question before; perhaps I skimmed over it somehow. Let me try to explain at least my view. I cannot speak for steeeeve or jyoshu, though.\n \n Anyway, the question is not whether the Constitution protects the rights of minorities against majorities. To the degree that the Constitution protects individual rights, it protects everyone's individual rights, not just some perceived minority's rights. Hence, when the Constitution says in Amendment V that no person may be compelled to be a witness against himself in trial, that is a substantive right granted to all, not just a minority. You seem to think that this is a protection mainly against a majority enacting some statute which would compel the accused to testify against himself. I do not believe this to be so. It is a protection against that, and any other form of such behavior, whether it be imposed by a legislature (majority), or whether it be imposed by a trial judge (clearly not a majority).\n \n You see, majority is a very subjective term. It's scope depends upon the immediate context. Supreme Court cases are determined by a majority of the people comprising that court, yet we could hardly say that their decisions are majoritarian. Likewise, when the legislature enacts legislation, it also is not necessarily majoritarian. So what exactly do you mean by \"majority tyranny?\"\n \n In my view it is the process established by our federal and state constitutions that prohibits (or curtails) majority tyranny, as you put it. The Constitution clearly does not seek to prevent majority rule per se, otherwise it would not have established an amendment process whereby a certain majority could impose without impunity any law they wish to. The Constitution does, however, seek to prevent mob rule, and it does so by establishing not a direct democracy, but a constitutional republic.\n \n I think this is the only way it possibly could be; for there will never be agreement on what is a \"human right.\" It would be very strange indeed if there was a clause in the Constitution which explicitly read, \"All human rights are hereby guaranteed by this Constitution\" What the heck would that mean? That would be confusing enough were it explicitly written in the Constitution. And yet, what it seems many are proposing is that the 14th Amendment somehow does exactly that. That is implausible in itself. But some even carry the implausibility into a contradiction when they suggest that the judiciary is charged with protecting the human rights protected by the 14th Amendment (which, evidently, is all human rights), even though the text of the Amendment grants that responsibility to Congress.\n \n Nothing about the nature of lawyers or the judiciary leads me to believe that attorneys and judges are somehow better at determining what is a human right as opposed to, say, theologians, ethicists, philosophers, machine shop workers, grounds keepers, or baby sitters. The Constitution, therefore, sets up a process by which rights may be protected, mostly through strictly defined procedures, but it also establishes by those procedures a way to protect virtually anything under the sun through the amendment process.\n \n \nIt would be a worthless bit of paper that put no restrictions on government or legislative power at all. Anything a government or legislature said was Constitutional, unless expressly prohibited, would be, and that would so totally undermine the spirit of the document it would become worthless.\n\n First of all, there is absolutely nothing that keeps a legislature from acting in a way \"contrary to the spirit\" of the Constitution. Maybe it should not do that, but it is not barred from doing that. I could say that offering a plea bargain to a violent criminal is contrary to the spirit of justice, and yet prosecutors are certainly permitted to offer plea bargains. What prohibits a legislature from acting in a certain way is not some abstract notion of \"the spirit of the Constitution,\" but rather it is the Constitution itself. I do not think that this renders the Constitution to be a worthless piece of paper. Nobody believed that the Constitution did everything it ought to have done. That was not even the goal of its invention, as may be clearly seen in the fact that an amendment process was included. It was simply a document that did some things, and did not do other things. Good or bad, that is the case. We as a nation have many times perceived that it did some bad things, or simply needed a bit of tweaking here and there, and hence we changed the Constitution to accomplish those mostly worthy ends. What we did not do until fairly recently is endow a majority of the Supreme Court judges, a mere 5 people, to change the Constitution by re-interpreting the meaning of its individual phrases.",

What we did not do until fairly recently is endow a majority of the Supreme Court judges, a mere 5 people, to change the Constitution by re-interpreting the meaning of its individual phrases.\n\n \n The founders themselves wrestled with the question of how to prevent the majority from denying rights to minorities. James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper 51, \"It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part. If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure.\" Madison himself sought to write a constitution that would protect minorities from the potential tyranny of the majority. \n \n The legislative branch is an expression of majority will, of majority rule. The people elect the legislature, by majority vote in each district. Legislatures may act to preserve and protect minority rights, but they also may, and sometimes have, acted to deny minority rights. This was the reality faced by the framers of the 14th amendment: the systematic denial of rights to the newly freed people in the South by southern governments, acting on behalf of the white voting majority. Black codes, laws aimed at restricting the rights of the freed people and forcing them back into a condition close to servitude, prompted the Republicans in Congress to pass first a significant Reconstruction Act to stop this and then to include in the constitution itself a permanent protection for the rights of individuals from majority abrogation by state legislatures. It was not the Supreme Court that did this; it was the framers of the 14th amendment itself, who sought to prevent the states through majority legislatures from denying rights to individuals. The 14th amendment did not specify that ONLY those rights already protected from federal usurpation would be protected from state usurpation. The language of the amendment was and is broad intentionally. That was the framers' intention, if you look back at what the framers of the 14th amendment wrote and said. If your approach to constitutional interpretation is going to be original intent, then you have to look at the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, based on what they said. If you look at the context in which they drafted the amendment, they were quite clearly seeking to protect the rights of minorities against the tyranny of the majority, as that was the situation that African Americans were facing in the South at the time. \n \n It's also not true that the framers of the 14th amendment left it to Congress to protect the rights of individuals from state abrogation. The 14th amendment allows for Congress to enact legislation as a means to protect individual rights under the amendment, but the amendment does not require Congress to do so, nor does the 14th amendment require Congressional legislation to exist in order for the amendment to protect individual rights. The amendment itself protects those rights. The justices are not the protectors of rights; the constitution is the protector. The justices simply interpret the constitution and what it means in terms of protections. \n \n The 14th amendment did and does broaden the protections of the constitution for human rights. The framers of the 14th amendment quite clearly sought to stop and forever prevent the southern states from denying rights to the newly freed people. They did clearly intend to protect human rights from the actions of state legislatures. They wrote the amendment using broad language intentionally and purposefully. They were not seeking to limit the protections for human rights provided by the constitution, but to expand them. And they did expand them. You suggest here that the people have recourse to constitutional amendments if they want rights protected by the constitution. That is exactly what the 14th amendment is: a constitutional amendment providing for the protection of people's rights. You can't dismiss the 14th amendment simply because you may regard it as overly broad or its intentions as \"implausible\" in your judgment. The framers of the 14th amendment did as you have argued people must do: they changed the constitution for worthy ends, and those ends were to protect human rights from abrogation by the states. \n \n You write the following: \"What we did not do until fairly recently is endow a majority of the Supreme Court judges, a mere 5 people, to change the Constitution by re-interpreting the meaning of its individual phrases.\"\n \n That statement is simply not true. The Supreme Court throughout its history has reinterpreted the constitution, often by 5-4 opinions, and often to the chagrin of those who agreed with the dissenters. Look at the long history of justices interpreting and then re-interpreting the meaning of the commerce clause, for example. Chief Justice John Marshall, no modern figure, was accused by those who disagreed with him of exercising judicial tyranny and of changing the constitution by interpreting its phrases and clauses in particular ways. The idea that the Supreme Court suddenly in recent decades began \"changing the constitution by re-interpreting the meaning of its individual phrases\" is a myth. The Supreme Court has not changed the constitution at all, but the Court has over time changed its interpretations of what individual clauses and phrases mean, and that has been going on since Marbury v. Madison in 1803. \n \n No, the protection of liberties broadly was not a creation of the Supreme Court; it was a creation of the framers of the 14th amendment, which was approved by Congress and ratified by the states. For decades, nearly a century, the Supreme Court interpreted the 14th amendment so narrowly and contrary to the intentions of the framers of the amendment that the 14th amendment was largely ineffectual in protecting human rights at all. In the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court finally began interpreting the 14th amendment in ways consistent with the intentions of its framers. The change beginning in the 1950s was that they Supreme Court finally began to adhere to the original intent of the framers of the amendment, rather than ruling to allow states to evade the requirements of due process and equal protection with segregation laws covered by the fiction of \"separate but equal.\"\n \n Finally, the constitutional amendment process itself contains protections against majority tyranny in that the amendment process requires far more than a simple majority vote of any body. It's not a public referendum. The amendment process requires what amounts to a super-majority, first 2/3 of both houses of Congress and then ratification of 3/4 of the state legislatures. That's a very high bar to create an amendment. It's that way to prevent simple majorities, acting on popular prejudice or whims, from amending the U.S. constitution. It's why a federal marriage amendment has little chance of becoming part of the constitution, or why an amendment banning abortion has little chance of becoming part of the constitution. But the 14th amendment IS part of the constitution. \n \n From the point of view of those who oppose same-sex marriage, the 14th amendment is like a ticking time bomb. It's there, and it can serve as the constitutional basis for striking down the state laws that ban same-sex marriage, just as the 14th amendment served as the constitutional basis for striking down the state laws that banned inter-racial marriage. It seems that when justices rule in ways that reflect the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment, opponents of their rulings frequently accuse the justices of being tyrants and of changing the constitution. The justices have not done so. The framers of the 14th amendment itself changed the constitution, as did the members of Congress who voted for the amendment and the states that ratified it. The change was and is significant and real, and it was not a change created by judges. What the judges have done over the past half century or so is to finally catch up with the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment and apply the amendment to protect human rights as the framers of the amendment envisioned.",

   "It seems that when justices rule in ways that reflect the intentions of the framers of the 14th amendment, opponents of their rulings frequently accuse the justices of being tyrants and of changing the constitution\n\n \n It's just as problematic to assume that any case where opponents of rulings are really nothing more than just dislike of a ruling rather than accepting that they may have a point in that the SCOTUS can sometimes go too far. You seem to want to give the justices latitude to be above criticism or belief that they are going too far. SCOTUS judges are essentially a part of government. They are unelected, but that fact should (if anything) be cause for more cautiousness, not less. I think we should constantly keep government under a watchful eye for tyranny, and the judicial branch is no exception. For justices to have to put up with people's disapproval is hardly asking too much. They know what they are getting into when they accept the appointment, just as an elected legislator knows what they are getting into when they run for office. There's nothing unfair about it. To chalk every case of people considering the court tyrannical in its decisions as no more than mere disapproval of a case outcome is an oversimplification.\n \n It's true that people raise this sort of rhetoric when a case doesn't go their way. But it's no different than when people disapprove of, say, congress doing something that doesn't go their way, and considering *it* tyrannical for doing so.

I said that the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment was to protect rights of individuals broadly from state abrogation. Part of the 14th amendment is the equal protection clause, requiring that states apply the laws equally to all persons. In Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that the Virginia state law banning inter-racial marriage ran afoul of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. (They also ruled that it violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment.) Virginia argued that the law treated everyone equally because it prevented anyone from marrying someone of a different race. The Supreme Court did not accept this argument. In that sense, the case for states recognizing legal same-sex marriage is even stronger under the equal protection argument than was the case for states recognizing legal inter-racial marriage. No one is by nature oriented toward marrying someone of a different race. It's entirely a choice to marry someone of a different race; people do not have an inherent predisposition to do so. In the case same-sex marriage, gay people, as subset of the population, do have an inherent predisposition to seek to marry someone of the same sex; we are by nature oriented that way. Therefore, the case for striking down laws banning same-sex marriage based on the equal protection clause is even stronger than it was in the Loving v. Virginia case, where the Supreme Court struck down the Virginia law banning inter-racial marriage. \n \n Phyllis herself has said that she agrees with the ruling in Loving v. Virginia on equal protection grounds. She has acknowledged that the 14th amendment applies to marriage cases. To argue that it doesn't apply to marriage cases because the framers were not thinking specifically of marriage cases is to ignore the broad language of the 14th amendment, with its references to persons and equal protection of the laws. To say that the amendment applies only to the specific kinds of cases that were in the minds of the framers at the time would be to interpret the 14th amendment contrary to its broad language and would render the 14th amendment entirely inapplicable to most kinds of cases that come before the Supreme Court. The framers clearly intended the amendment to apply broadly, to whatever ways that states might deny to persons the equal protection of the laws. \n \n Yes, the 14th amendment is a sort of catch-all amendment, because of its broad language, which reflected the intent of the framers. They wrote the amendment in broad language intentionally. \n \n Of course, complicating all of this is the large body of precedent in rulings regarding the 14th amendment, generally known as stare decisis. The Supreme Court has its own body of precedent to work from and to direct how it interprets the amendment. The Supreme Court has traditionally interpreted the constitutional protection of individual rights to be not absolute. The Court uses a balancing test to weigh the rights in question being abrogated against the interest of the state in abrogating those rights. That's where the idea of \"strict scrutiny\" comes in, with certain forms of discrimination or rights violated requiring more of a state justification than others. This test and the judgment that some forms of discrimination require strict scrutiny is not in the 14th amendment itself; it has been developed by the Supreme Court over time. \n \n I actually like your second solution to the question of who can get married. If there is no harm, and both parties are consenting adults, why should they not be allowed to marry legally? There is a small movement in existence to try to win the right to first-cousin marriage. I recall reading that in some states, first-cousin marriages are legal, and in other states they are not legal. The first-cousin marriage movement folks argue that there is no rational basis for denying first cousins the right to marry. They argue that the primary reason that has been given for not allowing first-cousin marriages, that children may be born with physical defects, is not supported by research evidence, and the chances of this happening are miniscule. They make a compelling case. If there is no evidence that a particular kind of marriage will produce harm, then why should that kind of marriage between consenting adults not be recognized by the state?",

The framers of the amendment were results oriented. They gave the constitution a new purpose, I think, which was to protect the rights of the people from abrogation by the states. \n \n Your contrasting of race and marriage is a contrasting of two categories that are not equivalent. Race is a characteristic of people; marriage is a legal institution. The Loving v. Virginia case involved both race AND marriage, and Phyllis has said that she agrees with the ruling in that case. So she must think the 14th amendment equal protection clause DOES apply to marriage, since the Supreme Court applied it to marriage in that case, and Phyllis agrees with their ruling. But we should let her clarify her position on this rather than speculating about it.\n \n Now if you were to say that the framers of the 14th amendment intended it to apply to cases of discrimination on the basis of race, not sexual orientation, that's certainly true, since the framers of the 14th amendment never thought of sexual orientation. It was the newly freed people whose rights were being denied in the most blatant and horrifying ways by the southern states. The discrimination that the framers sought to eliminate was race discrimination, absolutely. \n \n But the language of the 14th amendment says nothing about race; it talks about persons. The framers of the amendment sought to protect all persons, a point that Phyllis made earlier. Yes, the framers were concerned immediately and specifically about protecting the members of a particular minority group; that is the historical context for the creation of the amendment. This is why we talked earlier about protecting minorities from the denial of rights by the majority. The framers of the 14th amendment wrote it in response to a minority facing the denial of rights by the majority. But as Phyllis noted earlier, the 14th amendment does not say that it protects only minorities, nor does it say that it protects only one specific minority. It refers broadly to persons. The framers of the amendment sought to prevent the states from denying to any person the equal protection of the laws. \n \n Contrast this with the language of the 15th amendment, in which the framers did specifically refer to race. In the 15th amendment, the framers sought to prevent the states from denying the right to vote specifically on the basis of race, and not on the basis of sex, which became a big issue at the time. It's interesting that women were intentionally excluded by the framers of the 15th amendment from the constitutional protection of the right to vote. But the 14th amendment due process and equal protection clauses were worded to guarantee rights to all persons, which included women. The framers of the 15th amendment could have written it in broad language, but they didn't. They could have said, \"The right of citizens to vote shall not be abridged or denied by any state.\" But they didn't use that broad language; they limited the protection of the constitution to prevent states from denying the right to vote on specific bases. That was their intent. The 14th amendment contains no such limits on which persons it protects. It simply refers to persons, with no qualifications and no exclusions in the due process and equal protection clauses.",

To argue against that is to say that they used broad language unintentionally and without purpose. Is that really what you want to argue? \n \n Congressman John Bingham of Ohio was the chief author of the 14th amendment. He said that his intent with the amendment was to protect the rights of all Americans, both natural rights and rights under common law. He said explicitly that his intent with the Privileges and Immunities Clause was to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply the protections of these rights to the states. He also said that the 14th amendment was not intended to protect only those rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Bingham said, for example, that the 14th amendment was intended to protect the right \"to work in an honest calling and contribute by your toil in some sort to the support of yourself, to the support of your fellowmen, and to be secure in the enjoyment of the fruits of your toil.\" In his statements before Congress and his speeches and writings, John Bingham, the chief writer of the 14th amendment, called for the amendment to protect rights broadly, and to protect the rights of all Americans. \n \n Bingham's statements were later dismissed by several constitutional scholars, who said that his writing was opaque and his thinking was muddled and inconsistent. Recently other scholars have sought to revive John Bingham's reputation and to take seriously his constitutional philosophy. They have been revisiting what Bingham said and wrote about the 14th amendment. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court initially refused to apply the 14th amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights, as its author had insisted. Instead, the Supreme Court began a gradual process of selective incorporation.\n \n To summarize, it appears to me that the principal author of the 14th amendment, John Bingham, did see the amendment as protecting rights broadly, including and going beyond protecting the rights named in the Bill of Rights. He did write the amendment in broad language intentionally and purposefully. Bingham saw the Privileges and Immunities Clause as the central and most significant section of the 14th amendment. Ironically, the Supreme Court early on in the Slaughterhouse Cases effectively rendered this clause meaningless, by interpreting it in a way that Bingham certainly never intended. \n \n Btw, Les, whom I have met, is not delusional. He may be mistaken about some things, as we all are, but that is not the same as being delusional.",

   "...\n\n \n \nI think there are two broad schools of thought about how the rights of the people are best protected in the U.S. governmental system. One school takes the position that the rights of the people are best left to the protection of the states, and that rights not specifically named in the constitution do exist but are up to the states to protect; they are not protected by the U.S. constitution.\n\n \n Well, that worked well in Colorado's Proposition 2, which had to be overturned by the Supreme Court! ;) Clearly, as you say, we cannot rely on individual states to protect the rights of citizens.\n \n \nThe other school takes the position that the rights of the people, especially minorities and people who are different from the majority in some way, must be and are protected by the U.S. constitution against abridgement by the states and by majorities.\n\n \n This is the sensible, pragmatic view. This is why the US Constitution, for all its occasional flaws, is admired throughout the West, and has been often emulated.\n \n \nThe specific constitutional basis for the latter school in modern constitutional interpretation is the 14th amendment and several other amendments, but most notably the 14th amendment. I personally agree more with the latter school than the former.\n\n \n A sound position to take, one in accord with the spirit of the Constitution. I don't deny that certain rights that ought, it seems to me, to be pretty self-evident to any unbiased, objective mind, have had to be reinforced or underlined by subsequent amendments -- e.g. voting rights. (Ironic that the Republican party originally argued it protected the right to vote while the Democrats did not -- those philosophical positions have been profoundly reversed, as the modern GOP seeks to undermine that right whenever it can.) However, I see this only as underlining positions that are already inherent in the structure of the document, so they cannot be misinterpreted by those malicious enough to try.\n \n \nThe 14th amendment provides the foundation for the Supreme Court potentially, one day in the future, to strike down state laws that ban same-sex marriage as a violation of the equal protection of the laws, the same rationale they used to strike down laws that ban inter-racial marriage. Whether the Supreme Court will actually do this, I cannot say. But the constitutional foundation for doing it is there, and I think the opponents of same-sex marriage know it is there, which is why some of them want to amend the U.S. constitution to prevent same-sex spouses from marrying legally. The Supreme Court doesn't even have to apply the doctrine of \"substantive due process.\" All they need to do is to apply the constitutional principle of the equal protection of the laws.\n\n \n Agreed. I don't believe the current Supreme Court would find for gay rights -- it's far too dominated by Catholic and Protestant fundamentalists. But I agree, the legal precedent is there -- and even more important for me, the rational basis -- for applying the equal protections argument. I would also invoke other constitutional rights the right-wing finds curiously controversial, such as the right to privacy -- but you anticipated me...\n \n \nThe promising Supreme Court rulings have been Romer v. Evans, in which the Supreme Court ruled that a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring the enactment of laws that protected people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was unconstitutional under the 14th amendment. That was a very significant ruling, because the Supreme Court affirmed that the rights of gay people are protected from state abridgement by the 14th amendment; we are not strangers to the protections that the 14th amendment provides. The other significant and positive ruling was, of course, the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas striking down the previous Supreme Court ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick. Lawrence v. Texas affirmed that gay people do have the right to privacy, and there are those who dispute that there is a right to privacy. But the Supreme Court has found the right to privacy protected by guess what? The 14th amendment. \n\n \n Exactly. Those are hard precedents to overlook, and are the significant ones -- Scalia was not, unusually enough, wrong about that.",

   "...\n\n \n \nAnyway, the question is not whether the Constitution protects the rights of minorities against majorities. To the degree that the Constitution protects individual rights, it protects everyone's individual rights, not just some perceived minority's rights.\n\n \n But it does, therefore, protect the rights of minorities against majority tryanny, because minorities are a part of \"everyone\".\n \n \nYou see, majority is a very subjective term.\n\n \n It's any required plurality in a vote. It's pretty well defined in law. \n \n \nSupreme Court cases are determined by a majority of the people comprising that court, yet we could hardly say that their decisions are majoritarian. Likewise, when the legislature enacts legislation, it also is not necessarily majoritarian. So what exactly do you mean by \"majority tyranny?\"\n\n \n I think it's very clear what is meant by majority tyranny: For example, the referendum that passed Colorado's Proposition 2 that singled out gays as not having equal protection of anti-discrimination laws was a clear exercise of majority tyranny. It's any law passed by whatever plurality is required that unreasonably restricts the rights of whatever minority it is that is subject to it.\n \n \nI think this is the only way it possibly could be; for there will never be agreement on what is a \"human right.\" It would be very strange indeed if there was a clause in the Constitution which explicitly read, \"All human rights are hereby guaranteed by this Constitution\" What the heck would that mean? That would be confusing enough were it explicitly written in the Constitution. And yet, what it seems many are proposing is that the 14th Amendment somehow does exactly that. That is implausible in itself. But some even carry the implausibility into a contradiction when they suggest that the judiciary is charged with protecting the human rights protected by the 14th Amendment (which, evidently, is all human rights), even though the text of the Amendment grants that responsibility to Congress.\n\n \n This is a weak argument. I agree that agreement on what constitutes a human right is difficult to achieve, and any consensus is likely to change from generation to generation, and culture to culture. That is precisely why the founders left the Constitution mostly vague on the issue -- it has to be interpreted and applied not in the context of the time in which it was written, but in the present day's. It's no use looking to the founders for guidance on how to deal with equal rights for gays, abortion, DNA privacy or therapeutic cloning, for example. Those are modern debates, and we should not be hide-bound by what (if anything) was thought about such issues in the past.\n \n A right is best defined, I believe, as whatever people say it is, albeit with important provisos to avoid arbitrary and ludicrous claims. First, it must be based on reasonable and rational grounds -- there must be a demonstrated need for something to be claimed as a basic right. Second, it cannot infringe already established rights acknowledged to be possessed by the people. If it passes these two tests, then it's up to the opponents to show that it shouldn't be recognised as a basic right, otherwise the notion of individual liberty is a joke, and I'd hate to live in any society that thought it was.\n \n So for example, the right of gay people to consummate their intimate relationships is only a very recently recognised right, but it's a right nevertheless, for all that it probably would not have been seen as such in the days of the founders. But so what? Obviously, it's a right in dispute by religious zealots, but conservatively speaking, the onus should be on them to demonstrate why it should be denied, without appealing to their divine scriptures. It's a conservative position for the courts to protect it, because it's an infringement of individual liberties to deny it, and acknowledging it harms no-one, nor infringes on any previous rights.\n \n If the Constitution cannot be read as protecting that right, then again I ask: What use is it? Why should gay Americans have to wait for an amendment specifically recognising them as human beings entitled to equal protection under law? Just because blacks and women had to? Is that reasonable?\n \n Let me remind you of what Martin Luther King said about justice: justice delayed is justice denied. Anyone with an ubiased mind reading the Constitution should be clear that gay peoplecannot be denied their rights. They shouldn't need to wait indefinitely until a majority maganimously agree to pass an amendment recognising them, the way women and blacks had to do. Let us at least learn some lessons from history, so we won't have to keep repeating it over and over again.\n \n \nNothing about the nature of lawyers or the judiciary leads me to believe that attorneys and judges are somehow better at determining what is a human right as opposed to, say, theologians, ethicists, philosophers, machine shop workers, grounds keepers, or baby sitters.\n\n \n Fine, I don't dispute that judges are in principle no better than any other educated member of the public, though they do tend to be more educated on the relevant issues than the average member of the population or legislature, which is an argument in their favour. They are more likely to have an understanding of the issues, though that is not guaranteed. So make the Supreme Court more representative of society. I certainly have no problem with that. \n \n However, it is not the Supreme Court that makes the initial determination of what a right is: it's the people who assert it, and none other. They and they alone have that right and responsibility, not those who would oppose them. The court is merely recognising their assertion (and that is all it can do, it cannot create rights out of nothing), and usually, it's relatively tardy, following rather than leading public opinion. Occasionally, as in Loving v. Virginia, it leads opinion, but in the case of gay rights, it has lagged lamentably. It's actually beginning to catch up, or was until the dreadful Bush maladministration.\n \n \nFirst of all, there is absolutely nothing that keeps a legislature from acting in a way \"contrary to the spirit\" of the Constitution. Maybe it should not do that, but it is not barred from doing that.\n\n \n It's enough to recognise that it shouldn't do that. Whenever it does that, it erodes the authority of the document, and that should be just as much a cause for concern as a misinterpretation of word or meaning. Pass laws contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and you will inevitably bring the document into disrepute as an irrelevant piece of rhetorical hypocrisy.",

   "I really don't think the 14th amendment was \"intended\" for the purpose of allowing other types of marriage besides what everyone understood as marriage at the time. (In fact its intentions had nothing to do with marriage of any kind.) To say that judges today are catching up with the intentions of the 14th's framers by allowing other forms of marriage is somewhat disingenuous. What is happening is that a group is simply trying to take advantage of a broadly worded amendment and fit their situation under its auspices. That's a strategy, pure and simple. Nothing wrong with that--people try to have their view carry the day all the time and to do so they try to find a constitutional basis depending on what's there. \n \n I think the 14th has come to be regarded in the sense of a catch-all amendment--almost a constitution in itself, and I suspect that was not what its framers intended at all. The reason it is the default 'fall-back' amendment is because it is so broadly worded. With the approach taken, it seems most any constitutional question could fall under its auspices. It seems te me that with the approach of using it for things like gay marriage, there would be no need for many of the other amendments.\n \n It may be that the only way this issue of marriage will ever really be resolved is to either a.) remove marriage benefits altogether, or b.) just make some sort of blanket rule that benefits can apply to any sort of situation that ever comes along whereby the participants call themselves 'married' (provided harm and consent issues are covered).\n\n \n Yes, if the only way of sticking gays in the eye is to abolish legal marriage, then legal marriage should be abolished! What a delicious line of reasoning -- let's cut off our straight noses to spite our gay faces. \n \n This is the ABM argument: Anything But (Gay) Marriage. It's as old as the hills, but much less salient. The 14th Amendment indeed has nothing to do with marriage. But if the government insists on recognising straight marriages, it needs a better reason to then turn around and deny gay marriages than \"My god dun tol' me it's a sin!\"\n \n That's the beauty of the 14th -- at a stroke, without any deliberate intention of the founders relevant to gay Americans whatever, it protects their rights anyway. The law is, in this case, blind to a person's sexual orientation, even though it was written long before the concept of sexual orientation was recognised as a basic social and biological fact. As soon as society developed a need for gay marriage, then it came already protected if the government chose to regulate marriage at all.\n \n Yet so many Americans are so horrified by the beauty and simplicity of their Constitution, because it mandates equal treatment for people they would rather treat as second class citizens -- for squalid religious reasons -- that they seek to ignore its clear provisions, or even, when they realise the provisions cannot be ignored, to remove gays specifically from the protections of the Constitution. Alternatively, they argue that marriage itself should be sacrificed on the altar of homophobia.\n \n While the founders certainly couldn't possibly have anticipated the gay rights controversy specifically, clearly they had such general controversies in mind where majorities attempted to restrict the rights of minorities, and now the anti-gay activists need to come up with an excuse for regarding gays differently from other American citizens.",

(Not the post directed to Steeeve, but the posts on the topic of the constitution, the 14th amendment, and protection for human rights.) As I read your posts, I thought of the ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, the ruling that the Supreme Court struck down in Lawrence v. Texas. In the Bowers majority opinion, the Supreme Court really did set gay people apart and made us strangers to the equal protection of the laws and to the protections provided by the constitution. The majority said explicitly that there is no right to privacy for same-sex relations. They carved out an exception to the protections of the constitution for gay people! Instead of ruling by interpreting the provisions of the constitution as they would and did in other cases, the majority justices turned to religious tradition and popular prejudice and opinion to guide their ruling. Their opinion said, in essence, that because in the Judeo-Christian tradition, homosexuality has been regarded as sinful, there is no right to privacy for same-sex relations as there is for opposite-sex relations. Popular religious beliefs about homosexuality trumped the protections of the constitution. \n \n The Supreme Court 17 years later recognized its terrible mistake and overturned their previous ruling, which is historic and praiseworthy. It's interesting to me that the Court that ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick was generally regarded as more liberal in its approach and rulings than was the Court that ruled in the Lawrence v. Texas case. In the Bowers case, a generally liberal Supreme Court reached the wrong result using wrong interpretation. In Lawrence v. Texas, though the dissenters were the most conservative justices, the Court looked beyond popular prejudice and interpreted the protections of the constitution to apply to all persons, not just persons that others approve of or that religious tradition approves of. They had paved the way for this, of course, with the important ruling in Romer v. Evans.\n \n I am sorry that Michael Hardwick, the gay man who was arrested and jailed for having sex with his partner in his own house and who brought the suit that led to the Bowers v. Hardwick ruling, died before the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas. He never lived to see the victory. Some years ago, I taped a television special on the Bill of Rights that included a Bill Moyers interview with Michael Hardwick. I still have that tape, which is terrific. Moyers asked Hardwick how he felt about losing the case in the Supreme Court. Hardwick answered that he had not expected to lose, and he thought the Court made the wrong ruling. Then Moyers asked him if he thought the system works, that the Bill of Rights works to protect human rights. Hardwick answered, \"Yes, I think it works.\" Moyers replied, \"Even though you lost?\" Hardwick answered, \"Yes, even though I lost. Some day another plaintiff may not lose. It's a good system.\" Hardwick, though he did not live to see it, turned out to predict the future accurately. Some day another plaintiff won, and the Court overturned the ruling in which he had lost. Notably, though he lost his case, Hardwick did not attack the Supreme Court as tyrannical or its ruling as \"illegitimate.\" Instead he said quietly, \"It's a good system.\" I agree with him about that.",

   "The founders themselves wrestled with the question of how to prevent the majority from denying rights to minorities. James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper 51, \"It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part. If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure.\" Madison himself sought to write a constitution that would protect minorities from the potential tyranny of the majority.\n\n This is not what I was disputing; what I was disputing is that the founders (Madison included) did this by placing \"all human rights\" in the Constitution. They did not do so. In fact, it would appear that Federalist 51 proves my point rather than dismisses it. For Madison follows by articulating how it is the structure of the (unamended) Constitution that accomplishes this. And of course, the Federalist Papers were a rigorous defense of the merits of the Constitution absent the Bill of Rights. Indeed, it argues that not only is a Bill of Rights unnecessary, but that it would be \"dangerous.\"\n \n \nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous.\n\n \n \nPhyllis has acknowledges that the 14th amendment equal protection clause applies to race...not marriage.\n\n Well, the Equal Protection clause applies to all laws. No state may \"deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.\" That is, any laws. The equal protection clause is (surprise) not a clause that requires neutral lines in statutes, but rather it requires that the statute merely be applied equally to all persons. Opposite-sex requirements in marriage do this, by the way.\n \n What I affirm is that the equal protection clause was clearly aimed at resolving racial classifications, essentially moving those (but only those) as out of bounds. Loving was correct on Equal Protection grounds not because marriage wasn't being given to all (it wasn't even after Loving), but because certain marriage statutes made a racial classification. I reject the claim that the Equal Protection clause gives judges the authority to examine what statutory classifications are \"reasonable\" and which are not.\n \n \nFurthermore, your answer to this question was far more complicated than it had to be. The very main purpose of the constitution was to set up a system of government. Above all that is the purpose. In doing so it did many more things...one of which was to provide some protections to the minority but it did not give absolute power to the minority because this is idiotic.\n\n I don't disagree with this. But it appears that Lesz believes that if the Constitution does not protect \"all human rights\" (which according to his own definition are not actually real, but merely social constructs) then it can have no value. Which seems only to be another way of saying that if a Constitution does not empower a very small number of highly educated and massively unrepresentative ivy league lawyers to enforce what they subjectively and magically discover to be a \"human right\" against any duly elected and accountable legislative body, then it is a useless piece of paper. \n \n The problem with that is that the Constitution does not so empower judges, and it is a very useful and valuable piece of paper nonetheless.",

   "It's any required plurality in a vote. It's pretty well defined in law.\n\n In some cases the pluarality required is 50 plus one percent. In others, it is 2/3, in others 3/4.\n \n A simple example is that we may by constitutional marriage prohibit marriage altogether. Majority tyranny? Evidently not by the framer's understanding.\n \n \nI think it's very clear what is meant by majority tyranny: For example, the referendum that passed Colorado's Proposition 2 that singled out gays as not having equal protection of anti-discrimination laws was a clear exercise of majority tyranny. It's any law passed by whatever plurality is required that unreasonably restricts the rights of whatever minority it is that is subject to it.\n\n Unreasonable by whose standard? 5 judges, evidently.

That is precisely why the founders left the Constitution mostly vague on the issue -- it has to be interpreted and applied not in the context of the time in which it was written, but in the present day's.\n\n So in one context, the Constitution forbids racial discrimination. But some time in the future, without any change of the text, it might allow racial discrimination depending on whether 5 judges happen to think it necessary to the context? That doesn't sound to me like a very strong protection to minority (actually, more precisely, individual) rights.\n \n \nIt's no use looking to the founders for guidance on how to deal with equal rights for gays, abortion, DNA privacy or therapeutic cloning, for example. Those are modern debates, and we should not be hide-bound by what (if anything) was thought about such issues in the past.\n\n There is a distinction between the meaning of a text, on the one hand, and the application of the text on the other. I am not suggesting that we apply what the founders thought about gays, for instance, to today. Rather I am suggesting we discover the original meaning of the text, and then apply that to new cases. Hence, when the fourth amendment bars unreasonable searches and seizures, we can know that it bars the government from using infrared technology to view the inside of a home unless a warrant has been issued even though the framers never discussed the issue. See Kyllo v. United States, for example.\n \n \nSo for example, the right of gay people to consummate their intimate relationships is only a very recently recognised right, but it's a right nevertheless, for all that it probably would not have been seen as such in the days of the founders. But so what? Obviously, it's a right in dispute by religious zealots, but conservatively speaking, the onus should be on them to demonstrate why it should be denied, without appealing to their divine scriptures. It's a conservative position for the courts to protect it, because it's an infringement of individual liberties to deny it, and acknowledging it harms no-one, nor infringes on any previous rights.\n\n Is this a reference to Lawrence v. Texas? If so, insofar as that case relied on substantive due process, it was not decided correctly. That is the whole argument that I have made.\n \n \nIf the Constitution cannot be read as protecting that right, then again I ask: What use is it?\n\n Oh, I see. If the Constitution does not give you everything you want, then it is useless. Well, the Constitution does not give me everything I want, but I don't consider it useless. I also get the feeling that the Constiuttion does not give steeeeve or jyoshu everything they want, and I'll go out on a limb and say that neither of them would therefore think it useless.\n \n \nWhy should gay Americans have to wait for an amendment specifically recognising them as human beings entitled to equal protection under law? Just because blacks and women had to? Is that reasonable?\n\n Gay americans don't have to wait for an amendment specifically recognizing them as entitled to equal protection of the laws. They already have it, just as every person does.\n \n \nThey shouldn't need to wait indefinitely until a majority maganimously agree to pass an amendment recognising them, the way women and blacks had to do. Let us at least learn some lessons from history, so we won't have to keep repeating it over and over again.\n\n Maybe they shouldn't have to wait for an amendment in order to have same-sex marriage. But, good or bad, that is what the Constitution requires, that is if you want to have it federally recognized.\n \n \nSo make the Supreme Court more representative of society. I certainly have no problem with that.\n\n More representative in what way? By increasing its numbers? By having them elected by the people? By making a sort of super legislature? I don't see how that really gets you anywhere; for your argument is that the most representative body of government possible in our system cannot be relied on to protect rights. So how does making the Supreme Court look more like Congress remedy that?",

   "Quotes from Phyllis are in purple, and an older quote from Phyllis is in blue. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316479]This is not what I was disputing; what I was disputing is that the founders (Madison included) did this by placing \"all human rights\" in the Constitution. They did not do so. [QUOTE]\n \n You wrote the following, in which you certainly appear to dispute the argument that the constitution protects minorities from abrogation of rights by the majority. My quotation from you is in italics and in blue. I was responding to this: \n \n Anyway, the question is not whether the Constitution protects the rights of minorities against majorities. To the degree that the Constitution protects individual rights, it protects everyone's individual rights, not just some perceived minority's rights. Hence, when the Constitution says in Amendment V that no person may be compelled to be a witness against himself in trial, that is a substantive right granted to all, not just a minority. You seem to think that this is a protection mainly against a majority enacting some statute which would compel the accused to testify against himself. I do not believe this to be so. It is a protection against that, and any other form of such behavior, whether it be imposed by a legislature (majority), or whether it be imposed by a trial judge (clearly not a majority).\n \n You see, majority is a very subjective term. It's scope depends upon the immediate context. Supreme Court cases are determined by a majority of the people comprising that court, yet we could hardly say that their decisions are majoritarian. Likewise, when the legislature enacts legislation, it also is not necessarily majoritarian. So what exactly do you mean by \"majority tyranny?\"\n \n You went on to make your argument that Madison did not protect all human rights with the constitution, but your initial argument was a dismissal of Madison's concern for the majority denying rights to minorities. He used the terms \"majority\" and \"minority.\" \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316479]In fact, it would appear that Federalist 51 proves my point rather than dismisses it. For Madison follows by articulating how it is the structure of the (unamended) Constitution that accomplishes this. And of course, the Federalist Papers were a rigorous defense of the merits of the Constitution absent the Bill of Rights. Indeed, it argues that not only is a Bill of Rights unnecessary, but that it would be \"dangerous.\"[QUOTE]\n \n This is the point we argued about at length in our debate over the meaning of the 9th amendment. I can present a strong case that this is NOT what Madison sought to do. But let's accept your point about Madison's intentions for the sake of argument. \n \n Madison did not write the 14th amendment. Madison was not alive any longer in 1868, and neither were the others of the founding generation. My argument to you, which I have been making here, is that you have to reckon with the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, and it was not the same intent that Madison had. One clear intent was to use the U.S. constitution to prevent the states from denying rights to the people. John Bingham, the writer of the 14th amendment, argued quite clearly that he wanted to apply the Bill of Rights to the states, and he went on to argue that the 14th amendment protected rights beyond those enumerated in the Bill of Rights. \n \n You can't just go back to Madison as though the constitution was never subsequently amended. The 14th amendment represented a huge and important change in the nature of the constitution. With the 14th amendment, the constitution no longer left the protection of rights to the structure of government, no longer restricted only the federal government from denying certain rights. With the 14th amendment, the constitution came to protect the people's rights from state abrogation. You have to reckon with this. You cannot pretend the 14th amendment was never ratified. And the 14th amendment represented a huge change, in my view, in the purpose of the constitution and in how it protected rights. It extended the federal protection of rights and limited the power of the states to deny rights. The Supreme Court then turned around and interpreted the 14th amendment so as largely to eviscerate this purpose, which had been clearly stated by the man wrote the amendment. Only in the mid-20th century did the Supreme Court begin to interpret the 14th amendment as its framers had intended it. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316479]Well, the Equal Protection clause applies to all laws. No state may \"deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.\" That is, any laws. [QUOTE] \n \n Right. Including marriage laws. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316479]The equal protection clause is (surprise) not a clause that requires neutral lines in statutes, but rather it requires that the statute merely be applied equally to all persons. Opposite-sex requirements in marriage do this, by the way. [QUOTE]\n \n Wrong. You are making the same argument here that the state of Virginia made in its claim that its marriage law banning inter-racial marriage was applied equally to all persons, because no one was permitted by law to marry someone of a different race. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in the Loving v. Virginia case. You appear to be making this same argument about same-sex marriage: that the laws banning same-sex marriage apply equally to all persons, because no one is permitted by law to marry someone of the same sex. It's the identical argument that Virginia made and that the Supreme Court rejected. \n \n How is it that you can support the ruling by the Supreme Court in the Loving v. Virginia case on equal protection grounds and then turn around in same same-sex marriage cases and make the same losing argument that the state of Virginia made in the Loving case? How were the anti-miscegenation laws an unequal application of the law, while, as you claim, the anti-same-sex marriage laws are an equal application of the law? This is inconsistent, and it makes no sense. Please don't argue here that one is about race and the other one isn't, because that's not the point you are making in this last paragraph. You are essentially agreeing with the Supreme Court that the anti-miscegenation laws, which were equally applied to everyone, were a denial of equal protection, while you are arguing that the anti-same-sex marriage laws are not a denial of equal protection. How do you explain the contradiction in your position? \n \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316479]What I affirm is that the equal protection clause was clearly aimed at resolving racial classifications, essentially moving those (but only those) as out of bounds. Loving was correct on Equal Protection grounds not because marriage wasn't being given to all (it wasn't even after Loving), but because certain marriage statutes made a racial classification. I reject the claim that the Equal Protection clause gives judges the authority to examine what statutory classifications are \"reasonable\" and which are not. [QUOTE]\n \n The problem with this argument is that it is based neither in the text of the 14th amendment nor in the statements of the framers of the 14th amendment. As I have pointed out in several posts, nowhere does the 14th amendment ever mention race or racial classifications (in contrast to the 15th amendment). John Bingham, who wrote the 14th amendment, never said that it was limited to race discrimination, even though this was clearly the form of discrimination that he and other Republicans in Congress were seeking to address. Bingham said clearly that the purpose of the amendment was to protect the rights of all persons from state abrogation. He never said only persons facing discrimination on the basis of race, though he obviously saw, given the context of time, the blatant and horrifying results of race discrimination. His immediate target was race discrimination, clearly. His broader long-term aim, which he stated very clearly in speeches before Congress and at other times, was to empower the national government to prevent the states from denying rights to any person. \n \n Your interpretation of the 14th amendment appears to be far narrower than the framers of the amendment intended. Your narrow reading is inconsistent with of the language of the amendment itself. The intent of the framers of the amendment was to use the power of the constitution to prevent the states from denying rights, all kinds of rights, according to John Bingham, to any person. The language in the amendment reads \"any person.\" The Supreme Court in the mid-20th century finally began to read the 14th amendment in the expansive way that its framers intended and that is reflected in the broad language of the amendment itself. \n \n It would be nice if the Supreme Court one of these days would overturn the interpretation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in the majority opinion in the Slaughterhouse Cases and apply this most significant portion of the amendment as its chief framer, John Bingham, intended it.",

They already have it, just as every person does.\n\n \n Phyllis, I want to be gentle about this and not get angry. My reaction to your last statement was initially anger at a statement that seemed both insensitive to other people and absurd. But I have to recognize that people who are not gay mostly have no idea how intense and how terrible the discrimination is that we face, unless they experience it through family members or close friends. Much of the discrimination is social, not legal. But the social discrimination is bolstered by the legal discrimination, and the legal discrimination alone has terrible effects on us and on our families. \n \n There is no doubt that gay people are denied the equal protection of the laws. Just about any gay person will acknowledge that. It's not as bad as it was even 10 years ago, of course. The recent Supreme Court rulings in Romer v. Evans and Lawrence v Texas, and on the state level in Massachusetts and California have brought very positive changes for us. We can get married now! Not everywhere, but somewhere. We could never get married before. \n \n Oh, sure. You can argue that the marriage laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman are \"equally applied,\" but it's not true. That's a legal fiction. In most states we gay folks are effectively barred from civil marriage. To have the \"right\" to marry someone we don't love is no right at all. And without the right to marry our REAL spouses, the ones we choose and love and raise our children with, there is no right of marriage for gay people. We remain strangers to the law. To interpret the 14th amendment so narrowly that \"equal protection of the laws\" permits this kind of discrimination to continue is, frankly, unconscionable. It is using a legal fiction, a legal fig leaf, to cover the truth of the discrimination. \n \n The truth is that because of popular prejudice, gay people are not permitted to marry our spouses civilly in most states of the United States. To be blase about this, and say, \"Well, you have the equal protection of the laws\" is both disingenous and uncaring, in my view. Not to have the right to marry one's beloved spouse and to protect one's children and family is a terrible form of discrimination. It has awful effects on people. It negatively affects our children.\n \n Imagine you were denied the right to marry the person you loved and wanted to marry. Imagine that any person you might love or want to marry would never be able to marry you. Imagine you are forever excluded from marrying. Is that the \"equal protection of the laws?\"\n \n I'm sure that you and Jyoshu and Steeeve have each experienced discrimination and exclusion and slings and arrows aimed at you. I'm sure that you understand what that is like. If so, how can you be so dismissive of the pain and the second-class citizenship suffered by gay people? Not so long ago, gay people were being arrested merely for gathering in public. Not so long ago, gay people feared being beaten to death for walking down the street with a spouse. Not so long ago, I was nearly beaten to death for walking out of a lesbian bar. And it still happens today. Gay people are still being killed for being who we are. Gay people are still losing our jobs for being who we are. Gay people are still denied the opportunity to marry and raise families because of who we are. The burden has lessened, as people have to come to recognize the injustice of the discrimination. Some of the laws that used to discriminate against us are now gone. But some remain, notably the laws that do not permit us to marry the person we love, the person we want to marry. And that is terrible discrimination, never to be able to marry and raise a family. It's not a small matter. \n \n Because we are all human, our knowledge is always partial. We humans are not always compassionate because we often do not know what others experience. This is true of all of us. So while I am dismayed by what I perceive as your lack of compassion for gay people, your willingness to dismiss and to argue away the real and terrible legal discrimination we experience, I understand that we are all human and we don't know everything. \n \n I am asking you to listen a little harder to the gay people here, to work a littler harder to understand what gay people go through. I have come to like you a great deal, and to respect your thinking, even though I disagree with much of what you think. I am asking you now to take more seriously than you appear to from this post the discrimination and the suffering that gay people face. It may not change your thinking about the constitution, which is not really the point anyway. But it may make you a little more understanding of the lives of gay people. And I promise to work harder to understand the viewpoints of those with whom I disagree, or whose lives and life experiences and ways of thinking differ significantly from my own. \n \n Thanks for listening.",

I have gone for walks with him, and we have had long talks about everything under the sun. To call him \"delusional\" is certainly not accurate or \"spot on.\" He is not delusional. He is intelligent, charming, articulate, and thoughtful. He is also well-educated. He and I have had some whopper disagreements on various topics back in the New York Times forums.

And if you are the person being disbelieved, it's frustrating, because nothing you say can change the other person's mind. \n But is disbelieving someone \"mean-spirited?\" I don't think so necessarily.

   "[QUOTE=jyoshu;316505]Not to intrude, but why should that make you angry? You yourself believe you already have an amendment (as she said) guaranteeing your equal protection of the laws, don't you? [QUOTE]\n \n I do think the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment requires equal treatment under the law for gay people, including the equal right to marry our spouses. But state laws have to be challenged in the courts before the justices evaluate their constitutionality and either strike them down as unconstitutional or not. The laws barring same-sex marriage have yet to come before the Supreme Court. \n \n I think it's important for people to understand what it means to people to be denied the right to marry. Heterosexuals usually take for granted that they can marry the person they love and protect their families by law. Gay people are denied that right in most states. Some people claim that we have the same marriage rights as heterosexuals have, but that's nonsense. That's like telling a person who cannot walk that he has the same right to climb the stairs of the courthouse as anyone else, and he should not complain that there is no elevator and he cannot get up the stairs. He may have the same right to climb the stairs as anyone else, but he is not the same as most other peope, and for him, the right to climb the stairs is meaningless. Gay people are not the same as heterosexuals, and so the laws that are supposedly the same in how they apply to all actually apply to gay people far differently than they do to heterosexuals. To heterosexuals, the laws guarantee a right to marry the person they love. To gay people, the laws bar us from ever marrying someone we love. \n \n If that is not the unequal protection of the laws, then I don't know what is.\n \n As for compassion, I cannot judge the depth of anyone else's compassion. Only they can do that. I also don't think you can argue constitutional principles in a vacuum, ignoring the real lives of the people whose rights the constitution is supposed to protect and whose lives the rulings directly affect. We do not live in a purely theoretical world; we live in a real world of flesh and blood human beings who are done real harm by the discrimination that they may experience.\n \n Marriage is a serious thing, not just something we want to extract from the constitution \"illegitimately.\" To wish to marry the person we love is not like wishing we could shop at Wal-Mart for anything we want. The suggestion that we just want what we want is dismissive, I think, of the enormous significance of marriage for real human beings and our families. Being denied the right to marry has had a profoundly negative impact on gay people and our families. That is what people need to listen to and hear: the real human effects of this discrimination under the law, this unequal application of the law to gay people. \n \n The purpose of the 14th amendment was, and still is, to prevent the state legislatures from denying to any person the rights protected by the Bill of Rights and other rights as well. That was the intent of the framers of the amendment. To interpret the amendment so narrowly that it protects almost no one's rights is to subvert the intentions of those who crafted the amendment and pushed it through to ratification. \n \n There probably is no other amendment needed to prevent the states from denying rights to the people. The 14th amendment is sufficient. It is broad, and its framers intended it to be broad. Phyllis presented us with her approach to constitutional interpretation. She said that to interpret the constitution correctly, we should look to the intent of the framers and to the text of the constitution. If we look at the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, we see that they intended the amendment to protect rights broadly and to apply to all persons. If we look to the text of the amendment, we see broad language, and we see that the amendment applies to all persons. It never mentions race or racial classifications. By Phyllis' own standard of constitutional interpretation, the understanding of the amendment as protecting rights broadly is the correct interpretation.",

   "You went on to make your argument that Madison did not protect all human rights with the constitution, but your initial argument was a dismissal of Madison's concern for the majority denying rights to minorities. He used the terms \"majority\" and \"minority.\"\n\n Actually I was using my own words to describe majority tyranny as opposed to majority rule. Granted I did so in perhaps an unusual way, but if I recall correctly I was rather tired when I made that post. Anyway, I'll leave this one where it is.\n \n \nThis is the point we argued about at length in our debate over the meaning of the 9th amendment. I can present a strong case that this is NOT what Madison sought to do. But let's accept your point about Madison's intentions for the sake of argument.\n\n The text in question was the federalist papers, which in general argue for the merits of a Constitution which did not contain a Bill of Rights, and indeed a specific quote from the text of the Federalist Papers made this abundantly clear:\n \nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous.\n\n If you want to counter this--if you can make a strong case for the opposite--then I would sure welcome it. Specifically if the case can be made using the framer's actual words, and not just the scholars' presentation.\n \n \nWith the 14th amendment, the constitution came to protect the people's rights from state abrogation. You have to reckon with this. You cannot pretend the 14th amendment was never ratified.\n\n I have not ignored this important fact. Your argument appears to me to be that the 14th Amendment protects \"all rights.\" And, not only does it protect all rights, but that it grants the judiciary the unitary power to declare what rights are part of the elusive \"all rights.\"\n \n Of course a consequence of this--if the rights granted are only those interpreted by the judiciary--then what the Supreme Court interprets as a protected right in, say, 1967 (no racial classifications for marriage) might one day be reinterpreted by the judiciary in 2067 to mean the exact opposite. This, ironically, leads to the possibility that the Supreme Court may legitimately re-interpret the 14th amendment to mean the exact opposite of its clear intention: to remedy racial classifications.\n \n \nIt extended the federal protection of rights and limited the power of the states to deny rights.\n\n Certain rights. Not \"all rights\" in general.\n \n \nWrong. You are making the same argument here that the state of Virginia made in its claim that its marriage law banning inter-racial marriage was applied equally to all persons, because no one was permitted by law to marry someone of a different race. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in the Loving v. Virginia case.\n ...\n How is it that you can support the ruling by the Supreme Court in the Loving v. Virginia case on equal protection grounds and then turn around in same same-sex marriage cases and make the same losing argument that the state of Virginia made in the Loving case?\n \n\n Correct, the court did decide for Loving, but not for the reason you have articulated here. On the Equal Protection analysis, interracial marriage prohibitions were rejected not because the argument that the law applies to all the same way is invalid, but rather because the classification was based upon race. That racial classifications are unacceptable derives directly from the context and history of the amendment, and is reflected as early as the Slaughterhouse Cases. Insofar as opposite-sex statutes do not discriminate on those grounds, than equal application is all the Equal Protection clause demands.\n \n Much as you seem to think that it is, the Equal Protection argument in Loving vs. the Equal Protection argument in same-sex marriage cases is not the same. The racial classification makes all the difference. And it is precisely this reason that age requirements, consanguinity requirements, number of persons requirements, and opposite-sex requirements in marriage are valid classifications under the Equal Protection clause.\n \n \nPlease don't argue here that one is about race and the other one isn't, because that's not the point you are making in this last paragraph. You are essentially agreeing with the Supreme Court that the anti-miscegenation laws, which were equally applied to everyone, were a denial of equal protection, while you are arguing that the anti-same-sex marriage laws are not a denial of equal protection. How do you explain the contradiction in your position?\n\n Yes, indeed that is my point; racial classifications are prohibited by the Equal Protection clause (even though the Court has been somewhat inconsistent on this clear point in recent times). All other classifications are valid under the Equal Protection clause if they apply equally to everyone. This would appear to be the reason that, rather than re-interpreting the 14th Amendment to guarantee the franchise to women, a Constitutional amendment had to be passed. But let's simply consider a relevant part of the Loving decision, paying close attention to what I have underlined.\n \n \nBecause we reject the notion that the mere \"equal application\" of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations, we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose.\n\n \n The problem with the Virginia statute was its racial classification, which have been treated differently than any other classification from the first case involving the Equal Protection clause.\n \n \nThe problem with this argument is that it is based neither in the text of the 14th amendment nor in the statements of the framers of the 14th amendment.\n \n It is based on the history of the amendment, as well as the construction of the Equal Protection clause from the very first case it was employed.",

Perhaps I wasn't clear with my meaning?\n \n As you know, however, I have also argued that a new amendment needs to be passed in order to guarantee same-sex marriage at the federal level (which would, by definition, apply to all as well). This, then, is right on par with our discussion about Constitutional construction. In other words, I do not believe that Equal Protection of the laws means that if there is opposite-sex marriage, then there must be same-sex marriage.\n \n All I can say is please don't read that much into my posts. We are having a discussion about the Constitution, and I would advise you the same as I have tried to advise Lesz: please do not try to derive my personal attitudes or beliefs from what I say about Constitutional interpretation, or the methods by which I choose to articulate my view, and challenge the views of others.\n \n \nI have come to like you a great deal, and to respect your thinking, even though I disagree with much of what you think.\n\n And I you as well.\n \n \nShe said that to interpret the constitution correctly, we should look to the intent of the framers and to the text of the constitution.\n\n Actually, I do not believe I said this. I said that we should look at the original meaning of the text, which may or may not correspond with the intent of the framers. More than the framers were involved in giving the Constitution the force of law, and hence seeking original meaning is broader than simply looking to the intent of the framers. And of course, we certainly should look to the text of the document.",

   "[QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]The text in question was the federalist papers, which in general argue for the merits of a Constitution which did not contain a Bill of Rights, and indeed a specific quote from the text of the Federalist Papers made this abundantly clear:\n \n If you want to counter this--if you can make a strong case for the opposite--then I would sure welcome it. Specifically if the case can be made using the framer's actual words, and not just the scholars' presentation.[QUOTE][/COLOR][/COLOR]\n \n I am well aware that Madison initially as well as others among the framers of the constitution opposed including a Bill of Rights, because they feared that no list of enumerated rights was necessary, that the constitution already protected the rights of the people through the structure it created and that creating a list of rights would leave out rights and lead to the mistaken notion that these were the only rights that the constitution protected. They feared that listing rights would imply that the federal government had the power to deny these rights in the first place, which they insisted it did not. They believed that the constitution already protected all the rights of the people. \n \n Madison changed his thinking on this and grew to accept the idea of adding a Bill of Rights. He became a drafter of amendments that came to be known as the Bill of Rights. He thought that the 9th amendment would serve to prevent what he and other framers who had opposed a Bill of Rights had feared. Here is where several of us have debated Madison's view of the 9th amendment, way back when. We don't need to go over that ground again. Suffice it to say here that I am well aware of that history. But that's all prior to the 14th amendment, which brought a profound change in the constitutional protection of rights. \n \n As it turned out, there was a need for a Bill of Rights, and the structure of the constitution and the government did NOT by itself protect the rights of the people. And by the time of Reconstruction after the Civil War, it was quite clear that state legislatures were blatantly denying pretty much any rights at all to the newly freed people. John Bingham, the chief drafter of the 14th amendment, said in speeches that he was very upset that the federal government could do nothing under the existing constitution to protect the rights of the people from the states. That was his goal with the 14th amendment. And it was Bingham, not me, who said that his 14th amendment should apply the Bill of Rights to the states and also protect other rights from state abrogation. That was his stated purpose for the amendment. The Supreme Court did not adhere to his stated purpose in its earliest interpretations of the amendment, but that's what he, the chief framer, said it was. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]I have not ignored this important fact. Your argument appears to me to be that the 14th Amendment protects \"all rights.\" And, not only does it protect all rights, but that it grants the judiciary the unitary power to declare what rights are part of the elusive \"all rights.\"\n \n Of course a consequence of this--if the rights granted are only those interpreted by the judiciary--then what the Supreme Court interprets as a protected right in, say, 1967 (no racial classifications for marriage) might one day be reinterpreted by the judiciary in 2067 to mean the exact opposite. This, ironically, leads to the possibility that the Supreme Court may legitimately re-interpret the 14th amendment to mean the exact opposite of its clear intention: to remedy racial classifications.[QU0TE][/COLOR]\n \n The 14th amendment does not enumerate what rights it protects specifically, other than \"life, liberty, or property\" in the due process clause. There has been lengthy debate among justices and among constitutional scholars over whether the 14th amendment should incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states. John Bingham quite clearly saw his amendment as doing that. The Supreme Court in its early interpretations did not interpret the amendment that way. There is now also an emerging discussion over reviving the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which John Bingham appears to have seen as the heart of the 14th amendment.\n \n Because the 14th amendment was written in broad language, without specifying what rights it protects, it has been left to the judiciary and also to the Congress to interpret what rights the amendment protects. You yourself pointed out a few posts back that the amendment grants to Congress the power to pass enabling legislation to put the amendment into effect. That's the reality. We have only the interpretation of the justices to go on and the legislation enacted by Congress, plus than what the framers actually said about their intentions. Bingham said that he intended for the amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states. This the Supreme Court has gradually done, starting with selective incorporation rather than full incorporation. He also said that the amendment should protect other rights as well. I offered a quote from Bingham earlier on this specific point.\n \n Bingham never said that his purpose was to remedy racial discrimination alone, although this was, as I have said, certainly the context in which he drafted the language of the amendment, and it was the discrimination that was uppermost is his and everyone's minds. But it is significant that Bingham did not use the term \"race\" or \"racial classifications\" anywhere in the language of the amendment. He wrote \"any person.\" It's clear from Bingham's statements about the amendment that he drafted that he intended it to apply broadly to protect the rights in general of all people from state abrogation. He sought through the amendment to extend the federal power to prevent the states from denying rights to the people. But he did not list those specific rights in the amendment, though he said repeatedly that the rights should include those in the Bill of Rights and other rights as well. \n \n The Supreme Court does have the power to interpret what rights the 14th amendment protects and to change its interpretation of those rights over time. Indeed, the Supreme Court has done that. The Supreme Court in the late 19th century interpreted the 14th amendment in ways that were clearly contrary to the intentions of its framers, and the Supreme Court mostly failed to apply the amendment at all to strike down laws that were racially discriminatory. The Court has moved over time in the opposite direction from what you expressed here as a fear. The Court has moved from mostly allowing laws that discriminate on the basis of race to stand to striking down those laws as unconstitutional under the 14th amendment. It was the Warren Court, the Court that so many conservatives love to hate, that began interpreting the 14th amendment mostly as its framers intended it to be interpretated. \n \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]Certain rights. Not \"all rights\" in general.[QUOTE]\n \n What rights, then? You must think that the rights the amendment protects include the right to marriage, since you have agreed that the ruling in Loving v. Virginia was correct, in your judgment, and this was a case involving the right to marry. On what basis do you believe the 14th amendment protects the right of marriage, which is nowhere named explicitly in the constitution? \n \n Do you agree with the Supreme Court that the 14th amendment should incorporate the first 8 amendments in the Bill of Rights and apply them to the states? If so, where do you draw that interpretation from? Is it from John Bingham?\n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]Correct, the court did decide for Loving, but not for the reason you have articulated here. On the Equal Protection analysis, interracial marriage prohibitions were rejected not because the argument that the law applies to all the same way is invalid, but rather because the classification was based upon race. That racial classifications are unacceptable derives directly from the context and history of the amendment, and is reflected as early as the Slaughterhouse Cases. Insofar as opposite-sex statutes do not discriminate on those grounds, than equal application is all the Equal Protection clause demands.\n \n And here is your interpretation of the 14th amendment as elevating or privileging race discrimination above all other forms of discrimination, an interpretation that you draw from the \"context\" of the amendment. Yet John Bingham, who wrote the amendment, never claimed to be privileging race in this way, or singling out racial classifications. To rely on subsequent Supreme Court rulings to justify your interpretation is to shift the basis for your interpretation away from the intent of the framers and the language of the amendment and onto how the Supreme Court has subsequently ruled, which you have regularly criticized as \"illegitimate.\" You can't argue on the one hand that the Supreme Court has gone beyond its \"legitimate\" powers in interpreting the 14th amendment and then turn around and base your interpretation of the amendment on those Supreme Court rulings. \n \n The Supreme Court, which you partially agree with and partially disagree with in the Loving case, has indeed developed the standard of strict scrutiny for cases involving race discrimination, but it has applied strict scrutiny to other forms of discrimination as well. And the Supreme Court has applied strict scrutiny, rather inconsistently, to cases involving the denial of a fundamental right. Plus, the Supreme Court uses a middle level of scrutiny for cases involving sex discrimination. It's not yet entirely clear whether the Supreme Court will apply strict scrutiny or not to cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; they did not in Romer v. Evans, but they did not have to, as they found no rational basis for the state constitutional amendment in question. We don't know yet what standard of scrutiny the Court may apply to a same-sex marriage case, nor even whether such a case will come before the Court. My understanding of your position is that you think any case not involving race discrimination should be judged not on whether the law discriminates at all, but on whether the discriminatory law is simply \"equally applied.\" By your interpretation of the 14th amendment, the amendment singles out race and leaves other types of discriminatory laws intact unless the Supreme Court determines that they are not applied equally. This means, by your approach, that if a state law bans inter-racial marriage and applies the law equally to all, the law should be struck down because it draws a racial classification. But if a state law bans same-sex marriage and applies the law equally to all, the law should stand as no violation of the 14th amendment. And presumably if a state law were to ban marriages between Catholics and Jews and the state applies the law equally to all, the law should stand as no violation of the 14th amendment equal protection clause, though you might find such a law a violation of the establishment clause applied to the states. And I correct about this? And you draw this conclusion about the intent of the 14th amendment from the \"context\" of the amendment and from early cases, notably the Slaughterhouse Cases. This, as I understand your post, is your analysis of how to interpret the \"original meaning\" of the 14th amendment. \n \n I have a different interpretation of the \"original meaning,\" based on the words of the man who wrote the language of the amendment and on the words in the amendment themselves. \n \n Why is your contextual interpretation \"correct,\" while mine, which is more clearly based in the actual language used by both the chief framer of the amendment and the amendment itself, is incorrect, in your view? Is it because the Supreme Court has over time come to an interpretation that in one respect (but not in others) reflects your interpretation of the amendment? But this is the same Supreme Court that you and others criticize for interpreting the 14th amendment supposedly too broadly in order to define new \"rights\" that some presume to be invented by the justices. Or are you relying on the ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases to support your interpretation of the amendment? But this is the same ruling in which the Supreme Court eviscerated the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment, interpretating it in a way that was quite clearly contrary to the \"original meaning\" of the framers and those who pushed the amendment through to ratification. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]Much as you seem to think that it is, the Equal Protection argument in Loving vs. the Equal Protection argument in same-sex marriage cases is not the same. The racial classification makes all the difference. And it is precisely this reason that age requirements, consanguinity requirements, number of persons requirements, and opposite-sex requirements in marriage are valid classifications under the Equal Protection clause.[QUOTE][/COLOR]\n \n That has yet to be determined, as the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on a same-sex marriage case. This is just your opinion. If the Supreme Court rules that marriage is a fundamental right, the Court may apply strict scrutiny for that reason. We don't know yet what the Court may do. \n \n [QUOTE=Phyllis;316516]Yes, indeed that is my point; racial classifications are prohibited by the Equal Protection clause (even though the Court has been somewhat inconsistent on this clear point in recent times). All other classifications are valid under the Equal Protection clause if they apply equally to everyone. This would appear to be the reason that, rather than re-interpreting the 14th Amendment to guarantee the franchise to women, a Constitutional amendment had to be passed.[QUOTE]\n \n Again, you have shifted the basis for interpreting the amendment, from what the amendment says in its text and what the intentions of the framers were to what the Supreme Court has ruled in the past, which you acknowledge as being \"somewhat inconsistent.\" And I will argue to you that the \"clear point\" you insist is the correct interpretation of the amendment is not so clear. The interpretation that the 14th amendment was crafted to single out ONLY racial classifications is an interpretation that the Supreme Court has not long held, abandoning this interpretation not long after the ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases. \n \n The language of the 14th amendment says nothing about racial classifications; that's your interpretation and that of the Court at various times, decided inconsistently. The determination of which classifications should receive strict scrutiny has changed over time with Court rulings. \n \n As for women and the franchise, the 14th amendment was not understood in the post-Civil War period to guarantee the franchise to black men either, which is why the 15th amendment had to be passed prohibiting states from denying the vote on the basis of race. Whether the 14th amendment should guarantee the right to vote was a matter of debate at the time, but the debate was not over whether the 14th amendment outlawed racial classifications. It was not assumed to do so in 1869 and 1870. The debate was over whether the 14th amendment protected the right to vote, or whether that was still up to the states to determine. The question of what rights the 14th amendment protected was a burning one right from the time the amendment was ratified, as the amendment itself did not and does not enumerate which rights it protects. John Bingham said that his amendment should incorporate the Bill of Rights and also other rights, but others were uncertain about this or simply disagreed with this. \n \n The Supreme Court ruled in the Minor case involving a woman who sued for the right to vote that the 14th amendment did not protect the right to vote, that this was a state matter. Today the Supreme Court does regard the right to vote as \"fundamental\" and protected by the 14th amendment, as evidenced in the ruling in Bush v. Gore.",

   "To Phyllis,\n \n In regard to this quotation pulled from the Loving v. Virginia ruling: \n \n Because we reject the notion that the mere \"equal application\" of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations, we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose.\n \n The Court here was applying its doctrine of strict scrutiny and rejecting the state's argument that a rational basis for the law was sufficient to make it constitutional. By 1967, the Supreme Court had developed its rigid classification system by which it determined whether laws should be given strict scrutiny or lesser scrutiny.\n \n It's important to note that this classification system did not spring from the text or the context of the 14th amendment itself, but it was a product of a long evolution in Supreme Court rulings on equal protection cases. In the Slaughterhouse Cases, as you noted, the Court said that the equal protection clause did not apply beyond cases of race discrimination, which is your position. But soon after this, the Court began to change on this question and to view the equal protection clause as applying to all who might be similarly situated. By the 1930s with the Carolene Products case, the idea of applying a higher level of scrutiny to certain kinds of cases emerged, and not just in race discrimination cases. You appear to agree with the Court from back in the Slaughterhouse Cases, that race is the only category that should be privileged in equal protection cases. \n \n It's important to note that, with the evolution in Supreme Court cases involving equal protection claims, today race is NOT the only classification to which the Court gives strict scrutiny. Also in Loving v. Virginia, the Court majority seemed to refer to marriage as a fundamental right, though they did not apply strict scrutiny on that basis, and they didn't have to. But the Court could apply strict scrutiny to a same-sex marriage case, possibly because they rule that marriage is a fundamental right or because they may regard gay people as similarly situated with other groups facing blatant and invidious discrimination. It seems unlikely that the Court anytime soon will do this, but it's possible.",

   "I have to say, I went back and read this several times, and indeed re-read the entire post, and I can't figure out how this would have come across as insensitive. It actually surprised me. What I was trying to get at with Lesz in the statement that concerns you is that even if the Constitution does not protect the right to sodomy (and it never did until 2003), the Constitution is still very important, valuable, and useful. I'm trying to challenge the idea that if the Constitution does not protect X, then it is a useless piece of paper.\n \n And also, when I said, \"Gay americans don't have to wait for an amendment specifically recognizing them as entitled to equal protection of the laws. They already have it, just as every person does[,]\" all I was saying is that the Equal Protection clause applies to everyone. I.e., that a new Constitutional Amendment does not need to be passed in order to guarantee Equal Protection to gays. In other words, Lesz asked a question and I answered it. I'm sorry if that may have caused you to be upset. Perhaps I wasn't clear with my meaning?\n \n\n \n The argument that we already are covered as gay people by the equal protection clause, indeed, by the whole of the 14th amendment, is true, and it has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. \n \n The problem comes in what actually happens in people's real lives. Are gay people free from discrimination by law? No, clearly we are not. We are still treated unequally under the law. Are the state marriage laws equally applied to gay people? No, they are not. If the state writes a law that intentionally serves to advantage some and to exclude other people entirely from the rights that others have, that cannot be called equal protection or equal application of the law. Gay people face the kind of situation that the framers of the 14th amendment sought to remedy with the 14th amendment, which is the blatant exclusion of a despised class of people from the protections of the state laws. \n \n You favor an interpretation of the 14th amendment that elevates race discrimination above all other forms of discrimination and applies a different standard to race discrimination. This is, essentially, what the Supreme Court does now with strict scrutiny, though it does not limit strict scrutiny exclusively to cases involving race discrimination. But you agree with the idea that if a law discriminates against someone on the basis of race, it runs afoul of the equal protection clause regardless of what the law is or what right is being violated. But if a law discriminates against someone on the basis of sexual orientation, then the law should stand unless it is applied differently to gay people than to heterosexuals. In essence, this allows pretty much any discriminatory law against gay people to stand. This reading of the equal protection clause removes any teeth from the clause (sounds like teeth from the claws) when it comes to cases of real discrimination that are based on anything other than race. It makes the equal protection clause largely meaningless for groups that face invidious discrimination not based on race. \n \n This to me is clearly contrary to the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment. Of course they were thinking of race discrimination and not discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation when they wrote the amendment. The concept of sexual orientation did not exist, and gay people were almost wholly invisible. The discrimination the framers saw that was so horrific was race discrimination. Their the purpose in crafting the 14th amendment was to prevent what was then happening: states were passing laws that discriminated against African Americans, and the federal government and the federal courts could do nothing about it. \n \n But they wrote the amendment in broad language, to protect \"any person\" from discrimination by the states. Any person. \n \n Now, gay people are facing not the extreme discrimination and violence and lynchings that African Americans faced in the late 19th century, certainly. No discrimination in the U.S. today comes anywhere close to that, and I hope it never will. But gay people do face discriminatory laws, and we do face violence, and we are physically attacked and sometimes murdered for being who we are. My argument is that the laws banning same-sex marriage are no less invidious discrimination than were the laws banning inter-racial marriage. They have no less of a negative impact. They are exactly the kind of discrimination that the framers of the 14th amendment sought to protect \"any person\" from. But in your interpretation of the 14th amendment, the amendment is rendered essentially useless in stopping the discrimination. Your interpretation of the amendment is so narrow as to make the purpose of the amendment impossible to achieve. \n \n In terms of real human impact, the denial of Mildred and Richard Loving's right to marry is no more or less devastating to them than the denial of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon's right to marry is to them. Yet, Mildred and Richard Loving were able to call on the Supreme Court to apply the 14th amendment to guarantee them the right to marry. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon could not do that, and never could, under your interpretation of the 14th amendment. For 80 plus years, Del and Phyllis were life partners, and they were never allowed to marry until a few weeks ago, in California. This may sound like a results-based argument, but ultimately, the purpose of the law is in the results it brings, and the people affected by the law are the ones who matter. To draw the boundaries of the 14th amendment so narrowly so that they do nothing to counter the invidious discrimination suffered by gay people is to undermine the purpose of the amendment as its framers envisioned it. \n \n In theory, gay people have the \"equal protection of the laws.\" In practice, we don't. The discrimination continues. I hope that the Supreme Court chooses not to interpret either the equal protection clause or the due process clause as you would, meaning so narrowly that they don't protect gay people at all. \n \n As for passing a constitutional amendment to ensure the right to same-sex marriage, it certainly won't happen in my lifetime, and probably not in my daughter's lifetime. And it should not have to, because a proper reading of the 14th amendment should be sufficient to ensure the end of this invidious discrimination.\n \n Your interpretation of the 14th amendment seems to me to amount to this: that the framers of the amendment never intended it to protect the rights of all people broadly from state abrogation, that the framers intended only to stop race discrimination and to protect \"some rights.\" You argue that people who are discriminated against on the basis of race are protected by the amendment against any discriminatory \"racial classifications,\" but that people who are discriminated against for any other reasons are protected only from the unequal application of laws that may discriminate, not from the discrimination by law itself. That interpretation, which is a very narrow interpretation of the scope of the 14th amendment, is not how the 14th amendment reads, nor is it what its chief framer said was its purpose. \n \n Had the purpose of the 14th amendment been to prohibit race discrimination ONLY, the amendment would have been worded that way. The 15th amendment was worded that way. But the 14th was worded in broad language, and to interpret it so narrowly that it allows for pretty much any discrimination by states on any bases other than race is to eviscerate the powerful weapon that John Bingham and his colleagues sought to wield to protect the rights of all the people. Yes, Bingham and his colleagues at the time were thinking about race discrimination; that was their immediate and primary target. But with their broad wording of the amendment, they opened the door for the federal government to prevent the states from discriminating against the people on other bases as well.",

   "Since we got into the ruling in Loving v. Virginia, let's also take a look at the more recent (1996) Supreme Court ruling in Romer v. Evans, in which the Supreme Court struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment prohibiting any laws that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation, as a violating of the equal protection clauses. \n \n Here is a some of the text of that ruling: \n \n Held: Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 4-14. \n \n (a) The State's principal argument that Amendment 2 puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all other persons by denying them special rights is rejected as implausible. The extent of the change in legal status effected by this law is evident from the authoritative construction of Colorado's Supreme Court--which establishes that the amendment's immediate effect is to repeal all existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities barring discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that its ultimate effect is to prohibit any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective, measures in the future absent state constitutional amendment--and from a review of the terms, structure, and operation of the ordinances that would be repealed and prohibited by Amendment 2. Even if, as the State contends, homosexuals can find protection in laws and policies of general application, Amendment 2 goes well beyond merely depriving them of special rights. It imposes a broad disability upon those persons alone, forbidding them, but no others, to seek specific legal protection from injuries caused by discrimination in a wide range of public and private transactions. Pp. 4-9. \n \n (b) In order to reconcile the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that no person shall be denied equal protection with the practical reality that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, the Court has stated that it will uphold a law that neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class so long as the legislative classification bears a rational relation to some independent and legitimate legislative end. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-320. Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry. First, the amendment is at once too narrow and too broad, identifying persons by a single trait and then denying them the possibility of protection across the board. This disqualification of a class of persons from the right to obtain specific protection from the law is unprecedented and is itself a denial of equal protection in the most literal sense. Second, the sheer breadth of Amendment 2, which makes a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, is so far removed from the reasons offered for it, i.e., respect for other citizens' freedom of association, particularly landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality, and the State's interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups, that the amendment cannot be explained by reference to those reasons; the Amendment raises the inevitable inference that it is born of animosity toward the class that it affects. Amendment 2 cannot be said to be directed to an identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It is a status based classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit. Pp. 9-14. \n \n I think THIS is a proper interpretation of the equal protection clause. The Court did not simply say, \"Colorado's state constitutional amendment is applied equally to gay people and heterosexuals alike, as under the amendment no one can be protected from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. And since gay people are not a suspect class and this is not race discrimination, the amendment does not violate the equal protection clause.\" No, the Court did not say that. They said that the amendment itself is intended to disadvantage gay people legally (which is also what the laws banning same-sex marriage do, btw). The Court did not even say that it would not apply strict scrutiny; the Court simply said that even by ordinary scrutiny, the state constitutional amendment violated the equal protection clause. The Court did not have to apply strict scrutiny (which left the question of strict scrutiny in cases involving sexual orientation open).\n \n I see the ruling in Romer v. Evans as a model for how the Supreme Court might apply the equal protection clause in a same-sex marriage case. That doesn't mean that they will apply it this way, but they could justifiably do so, and I think it would be a proper interpretation of the equal protection clause.",

   "Here's a last point for now on this whole question of interpreting the 14th amendment equal protection clause and Phyllis' assertion that we need a constitutional amendment to ensure that gay people can marry legally across the United States. \n \n My argument to Phyllis is that there is no difference between marriage between two people of the same sex and marriage between two people of the opposite sex. They are the same. Marriage is marriage. We should not need a constitutional amendment specifically to legalize same-sex marriage, because it's not a separate or different institution from opposite-sex marriage. The laws barring same-sex marriage bar specific kinds of indviduals from marrying each other; they do not bar a separate or new institution. The laws barring same-sex marriage are simply state laws that discriminate against persons on the basis of both sex and sexual orientation. There is and should be no separate legal entity \"gay marriage,\" just as there was no separate legal entity \"inter-racial marriage.\" There is simply marriage, in which the spouses may be a male and a female or a male and a male or a female and a female.\n \n Phyllis is arguing that the 14th amendment does not prohibit laws that ban marriage between two people of the same sex, that we need a whole new amendment to address this specific form of discrimination. She sees danger for some reason in allowing the 14th amendment to prohibit discrimination other than race discrimination. \n \n The problem with requiring a new constitutional amendment to ban each specific form of discrimination is that it's impossible in a practical sense. It took women more than 70 years of struggle to win a constitutional amendment specifically banning discrimination in voting based on sex. The argument that the only way gay people can be ensured of the right to marry is by a specific constitutional amendment would mean that none of the gay people living today would ever have this right protected across the nation by federal law. None of our children probably would either. Is prohibiting discrimination really so scary that the hurdles should be mounted so high as to be nearly impossible to surmount? \n \n The difficulty of leaving anti-discrimination protections up to legislatures and to the vote of super-majorities through constitutional amendment is that it's popular prejudice itself that results in the discrimination. The majority in most states is not going to support protecting gay people from discrimination because it's the popular animus against gay people that causes the discrimination in the first place. People are not going to vote to prohibit themselves from discriminating against a group that they generally despise because of widespread prejudice. \n \n The Reconstruction amendments (13, 14, and 15) were ratified in a singular environment, in the wake of a war that killed over 600,000 people and largely destroyed much of the American South. It was a circumstance in which these pathbreaking constitutional amendments could be passed and ratified. The Republicans entirely controlled the Congress, and they set the terms on which the southern states could re-enter the union. In effect, the Republicans forced the Reconstruction amendments on an unwilling South, and the result was a sea change in how the constitution protects liberties. It was a circumstance never seen before or since, in which one part of the people could, in effect, force on the rest of the people constitutional amendments that much of the population found utterly abhorrent. The result, despite the methods and circumstances of ratification, was tremendously positive, though these positive results of the amendments took nearly another 100 years to come to fruition via the Supreme Court and the civil rights movement. The 14th amendment was drafted and ratified in an environment that was sui generis, and opponents of its broad protections of liberty have been arguing for limiting it and eviscerating its protections ever since. But the amendment is there; it stands. \n \n I think that we gay folks do not need a constitutional amendment specifically guaranteeing us the right to marry if the 14th amendment is properly interpreted by a future Supreme Court. \n \n Phyllis has said that gay people already have the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th amendment. This is true. We don't have the equal protection of the laws in practice, but the amendment is there, waiting to be applied. What Phyllis said about equal protection and gay people is like someone saying that African Americans had the right to vote from 1870 on, because of the 15th amendment. They did in theory, but mostly they did not in actual practice. \n \n I don't know exactly how we gay folks will win the right to marry nationwide in the United States. I can't see into the future. I strongly doubt it will be by a specific new constitutional amendment, ever. I suspect we will continue to make gains state by state, as we gradually have been. I think that if someone brings a case before the Supreme Court and argues on equal protection grounds, and also on due process grounds, which we have not discussed much at all, and the Supreme Court decides the case correctly, in my view, we may win in the Court. But I think we need to wait to bring such a case until we have new justices who reject Phyllis' interpretation of the 14th amendment and who interpret the amendment in the broad way that I think its framers intended, as protecting the rights of all people.",

   "Prof,\n \n I don't have time to get to your longer posts right now. I'll go ahead and give some comments on this shorter one, though. I hope you don't mind if I do that.\n \n \nIt's important to note that this classification system did not spring from the text or the context of the 14th amendment itself, but it was a product of a long evolution in Supreme Court rulings on equal protection cases.\n\n Yes, I recognize that this method of application is not in the text itself, but that is not a big deal to an originalist. An orignalist is concerned with what the original meaning of the text was, and how best to apply the text in order to get apply its original meaning; not what the text might mean absent any other considerations other than the text itself.\n \n I do believe that what is now referred to as \"strict scrutiny\" in cases of racial classifications is based in the history and context of the passage of the 14th Amendment. You do agree, for example, that the 14th Amendment was aimed at remedying racial discrimination, correct? You merely disagree that it was aimed only at that particular kind of discrimination. At least that's what I think you have been arguing.\n \n \nBut soon after this, the Court began to change on this question and to view the equal protection clause as applying to all who might be similarly situated. By the 1930s with the Carolene Products case, the idea of applying a higher level of scrutiny to certain kinds of cases emerged, and not just in race discrimination cases. You appear to agree with the Court from back in the Slaughterhouse Cases, that race is the only category that should be privileged in equal protection cases.\n\n Ah yes, the infamous footnote 4. I am wary of that footnote. I know the Court has expanded the meaning of the Equal Protection clause beyond what the Slaughterhouse cases held, but I'm not convinced they have done so appropriately.\n \n \nIt's important to note that, with the evolution in Supreme Court cases involving equal protection claims, today race is NOT the only classification to which the Court gives strict scrutiny. Also in Loving v. Virginia, the Court majority seemed to refer to marriage as a fundamental right, though they did not apply strict scrutiny on that basis, and they didn't have to. But the Court could apply strict scrutiny to a same-sex marriage case, possibly because they rule that marriage is a fundamental right or because they may regard gay people as similarly situated with other groups facing blatant and invidious discrimination. It seems unlikely that the Court anytime soon will do this, but it's possible.\n\n Incidentally, when the court begins to refer to \"fundamental rights,\" it is applying substantive due process analysis, which as you know I do not believe is appropriate in any case.\n \n And if we're going to use Footnote 4's discrimination against \"discrete and insular minorities\" requirement for strict scrutiny, then we are going to need to know the meaning of that phrase as well. Although I'm not sure footnote 4 is in accordance with the original meaning of the 14th amendment, however much I might like the fact that it added certain other categories to higher scrutiny analysis.",

   "Your last several posts are beautifully written, spot on and clear. (Not the post directed to Steeeve, but the posts on the topic of the constitution, the 14th amendment, and protection for human rights.) As I read your posts, I thought of the ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, the ruling that the Supreme Court struck down in Lawrence v. Texas. In the Bowers majority opinion, the Supreme Court really did set gay people apart and made us strangers to the equal protection of the laws and to the protections provided by the constitution. The majority said explicitly that there is no right to privacy for same-sex relations. They carved out an exception to the protections of the constitution for gay people! Instead of ruling by interpreting the provisions of the constitution as they would and did in other cases, the majority justices turned to religious tradition and popular prejudice and opinion to guide their ruling. Their opinion said, in essence, that because in the Judeo-Christian tradition, homosexuality has been regarded as sinful, there is no right to privacy for same-sex relations as there is for opposite-sex relations. Popular religious beliefs about homosexuality trumped the protections of the constitution. \n \n The Supreme Court 17 years later recognized its terrible mistake and overturned their previous ruling, which is historic and praiseworthy. It's interesting to me that the Court that ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick was generally regarded as more liberal in its approach and rulings than was the Court that ruled in the Lawrence v. Texas case. In the Bowers case, a generally liberal Supreme Court reached the wrong result using wrong interpretation. In Lawrence v. Texas, though the dissenters were the most conservative justices, the Court looked beyond popular prejudice and interpreted the protections of the constitution to apply to all persons, not just persons that others approve of or that religious tradition approves of. They had paved the way for this, of course, with the important ruling in Romer v. Evans.\n \n I am sorry that Michael Hardwick, the gay man who was arrested and jailed for having sex with his partner in his own house and who brought the suit that led to the Bowers v. Hardwick ruling, died before the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas. He never lived to see the victory. Some years ago, I taped a television special on the Bill of Rights that included a Bill Moyers interview with Michael Hardwick. I still have that tape, which is terrific. Moyers asked Hardwick how he felt about losing the case in the Supreme Court. Hardwick answered that he had not expected to lose, and he thought the Court made the wrong ruling. Then Moyers asked him if he thought the system works, that the Bill of Rights works to protect human rights. Hardwick answered, \"Yes, I think it works.\" Moyers replied, \"Even though you lost?\" Hardwick answered, \"Yes, even though I lost. Some day another plaintiff may not lose. It's a good system.\" Hardwick, though he did not live to see it, turned out to predict the future accurately. Some day another plaintiff won, and the Court overturned the ruling in which he had lost. Notably, though he lost his case, Hardwick did not attack the Supreme Court as tyrannical or its ruling as \"illegitimate.\" Instead he said quietly, \"It's a good system.\" I agree with him about that.\n\n \n Right. That was a good example of when the Supreme Court got it wrong first time around, and corrected itself later. I'd agree that we can't expect the Court to be right every time, and it's just plain silly to get hysterical and claim it's a \"tyrannical\" or \"activist\" court when it occasionally gets something wrong. Or when it produces a result one objects to politically, which is what's been happening when the right-wing got its collective knickers in a twist about so-called judicial activism.\n \n Again, I have to suggest that if the US didn't have a Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of its legislation, it would have to invent one. It could be reformed, of course, because no institution is ever perfect, but the result would still be pretty much the same. It's a good system, no matter that it occasionally misfires.",

   "You conveniently completely left out the fact I put forward a second option: allow all types of marriage possible. (Not that I'm surprised.)\n\n \n Wait a minute... what do you mean, \"all types of marriage\"? A marriage is a recognition of a particular kind of committed, co-dependent relationship, not just any old relationship. You seem to be suggesting that rather than have to admit the validity of gay marriage, we should simply abolish marriage altogether, and recognise any casual relationship on the same terms as co-dependent ones.\n \n That's plain silly, and is another version of ABM. The question wouldn't even had arisen had it not been politically necessary for anti-gay Christians to seem to be reasonable and objective while avoiding recognition of the equality of gay relationships.\n \n \nThat's the problem with the OSG argument: (Only Straight or Gay)--it just expands marriage to one other group, and therefore isn't really an argument about fairness at all, even though unfairness is so often the accusation made. If you are going to argue that the government is being fundamentally unfair in terms of marriage, then it needs to reform marriage, not just gay marriage. The issue becomes whether or not marriage should be broadened or not, and if it does then it might as well be broadened in every respect and made fair.\n\n \n Well, do I have to remind you that marriage generally involves a close and intimate relationship? This often includes sex, at least for couples who aren't geriatric. I mean, do you really want or need to get married to your grocer or rat catcher in order to have a relationship with them? I think not.\n \n Most relationships do not need marriage, because they aren't of the marital sort. Gay marital relationships are the only ones I am aware of that approximate to straight ones.\n \n \nSorry, but Steeeeve is spot on when it comes to Lesz. Phyllis has also come to see his tactics. You tend to defend him at any opportunity he's criticized (even if it has nothing to do with his gay rights stances) and rarely ever acknowledge the mean-spirited things he sometimes says. \n\n \n Yep... you guys are all peas in a pod, and you all use the same passive-aggressive tactics in your rear-guard reaction against equal rights for gays. You really believe that it's the equal rights proponents who are demanding things they have no right to have... such as the marriages you lot take for granted in your own lives. You haven't fooled anyone.",

   "In some cases the pluarality required is 50 plus one percent. In others, it is 2/3, in others 3/4.\n\n \n I am well aware that US law calls for different pluralities in different contexts. That isn't relevant to the concept of majority tyranny, which is simply a situation where any required plurality rides over the rights of any minority on a whim. That is one of the situations the Constitution exists to prevent.\n \n \nA simple example is that we may by constitutional marriage prohibit marriage altogether. Majority tyranny? Evidently not by the framer's understanding.\n\n \n I don't think the government would have a constitutional leg to stand on if it actually tried to prohibit marriage and make it a criminal offense. The most it could do, constitutionally, is not recognise it legally as having any effect on government policy towards individuals. However, as soon as it tries to play favourites and says that these marriages are OK, but those are illegal, and especially if it says so because someone's religious belief decrees it, it's on very shaky constitutional grounds under the 14th Amendment.\n \n It is required to make the law applicable equally to all to whom it might reasonably apply, and since both gay and straight marital relationships are equivalent, it's not only socially invidious but constitutional dubious to make such unnecessary distinctions, simply for the sake of catering to some religious prejudice.\n \n \nUnreasonable by whose standard? 5 judges, evidently. The Constitution simply does not give the judiciary the authority to overturn any law that may happen to offend the personal sensibilities of 5 judges.\n\n \n Well, I don't know who advocated judges throwing out laws on a whim, but no-one here did, and it isn't what happens during judicial review of laws whose constitutionality has been questioned. Judges have to justify their reasoning legally. You, personally may not agree with some decisions, while I may not agree with others, but that doesn't mean the court was wrong to make them at all, or even necessarily that the court decided the case the wrong way. Just because you or I disagree with a court doesn't make the court wrong.\n \n \nSo in one context, the Constitution forbids racial discrimination. But some time in the future, without any change of the text, it might allow racial discrimination depending on whether 5 judges happen to think it necessary to the context? That doesn't sound to me like a very strong protection to minority (actually, more precisely, individual) rights.\n\n \n I think the concept of race is pretty well precedented and established legally -- it doesn't change with legal context. Although biologically speaking, the concept of race in the human species is at best fuzzy, and at worst misleading, it's accepted historically, socially and legally. I don't think we need fear that judges will be redefining it, let alone claiming that racial discrimination is required by the Constitution when it is clearly prohibited. This is quite different from the situation vis a vis gay marriage, where it is society that has redefined the position of gays within it, and gays who have come to a social awakening with respect to their pariah status.\n \n (For what it's worth, I suspect that affirmative action is probably on shaky constitutional grounds, although it's survived so far by the skin of its teeth. It may not survive indefinitely.)\n \n \nThere is a distinction between the meaning of a text, on the one hand, and the application of the text on the other. I am not suggesting that we apply what the founders thought about gays, for instance, to today. Rather I am suggesting we discover the original meaning of the text, and then apply that to new cases. Hence, when the fourth amendment bars unreasonable searches and seizures, we can know that it bars the government from using infrared technology to view the inside of a home unless a warrant has been issued even though the framers never discussed the issue. \n\n \n You seem to have grasped my meaning without thinking the application of it through to the current discussion.\n \n Since gay marital relationships are today seen, properly, I believe, as equivalent in every significant essence to straight relationships, I can't see how one can read the 14th Amendment in any way other than to mandate that government treats gay and straight married couples equally. That IS the original meaning of the text: \"equal protection\". Those words haven't changed meaning in the last 200 years. It just so happens that it's a modern realisation it should also be applied to gay Americans in equivalent legal situations.\n \n This seems to me to be logically and semantically equivalent to your point, which I accept, about illegal search and seizures applying to new technology, only instead of technology changing the perceptual landscape, it's social awareness. And, I might add, new science pertaining to human psychology and sexuality.\n \n \nIs this a reference to Lawrence v. Texas? If so, insofar as that case relied on substantive due process, it was not decided correctly. That is the whole argument that I have made.\n\n \n As I recall, there were several constitutional points: equal protections, which was the sole reason Sandra O'Connor chose, and privacy and equal protection arguments advanced by the majority. I think those are significant constitutional protections the previous sodomy ruling, Bowers v. Hardwick, ignored in its rush to embrace religious prejudices. (In a delicious irony, the prosecutor Hardwick, a religious homophobe who dismissed a lesbian lawyer on his staff after she came out, was later found to be himself engaged in illegal, adulterous activity, but apparently, he thought straights were above such antiquated laws!)\n \n \nOh, I see. If the Constitution does not give you everything you want, then it is useless. Well, the Constitution does not give me everything I want, but I don't consider it useless. I also get the feeling that the Constiuttion does not give steeeeve or jyoshu everything they want, and I'll go out on a limb and say that neither of them would therefore think it useless.\n\n \n Oh for heaven's sakes Phyllis, surely you can argue more rationally than this. Lawyers and activists for equal rights have routinely argued that the Constitution as it stands does, in fact, provide gay Americans with everything they need or want. The historical problem has been to convince courts, legislatures and government executives to abide by its provisions, owing to prior and current social and religious prejudice and discrimination against gays in America. Yes, on paper, gays aren't constitutionally discriminated against, though many on your side of the fence have been agitating to change that with the anti-marriage constitutional amendment. However, they have been legally discriminated against in practice, and in law outside the written US Constitution, in state and federal legislation and the occasional state constitutional amendment.\n \n If the plurality is not willing to abide by these legal, constitutional protections, then the Constitution isn't worth more than toilet paper. That's the point. Why didn't you address that issue?\n \n \nGay americans don't have to wait for an amendment specifically recognizing them as entitled to equal protection of the laws. They already have it, just as every person does.\n\n \n Only in the paper of the Constitution, as I've said above. Not, however, in the words of the laws that governments have enforced against gays. Is this another case of selective blindness on your part? Perhaps you begin to understand why I do not fully trust your sincerity in this, if you claim to be unaware of legal discrimination against gays. That, I find wholly incredible, and it's a claim that I can only believe can be made with a lawyerly lack of sincerity -- it's disingenuous, and, I believe from the general tenor of posts on gay issues, deliberately so. (Ohioprof is free to disagree with me on that, but I trust my instincts here.)\n \n \nMaybe they shouldn't have to wait for an amendment in order to have same-sex marriage. But, good or bad, that is what the Constitution requires, that is if you want to have it federally recognized.\n\n \n Where in the Constitution -- so far -- does it say that gay marriage requires a constitutional amendment to compel government to recognise it equally to straight marriage? Another disingenuous claim. The federal government could recognise it tomorrow at a stroke of the pen, and it probably wouldn't even need an act of Congress, except maybe to abolish DOMA.\n \n Now, many Christian leaders and assorted anti-gay activists have been desperately trying to change the Constitution so that it WOULD require such an amendment. Why do you think they are trying so hard to amend it, if they had not done their own arithmetic and concluded that as it stands, the Constitution does, indeed, require equal treatment for gay Americans?",

   "Phyllis, I want to be gentle about this and not get angry. My reaction to your last statement was initially anger at a statement that seemed both insensitive to other people and absurd. But I have to recognize that people who are not gay mostly have no idea how intense and how terrible the discrimination is that we face, unless they experience it through family members or close friends. Much of the discrimination is social, not legal. But the social discrimination is bolstered by the legal discrimination, and the legal discrimination alone has terrible effects on us and on our families. \n\n \n Not to get involved in an argument \"about\" Phyllis specifically, as opposed to this issue, but just so you can get a feeling of where I'm coming from in my attitudes towards others, this, generically, is why I take arguments that assume there is no discrimination against gays, and that the Constitution offers no protection against such discrimination, with a truckload of salt and not a bit of resentment (does \"Bob Maddox\" from the NYT ring any bells? Note: I am not making tiresome accusations of fake identity here, merely pointing to similar and tired old arguments). I've seen them made by far too many people whose covert agenda it is to simply block equal rights for gay Americans, by any means possible, while trying to smell sweet and unbigoted.\n \n It's almost a form of passive-aggressive behaviour -- an attempt to oppose progress towards emancipation while pretending to be the aggrieved party at the hands of \"intolerant\" social and political activists. The tactic is to attack political activists who advance gay rights legislatively and judicially, all the whilst maintaining a spurious objectivity, despite ferociously defending anyone who criticises gay activists, and attacking every attempt to change anti-gay laws by judicial appeal. It seems to me nothing more than a rhetorical tactic which attempts to hide an anti-gay motive behind a socially acceptable facade. Now that is simply a statement of my feelings on the matter, whether I am right or wrong to think so; whether you think I am right or wrong; or whether or not Phyllis gets upset by my personal attitudes. It is is simply my gut, instinctive reaction to be highly suspicious of motives in this context, owing to my experience. \n \n So far as I am concerned, any argument that begins with the assumption that there is no legal discrimination against gays is already so far off-the-wall, it doesn't deserve to be treated seriously. It's manifestly, self-evidently bogus. Call me stubborn if you like, but consider the history of message board participants who have advanced such arguments. The only issue in this limited context is whether such discrimination by state and federal governments is legal under the 14th Amendment.\n \n Of course, there are other issues such as reasonable expectations of privacy and freedom of and from religion. I think a reasonable constitutional case can be made on several grounds.",

At least we have found something that we can both agree upon.\n \n \nAs I recall, there were several constitutional points: equal protections, which was the sole reason Sandra O'Connor chose, and privacy and equal protection arguments advanced by the majority.\n\n The majority did not reach equal protection. This case should properly be discussed as having been decided on due process rather than Equal Protection. The majority had the desire not merely to end bans on same-sex sodomy, but indeed they wanted to end all bans on sodomy, because such bans offended a majority of the individual Justices' personal sensibilities. They simply could not use the Equal Protection clause to accomplish their personal ends, so they employed the much more powerful doctrine of substantive due process, and bam, we end up with the ridiculous assertion that the constitution bans prohibitions against sodomy.\n \n \nIf the plurality is not willing to abide by these legal, constitutional protections, then the Constitution isn't worth more than toilet paper. That's the point. Why didn't you address that issue?\n\n I did address the issue. I said that just because the Constitution does not protect the right to sodomy (let's just assume Lawerence was not yet decided, or was incorrect for the sake of this one point), it would still be a very useful, valuable, and amazing document that was paid for by the blood and sacrifice of countless men and women.\n \n \nIs this another case of selective blindness on your part? Perhaps you begin to understand why I do not fully trust your sincerity in this, if you claim to be unaware of legal discrimination against gays. That, I find wholly incredible, and it's a claim that I can only believe can be made with a lawyerly lack of sincerity -- it's disingenuous, and, I believe from the general tenor of posts on gay issues, deliberately so. (Ohioprof is free to disagree with me on that, but I trust my instincts here.)\n\n First of all, there are plenty of lawyers who are sincere.\n \n Second of all, I have never, ever said there was not discrimination against gays. All I have been saying is that such discrimination does not violate the federal Constitution, just as male-only conscription, a discrimination against males, does not violate the constitution. \n \n You are perfectly free to continue on in your fantasy world where it is not the words that were written, but rather the words that were not--reading between the lines, as you put it--that reveal what a person believes; where even if a person explicitly denies what you have read between their lines, you read between those explicit lines of denial only to find out that they are (evidently) nothing but a quite clever liar. That is a ridiculous tactic, to say the least, but I suppose I shall have to accept it as a flaw that can never be remedied.\n \n \nWhere in the Constitution -- so far -- does it say that gay marriage requires a constitutional amendment to compel government to recognise it equally to straight marriage? Another disingenuous claim. The federal government could recognise it tomorrow at a stroke of the pen, and it probably wouldn't even need an act of Congress, except maybe to abolish DOMA.\n\n No, listen very carefully. My view is that a federal marriage amendment is necessary in order to compel all of the states to recognize same-sex marriage against the will of those states. Obviously the federal government can (and has) define marriage, but it may not define it for the states by mere statute.\n \n \nWhy do you think they are trying so hard to amend it, if they had not done their own arithmetic and concluded that as it stands, the Constitution does, indeed, require equal treatment for gay Americans?\n\n No, it is more accurate to say that they perceive that the Constitution may be interpreted to require same-sex marriage. That is not the same thing as them perceiving that the Constitution actually does presently require same-sex marriage.",

At least we have found something that we can both agree upon.\n\n \n Phyllis, you will never find me defending any principle of affirmative action based on race, creed, sex, sexual orientation, or anything else. I believe in treating people according to their needs and merit, not because of their membership of some group, no matter how shabbily that group has been treated in the past. I also believe in placing resources where they are needed, and if that means (for example) into schools in minority districts, so be it.

It appears you want to have your cake and eat it, but more of this anon, I'll deconstruct your post sequentially.\n \n \nThe majority did not reach equal protection. This case should properly be discussed as having been decided on due process rather than Equal Protection. The majority had the desire not merely to end bans on same-sex sodomy, but indeed they wanted to end all bans on sodomy, because such bans offended a majority of the individual Justices' personal sensibilities. They simply could not use the Equal Protection clause to accomplish their personal ends, so they employed the much more powerful doctrine of substantive due process, and bam, we end up with the ridiculous assertion that the constitution bans prohibitions against sodomy.\n\n \n I have no problem in the court finding a ban on \"sodomy\" unconstitutional on the grounds of privacy. Same for the use of contraception. I don't think that's a \"ridiculous assertion\" at all, Phyllis, I think it's a cornerstone of American liberties.\n \n My philosophy of government is that it should rule with the lightest hand feasible, and not infringe individual liberties. In that, I differ from the American right these days, though this didn't use to be so. It simply isn't the government's proper business what consenting adults do in bed together, and I am delighted the court finally saw reason on this issue.\n \n \nI did address the issue. I said that just because the Constitution does not protect the right to sodomy (let's just assume Lawerence was not yet decided, or was incorrect for the sake of this one point), it would still be a very useful, valuable, and amazing document that was paid for by the blood and sacrifice of countless men and women.\n\n \n The Constitution doesn't protect the right to \"sodomy\" (what a curious word that is! That isn't what the bible meant), but it does protect the right against unreasonable government interference in private activities. Where does the government get a right to legislate private moral behaviour, and punish people for it? Not in the Constitution.\n \n What you didn't address was the fact that most state and federal jurisdictions do not treat gay citizens equally to their straight citizens, in circumstances where equal treatment is warranted by reason and justice. People have a reasonable, constitutional expectation to such equal treatment. Without it, all the Constitution would be is a blueprint for organising a government and electing public officials. As a means of securing the rights of free Americans, it would be toilet paper, and clearly, the founders were very concerned that the Constitution should be seen as more than a blueprint for government organisation -- I'm sure Ohioprof will bear me out there -- which is why they added a Bill of Rights that is envied throughout the world, but that the American right these days would prefer to ignore.\n \n The only way the Constitution can avoid being toilet paper is for the majority to realise and willingly accept that its purpose is, in significant part, to limit their power to enact their every prejudice against some minority whenever they damn well feel like it. That is where the legitimacy of the Constitution comes from. If they don't accept this, then they might as well not have a Constitution at all, since they won't pay any attention to anything it says about individual rights.\n \n \nFirst of all, there are plenty of lawyers who are sincere.\n\n \n Perhaps. Have you consulted public opinion on this?\n \n \nSecond of all, I have never, ever said there was not discrimination against gays. All I have been saying is that such discrimination does not violate the federal Constitution, just as male-only conscription, a discrimination against males, does not violate the constitution. \n \n \n Yes, I am aware that's what you've been saying, and I profoundly disagree with your opinion. So have the courts. I'd point out that male-only conscription is, in fact, discrimination against females (or males, depending on whether you think it's a good or bad thing), just as it's discrimination against gays to prohibit their open membership in the military. If discrimination against gays, blacks and females is not unconstitutional, then why can't we forbid them from entering the workforce at all, or disallow their civil liberties or equal protections? \n \n (Granted, the courts have historically given the military a lot of wiggle room in being free from the rigours of the Constitution, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are legally correct or wise in doing so. Even if one views the military as a justifiably exceptional case, for which arguments have been made, that doesn't mean civilian government institutions are therefore equally exempt from respecting constitutional rights.)\n \n When you apply a litmus test of sex or sexual orientation to marriage or military service (though these aren't strictly analogous cases), it's exactly like applying a test of religious or political belief. It doesn't address the issue of whether an individual is capable of doing a job, it's a blanket discrimination against individuals because they are members of some arbitrary group it's considered OK to discriminate against. Unless the government has some good reason for doing so -- for example, it is reasonable to exclude blind people from military service -- all it is, is unwarranted discrimination. In this case, based on a religious superstition. This is as far from equal protection as it is possible to get. \n \n It is perfectly reasonable to read the Constitution as guaranteeing these rights. Again, if it hadn't been intended to, and didn't guarantee these rights, why would the Bill of Rights exist at all?\n \n Let's go back to the affirmative action example. If you don't think affirmative action is constitutional because it infringes equal protection respective to sex, race, or group membership, then I don't see how you can logically or consistently argue that discrimination in favour of heterosexuals (against gays) is. Your views here are thoroughly contradictory. My position is actually far more conservative, logical and consistent than yours: I don't accept affirmative action or discrimination against gays (alternatively, in favour of straights) for very similar reasons. Both offend the letter and spirit of the 14th Amendment, in the same way.\n \n \nNo, listen very carefully. My view is that a federal marriage amendment is necessary in order to compel all of the states to recognize same-sex marriage against the will of those states. Obviously the federal government can (and has) define marriage, but it may not define it for the states by mere statute.\n\n \n The Constitution has not been seen historically as compelling any state to recognise every legal action of any other state. That is perfectly reasonable. However, it is seen as compelling states to treat their citizens and people equally, and since the treatment of gays and straights by most states is manifestly unequal, then constitutional arguments are compelling. A state can, if it wishes, refuse to recognise any marriage contracted in or outside the state. It is not as free, albeit with some minor exceptions, to choose whose marriages it will recognise and whose it will ignore or criminalise.\n \n There is an informative example here of state differences in laws of consent with respect to age. Not all states allow consent to marriage at the same age, so it possible to be legally married in a state with relaxed laws, and not have that marriage recognised in a state with more restrictive laws. However, this is not analogous to gay marriage, unless one is arguing that gay Americans are never fit to consent to a gay marriage, which is patently ridiculous. Minors just do not have the same rights as adults who have attained the age of majority.\n \n In practice, except for such anomalies on the fringes, no state would refuse to recognise a legally contracted marriage in another state, or indeed, in another country -- except if the contractees are of the same sex, because they are gay. Nor would the Supreme Court countenance a state that recognised only marriages contracted within its borders, but refused to recognise marriages in other states -- again, except for gays. However, gays are not analogous to underage minors.\n \n Sorry, but the Constitution doesn't allow that sort of discrimination. If it did, it would be toilet paper.\n \n \nNo, it is more accurate to say that they perceive that the Constitution may be interpreted to require same-sex marriage. That is not the same thing as them perceiving that the Constitution actually does presently require same-sex marriage. \n\n \n Actually, the Constitution doesn't require any recognition of marriage. What it requires is equal protection of the laws. This is what is clearly missing today, and advocates of a federal anti-gay marriage amendment know it. Which is why they seek to exclude gays from equal protections in marriage law, and who knows where that would end up.\n \n May I ask, for clarity, whether you support the anti-gay marriage amendment, and if so, why? Just for the record, so you can't accuse me of putting opinions in your mouth.",

It simply is not that detailed, and it was never intended by either the framers or ratifiers to be that detailed. Maybe sodomy shouldn't be classified as a misdemeanor. Justice Thomas was of that view. Yet I, like he, see no basis to claim that the Constitution covers sodomy, even if it is done through some mysterious and undefined \"right to privacy,\" a right which good or bad, is likewise not to be found in the Constitution.\n \n \nPerhaps. Have you consulted public opinion on this?\n\n No, I have not. I'm not certain what public opinion has to do with anything.\n \n \nIf discrimination against gays, blacks and females is not unconstitutional, then why can't we forbid them from entering the workforce at all, or disallow their civil liberties or equal protections?\n\n Discrimination on the basis of race, as I have repeatedly said, has been placed out of bounds by the 14th Amendment; though incidentally, I'm not certain what provision of the Constitution would prohibit the federal government from discriminating even on that basis. And, to give you another example of my thinking, though I think the court's decision in the DC handgun case was correctly decided, I am not so sure I would agree if the court were to apply the Second Amendment against the states sometime in the future because I have not settled my mind on whether the doctrine of incorporation itself is correct.\n \n Furthermore, assuming my statement is true for the sake of argument, there is no evidence that a law preventing gays, blacks, or females from entering the workforce would be passed. Our basic disagreement (I think) boils down to this: you believe (I think, please correct where necessary) that if all individual human rights are not protected by the Constitution, then the Constitution is meaningless because the majority will trample the rights of the minority, whereas I believe that some individual rights are directly protected by the Constitution, and others indirectly protected by the process and structure established by the Constitution.\n \n \nIt doesn't address the issue of whether an individual is capable of doing a job, it's a blanket discrimination against individuals because they are members of some arbitrary group it's considered OK to discriminate against.\n\n I get it; I really do. You find this to be unacceptable. I'm sure many people likewise find it unacceptable. Your argument here, considered as an argument to a legislature, might be very compelling. But, there is nothing in the Constitution that bars a person or the government from discriminating against many, many apparently arbitrary groups even if individual members of the said groups are as capable of doing the job as anyone else.\n \n \nIt is perfectly reasonable to read the Constitution as guaranteeing these rights. Again, if it hadn't been intended to, and didn't guarantee these rights, why would the Bill of Rights exist at all?\n\n The more pressing question in my mind is if the Bill of Rights was intended by the Framers, or expected by the ratifiers, as protecting \"all human rights,\" then why not simply have one amendment stating as much? \"All human rights shall be protected by this Constitution,\" would have sufficed to get the Constitution to do what you say it does and must do. But they listed specific things as being protected. Why did they do that?\n \n \nLet's go back to the affirmative action example.

Both offend the letter and spirit of the 14th Amendment, in the same way.\n\n There is not a contradiction if it is true that the 14th Amendment set out to remove racial classifications, but leave other classifications intact. This, I think, is quite demonstrable as a principle. For example, you certainly do not believe that the Equal Protection clause bars government from making every classification whereby one group would be treated differently from another. Such an interpretation would prohibit the government, in the very least, from establishing any criminal laws at all; or at least from treating those who violate criminal laws differently from those who do not.\n \n So, I conclude that the 14th Amendment did not remove all classifications off of the table from legislative use. The question then becomes which classifications, if any, were removed off the table, and which were not. Which classifications may a legislature employ, and which ones may they not. I conclude from the context and history of the passage of the Civil War Amendments, that racial classifications (all racial classifications, incidentally) were removed off the table by the 14th Amendment. Aside from that, there simply is no evidence that any others were.\n \n \nHowever, it is seen as compelling states to treat their citizens and people equally,\n\n No, this is not what the Constitution does. Per my paragraph above, the 14th Amendment did not command equal treatment for all citizens; it left the state free to treat citizens differently. If the Constitution demands that a state treat its citizens equally, then what becomes of the criminal code and the states' present unequal treatment of those who violate the criminal code and those who do not?\n \n Perhaps you will reply that the discrimination must be reasonable. But then who gets to decide what is reasonable, and from where does this authority derive? I see absolutely no evidence that the 14th Amendment set up a standard whereby the constitutionality of every law that is passed by any state ultimately rides on whether the state can persuade 5 individual judges that the law is \"reasonable,\" whatever that even means.\n \n \nActually, the Constitution doesn't require any recognition of marriage.\n\n Obviously not, even though the Supreme Court, in applying substantive due process, has said that it does.

Just for the record, so you can't accuse me of putting opinions in your mouth.\n\n I'll happily detract from my normal policy to answer this one question in the hopes that you will stop accusing me of insincerity. I think the definition of the institution of marriage is manifestly a state issue. From the beginning of our republic, marriage has been the province of the several states. I therefore do not really support the Federal Marriage Amendment. What I would support, however, is an amendment making it clear (though I think it already is) that the states are not required by the federal constitution to recognize same-sex marriage. Were the Supreme Court bound by the original meaning of the Constitution in its cases, such a clarification would not be necessary. But since the court has largely abandoned deciding its cases on these grounds (except, of course, when adhering to original meaning advances its policy goals), then I think an amendment doing exactly what I have suggested (and no further) is necessary to preserve the right of the states to continue doing something that they have done from long ago: create their own public policy regarding the institution of marriage. Hence, I would support an amendment that is much like the 9th Amendment; one describing how the Constitution is to be construed.\n \n In practice, this is why I support the right of Californians to vote on an amendment defining marriage on the one hand, but do not really care how they vote on that amendment on the other.",

No-one claims the Constitution says anything specific about sodomy, so stop floating that straw man. What is being read into the Constitution, and with considerable justice, is a right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable government interference in one's private life. That includes laws about sodomy, masturbation, contraception, etc.\n \n If you don't like the fact that lots of people do see the Constitution as providing them with protection against overweaning government authority, then I don't know what I can suggest for you.\n \n \nDiscrimination on the basis of race, as I have repeatedly said, has been placed out of bounds by the 14th Amendment; though incidentally, I'm not certain what provision of the Constitution would prohibit the federal government from discriminating even on that basis.

But they listed specific things as being protected. Why did they do that?\n\n \n If you recall, they also took the time to pass an Amendment saying that that rights no enumerated were retained by the people. They knew well enough that if you specify rights, then someone who loves authoritianism will come along and claim that unless it is specified, it doesn't exist as a right.\n \n \nThere is not a contradiction if it is true that the 14th Amendment set out to remove racial classifications, but leave other classifications intact.

   "We are back from our first vacation, a week at church camp! I did not look at my email or use the computer a single time during the whole wonderful experience. I was struck by how liberating NOT using the computer can be. Messages from work? I didn't read them. Arguments in this thread about the 14th amendment? I didn't read them either, though they interest me more than most messages from work do. \n \n I don't have time now to respond in any detail to any of the posts made since I left my computer at home and enjoyed the free life! \n \n I will, however, ask Phyllis one question. Phyllis, you said in an earlier post that the 14th amendment protects \"some rights.\" I think I just read a recent post here in which you said that you are not sure if you think that the amendment incorporates the Bill of Rights and applies them to the states. \n \n So if the 14th amendment protects \"some rights,\" what rights does it protect? For you to determine what these \"some rights\" are, wouldn't you have to turn to the Bill of Rights for a list?\n \n Note that I think the framers of the 14th amendment intended the amendment to protect rights more broadly than just those listed in the Bill of Rights, and as I think they intended to do more than outlaw merely \"racial classifications,\" which are nowhere mentioned in the amendment. It's clear from what John Bingham wrote that when he crafted the 14th amendment, he thought that the structure of the government set up by the constitution had failed to protect the rights of the people, as indeed it had. His primary goal was to extend the power of the federal government, through the constitution, to prevent the states from denying rights to the people. The states, as he saw it, had become the chief deniers of the people's rights, not the protector of the people's rights. One way to think of the framers' intent with the 14th amendment is to view this as a change in the structure of the government.....a tilting of governmental power toward the federal government and away from the states. \n \n Your principal objection to viewing the amendment as protecting rights broadly is that you think this interpretation of the amendment gives too much power to judges to determine what rights the amendment protects and what legal distinctions between people are reasonable. I am arguing that this is in fact what the framers intended with the 14th amendment: to give power to federal judges and also Congress and to take power away from the state legislatures. My reading of what the framers wrote suggests that they wanted to remove power from the states and place it squarely in the hands of federal judges and also Congress to pass enabling legislation for the amendment. You may personally object to this intent, but I think it was the original intent of the framers of this amendment. And if you are going to abide by your own standard of looking to the original intent of the framers, you cannot oppose interpreting the 14th amendment broadly simply because you dislike giving that much power to judges, if giving power to federal judges was the original intent of the amendment's framers. \n \n Using your own approach, which is looking to the original intent behind the provisions in the constitution, we see that the principal original intent for the 14th amendment was to limit the power of state legislatures. You may be most fearful of the power of judges, but that was not the sentiment of the Republicans who pushed through the 14th amendment (though they did insert into the amendment a definition of who is a citizen that effectively overturned Justice Taney's statement in the Dred Scott ruling that no black person is a citizen.) The primary source of outrage that fueled the creation of the 14th amendment was the actions of southern state legislatures. By interpreting the amendment more narrowly than either the framers or the Republicans who pushed through the amendment intended, you ignore the original intent for the 14th amendment, which was to give the federal government, including federal judges, the power to prevent state legislatures from denying rights to the people.",

   "On the question of who should decide what is reasonable, judges do decide what is reasonable....they decide this all the time. That's what judges do. From where do they derive this authority? The same place they derive the power of judicial review. It comes from tradition and precedent and from popular acceptance of the idea. The constitution says very little about the power of judges or the role of judges or the responsibility of judges. \n \n The constitution is not a rule book with every possible situation described in detail. It's written for the most part more broadly than that. A Supreme Court Justice, in making a ruling, does not simply look a situation up in the constitution the way a baseball umpire looks in the baseball rule book. \"Same-sex marriage? Let's see what page of the constitution this is on. Oh, it's not there? Then it doesn't exist.\" That's not what judges do, nor it is how the constitution was written. A Supreme Court justice has to interpret the meaning of a broadly written document, and they have to do it concerning a real case involving real human beings acting in the real world. So of course they consider what is reasonable. It's only reasonable for them to do so. To insist that they must base their rulings purely on a particular philosophy of interpretation is to strip the judges of their connection to human reality, and to the reality of the case before them. Judges do not operate in a purely philosophical realm, nor does the constitution require them to do so. \n \n The constitution does not say that judges cannot consider what is reasonable in their rulings. Indeed, they largely have to consider it. They have that power, obviously, through the structure of the governmental system that the framers created. \n \n Phyllis and Jyoshu, in expressing such fear of alleged \"judicial tyranny,\" speak as though the Supreme Court justices are just ruling the way they personally feel about issues, and not on the basis of the constitution. That may happen sometimes, but I think it's rare. Justices, acting in good faith, can and do disagree about what the constitution means. Those justices can and do make different interpretations of what is constitutional and what is not. That doesn't mean that they are ruling based only on their personal opinion concerning a particular issue. \n \n Phyllis and Jyoshu also seem to be expressing the belief that what is reasonable should be left to legislatures but not to the justices, since the justices' view of what is reasonable must simply be their opinion rather than what is in the constitution. This is a very narrow interpretation of the role of judges, and it leaves judges with little room to consider the actual circumstances faced by actual people in the real world. It takes most of the judging out of being a judge and replaces it with what sounds like a rote approach to reading the constitution, with little or no regard to anything else. Did the Supreme Court rule that there is a right to abortion in Roe v. Wade primarily because the justices on the Court believed in abortion? Or did the Supreme Court rule that there is a right to abortion because the justices did see a right to privacy protected by the constitution, and they did see in this particular case that privacy extends to the ability to make choices about reproduction, including choices about abortion? Were the justices motivated by personal beliefs in favor of abortion, or were they motivated by genuine interpretations of the consitution and what rights it protects? I think they were motivated by the latter. \n \n I think that Supreme Court justices, while often disagreeing in their approach to constitutional interpretation, mostly have tried to make rulings that are consistent with the constitution and are reasonable in light of the facts of the case. Good people can disagree with their rulings. But to suggest that the Supreme Court has been motivated through our history principally by politics or by the personal views of the judges on particular issues is unfair, I think, and inaccurate, though it may be an accurate criticism in certain specific cases. \n \n Of course, one can make the argument that there is no check on the power of the justices, no way to prevent them from imposing their political views on the whole nation with their rulings if they want to. My answer is that the check on the power of the Supreme Court comes mainly through the nomination and confirmation process for justices. We have to be really careful about whom we put on the Supreme Court. Beyond that, given the difficulty of amending the constitution, there is little we can do to check their power. We have to trust that reasonable justices will make reasonable rulings consistent with the constitution. And I think they generally, for the most part, have done this, even in cases in which I personally disagree with their ruling or dislike the outcome of their ruling.",

   "\n There is not a contradiction if it is true that the 14th Amendment set out to remove racial classifications, but leave other classifications intact. This, I think, is quite demonstrable as a principle. \n\n \n I do not think the framers of the 14th amendment set out to remove racial classifications. They did not say this, and the amendment is not worded with any reference whatsoever to racial classifications, or to race at all. In contrast, the 15th amendment DOES specifically prohibit the states from denying the right to vote based on race. The 15th amendment specifically and clearly prevents the states from making a racial classification in voting laws. The 14th amendment is not written that way; it makes no reference at all to race, and it refers broadly to persons and to states. \n \n My reading of the purpose of the 14th amendment, as described by its framers, notably John Bingham the author of language in section 1 of the amendment, is that his goal was to amend the constitution to limit state power to deny rights to individuals. He repeatedly expressed frustration that the states could deny rights to individuals, and the federal government under the existing constitution could do nothing about it. His focus was on limiting the power of state legislatures. He did not seek to limit state legislative power only in the area of race; and the amendment never specified only race. \n \n That the Supreme Court interpreted the amendment in the Slaughterhouse Cases as applying only to race discrimination is NOT evidence that this is what the framers of the amendment intended, especially given the Court's interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause in a way that rendered it essentially meaningless. Bingham clearly had other intentions for the privileges and immunities clause, which he intended to be the heart of the 14th amendment. Also, and ironically, the Supreme Court in the late 19th century after Slaughterhouse interpreted the 14th amendment as allowing racial classifications, not as prohibiting them. The Plessy ruling is the clearest and most stark example of this. Since then, of course, the Court has not ruled that racial classifications are out of bounds under the 14th amendment. The Court has subjected such classifications to strict scrutiny. And the Court applies strict scrutiny not exclusively to racial classifications. \n \n I have repeatedly pointed to the speeches of John Bingham who wrote section 1 of the 14th amendment, and I have quoted Bingham, to demonstrate what he intended with his amendment. You have ignored this, and you have said that original intent does not mean what the framers of the amendment meant for it. But if you reject what the framers said about the amendment as evidence of \"original intent,\" and you rely purely on what you say is the \"context\" for the ratification of the amendment and on a subsequent and weird Supreme Court ruling (Slaughterhouse) as evidence of original intent, then you are on very shaky ground. What you claim is the original intent of the amendment is based on what you believe is the context and not on either what the framers of the amendment said or on the language of the amendment itself. \n \n So whose \"original intent\" are you talking about when you describe the 14th amendment, if not the original intent of the man who wrote the amendment? You seem to have no problem returning to James Madison and what he wrote about his amendments. Why are you ignoring what John Bingham wrote about his amendment: the 14th?",

   "On the question of who should decide what is reasonable, judges do decide what is reasonable....they decide this all the time. That's what judges do. From where do they derive this authority? The same place they derive the power of judicial review. It comes from tradition and precedent and from popular acceptance of the idea. The constitution says very little about the power of judges or the role of judges or the responsibility of judges.\n\n \n In that case, we can criticize them if they rule in a way that we feel is not true to the way they should in order to be true to the constitution. I still see no reason that someone should be above criticism just because they are a judge. I get the impression you feel that it's just fine to criticise legislatures and elected people (in which case you are right of course) but that judges should be off-limits and allowed to rule any way they want with no criticism. I feel that, if anything, this branch of govt. involved unelected officials and therefore doesn't have the added protection of people being able to remove them if the need is there (unlike the legislature which can be voted out).

I think different people idealize different parts of government sometimes. Some people idealize the presidency, for instance--the whole 'Camelot' mindset. Others may idealize the judicial branch.\n\n \n I criticize Supreme Court rulings all the time. I think some rulings are horrible. Bowers v. Hardwick is an example of a horrible ruling from the modern era, in my view. Some people regard the Roe v. Wade ruling as equally horrible in their view. Most people today view the Dred Scott ruling as horrible, and probably most feel the same way about Plessy v. Ferguson. \n \n I have never said that the Supreme Court is beyond criticism. But there is a difference between saying that a particular ruling is wrong and saying that the Court is tyrannical. You have said, as I recall, that you don't oppose judicial review. It's judicial review, the power to strike down laws passed by Congress or laws passed by state and local governments, that gives the Supreme Court the power you apparently wish the Court did not have. So when you say that \"putting such power in the hands of a few individuals with no checks and balances goes against one of the very principles on which this country was founded--to move toward democracy away from monarchy or the rule of a few people,\" you contradict your earlier statement that you don't oppose judicial review. Apparently you do oppose it, because you believe that this power \"goes againt one of the very principles on which this country was founded.\" The framers of the constitution did not say much about the power of the Supreme Court in the text of the document itself, but most Americans, with the notable exception of Thomas Jefferson, accepted judicial review and assumed that this was what the Court ought to do. \n \n If you think that somehow the Supreme Court is more \"activist\" today than in the past, you should read about the rulings by the Marshall Court in the early 19th century. He was the pioneer who fashioned a powerful, activist Supreme Court through his leadership and his use of judicial review. He was condemned by Jeffersonians as embedding into our system of government, through his Court rulings, a Federalist view of government, even as the Federalist Party was dying. And he probably did just that. The Supreme Court has been \"activist\" for nearly its entire history; it's not true that the Supreme Court used to be restrained and then it suddenly became dominated by liberals and became \"activist.\" That's simply not accurate history.\n \n What do you mean when you say \"if they [the justices] go too far?\" What does that mean? Too far from what? From you particular way of interpreting the constitution? \n \n Yes, you are right that the justices are human, and they of necessity bring their personal opinions into their rulings. How could they not? And yes, you are right that the approach to constitutional interpretation that judges use reflects their personal ideologies and beliefs. Again, how could it not? I think, though, that most of us here, whatever our personal ideologies and beliefs, want the justices to rule based not purely on their personal political views or based on a particular desired outcome. We want them to rule based on the constitution as they interpret it. We don't want the justices to rule for stopping the vote recount because they favor Bush as President over Gore. We want them to consider carefully what the constitution says and what it means and rule on that basis. We don't want the justices to rule for abortion rights simply because they believe in abortion; we want them to consider carefully what the constitution says and what it means and rule on that basis. We have all here argued against what someone called \"results-based\" rulings. On that I think most of us here agree. \n \n Of course the justices differ from each other in how they interpret the constitution, but that kind of disagreement does not make a ruling out of bounds or \"tyrannical\" or going \"too far.\" If we were to see a justice ruling purely on the basis of his or her desired outcome, with no regard for the constitution, then that, in my view, would be out of bounds and worthy of the most strident criticism. I think this is what happened with Justice Taney's opinion in Dred Scott. He went out of his way to declare that no black person had rights and that no black person was a citizen, even though nothing of the kind appeared anywhere in the constitution.\n \n Most rulings by the Supreme Court are not like that. Most rulings, even rulings I consider wrong, are a faithful effort by the justices to interpret the constitution. Some rulings are, in my view, wrong rulings that make me angry and upset. That does not mean the Court went \"too far;\" it means that I disagree with how the majority interpreted the constitution in that case. I do criticize the justices. I think Justice Scalia, while reputedly brilliant, is wrong-headed in his approach to interpreting the constitution. That does not make him a tyrant, just wrong in my view. \n \n I think it's important to grasp the distinction between saying that the Court is wrong in a ruling and saying that the Court is \"tyrannical.\" And while it's true that liberals do criticize Justice Scalia vociferously, it isn't liberals who rail against the alleged \"tyranny\" of the Supreme Court. It's mostly extreme conservatives who have been doing that. And in attacking the Supreme Court as \"tyrannical\" simply because they disagree with the Court on various rulings, these conservatives go against one of the principles on which our republic was founded, which is respect for the rule of law and respect for one of the three branches of the federal government. It's ironic, I think, that conservatives, who usually tend to support the system set up by the framers and who usually support the rule of law, are nowadays attacking that system and attacking the rule of law. Not all conservatives are doing this, of course, but some of them are. It's ugly, and it does not serve our democratic republic.",

Nothing in the committee statement suggests that the 14th amendment was not intended to incorporate the first 8 amendments. Indeed, the quotation you present here says the opposite. It explains why members of Congress like Bingham thought the 14th amendment was needed to incorporate the Bill of Rights, because the judiciary had previously ruled (in Barron v. Baltimore) that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. The committee noted that the Republicans in Congress also feared that the Court would do likewise with Article 4, Section 2 of the constitution, that they would rule that the states did not have to respect the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States (which Bingham said was the same as the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states). Therefore, said the committee, the 14th amendment was written to ensure that the Bill of Rights would be incorporated and applied to the states, as would the provision of Article 4, Section 2. The material you quote says the opposite of what you claim it says. \n \n Bingham himself had long held that the Bill of Rights DID apply to the states, even before the Civil War. He thought that the Supreme Court had incorrectly interpreted the constitution in Barron v. Baltimore by ruling that the constitution did not require the states to respect the rights named in the Bill of Rights, and other rights as well. Because of this, Bingham clearly expressed his belief that a constitutional amendment was needed to require the states to adhere to the Bill of Rights and to respect other rights that Bingham saw as constitutionally protected. That was his intent with the 14th amendment. He viewed the constitution as protecting rights broadly, and because the Court had already ruled that the constitution did not protect rights from state abrogation, he felt it essential that a constitutional amendment extend the protection of rights to prevent the states from denying them. \n \n During the debates over the 14th amendment, Bingham said in a speech that the proposed amendment was &#8220;simply a proposition to arm the Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.&#8221;\n \n He went on to say that this was the purpose of both the privileges and immunities clause and the due process clause of the proposed amendment. \n \n I don't think it gets any clearer than that. Bingham said straight out that the purpose of the 14th amendment was \"to arm the Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.&#8221; \n \n To argue that the purpose of the amendment was not incorporation of the Bill of Rights is to argue against what Bingham said directly. \n \n You appear to have taken your argument about the privileges and immunities clause and about Bingham from this recent article on Federalistblogspot: http://federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm\n \n The analysis in this article appears to be an attempt to rewrite the history of the framing of the 14th amendment to make Bingham's clearly stated intentions sound other than what they were. I reject this analysis pretty much entirely as a twisting and a distortion of what the framers of the amendment said. I recommend instead to you the analysis of the 14th amendment by the legal scholar Michael Kent Curtis. His fine book No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights is a terrific analysis of the 14th amendment. Curtis makes the case that the framers of the 14th amendment and the Republican members of Congress who pushed the amendment through did intend to use the amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states. Other legal scholars have disagreed with this argument by Curtis, of course, and the incorporation debate has been a lively one on the Supreme Court over time. But Curtis places the language of the 14th amendment into the historical context of the Reconstruction era, and he closely examines the intent of the amendment's framers, including Bingham, and the intent of the amendment's champions in Congress. \n \n I also recommend that you read the following article by Michael Kent Curtis that appeared in the Akron Law Review. It is entitled \"JOHN A. BINGHAM AND THE STORY OF AMERICAN LIBERTY: THE LOST CAUSE MEETS THE 'LOST\n CLAUSE.'\" http://www.uakron.edu/law/docs/curtis36.4.pdf",

Is it reasonable to want to live in a dictatorship?

It seems to me that gay marriage oppionents are hard stretched to claim that there is no such constitutional obligation. You guys seem to eschew the use of reason altogether when a policy offends your gut instincts. At least, NONE of you have managed a rational rebuttal to this argument.

Otherwise we've just expanded it a little and it's still not really equality.\n\n \n I don't agree with this last statement. Marriage law has to include some consideration for marriages that may do harm, which means specifically and especially marriages between adults and children. There is both a rational basis for and a compelling state interest in prohibiting marriage between an adult and a child. It's for the protection of the child. The Supreme Court has never ruled that the rights protected under the constitution are absolute; they have long made the effort to balance the interests and needs of the state in providing protections against the rights of individuals. That's why the Court uses various balancing tests. \n \n Each specific effort to extend marriage rights beyond the limits they have now under the law needs to be considered on its own merits, in my view. Whether states should recognize polygamous marriages is a different question from whether states should recognize same-sex marriages. Some of the same questions about such marriages will naturally arise, but the answers to those questions may be different in the two situations, or maybe they won't be. \n \n When I argue that the issues in same-sex marriage cases are nearly identical to the issues in inter-racial marriage cases before the Loving v. Virginia ruling, I am not arguing that the Loving ruling should have automatically led to the legalization of same-sex marriage. I am simply pointing out that in both cases, there is no rational basis and no compelling state interest for the states to deny the right of marriage to the individuals in question. The parallels betweent the two situations are great, and the differences between the two are minor. But the question of whether inter-racial marriages must be recognized by law and whether same-sex marriages must be recognized by law are still different questions, and each must be evaluated on its own merits. \n \n I personally have never argued for sweeping away all restrictions on who can marry whom. I have argued for sweeping away restrictions that are based simply in prejudice and/or in religious doctrine, as neither of these rises to the level of either a rational basis or a compelling state interest in restricting who can marry whom. States need to have a good reason, beyond religious beliefs, for restricting who can marry whom under the law. Harm to children is a good reason. The inability to give consent, as in the case of a human marrying an animal, is a good reason. \n \n Dislike for gay people or a belief that same-sex relationships are sinful are NOT good reasons to restrict legal, civil marriage. (These are okay reasons for churches to prohibit religious marriage within their faith, but not for voters to prohibit civil marriage).",

Why should justices only add one more group when they could rule more broadly than that?\n\n \n You are misreading what I said. I have said that the 14th amendment protects rights broadly from state abrogation. However, as I said in an earlier post today, rights are not absolute. States have the power, indeed the obligtion, to pass laws for the protection of the people, and those laws can abridge certain rights, depending on what laws we are talking about and the circumstances. That is why the Supreme Court, rightly, seeks to balance the interests of the state in protecting people and the rights of individuals. The 14th amendment is not limited to any specific groups of people; it protects the rights of all persons. But the amendment does not protect rights absolutely, and states have to be able to present arguments for a rational basis or a compelling state interest in not extending marriage rights to particular people, because a particular kind of marriage would do harm or would lack consent between adults. \n \n You and I have both acknowledged that marriages between adults and children do harm, and thus the state has and should have the power to prohibit such marriages. There may be other examples of marriages that do harm or that are not between consenting adults. To figure out whether a particular kind of marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults, that kind of marriage needs to be considered on its own merits. \n \n I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples. I have argued that whether marriage should be extended to other kinds of couples now excluded should be considered with attention to the specific circumstances in each proposed legal change. Each legal change should be considered on its own merits. We need to consider whether polygamy does harm or is not between consenting adults, separately from our consideration of whether same-sex marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults. We need to consider whether first cousin marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults separately from our consideration of whether polygamy or same-sex marriage do harm or are between consenting adults. Each legal change has to be considered on its own merits, not in one lump. That's true because polygamy is not the same as same-sex marriage, and cousin marriage is not the same as same-sex marriage, and none of these is the same as inter-racial marriage. The issues are somewhat different in each kind of case. People need to be able to argue out the merits and problems of each law restricting particular kinds of marriage, whether the arguments take place in the courts, in the legislatures, or in both. I do not assume that either cousin marriage or polygamy should remain prohibited. My tendency is to think they should be legalized.

   "You are misreading what I said. I have said that the 14th amendment protects rights broadly from state abrogation. However, as I said in an earlier post today, rights are not absolute. States have the power, indeed the obligtion, to pass laws for the protection of the people, and those laws can abridge certain rights, depending on what laws we are talking about and the circumstances. That is why the Supreme Court, rightly, seeks to balance the interests of the state in protecting people and the rights of individuals. The 14th amendment is not limited to any specific groups of people; it protects the rights of all persons. But the amendment does not protect rights absolutely, and states have to be able to present arguments for a rational basis or a compelling state interest in not extending marriage rights to particular people, because a particular kind of marriage would do harm or would lack consent between adults. \n \n You and I have both acknowledged that marriages between adults and children do harm, and thus the state has and should have the power to prohibit such marriages. There may be other examples of marriages that do harm or that are not between consenting adults. To figure out whether a particular kind of marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults, that kind of marriage needs to be considered on its own merits. \n \n I have never argued that marriage rights should only be extended to include same-sex couples and no other kinds of couples. I have argued that whether marriage should be extended to other kinds of couples now excluded should be considered with attention to the specific circumstances in each proposed legal change. Each legal change should be considered on its own merits. We need to consider whether polygamy does harm or is not between consenting adults, separately from our consideration of whether same-sex marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults. We need to consider whether first cousin marriage does harm or is not between consenting adults separately from our consideration of whether polygamy or same-sex marriage do harm or are between consenting adults. Each legal change has to be considered on its own merits, not in one lump. That's true because polygamy is not the same as same-sex marriage, and cousin marriage is not the same as same-sex marriage, and none of these is the same as inter-racial marriage. The issues are somewhat different in each kind of case. People need to be able to argue out the merits and problems of each law restricting particular kinds of marriage, whether the arguments take place in the courts, in the legislatures, or in both. I do not assume that either cousin marriage or polygamy should remain prohibited. My tendency is to think they should be legalized. But we need to hear the arguments about harm and consent before we reach conclusions about these specific legal changes. \n \n This forum is about same-sex marriage, not about polygamy. I think we could have an interesting debate about whether polygamy should be legal, but not in this forum, which is on the issue of same-sex marriage specifically.\n\n \n I realize that this forum is dedicated to gay rights, but I also think one can't have a full discussion of the issue of marriage without discussing the broader issues of marriage. I think the issue is a part of a broader one. It's like someone discussing affirmative action without discussing the broader issue of civil rights, or discussing one particular religious group trying to avoid touching on the broader issue of religion. I don't think the issue of marriage can really be comprehensively discussed without dealing with marriage in a broader sense than just gays. And IMO, the issue of marriage discrimination is really not just about gay marriage specifically, but about legal marriage and the government's role in it. I think it's completely appropriate to consider broader implications here.\n \n As far as the rest of what you said, I see no reason that marriage should be dealt with only one specific group at a time--what you are referring to as 'on it's own merits.' For instance, our laws don't only give civil rights to black people, they give all people civil rights. Is there some legal reason that you feel things have to dealt with one category at a time? It seems unlikely to me that SCOTUS justices will specify gay marriage if and when they ever rule on it, and I think the same thing would happen in regards to the language of an amendment if and when that ever happens. They would more likely word it more generally, and rule on the issue of government recognition, period. (barring harm and consent issues, though I think we've covered that.)",

   "Your interpretation of the quotation from the congressional committee from 1871 on which Bingham sat is a misreading of what the committee said. Nothing in the committee statement suggests that the 14th amendment was not intended to incorporate the first 8 amendments. Indeed, the quotation you present here says the opposite. It explains why members of Congress like Bingham thought the 14th amendment was needed to incorporate the Bill of Rights, because the judiciary had previously ruled (in Barron v. Baltimore) that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. \nI'm not sure how you could read what I posted any differently than the only \"privledges and immunities\" awarded to the citizens were those already given in Article IV as it directly stated.\n \n \nThe committee noted that the Republicans in Congress also feared that the Court would do likewise with Article 4, Section 2 of the constitution, that they would rule that the states did not have to respect the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States (which Bingham said was the same as the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states)\n Not \"also\" but \"only\". It stated...in exact wording...that the only privileges and immunities in the 14th amendment are those in article IV section 2 which obviously did not include the first 8 amendments. \n \n \nTherefore, said the committee, the 14th amendment was written to ensure that the Bill of Rights would be incorporated and applied to the states, as would the provision of Article 4, Section 2. The material you quote says the opposite of what you claim it says. \nYou are mistaken on a huge level. You can't read beyond this: \"other than those privileges and immunities embraced in the original text of the Constitution, article four, section two\"\n \n You'd have to be delusional to think this means the first 8 amendments.\n \n \nTo argue that the purpose of the amendment was not incorporation of the Bill of Rights is to argue against what Bingham said directly. \nHe wasn't the one that adopted the amendment and he wasn't the only writer. The only 100% agreed upon meaning was the judicial committee's meaning which clearly states the opposite of Bingham's confusing flip flops on the subject. \n \n \nYou appear to have taken your argument about the privileges and immunities clause and about Bingham from this recent article on Federalistblogspot: http://federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm\nActually, I have access to college databases and original documents although that article does look familiar. \n \n I don't need your analysis on something you think I might have read...that is a strawman argument...something a professor should know.\n \n \nI also recommend that you read the following article by Michael Kent Curtis that appeared in the Akron Law Review. It is entitled \"JOHN A. BINGHAM AND THE STORY OF AMERICAN LIBERTY: THE LOST CAUSE MEETS THE 'LOST\n CLAUSE.'\" http://www.uakron.edu/law/docs/curtis36.4.pdf\n\n John Bingham would have been a good source if it wasn't for his repeatedly contradicting comments on the meaning. Even a draft of the amendment where Bingham said it would incorporate the bill of rights had a specific right in it which contradicted what he said. \n \n The clear meaning comes from those who adopted it in this case(since the major writer is too flip floppy)...not one lunatic who wrote part of it.\n \n EDIT: here is a total writing of the judicial committee: http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=950CE7D8133EEE34BC4950DFB766838A669FDE&oref=slogin\n \n Furthermore, it should be noted that the supreme court has never ruled the first 8 amendments are to be incorporated by the clause in question. Finally, if we are to take the meaning of Bingham then we have to take the meaning given for the entire amendment which we would conclude that \"due process of law\" is a procedual guarantee along with \"equal protections\".",

No one who is supporting marriage for same-sex couples is arguing that it's not about these things. However, it's a false dilemma fallacy to say we must consider other re-definitions of marriage, and we cannot allow only same-sex re-definition. That's an attempt at a diversion, because you have no logical argument against equal marriage for same-sex couples. Your side will try anything to avoid the topic at hand.\n \n What you're saying is similar to suggesting we can't give civil rights to black people, without considering the same rights for all citizens, including murderers(or anyone already operating illegally). You've got polygamy and maybe incest on your mind. These things are already illegal. Gay relationships are legal and healthy, as heterosexual ones are. There is no logical reason for exclusion of gay couples from equality with straight couples. It's already happened that there's equal same-sex marriage without legalized polygamy and incest. So your assertion the choices are limited to either reject same-sex marriage, or else accept polygamy or incest, is proven false. \n \n Yet, there is a long history of polygamy existing alongside legal heterosexual marriage. Certainly if two things occur at the same time, it means one is responsible for the other(sarcasm). One may ask how can we have legal marriage for same-sex couples, without considering every possible definition of marriage, not only the heterosexual definition. Sorry, but giving rights, to one group, has never meant you have to give it to every possible group, before you can give it to anyone. But of course, you've now steered us away from the topic of equal marriage for same-sex couples, which was your goal. \n \n \nIt seems unlikely to me that SCOTUS justices will specify gay marriage if and when they ever rule on it,\n\n \n Oh come on, you can do better than that. It would be two legal \"persons\" instead of one man and one woman.\n \n \nand I think the same thing would happen in regards to the language of an amendment if and when that ever happens. They would more likely word it more generally, and rule on the issue of government recognition, period. (barring harm and consent issues, though I think we've covered that.)\n\n \n So, because it would specify one man and one woman, we could have a father marrying his daughter? Well, of course not. Those relations are illegal, unless the law is overturned. That will be a separate case to be argued, if such a thing ever happens.",

We have wandered well beyond the specific topic of this thread with our discussion of the 14th amendment, and I am largely responsible for that, since I enjoy discussing the 14th amendment so much. \n \n As for legal reasons why the courts would address same-sex marriage specifically, the courts don't simply address issues; they deal with specific cases that are argued before them. How narrowly or broadly the Supreme Court rules will depend on what case is before them. Some rulings are more narrow in scope than others. One of the questions that arose in the sodomy rulings (Bowers v. Hardwick and Lawrence v. Texas) was whether the Court would rule purely on sodomy laws that criminalized gay sexual relations or on sodomy laws more generally. \n \n I doubt in any ruling on the constitutionality of laws banning same-sex marriage that the Supreme Court would rule beyond same-sex marriage.

He disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling in Barron v. Baltimore that the Bill of Rights did not apply o the states. He also believed that the states were required under the constitution's Article 4, Section 2 to respect the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and he feared that that the Supreme Court would rule otherwise and allow the states not to honor those privileges and immunities. This was also a fear of other Republicans on the committee on which Bingham served. \n \n Bingham and other Republicans saw the Supreme Court as allowing the states to get away with abrogating the rights of the people that were supposed to be protected by the constitution, in their view, with no means for the federal government to do anything to stop it. They wrote the 14th amendment to ensure that the Bill of Rights would be applied to the states and to ensure that the states would be forced to honor the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. \n \n Bingham and his fellow Republicans on the committee believed that the constitution already protected the rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, and that the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause would ensure that the states would be forced to honor those rights that were in fact already protected through the Bill of Rights and should already have been applied to the states. In the paragraph that you quoted earlier, the judiciary committee on which Bingham served stated that the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment created no new privileges and immunities beyond those already protected by the constitution. It didn't have to, in their view; the clause merely had to require the states to respect the rights named in the Bill of Rights. That was Bingham's intention for the privileges and immunities clause, to apply the Bill of Rights to the states, which he believed the constitution did in the first place, but had been incorrectly interpreted by the Supreme Court. That was his purpose in writing the 14th amendment, and he stated it clearly. \n \n In your previous post, you claimed that the paragraph shows that Bingham's commttee never intended for the first 8 amendments to be incorporated through the privileges and immunities clause. But a clear reading of the paragraph, in context, shows the opposite; the paragraph was an explanation by the committee that the privileges and immunities clause applied the Bill of Rights to the states, but did not guarantee the right to vote, which was not included in the Bill of Rights. Thus, said the committee, the 14th amendment did not guarantee Victoria Woodhull the right to vote. \n \n Bingham believed that Article 4, section 2 by itself required the states to adhere to the Bill of Rights, if the constitution were properly interpreted. Since he felt that the Supreme Court had ruled incorrectly that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states (in Barron v. Baltimore), he sought through the 14th amendment to ensure that incorporation, through both the privileges and immunities clause and through due process clause of the 14th amendment. Bingham said this quite clearly. \n \n As for your assertion that Bingham was a \"lunatic,\" there has been a reassessment by scholars of John Bingham in recent years. In 2000 there was a scholarly conference devoted to the legacy left by Bingham and his vision for the constitution and the 14th amendment. The old claim that Bingham was too wishy washy to take seriously is being rejected by scholars. Bingham and his fellow Republicans sought to strengthen the power of the federal goernment over the states and to use the power of the federal government to protect the rights protected through the Bill of Rights from state abrogation. Understood in that way, Bingham's arguments are mostly consistent, and they make sense. They also make the purposes of the 14th amendment clearer. Some folks may not like what Bingham and his fellow Congressional Republicans in the Reconstruction era sought to do with the 14th amendment, but if they are serious about looking to original intent in interpreting the constitution, they have to grapple with Bingham and his fellow Republicans who pushed through the amendment.\n \n It is true indeed that the Supreme Court has not ruled to incorporate all of the first 8 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which is what Bingham said he intended with the amendment. The Supreme Court has instead, over time, and with much debate on the subject, chosen selective incorporation through the due process clause, and not through the mostly unused privileges and immunities clause.",

Bingham also said that he believed the constitution protected rights not named in the Bill of Rights as well, though he was hazy about what those rights were, exactly. This is where, I think, his thinking became less clear. But he was clear when he wrote that he believed the constitution already applied the Bill of Rights to the states, that the rights named in the Bill of Rights were privileges and immunities that the constitution already protected before the adoption of the 14th amendment, from state abrogation as well as federal abrogation. As I said earlier, he believed that the Supreme Court had erred in its interpretation of whether the Bill of Rights applied to the states, which prompted him to write the 14th amendment, in order to rectify what he regarded as this error of interpretation.\n \n You repeatedly say that Bingham contradicted himself. How, exactly, did he contradict himself? He was not entirely clear about which rights beyond the Bill of Rights he thought the constitution protected and that the 14th amendment should protect, and this is, I think, a significant gap in clarity, but not a contradiction. \n \n You are right that Bingham cannot be viewed as the only source for the original intent of the amendment, but since he wrote it, he is an important source. Several scholars in the past have simply dismissed Bingham as you do, but more recent scholars have taken another view of his thinking and have concluded that he was in fact consistent and clear. And other Congressional Republicans who shepherded the 14th amendment through shared his viewpoint. \n \n As for the statement by the committee that you rely on for the meaning of the amendment, you are relying on an interpretation of the committee statement that I dispute, based on the arguments made by members of the committee, including Bingham. The committee said that the 14th amendment does not expand the privileges and immunities of citizens beyond those already granted in Article 4, section 2. They concluded that the 14th amendment did not expand privileges and immunities to include voting, which is why Victoria Woodhull was not guaranteed the right to vote by the amendment. The right to vote is not in the Bill of Rights. The argument that the 14th amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights, an argument that Bingham stated clearly, is consistent with the committee's statement that the privileges and immunities clause did not expand rights beyond those already granted by the constitution. The Bill of Rights was in the constitution; the right to vote was not. What the committee was saying, in essence, was that because voting was not among the rights listed in the Bill of Rights or anywhere in the constitution, voting was not among the privileges and immunities already protected by the constitution.\n \n You ask why, if Bingham wanted the 14th amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights, he did not state that explicitly in the amendment. Here I can only speculate. I suspect he thought it was clear from his wording, as he assumed the privileges and immunities of citizens included the rights named in the Bill of Rights. Phyllis has argued that the 14th amendment was intended to apply only to racial classifications, but the amendment itself says nothing at all about race. The words of the amendment don't support that interpretation directly either.",

Of course, the Supreme Court, a more conservative group, in the subsequent Slaughterhouse Cases ruling and in the Cruikshank case did not see privileges and immunities the same way that the Radical Republicans who crafted the amendment saw it, and they interpreted the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States as being pretty much nothing at all.\n\n \n It strains rationality to claim that because the 14th Amendment was probably occasioned by the Dred Scott decision, therefore it can only ever apply to race. Seems to me folk who try this tack are generally grasping for straws, indulging in special pleading to justify their personal prejudices. The 14th could easily have been framed solely in terms of race, if it had been the intent, but the language is more general.\n \n I agree with you that often, the US Constitution is a matter of interpretation. Folk like Steve seem to prefer to think of it as if it were a mathematical, proposition with one and only one correct answer for each issue. Which they, of course, possess. I think the founders were wise that on certain issues they made the document flexible enough to allow for interpretation in the light of social circumstances and views, so it acted as a protection rather than a straitjacket to restrict rights.",

My reason for bringing up the Dred Scott case here was not to argue that the amendment was intended to apply only to cases involving race discrimination, but rather to point out that the Radical Republicans who pushed through the 14th amendment probably saw the \"privileges and immunities\" of citizens as including the rights protected by the Bill of Rights. They sought to undo the ruling by the Taney Court and Justice Taney's declaration that no black person is a citizen because to be a citizen would grant that person the privileges and immunities of citizens, which include the rights protected by the Bill of Rights. This Taney found inconceivable and unreasonable. The Radical Republicans who pushed through the amendment probably agreed with Taney that the privileges and immunities of citizens included the rights protected by the Bill of Rights; they disagreed with him that black people should be excluded from those rights under the constitution, and they sought with the 14th amendment to ensure that black people would be treated as citizens with privileges and immunities and would be guaranteed the rights protected by the Bill of Rights. Certainly John Bingham saw privileges and immunities as guaranteeing the rights in the Bill of Rights, as he said so.",

   "Bingham's view of the constitution was that the privileges and immunities section in Article 4, Section 2 effectively, by itself, applied the Bill of Rights to the states.\nI don't see where he ever said this and if he did than he is wrong and an idiot. How could something adopted before all of a sudden mean something different later? It's crazy. Even more so when you look at an amendment that specifically said \"congress shall make no law\".\n \n We have been over this argument anyway and it still holds no water. Even if Bingham wanted the 14th amendment to incorporate the 8 amendments (which he very well might have wanted) he failed because intent doesn't always equal meaning. The meaning is given by those who adopt it and it is clear no one felt it would incorporate the first 8 amendments. \n \n \nYou repeatedly say that Bingham contradicted himself. How, exactly, did he contradict himself? He was not entirely clear about which rights beyond the Bill of Rights he thought the constitution protected and that the 14th amendment should protect, and this is, I think, a significant gap in clarity, but not a contradiction. \nSometimes he said the bill of rights should apply to the states (first 8) and other times he said no new rights would apply to the states other than those in Article IV. \n \n \nYou are right that Bingham cannot be viewed as the only source for the original intent of the amendment, but since he wrote it, he is an important source. Several scholars in the past have simply dismissed Bingham as you do, but more recent scholars have taken another view of his thinking and have concluded that he was in fact consistent and clear. And other Congressional Republicans who shepherded the 14th amendment through shared his viewpoint. \nHe is dismissed considering practically everyone else that adopted the amendment felt it didn't incorporate the amendments and furthermore the judiciary committee he was one explained it didn't!\n \n \nAs for the statement by the committee that you rely on for the meaning of the amendment, you are relying on an interpretation of the committee statement that I dispute, based on the arguments made by members of the committee, including Bingham.\nThere is really nothing to interpret. It says it very explicitly. \n \n \nThe committee said that the 14th amendment does not expand the privileges and immunities of citizens beyond those already granted in Article 4, section 2.\nAnd that is all it said.\n \n \n They concluded that the 14th amendment did not expand privileges and immunities to include voting, which is why Victoria Woodhull was not guaranteed the right to vote by the amendment. The right to vote is not in the Bill of Rights.\nBut more importantly it is not in Article IV\n \n \nThe argument that the 14th amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights, an argument that Bingham stated clearly, is consistent with the committee's statement that the privileges and immunities clause did not expand rights beyond those already granted by the constitution\nand this contradicts what you just said with it not expanding the \"privileges and immunities\" in Article IV.\n \n \nThe Bill of Rights was in the constitution; the right to vote was not\nNot when Article IV was adopted.\n \n \nWhat the committee was saying, in essence, was that because voting was not among the rights listed in the Bill of Rights or anywhere in the constitution, voting was not among the privileges and immunities already protected by the constitution.\nPrivileges and immunities was not defined by the first 8 amendments. This idea has no backing in founding documents.\n \n\n You ask why, if Bingham wanted the 14th amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights, he did not state that explicitly in the amendment. Here I can only speculate. I suspect he thought it was clear from his wording, as he assumed the privileges and immunities of citizens included the rights named in the Bill of Rights.\nYet no one thought this and surely the adopters of the amendment didn't. \n \n \nPhyllis has argued that the 14th amendment was intended to apply only to racial classifications, but the amendment itself says nothing at all about race. The words of the amendment don't support that interpretation directly either.\nI'd say it only indirectly applies to racial classifications because everyone else was already guaranteed elsewhere in the constitution.

Therefore, when the judiciary committee on which Bingham served said that the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment guaranteed no rights beyond those guaranteed in Article 4, Section 2, this meant, to Bingham and to other Radical Republicans as well, that the privileges and immunities clause did guarantee the rights protected by the Bill of Rights. Voting, which Victoria Woodhull argued was now guaranteed to women by the 14th amendment, was not in the Bill of Rights, and the committee said that the 14th amendment did not guarantee the right to vote. Bingham's position was not contradictory if you understand what he was arguing. That's not to say you or anyone has to agree with his understanding of Article 4, Section 2, but that was his understanding. \n \n It may seem crazy to you, but it was not crazy to Bingham. Nor was it crazy to other Radical Republicans at the time, who were furious that the states were trampling rights with impunity, and the federal government could do nothing under the constitution to stop them. Bingham and other fellow Radical Republicans saw the constitution, specifically Article 4, Section 2, as limiting the power of states to deny rights to the people, and they saw those rights as named in the Bill of Rights. They saw power as residing primarily in the national government. Bingham also saw the supremacy clause as the source of the national government having the power to prevent the states from denying rights to the people.\n \n That the Bill of Rights was added after Article 4, Section 2 was written was not a contradiction to Bingham and to other Radical Republicans. Bingham regarded the Bill of Rights as a clarification of the rights protected by the original constitution, a further explication of the meaning of the privileges and immunities of citizens. There has been over time rather lengthy debate over what the privileges and immunities of citizens are. Bingham believed, as did Chief Justice Taney before the Civil War, that these privileges and immunities included the rights named in the Bill of Rights. That's a reason why Taney insisted that no black person was a citizen, because he regarded black people having the rights named in the Bill of Rights, the privileges and immunities of citizens, as absurd and as contrary to the intent of the framers of the constitution. And Bingham insisted that black people must be regarded as citizens, so that they would be guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens, which he saw as including the right guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. That was a major motivation for Bingham's wording of the 14th amendment. \n \n That Article 4 does not say that it includes the Bill of Rights is irrelevant to Bingham's position. Of course it does not say this, as it was written before the Bill of Rights was added. As I just said, Bingham regarded the Bill of Rights as a clarification of the what the privileges and immunities of citizens were. \n \n To argue that this position has no backing in the founding documents is also not relevant. I am talking here about what Bingham believed; I am not making an argument that he was right or wrong in his interpretation. I am talking about how he interpreted the constitution, to get at what he intended with the 14th amendment and what the words that he wrote there meant in his thinking. When it comes to the 14th amendment, Bingham's writings and speeches are the founding documents. \n \n Let me point out that, for all that some scholars have dismissed Bingham, he was not alone in his interpretation among Radical Republicans at the time. His was a viewpoint that other Radical Republicans embraced. He regarded previous Supreme Court rulings on the constitution and Bill of Rights, notably the ruling in Dred Scott but also other rulings as well, such as Barron v. Baltimore, as wrong, and his purpose, and that of other Republicans in Congress, in crafting the 14th amendment was to overturn what he and others regarded as those wrong Supreme Court rulings and ensure federal power over the states in protecting the rights of the people. \n \n If you are going to make an argument about the 14th amendment based on \"original intent,\" then you have to grapple with the \"intent\" of John Bingham, who wrote the amendment. Those were his words. You can argue that Bingham's \"intent\" was not the \"meaning\" of the words, but then you get into arguing that words can \"mean\" not what the person who wrote them intended. Of course others can and have interpreted Bingham's words differently than he intended or meant them to be understood. That's clear from the earliest Supreme Court rulings on the meaning of the 14th amendment. And the ruling in Slaughterhouse was clearly not what Bingham intended, as it largely eviscerated the privileges and immunities clause, which he saw as the heart of the amendment. But if you look to the writings of the Radical Republicans of Bingham's era on the constitution and the 14th amendment, you'll find that they largely agreed with Bingham. People today may not agree with his interpretation of the constitution and with his argument for incorporation of the Bill of Rights, but he said explicitly that this is what he intended with the amendment. And because he regarded the Bill of Rights as articulating what privileges and immunities of citizens the constitution protected, the judiciary committee's statement that the 14th amendment did not add any new rights beyond those in Article 4 is consistent with Bingham's argument that the 14th amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights and applied them to the states. \n \n Ultimately, the \"meaning\" of any portion of the constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is, whether we agree with them or not. We may regard this as too much power for \"unelected judges,\" but it is the power we have granted them, that the founders in their wisdom granted them.",

   "Would you be so kind as to quote the decision so I can see what you are referencing. I really don't feel like reading the decision again.\n\n \n It is shocking to re-read the Dred Scott decision. Here is what I am referring to. Justice Taney sets apart black people as outside the category of citizens, and then he talks about what privileges and immunities citizens have and how the founders never intended for black people to have these privileges and immunities. Note that the privileges and immunities he lists are rights protected specifically by the Bill of Rights. I have bolded that part. The material from Taney's ruling is in italics and in blue:\n \n The question is simply this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were imported into this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to all the rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that instrument to the citizen? One of which rights is the privilege of suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified in the Constitution. \n \n It will be observed, that the plea applies to that class of persons only whose ancestors were negroes of the African race, and imported into this country, and sold and held as slaves. The only matter in issue before the court, therefore, is, whether the descendants of such slaves, when they shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who had become free before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the sense in which the word citizen is used in the Constitution of the United States. And this being the only matter in dispute on the pleadings, the court must be understood as speaking in this opinion of that class only, that is, of those persons who are the descendants of Africans who were imported into this country, and sold as slaves....\n The words 'people of the United States' and 'citizens' are synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the 'sovereign people,' and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We think they are not, and that they are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word 'citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate [60 U.S. 393, 405] and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.... \n \n In the opinion of the court, the legislation and histories of the times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show, that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument.... \n \n The legislation of the States therefore shows, in a manner not to be mistaken, the inferior and subject condition of that race at the time the Constitution was adopted, and long afterwards, throughout the thirteen States by which that instrument was framed; and it is hardly consistent with the respect due to these States, to suppose that they regarded at that time, as fellow-citizens and members of the sovereignty, a class of beings whom they had thus stigmatized; whom, as we are bound, out of respect to the State sovereignties, to assume they had deemed it just and necessary thus to stigmatize, and upon whom they had impressed such deep and enduring marks of inferiority and degradation; or, that when they met in convention to form the Constitution, they looked upon them as a portion of their constituents, or designed to include them in the provisions so carefully inserted for the security and protection of the liberties and rights of their citizens. It cannot be supposed that they intended to secure to them rights, and privileges, and rank, in the new political body throughout the Union, which every one of them denied within the limits of its own dominion. More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police [60 U.S. 393, 417] regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went. And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.

   "I'm not sure what you refer to in Dred Scott...Taney only talked about what someone would get if called a citizen (specifically said this). Taney did not say these were the privilege and immunities. In fact earlier states a citizen gets rights, privileges, and immunities. Those listed were rights it seems. I don't think you can infer those are the \"privileges and immunities\" addressed in Article IV. This claim is just too idiotic because Article IV was adopted before the amendments were. So if Article IV section 2 was only about the 8 amendments then what did it mean prior to their adoption? \n \n \nBingham believed that Article 4, Section 2 guaranteed the rights named in the Bill of Rights. Therefore, when the judiciary committee on which Bingham served said that the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment guaranteed no rights beyond those guaranteed in Article 4, Section 2, this meant, to Bingham and to other Radical Republicans as well, that the privileges and immunities clause did guarantee the rights protected by the Bill of Rights.

I've seen nothing to indicate Article 4 section 2, a provision adopted prior to the first 8 amendments, actually includes the first 8 amendments. \n \n \nTo argue that this position has no backing in the founding documents is also not relevant. I am talking here about what Bingham believed; I am not making an argument that he was right or wrong in his interpretation.

Those were his words. You can argue that Bingham's \"intent\" was not the \"meaning\" of the words, but then you get into arguing that words can \"mean\" not what the person who wrote them intended.\nOriginal understanding has never and will never mean equal original intent because intent is impossible to understand. The original meaning by those who adopted it is all that is important. It is clear the adopters only wanted Article IV section 2 to apply to the states. It is also clear that Article IV section 2 is not the same as the Bill of Rights...in fact, that judiciary committee ruling even distinguished the two in its ruling when it said the court ruled against applying the 8 amendments to the states and the same might happen to Article IV section 2. Seems like and odd way to phrase it if they felt the two were one in the same or one included the other.\n \n \nbut it is the power we have granted them, that the founders in their wisdom granted them.\nThis is without a doubt not true.

   "I suppose that you do not know that it has been the function of the Judicial Branch to interpret what the Constitution means, at least since the days of Marbury v. Madison in 1803.\nThey have always been able to do this as Marbury v. Madison was basically right from the federalist papers. Yet those same federalist papers state that the judiciary branch should be the weakest and in response to the anti-federalist saying judges would change the meaning to suit their needs the federalist papers state this is impossible because they merely have judgment. They go on to insure that the judges would only interpret (which does not mean 'to give meaning' as you seem to think it does) and not make up the meaning for a given provision based upon what they feel at that time.\n \n The concerns expressed by the Anti-Federalists are shown below. There is no authority that can remove them, and they cannot be controlled by the laws of the legislature. In short, they are independent of the people, of the legislature, and of every power under heaven. Men placed in this situation will generally soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself.\n ....\n The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature.\nhttp://www.thisnation.com/library/antifederalist/78-79.html\n \n And then the Federalists deny this would ever happen:\n \nIt may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\n ...\n This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power\n ...\n For I agree, that \"there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n ...\n It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.\n ...\n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both;\n ...\n It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature.\n \n\n And as for Marbury v. Madison being the original meaning:\n There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.\n\n \nFor the rest of us, 200+ years provides precedent enough.\nWith 150+ of that using the very view I am talking about.

You throw the away the facts when they disprove your claims, and you will even adopt strict constructionism if it is the only way you can critique originalism. But if you want to play it that way, fine. I submit the following, also from Federalist 78, which I suggest you read in its entirety before you post again on the matter, if only to avoid further embarrassment:\n \n \nThe complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\n\n \n \nSo much for the \"weakest branch\" canard.\n\n The same Federalist Paper that declared that, \"No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid[,]\" likewise purported to prove \"incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power[.]\" So, far from being a canard, the claim that the Judiciary is supposed to be the weakest of the three departments of power is simply a direct quote from Federalist 78.\n \n \nWhy not come out and say it. It's not \"judicial activism\" when the SCOTUS declares a statute unconstitutional.\n\n Why not come out and say it? Well, I typically do not make a habit of stating the obvious. Moreover, no one on these forums has ever said that judicial review always amounts to judicial activism. What we have said is that the text of the Constitution has meaning, and that meaning does not change simply because the times have changed. No one has ever said that the meaning of the Constitution can never change; we have only said that the way it changes is through Amendments. No one has ever said that the Constitution wasn't flexible; we have only said that it's flexibility derives from the procedural provisions of Article V and not the judicial provisions of Article III.\n \n I find it somewhat amusing that you have been vigorously countering an argument that no one has even made.\n \n \nThat leaves us only with the trivial matter of how the Court arrives at its decision.\n\n This matter is not trivial at all; a Supreme Court that would allow an 18 year-old to serve in Congress would certainly be exercising its power of judicial review illegitimately; or, put another way, it would be reaching an illegitimate and wrong result.

   "Who are the real activists on the U.S. Supreme Court? Do Republican appointees differ from Democratic appointees? How much? Are federal judges political?\n \n I have been studying these issues with several colleagues, including Thomas Miles, an economist and lawyer at the University of Chicago Law School, for a number of years now. One big question: Do judges show a political bias? We also wanted to see what any bias might tell us about how judges might rule in the future -- under, for example, an Obama or McCain administration...\n \n We used a simple test to decide whether an agency's decision should be counted as liberal or conservative. If a decision was challenged by a public-interest group, like the Sierra Club or Environmental Defense, we counted it as conservative. If it was challenged by a corporation, like Exxon or General Motors, we counted it as liberal.\n \n We used this method because the relevant question is not whether an agency's decision is liberal or conservative in the abstract -- it is how and why that decision is challenged in its context. In addition, though we had many students working on this, we read every decision ourselves, making adjustments when our method led to errors.\n \n We wanted to know: Is it true that liberal justices are more partisan than conservatives? Who is the most partisan member of the Supreme Court? Who the most neutral?\n \n Our answers: Justice Clarence Thomas wins the Partisanship Award. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wins the Neutrality Award.\n \n [see link for table]\n \n This information does not tell us everything we need to know. Thomas shows the strongest partisan bias, but is he also an activist? Does he vote to strike down agency decisions at a high rate? To test for judicial activism and judicial restraint, we examined all the data to find which justices are most likely to strike down agency decisions.\n \n It turns out that Breyer wins the award for Judicial Restraint. Surprisingly, the award for Judicial Activism goes to . . . Justice Scalia. Here are the results:\n \n [see link for table]\n \n While the Supreme Court gets the most attention, the lower courts are also important in determining the meaning of national law and shaping national policy. To analyze their behavior, we decided to focus on how Republican and Democratic appointees approach the decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Labor Relations Board.\n \n We asked whether Republican appointees are less likely to vote to uphold liberal decisions from those agencies, than conservative ones; and whether Democratic appointees show the opposite pattern. Here, too, we defined agency decisions as liberal or conservative depending on who challenged them. If a labor union or an environmental group made the challenge, for example, the decision was labeled conservative. If a company challenged a labor ruling or an environmental regulation, the decision was characterized as liberal. We again read all the decisions here to test our characterizations.\n \n The answer: Partisan voting is pervasive on the lower federal courts.\n \n When the agency's decision is conservative, Republican appointees are far more likely to vote to uphold it than are Democratic appointees. Democratic appointees show the same bias: When the agency's decision is liberal, Democratic appointees are much more likely to vote to uphold it than are Republican appointees.\n \n Republican appointees vote to uphold liberal agency decisions at a significantly lower rate than conservative agency decisions. Democratic appointees vote to uphold liberal agency decisions at a significantly higher rate than conservative agency decisions.\n \n This evidence offers three important lessons.\n \n First, widespread conservative complaints about \"liberal judicial activism\" should be taken with many grains of salt. If we ask how often the justices vote to strike down agency decisions, Scalia and Thomas, the most conservative members of the Supreme Court, show the most activist voting patterns. By contrast, the justices commonly described as \"liberal\" are the least activist.\n \n Of course, there are other measures of what makes a judge \"activist,\" and I do not claim that our method cannot be challenged, but it is useful to offer some statistical tests, which can ensure that critics are not building their conclusions into their definitions.\n \n Second, partisan voting is a serious problem in the federal judiciary. If the EPA issues a regulation that is aggressive in cleaning the air, or if the National Labor Relations Board resolves a dispute in favor of a union, a panel that consists solely of Republican appointees is unusually inclined to strike it down. That's indefensible. No one should approve of a situation in which the fate of an environmental regulation depends on whether a lower court panel consists of one, two or three Republican appointees.\n \n Third and perhaps most important, federal agencies in an Obama or McCain administration are likely to make a number of decisions that are more liberal than those of the Bush administration. Many decisions will ultimately be challenged in federal court -- and the Republican-appointed judges who dominate the federal bench could well prove to be a big obstacle. On the Supreme Court, for example, Scalia and Thomas might be joined, much of the time, by Roberts and Alito. On key occasions, Kennedy might probably join them as well.\n \n The lower federal courts could prove an even more serious barrier. Those courts have been stocked with appointees of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The voting behavior of appointees has been clear: They show a distinctive tendency to strike down agency decisions that do not follow a conservative line.\n \n Here, then, is a major warning for the next administration - and a potential problem for democracy itself.\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/cass-r-sunstein/judicial-partisanship-awa_b_116200.html",

I've never come across an \"originalist\" who's been able to convincingly explain that paradox. Apparently, \"original intent\" only applies when it supports colonial-era attitudes and \"morality\" they themselves subscribe to.\nYou haven't heard an explanation because you probably aren't listening. \n \n For one, \"intent\" has little to do with originalism (although there are some that believe this). Meaning and intent can often be two different things and meaning of those who adopted a provision is what is key to understanding the constitution. No other method makes logical sense or is anything better than a violation of the original meaning of the document.\n \n So the second amendment says keep and bear arms. So what was the meaning of \"arms\". Originalism doesn't restrict someone to seeing what \"arms\" were available at the time but instead what that term is defined as. When looking at what is available today you probably would look at what was allowable then to gain an understanding of what \"arms\" meant. Obviously \"arms\" did not mean cannon back when the 2nd amendment was adopted. If you look at the Heller case it actually defines \"arms\" rather nicely. So you look back and it turns out \"arms\" referred to mainly handheld weapons used, among other things, to defend yourself against your country or others. Machine guns might be a little harder for an orginialist because you don't really know if a machine gun is more like your normal handheld gun or more like a speciality weapon disallowed in those times. \n \n \n \nThe 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson&#8217;s dictionary defined &#8220;arms&#8221; as &#8220;weapons of offence, or armour of defence.&#8221; 1 Dictionary of the English Language 107 (4th ed.) (hereinafter Johnson). Timothy Cunningham&#8217;s important 1771 legal dictionary \n defined &#8220;arms&#8221; as &#8220;any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.&#8221; 1 A New and Complete Law Dic#tionary (1771); see also N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)(reprinted 1989) (hereinaf#ter Webster) (similar).\n ...\n Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivo#ous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35&#8211;36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding. \n\n \n This also can apply to something like the death penalty in the 8th amendment. Clearly the death penalty was allowed at the time of the 8th amendment but it was not done using the same methods we have today. One merely looks at what \"cruel\" meant then as opposed to the actual methods to determine that the death penalty is allowable. \n \n I get the feeling you are confused between a \"strict constructionist\" and an \"originalist\". The two are not even close to the same. Furthermore, it would be foolish to look at originalism and say \"oh some things are not easily known or will never be known\" and therefore conclude originalism cannot work. Scalia said originalism doesn't have to be perfect because it can't be; it only has to be better than any other method. The only other theory out right now is the \"living\" constitution which almost never has an answer for meaning in the constitution. At least with originalism there is an answer most of the time. \n \n No one on this forum has yet to produce a piece of historical (at the time of adoption) evidence suggesting the framers wanted a \"living\" constitution. Oddly enough, if you did, you would be looking at the original meaning to support a \"living\" constitution which is truly ironic. But if you decide that the \"living constitution\" is just a better idea than you just decided to give no meaning to the document you claim to defend. With little to no meaning we might as well have 9 judges be the \"supreme\" lawmakers. If one supports this then they are foolish and have killed democracy.",

   "Steeeve,\n Here's a trenchant critique of what you are trying to espouse:\n \n \n Friday, September 30, 2005\n \"We Must Never Forget That It Is A Constitution We Are Expounding\"\n \n Ann Althouse is, however, certainly right about this:\n \n Scalia said that the politicization of the Supreme Court could be attributed to the emergence of a &#8220;judicial philosophy which says the Constitution is indeterminate.&#8221;\"It will become unpoliticized, as it relatively used to be, as soon as we go back to saying the Constitution means what it says, and it means what it meant when it was adopted,\" he said.\n \n As I have pointed out before, the idea that the broad Constitutional generalities that are subject to the greatest controversy can somehow be \"determinate\"--that conclusions can be produced that no reasonable and knowledgable person could disagree with--is absurd. (As Lindsay notes, Ronald Dworkin--who has a much greater faith in the ability of grand theory to constrain judges than I--makes this elementary point clearly in his evaluation of John Roberts.) Obviously, the idea that concepts such as \"unreasonable search and seizure\" and \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and \"due process\" can lead to mechanical, formalist outcomes in all concrete cases is self-evidently wrong. This is not to say that constitutional law is crudely reducible to politics, or that all constitutional arguments are equally plausible. But on no question of any significant interest does the Constitution reliably yield determinate outcomes.\n \n These objections are well-known, so I won't go on at great length, but Scalia's claim that originalism can \"depoliticize\" constitutional discourse is incorrect for three major reasons. The first is that, as Richard Posner (and countless others) have noted, the choice to use originalism is itself a political choice. The text of the Constitution does not require that it be interpreted by the use of any particular method. It is not, of course, surprising, that \"originalism\" is preferred by conservatives, as by definition it will tend to produce more reactionary outcomes over the long run. This is fine, and it's perfectly appropriate for conservative presidents to take these consequences into account, but the use of \"originalism\" is in no way somehow innocent of politics. Second, even among its adherents \"originalism\" does not yield determinate outcomes. The historical record is inherently inconclusive even for trained historians, and of course law office history generally falls well below such standards. In addition to that, originalism does not answer important questions such as the level of generality at which constitutional clauses are to be interpreted. Randy Barnett and Robert Bork are both originalists, but obviously disagree on countless issues. Pick any landmark case: Lochner, Brown, Roe--and you'll find serious originalists on both sides of the question. And finally, in practice Supreme Court justices are never fully constrained by grand theory. To find Scalia choosing his political preferences over the demands of his interpretive methodology you have to go all the way back to Raich. And even Thomas, who is a more principled originalist than Scalia, reaches outcomes in a variety of cases--most notably affirmative action and free speech--in which he doesn't even try to justify the result in originalist terms, because it's virtually impossible to make the case in these terms. (All of these points, I should add, can be made about any grand theory, whether used by liberal or conservative judges; the point is not to say that originalism is illegitimate, just to say that it can't produce determinate outcomes.)\n \n And, of course, it's absolutely laughable for a man who signed Bush v. Gore to complain about a \"politicized\" judiciary. It's not just that the majority opinion completely contradicts Scalia's previous writings about the equal protection clause, or that even the decision's defenders don't claim that it could be justified in \"originalist\" terms. It's that the decision was wholly unprincipled even on its own terms--the Court was unwilling to either require a legally appropriate remedy or to articulate a principle that could be applied in future cases. If Scalia's concerned about the excessive \"politicization\" of the judiciary, perhaps he should start with his own chambers first.\n ",
