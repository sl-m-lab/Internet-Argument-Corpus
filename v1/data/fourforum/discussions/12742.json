   "U.S. Needs More Inflation to Speed Recovery, Say Mankiw, Rogoff - Bloomberg.com\n \n The \"economists\" are at it again, with a \"solution\" to America's economic woes drawn straight from such economic powerhouses as Zimbabwe and the Weimar republic.\n \n Even if their hare-brained scheme worked, without any unintended consequences, the primary outcomes would be;\n \n 1) Markedly reducing the living standards of the majority of Americans, by reducing their real incomes and pushing them into higher tax brackets.\n \n 2) Essentially defrauding the American government's creditors.\n \n 3) Propping up wall street and real estate markets by encouraging leveraged investments.\n \n But it won't work, even to do this, because inflation is like crack. It might feel good for a while, but each hit's less effective than the last, and you keep needing more of it. We go for 6%, we'll soon find we need 10%, then 20%, then 1000% to keep us going - or we'll crash again. The only question is, how much can America take before it ODs?",

   "Pure lies!!!! I should have known from someone as crazy straight forward as you Symbiote.\n \n Anyone with a brain knows that you can print a bunch of money and pay off your debt whenever you want. China and Japan will be happy and we will once again be free from the evil corporations that move jobs overseas. What does that have to do with inflation? EVERYTHING! Obama/Bush 2012.\n \n Oh, and don't you worry because we have made fixes that are just as good such as the credit card reform act passed today. That will show those greedy credit card holders who pay their bill every month! Why should THEY get all the benefits just for being a good customer? Makes me want punch them. \n \n I'm sure the new emission standards will show promising results as well. \n \n :xbanghead",
