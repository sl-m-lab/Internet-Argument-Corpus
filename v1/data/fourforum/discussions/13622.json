   "MEDIA MATTERS\n 'SNL' scorches Obama policies\n NBC comedy show ruthless in satire of president's plans\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Posted: November 22, 2009\n 12:49 pm Eastern\n \n \n By Joe Kovacs\n \u00a9 2009 WorldNetDaily \n \n \n \"Saturday Night Live\" opened its show last night with a comedy sketch that scorched President Obama over his economic policies including health care, \"Cash for Clunkers\" and borrowing billions of dollars from China. \n \n The NBC program featured comic Fred Armisen portraying the commander in chief at a news conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, played by Will Forte, who spoke through an interpreter, comic Nasim Pedrad. \n \n Hu began by asking Obama about the success of his economic stimulus. \n \n \"I'm curious. How many jobs has it created?\" asked the Chinese leader. \n \n \"None,\" answered Obama. \"But our health-care reform plan, we're confident, is going to lead to enormous savings.\" \n \n \"How exactly is extending health-care coverage to 30 million people going to save you money?\" Hu asked. \n \n \"I don't know,\" admitted Obama. \n \n The foreign leader also ridiculed Obama's \"Cash for Clunkers\" car-incentive program, and issued a warning about the money the U.S. owes to China: \"Just so there is no misunderstanding, you are not allowed to pay us back in clunkers.\" \n \n \"I assure you. You're going to get your money,\" stressed Obama. \n \n Sensing he was being lied to, Hu through his interpreter asked a similar question three times, including: \"Do I look like Mrs. Obama? Then why are you trying to do sex to me like I was Mrs. Obama? Just do it. Get it over with.\" \n \n Just a year ago during the presidential campaign, the prime target of \"Saturday Night Live\" was then-Alaska governor Sarah Palin who was not only spoofed by Tina Fey, but also featured in a controversial skit where New York Times reporters sought to probe the possibility Palin's husband, Todd, was having sex with the couple's own daughters.\n \n 'SNL' scorches Obama policies",
