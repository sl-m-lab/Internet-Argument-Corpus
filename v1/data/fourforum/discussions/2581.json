   "[What's the solution? Close our borders and end immigration already!!]\n \n Global Tuberculosis Epidemic Fuels US Trend\n \n ATLANTA (Reuters) - U.S. health experts said on Thursday a global tuberculosis epidemic was fueling high rates of the disease among immigrants, refugees and other foreign-born residents in the United States and threatening efforts to eradicate the disease. \n \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said foreign-born people accounted for 46 percent of the 16,377 new U.S. cases of tuberculosis in 2000 and 72 percent of the more serious 141 multi-drug resistant TB cases. \n \n The rate of infection in this group was more than seven times higher than for those born in the United States and those born outside its borders to U.S.-born parents. The study did not include anyone born overseas with at least one U.S.-born parent. \n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general19/TBAL.htm",

   "\"Diversity\" has brought nothing but strife in America.\n\n \n Diversity has brought us some tough times but it has always made us better for it. If you go back in history and take away all immigration to this country you are left with a country that would never have become the only worlds superpower and managed it within only 250 years of existance. Without immigration this country would be just another country living under the communist rule of Russia or the nazi rule of Germany. Immigration not only boosted our population but it also brought ideas from all around the world to our country and today it pulls in the brightest minds from every country. The US has to be the biggest brain drain of all time as extremely educated people from around the globe want to immigrate here and we allow it as it brings us greater strength. I'm not really sure how any strife due to diversity can be over come at this time simply by ending immigration anyways. Diversity will always be here.",

At that time the Irish were the prime carriers of Tuberculosis into the United States.\n \n I bet he would have gone insane trying to decide whether to let his white bretheren in or keep them out for fear of a tuberculosis epidemic among other whites!\n \n On edit: I thought of another possibility. He would have demanded the government step in and help out his white bretheren who mere unmericlessly and unfairly being victimized by a dreaded disease (spread in no doubt by the dark and dirty races of the world). In fact, he might have gone so far as to suggest that the Navy take an active role in transporting the Irish to America where their chances of survival were much higher than impovrished Ireland.\n \n Sorry but no matter how you spin it, your original post is pure xenophobia.

You, however, want to talk about the 19th centtury Irish immigrants.\n \n Okay, I think Mexicans account for the largest number of foreign born people in the US at this point. \n \n We do realize that these foreigners are not the only people with TB. The reason that TB even exists today and has been on the rise since the 1990's is the CDC and their lax policies in infectious disease, control, the closing of sanitariums when TB was almost eradicated, and high risk groups who are not screened yearly. Also, immigrants who bring disease into the country.\n \n Any statistics the CDC publishes, is probably at least six months to a year old and sorta like electoral votes--a couple of states decide emdemics.
