The judge, Michael Mosman of Federal District Court, said that there were exceptions to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, under which the Vatican is typically immune from the jurisdiction of American courts. Rejecting the church's bid to dismiss the case, Judge Mosman ruled that there was enough of a connection between the Vatican and the priest, the Rev. Andrew Ronan, who died in 1970, for him to be considered a Vatican employee under Oregon law.",

This lawsuit considers the culpability of the Vatican and as such, I would think, also considers the Vatican as a co-perpetrator.",
