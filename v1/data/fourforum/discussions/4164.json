   "-------Issue: 4 - Tuesday, January 04,\n 2005 - Plain Text \"Natural Disasters? Blame \n The Omega Letter Intelligence Digest Vol: 7America!\"\n ======================\n \n There are over six billion people living on our planet. Of that six billion, almost two billion are Muslims. That's roughly a third of the total population of the earth.\n \n The earthquake that triggered the killer tsunami was centered just off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country. It was also the most severely devastated by the wave. Nearly 100,000 of the victims of the December 26 catastrophe were Indonesian Muslims. The vast majority of the victims were either Muslims, Buddhists or Hindu. Got all that? Good.\n \n Now, to the United Nations. The United ! Nations consists of 186 countries. The most powerful voting bloc is the fifty-seven Islamic countries that generally vote with one voice, especially when the United States or Israel are voting the other way.\n \n The United Nations' head of humanitarian relief, Jan Egeland, criticized the West for being stingy. He didn't specifically mention America, but he cited the exact percentage of the U.S. GDP that is budgeted for foreign aid, so there is little doubt of who the 'stingy West' was, at least in Egeland's mind. Egeland slammed the United States for not raising taxes so that America could give a greater percentage of its GDP to the UN to distribute as part of the UN's foreign aid package.\n \n Editorials in the Washington Post, the New York Times and other liberal newspapers echoed Egeland's charge, with the New York Times calling America's $350 million in direct government aid 'miserly'.\n \n The United States makes up some six percent of the world's total population, but we pay a quarter of the United Nation's total budget. The United States pays forty percent of the world's total disaster relief aid, and sixty percent of the world's total food donations.\n \n The $2.4 billion (that's BILLION) dollars Washington spent in emergency aid in 2003 represented 40 percent of the total amount of emergency assistance from all bilateral donors provided that year. Evidently, that isn't enough. It didn't take long for these same liberal elitists to turn Mother Nature into an American right-wing hater of Islam. Not only had America's imperialistic self-enrichment policies created the natural disaster, but also cold-hearted Muslim-hating President Bush wouldn't leave his ranch in Texas...which by the way, is his home--not a vacation destination--and only offered a 'stingy' initial monetary donation.\n \n While these elitist journalist were assailing President Bush and expounding the mantra that America should be giving more money to the devastated region in a token gesture that would 'show Islam that America didn't hate Muslims', UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was still on his vacation skiing in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He returned to New York four days later.\n \n The wave struck on Sunday, and it took only until Monday before the U.S. announced its $350 million in initial aid, sent the USS Abraham Lincoln into the region, including helicopters, and C-130 transport planes, sent hundreds of tons of pre-packaged emergency aid supplies, and deployed some 14,000 American troops to help with the recovery and cleanup. In Indonesia, U.S. helicopters flew at least 30 sorties, delivering 60,000 pounds of water and supplies, from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along a 120-mile stretch of Sumatra island's ravaged coastline.\n \n Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the richest natio! ns in the Islamic world, donated a paltry $10 million each. The United Arab Emirates donated some $20 million to relieve the suffering of their Islamic 'brothers'. Egypt's contribution so far is $104,000.00. (Egypt gets $2 BILLION in U.S. foreign aid annually).\n \n Assessment: Did anybody notice that the majority of the private donations came from those evil corporate types the left so loves to loathe? Pfizer donated $10 million in cash and $25 million in drugs. (That is more than oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined). General Motors pledged $2 million in cash, ! agreed to match employee donations dollar for dollar, and is sending vehicles to transport food and medical supplies to the region. Other corporate donors include Nike Inc., American Express, General Electric, First Data Corp., Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Exxon-Mobil, Citigroup, Marriott International and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n \n On the other hand, where are all the Hollywood liberals? Activist actors such as Ben Affleck, Susan Sarandon, Al Franken, P. Diddy, and Barbra Streisand have not been heard from. Where is George Soros, the world's richest left wing liberal? Actress Sandra Bullock donated one million dollars, but Bullock is neither an activist nor a liberal. (She also donated one million following September 11). Super-rich liberals like Bono and Bruce Springsteen are promising to hold another 'aid concert' to collect money (not theirs) for the victims.\n \n America, as noted at the outset, represents six percent of the global population. But in any catastrophe, it gets one hundred percent of the blame. The UN's nose is out of joint because the Bush administration refuses to funnel its aid through the UN's various aid agencies. Kofi Annan\n wants to use the catastrophe to shore up the UN's sagging image in the wake of the Oil-For-Food thefts from Iraq.\n \n The United States wants to ensure the aid doesn't end up lining the pockets of UN officials. So the U.S. is 'too stingy' and gets another black eye. Where is the rest of the Islamic world? There are fifty-seven Islamic nations, and the world's biggest Islamic nation is the one that took the\n hardest hit. But it is the United States--the world's largest donor nation--that is grabbing all the headlines for being 'stingy'.\n \n To put things in perspective, I saw a news photo yesterday of one of the Indonesian victims. He was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the face of Osama bin Laden.",

Pakistan, like another 'close' ally Saudi Arabia, uses oppressive, military dominated governing ideology, and contributed virtually nothing in tsunami disaster aid. But, as so aptly pointed out by another poster, we're involved in the grand daddy of humanitarian projects, $7 billion a month reforming the country of our old ally Saddam. And we do have cash flow problems. \n \n Incidentally, Bush's Texas Ranch was purchased, renovated and expanded in 1999 as a 'homey' set for his run for the presidency to foster the impression that he's a Texan. Truman, Johnson and others proved the image value of 'quaint' home surroundings in public perception, and a mansion on the East Coast, Bush's real home and his power base, didn't fit the desired public setting.",

Even the reporters who rely on lifts in American helicopters in order to visit remote areas stricken by the wave, do not give any credit to the American personnel who made their journey possible. \n I assume this discreditable attitude is part of the \"fall out\" from the Iraq war and the division of sympathies which it has elicited.",

   "What a bunch of outright lies, halftruths, blatant spin and the whole thing reeks of anti-islamism emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n There are over six billion people living on our planet. Of that six billion, almost two billion are Muslims.

The vast majority of the victims were either Muslims, Buddhists or Hindu. Got all that? Good.\n\n \n Up until now, i guess things are pretty accurate. Not that I see why it should matter which religion the victims belong to... Or is a muslim or Hindu or Buddhist worth less than a cristian?\n \n \n Now, to the United Nations. The United ! Nations consists of 186 countries. The most powerful voting bloc is the fifty-seven Islamic countries that generally vote with one voice, especially when the United States or Israel are voting the other way.\n\n \n The most powerful \"bloc\" is the single countries with permanent seats in the security council. The general assembly is powerless compared to even one of the permanent members in the security council. A veto from one of the members of the security council will block any vote from the general assembly.\n \n \n The United Nations' head of humanitarian relief, Jan Egeland, criticized the West for being stingy. He didn't specifically mention America, but he cited the exact percentage of the U.S. GDP that is budgeted for foreign aid, so there is little doubt of who the 'stingy West' was, at least in Egeland's mind. Egeland slammed the United States for not raising taxes so that America could give a greater percentage of its GDP to the UN to distribute as part of the UN's foreign aid package.\n\n \n Yeah, when the aid pledged from the Swedish government was greater than the amount pledged from the US government (Swedish GDP ppp: 283,3 billion USD, US GDP ppp: 10,99 trillion USD) I think the critisism was very much founded. But after the critisism, the US government began to find ways to increase the aid. That was good.\n \n \n Editorials in the Washington Post, the New York Times and other liberal newspapers echoed Egeland's charge, with the New York Times calling America's $350 million in direct government aid 'miserly'.\n\n \n Yeah, I don`t know if I would call it \"miserly\", but when the governments in Germany, Japan, Asutralia and Canada all have pledged more in real figures, I wouldn`t say that the sum is very impressing. Also keep in mind that Egelands critisism came prior to this amount had been pledged. One can only speculate in how much of the increased pledge was due to the critisism from Egeland.\n \n \n \n \n The United States makes up some six percent of the world's total population, but we pay a quarter of the United Nation's total budget. The United States pays forty percent of the world's total disaster relief aid, and sixty percent of the world's total food donations.\n\n \n US pays for a larger portion of the UN budget for two reason: They have a permanent seat in the security counsil, and the US is the richest country in the world. And that they pay a quarter of the budget is not really true. US should be paying a quarter, but haven`t done so for quite some time and is currently negotiating for a lower fee (around 20%). \n \n And, I would very much like to see those other figures backed up iwth dome sources. US governments tend to be rather stingy when it comes to paying out aid. The average american tends to be quite generous, but not the government... \n \n \n The $2.4 billion (that's BILLION) dollars Washington spent in emergency aid in 2003 represented 40 percent of the total amount of emergency assistance from all bilateral donors provided that year. Evidently, that isn't enough. It didn't take long for these same liberal elitists to turn Mother Nature into an American right-wing hater of Islam. Not only had America's imperialistic self-enrichment policies created the natural disaster, but also cold-hearted Muslim-hating President Bush wouldn't leave his ranch in Texas...which by the way, is his home--not a vacation destination--and only offered a 'stingy' initial monetary donation.\n\n \n I can`t defend the so called liberal elitist as I don`t know anything about them, but I would like to see some backing for the emergncy aid figure. I thought the figure hisotricly been around 30%, but I guess operations in Iraq could boost the figure (nevermind the mess is caused by the US government as well)...\n \n And now the lying starts:\n \n \nThe wave struck on Sunday, and it took only until Monday before the U.S. announced its $350 million in initial aid, sent the USS Abraham Lincoln into the region, including helicopters, and C-130 transport planes, sent hundreds of tons of pre-packaged emergency aid supplies, and deployed some 14,000 American troops to help with the recovery and cleanup. In Indonesia, U.S. helicopters flew at least 30 sorties, delivering 60,000 pounds of water and supplies, from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along a 120-mile stretch of Sumatra island's ravaged coastline.\n \n\n \n What?!?! The amount of 350 million was officially declared on the Friday! Only 35 million dollars where anounced on the Monday. But I guess a zero here or there doesn`t matter much emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the richest natio! ns in the Islamic world, donated a paltry $10 million each. The United Arab Emirates donated some $20 million to relieve the suffering of their Islamic 'brothers'. Egypt's contribution so far is $104,000.00. (Egypt gets $2 BILLION in U.S. foreign aid annually).\n\n \n Errr... Kuwait has pledged 100 million dollars. Saudi Arabia has pledged 30 million dollars. Quatar with a population of 840 000 people has pledged 25 million dollars and the United Arab Emirates have pledged 20 million.\n \n As a percentage of their GDP, the aid pledged from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Quatar and the United Arab Emirates is far greater than the amount pledged by the US... Even per capita, Kuwait, Quatar and the Arab Emirates have pledged more than the US... You shouldn`t throw stones when you live in a glasshouse you know...\n \n \n\n Assessment: Did anybody notice that the majority of the private donations came from those evil corporate types the left so loves to loathe? \n\n \n Yet another lie. The majority of aid came from private individuals, not corporations...\n \n \n Pfizer donated $10 million in cash and $25 million in drugs. (That is more than oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined). \n\n \n No its not. As stated above, the Kuwait government have pledged 100 million dollars and the Saudi Arabian government pledged 30 million. How much privatly donated by individuals in Kuwait and is unkown, but in Saudi Arabia, private contributions are up to 67 million dollars.\n \n \n The United States wants to ensure the aid doesn't end up lining the pockets of UN officials. So the U.S. is 'too stingy' and gets another black eye. Where is the rest of the Islamic world? There are fifty-seven Islamic nations, and the world's biggest Islamic nation is the one that took thehardest hit. But it is the United States--the world's largest donor nation--that is grabbing all the headlines for being 'stingy'.\n \n\n \n The worlds largest donor country? Only if you count private donations. And this is only because the US is the richest- and one of the largest countries in the world. On a per capita basis, US government donations are not very impressive at all, as a percentage of the GDP, US donations only rank at place 23...\n \n \n Now, don`t get me wrong. US has been generous. But so has the rest of the world. Including quite a few muslim countries. Trying to masquarade the whole thing as an example of US superiority over the rest of the world in general, and the muslim world in particular is really, really pathetic.",
