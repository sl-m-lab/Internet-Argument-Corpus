   "Arrest at Walmart leads to charges of racism \n By BETSY TAYLOR\n The Associated Press \n Monday, November 16, 2009; 9:08 AM \n \n ST. LOUIS -- Nearly three years after Heather Ellis switched checkout lines at a southeast Missouri store and touched off what she calls a racially charged dispute with white customers and authorities, the young black schoolteacher faces a trial that could send her to prison for 15 years. \n \n Witnesses have told authorities that Ellis cut in front of waiting customers at the Walmart in Kennett on Jan. 6, 2007, shoved merchandise already placed on a conveyor belt out of the way, and became belligerent when confronted, according to court filings. \n \n Ellis maintains she was merely joining her cousin, whose checkout line was moving more quickly. She claimed in a written complaint to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that she was then pushed by a white customer, hassled by store employees, called racial slurs and physically mistreated by Kennett police officers. \n washingtonpost.com\n \n\n \n Right out of the liberal playbook. When you're wrong, yell 'racism!'",

It was Bush who led us the country into an uneeded and unjust war into Iraq that has now resulted into the Afghan conflict you see before you. This war is not a war of atrition but of logistics.\n \n So my views were not stooped in leftist propaganda but in fact. I am not blaming Bush since he did not know ehat the consequences were of neglecting the Afghan theater, and I am not like Simone so stop putting me into that category period.\n \n I am simply stating none of us could have known that Afghanistan would turn out the way it has, but the issue is now not what we should have done, but what we need to do now...\n\n \n Naw I just call them as I see them bubba. In your opinion it was unjust and uneeded. Toppling a murdering monster is not needed you say.

Not everyone would put their lives on the line for their fellow countrymen, straight or otherwise. emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nJP ANY belief can be brought to a point of an extreme. Look at the Crusades... It is a blight that still taints Christianity to this day. Take the first seige of Jerusalem of the first crusade where the enitre population was butchered!\n \n I am merely pointing out that any belief or sect of that belief has it's own extremeists. We cannot be quick to judge all peoples of that belief as radicals lest we become prejudice against that belief or those people.\n \n It would be the same as if we compared all Christians to those who bomb abortion clinics and then call all Christians murderers. Is the rooting of Islam stooped in violence? Certainly. Just as much of anything was in the ancient world...\n \n I know several Muslims personally. And they condemn and hate those of the 9/11 attacks and those who bombed London and the killer at Fort Hood. In fact they agree that the killings at Ft. Hood was a terrorist act! (As do I)\n \n Please let us all here not be so quick to judge a group of people.\n\n \n You may not realize it, but I live in the Detroit subs amongst the largest Muslim population outside of the Middle East. In fact, five times/day calls for prayers are broadcast in the streets of a nearby city, so I'm not a rookie when it comes to Islam. I see how the men treat their women and children and it certainly can't be compared to Christianity. \n Ever go to a park in 90+degree weather and see a woman in full BLACK Burqa? I saw it daily. The men, however, were dressed very comfortably. It's a totally male narcissistic culture designed to ONLY benefit males. \n \n \nAn absolutely beautiful post in its truth, clarity and conciseness for defining what islam represents at its most basic core and fundamental beliefs. The difference between the Quran and the bible is that when one interprets the Quran as intended by Mohamed, its founder, they will reflect the radical elements as they are today.\n \n But when anyone interprets the Bible as intended by Jesus, our Messiah, they will never force anyone to convert or die but will pray for those who disagree with them. This is the difference the christian bashers don't want to consider. They bring up the crusades and other historical atrocities as if they reflected the bible accurately, rather than having been perversions of it which they were. They are so ignorant of what the bible actually says that they blame it for the corruption of it by spiritually corrupted men.\n\n \n The Bible speaks about \"free will\", the Qur'an speaks about forced submission.

Has Largest U.S. Muslim Population\n Michigan has the second-largest Arab community outside the Middle East, after Paris. About 300,000 people of Arab descent live in southeast Michigan, including significant numbers of Iraqi, Lebanese, Yemeni, and Palestinian Americans. Almost two-thirds of the population were born in the United States, and 40 percent of those born outside of the country have moved here since 1980, according to data from the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS) Web site,<www.accesscommunity.org<, and the Detroit News. \n \n Two-thirds of Arab Americans in the United States speak fluent English, and three-quarters use Arabic language media to keep informed. More than 90 percent of Arab Americans have close friends or family in the Middle East, and almost 65 percent have traveled there. \n \n Demographers estimate that more than 8 million Muslims live in the United States, making them the second-largest religious community in the country. About half of Arab Americans are Muslim, while the other half identify themselves as Christian. In the past few decades, Islam has become the fastest-growing religion in the United States. \n \n Mich. Has Largest U.S. Muslim Population ?
