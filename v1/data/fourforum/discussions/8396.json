   "That's a very good question.\n As for me I was not convinced there was really such a thing as an invisible god or gods when I was young. I went to church because I was told to do so. I participated in the functions, performed in the plays, sang in the choir, etc., but never went that next step in actually reaching for God. At sixteen I got a job after school and on weekends, getting away from church and never returned.\n \n It was not until 20 years later that I actually turned to God, questioned His existence, and subsequently felt His presence. Then I returned to church only after seeking one that actually prohibited any other religious jargon except what was actually written in the Bible. Even then I stayed only after a few Bible studies where I felt somewhat comfortable with the teachings. When a church says, \"God told me...\", or \"This is what it means....\", or \"This is how we should see it...\", I believe that it strays from truth.\n \n Responsibility lies squarely on the shoulder of those that seek God as to how they go about it. Allowing any institution, whether it be a church or Bible study group, to bear that weight is futile, imo, and a complete waste of time.",

   "And also, other cultures throughout the world who did not have the bible as a part of their worlds - like the americas before colinization - seem to have had these feelings of connection to divitiy because they had gods of their own.

And i would be willing to accsept that the bible was at least derived from gods word, if i belived that jesus was the son of God, but how can anybody proove a claim like that? i mean, even if you could proove that he did miraculous things - what dose that have to do with the feeligns of connection to divinity that i have today?",

   "that's fascinating maximus\n \n I find it interesting that you seem to imply that if something is unknown that one should choose a possible option and believe in it. sometimes I am accused of trying to sound interested to make people let their guard down in arguments - as a result I am a bit defensive about that and I will let you know right now that I never do anything of the sort, I really find this idea interesting. My intuition is to think that it is more authentic to just not know when you have no way of knowing something, but on the other hand, as I have tried to argue in the philosophy thread I made, and as I have stated repeatedly, you can never really know anything absolutely, so any understanding of your world that you develop is indeed based on this sort of practice of coming up with possibilities for the unknown, and accepting the one that feels most right to you.\n \n However, I feel as though there's something different about this sort of decision when it comes to God, and even more so when it comes to the bible. What this difference is - is that it seems more like it is an answer contrived to eliminate unknowns rather than it is a provisional assumption intended to further ones understanding. That is, God doesn't seem to me to be an answer that results from an assessment of available information and an acceptance of a possibility for the sake of learning more things by it - as accepting cause and effect, or logic would. God addresses a lot of unknowns: What is right and wrong? - God decides - Why is it right and wrong? - Because god will judge you on it - what will happen to me when I die? - you will go to god and he will decide - where did the universe come from? - God created it - why do I sometimes feel connected to something greater than myself? -God is touching you. And what really makes that feel contrived to me, is that for me, none of those unknowns really have anything to do with each other at all, and so it seems way to convent to answer them all with the same answer, it just seems like an awful lot to assume. I would accept the idea that they are all related by their answer, and that god is their answer, perhaps, if there was some justification for that, if there was some information I had now that indicated that to me - but I just don't. The only way I feel as though I can use the word God, is in reference to something I feel sometimes.\n \n And the bible, to me, is just a book, one I have never even read. The Christian claim its hat the bible contains God's word - for me to believe this, I have to accept that the feeling I feel sometimes is not just a feeling, but an awareness of something that can write a book, or at least be responsible for one. To me that seems... very bizarre. And that's not to mention the bizarre content of this book. I understand the history of the bible to be that it is composed of a selection of story's passed down from people who knew a man named Jesus - these stories were very meaningful to people at the time because they had become the myth of the time - they allowed mythic thinkers to understand there worlds. However, in order for these stories to be considered related to God in any way, one has to accept the bizarre idea that Jesus is the son of God - and this is further confounded by the fact that the content of the bible requires the acceptance that God is ALSO all of the above mentioned answers to all of those unrelated unknowns, as well as many other things - like an entity capable of feeling things itself, like anger or love, and a entity that holds unlimited 'power' meaning, he can do anything. Even if this was the case though - these stories haven't been well preserved. And yes, I know I know, they have been preserved better than most other things, but most other things don't rely on their source so much for their credibility! That is, Plato's writing for example may been poorly passed down, but what we do have of it dose not appeal to the authority of Plato, so it doesn't matter if Plato actually wrote it or not. Belief in the bible resets entirely on the authority of Jesus. Even if it is the best preserved document in the world, it is not preserved well enough! There are different versions of the same gospel that contradict each other, and the decision on witch gospels ended up in the bible was made with clear ulterior motives.\n \n And none of that is to mention the establishment of Jesus' authority to begin with! How can you know that Jesus was the son of god? The bible says so, but the bibles credibility depends on the credibility of Jesus - that's circular. And also, Jesus' ideas are not entirely knew or unique. If they really were divinely inspired, I would think that they wouldn't seem so much like a mere development from the ideas of the philosophers of the time.",

This conclusion is not simply assumption but history. The evangelistic Christians have been born too late.\n \n As for the other religions--I do not want to be reduced to nothingness as Buddhism wishes, I am a unique person with a personality, to evolve into nothingness seems reverse\n \n The characters of Hinduism seem too fantastic to me to be real--much more fantastic and mythical than Jesus, who is human and divine.\n \n Judaism--foundational but incomplete, missing something.\n \n Baihai--rips off too much from other religions without having a clear cut distinction. It is a mimic.\n \n Islam's fanaticism, indiscriminate violence, and contradictions seem more glaring to me than that of Christianity. And their God isn't even a bit nice--too impersonal. Mohammed is a counterfeit of Jesus. That's just a few of the religions that I have looked at.\n\n \n \n No, Judaism is not missing anything at all.

But it's one worth remembering - in large measure because Spinoza's life and thought have the power to illuminate the kind of events that at the moment seem so intractable and overwhelming.\n \n The exact reasons for the excommunication of the 23-year-old Spinoza remain murky, but the reasons he came to be vilified throughout all of Europe are not. Spinoza argued that no group or religion could rightly claim infallible knowledge of the Creator's partiality to its beliefs and ways. After the excommunication, he spent the rest of his life - he died in 1677 at the age of 44 - studying the varieties of religious intolerance. The conclusions he drew are still of dismaying relevance.\n \n The Jews who banished Spinoza had themselves been victims of intolerance, refugees from the Spanish-Portuguese Inquisition. The Jews on the Iberian Peninsula had been forced to convert to Christianity at the end of the 15th century. In the intervening century, they had been kept under the vigilant gaze of the Inquisitors, who suspected the \"New Christians,\" as they were called even after generations of Christian practice, of carrying the rejection of Christ in their very blood. It can be argued that the Iberian Inquisition was Europe's first experiment in racialist ideology. \n \n Spinoza's reaction to the religious intolerance he saw around him was to try to think his way out of all sectarian thinking. He understood the powerful tendency in each of us toward developing a view of the truth that favors the circumstances into which we happened to have been born. Self-aggrandizement can be the invisible scaffolding of religion, politics or ideology. \n \n Against this tendency we have no defense but the relentless application of reason. Reason must stand guard against the self-serving false entailments that creep into our thinking, inducing us to believe that we are more cosmically important than we truly are, that we have had bestowed upon us - whether Jew or Christian or Muslim - a privileged position in the narrative of the world's unfolding. \n \n Spinoza's system is a long deductive argument for a conclusion as radical in our day as it was in his, namely that to the extent that we are rational, we each partake in exactly the same identity.\n \n Spinoza's faith in reason as our only hope and redemption is the core of his system, and its consequences reach out in many directions, including the political. Each of us has been endowed with reason, and it is our right, as well as our responsibility, to exercise it. Ceding this faculty to others, to the authorities of either the church or the state, is neither a rational nor an ethical option. \n \n Which is why, for Spinoza, democracy was the most superior form of government - only democracy can preserve and augment the rights of individuals. The state, in helping each person to preserve his life and well-being, can legitimately demand sacrifices from us, but it can never relieve us of our responsibility to strive to justify our beliefs in the light of evidence. \n \n It is for this reason that he argued that a government that impedes the development of the sciences subverts the very grounds for state legitimacy, which is to provide us physical safety so that we can realize our full potential. And this, too, is why he argued so adamantly against the influence of clerics in government. Statecraft infused with religion not only dissolves the justification for the state but is intrinsically unstable, since it must insist on its version of the truth against all others. \n \n Spinoza's attempt to deduce everything from first principles - that is, without reliance on empirical observation - can strike us today as quixotically impractical, and yet his project of radical rationality had concrete consequences. His writings, banned and condemned by greater Christian Europe, but continuously read and discussed, played a role in the audacious experiment in rational government that gave birth to this country. \n \n The Declaration of Independence, that extraordinary document first drafted by Thomas Jefferson, softly echoes Spinoza. John Locke, Spinoza's contemporary - both were born in 1632 - is a more obvious influence on Jefferson than Spinoza was. But Locke had himself been influenced by Spinoza's ideas on tolerance, freedom and democracy. In fact, Locke spent five formative years in Amsterdam, in exile because of the political troubles of his patron, the Earl of Shaftesbury. \n \n Though Spinoza was already dead, Locke met in Amsterdam men who almost certainly spoke of Spinoza. Locke's library not only included all of Spinoza's important works, but also works in which Spinoza had been discussed and condemned. \n \n It's worth noting that Locke emerged from his years in Amsterdam a far more egalitarian thinker, having decisively moved in the direction of Spinoza. He now accepted, as he had not before, the fundamental egalitarian claim that the legitimacy of the state's power derives from the consent of the governed, a phrase that would prominently find its way into the Declaration.\n \n Locke's claims on behalf of reason did not go as far as Spinoza's. He was firm in defending Christianity's revelation as the one true religion against Spinoza's universalism. In some of the fundamental ways in which Spinoza and Locke differed, Jefferson's view was more allied with Spinoza. (Spinoza's collected works were also in Jefferson's library, so Spinoza's impact may not just have been by way of Locke.)\n \n If we can hear Locke's influence in the phrase \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\" (a variation on Adam Smith's Locke-inspired \"life, liberty and pursuit of property\"), we can also catch the sound of Spinoza addressing us in Jefferson's appeal to the \"laws of nature and of nature's God.\" This is the language of Spinoza's universalist religion, which makes no reference to revelation, but rather to ethical truths that can be discovered through human reason. \n \n Spinoza had argued that our capacity for reason is what makes each of us a thing of inestimable worth, demonstrably deserving of dignity and compassion. That each individual is worthy of ethical consideration is itself a discoverable law of nature, obviating the appeal to divine revelation. An idea that had caused outrage when Spinoza first proposed it in the 17th century, adding fire to the denunciation of him as a godless immoralist, had found its way into the minds of men who set out to create a government the likes of which had never before been seen on this earth. \n \n Spinoza's dream of making us susceptible to the voice of reason might seem hopelessly quixotic at this moment, with religion-infested politics on the march. But imagine how much more impossible a dream it would have seemed on that day 350 years ago. And imagine, too, how much even sorrier our sorry world would have been without it. \n \n Rebecca Newberger Goldstein is the author, most recently, of \"Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity.\"",

   "easyrider, that is not the way to simulate in anyway the values you belive in. the same goes for matthew s. easyrider, i believe in God myself but what i know to be a fact is that you are giving off the wrong view of God. how can we claim to be christians and then make a cutting comment to someone else that has wronged us or misinterpretted what was said? that is not spreading the love of Christ...its the complete opposite. now for matt i say mind your words as well because your actions obviously cause reactions. we are here to discuss an issue not call people out or take cheap shots when no one is looking. stick to the issue and don;t turn this forum into boxing match. i ask that others listen to my words too. this is an interesting topic and everyone who wants to say something should have the chance to. but i know people will be reluctant to say anything if they feel like they are going to be attacked. now for the opening question, yes i was born into my faith (seventh day adventist). it is true that when you are born into a faith you do not question your doctrines too hard. but as i got older i looked up the things that my church holds dear. i now let the bible confirm my faith instead of blindly accepting. there are some things that i definitly disagree with in my church but i haven't found anything that can shake my overall beliefs. i have not had any life changing experiences but i have noticed a change in my life when i began my own studying. i began to learn more about God and how to live a pretty good life. i believe that there is nothing to lose by following God. you focus on living a life that is all about love and compassion, which makes the lives of others around you better. also the things that cause stress in this world are of minor imprtance because my thoughts lie elsewhere. my faith lies in God, who has brought me to where i am now in life. i just feel life would be a lot harder without faith in something, so i chose faith in God because experience tells me it is the most rewarding. keep it clean boys and have fun!emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Stick around and post with some of these Christ bashers for 6+ years like I have and you'll find specific ones like who have been previously mentioned do not want any \"Christ compassion.\" They simply want to bash Christ, the Bible, and anyone who defends the Word of God, including you (as you will see if you post here enough and profess Christ and his salvation).

   "I will answer the post myself. I am in the process of losing my faith, not in God, but of the church. I do sometimes find that simone can be a little harsh and critical but I understand were she is comming from. There is a lot of hatred directed at me and my people by the evangelical christian right, the muslims, and conservative judism. I look at things like this \n \n Jesus said Love thy neighbor as yourself. I am holding people accountable to that especially if they consider themselves followers of Jesus. The way they treat others must be the way they want to be treated. I am going to share with you a letter I sent to the members of my church recently talking about the replacement of our burned up church. Yes I understand that what you will read will make me look like a hypocrite but being gay and gay rights trumps religion.\n \n\n Dear fellow members of Messiah Evangelical Lutheran church,\n \n Last Sunday, February 5th 2006, we gathered to vote to eliminate one of the choices that affect the future of the church. I was disappointed in the result. I was hoping that we could move toward some decision regarding the church. \n At the meeting Lois Lucas made a statement in favor of restoring the church. She gave a heart felt speech as to why the church was important to her and what the building meant to her. I, also, want to take this opportunity to tell you a little about myself and what the church means to me. Lois spoke of her roots in the church and all the wonderful memories and memorable events in her life that have taken place in the church over the past years. I am sure that the majority of members have similar roots, stories, and memories. I am not so lucky in that I am a recent member invited in and confirmed within the last 10 years. I was born and baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. My paternal grandmother, father, and mother&#8217;s family were Roman Catholic. My paternal grandfather and my father&#8217;s brother were Methodists. I came to Michigan when I was 14 to stay with my father&#8217;s brother and his wife, who was Missouri synod Lutheran, my uncle and I became Lutheran. My father was a wonderer and I have lived in many parts of the eastern United States. Religion and Christian faith was very important to my father. He made it a point to make sure that where ever we were we went to church. I have attended, in my life, many different churches and Christian sects; these include Roman Catholic, Baptist, Salvation Army, Lutheran, Metropolitan Community Church, United church of Christ, and numerous non-denominational bible churches. All of the aforementioned churches have several things in common; their Faith in God, Love for Jesus, and a sense of community. I bring this up to make a point that no matter where you travel, live, or what church you attend it is our Christian faith that is important. Lois mentioned that she felt that the church building was the house of God, though true from a certain perspective, the church building is not and should never be considered the only house of God the church is also in our hearts. Jesus says in Matthew 18:20 &#8220;For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them&#8221;. We must remember this and realize that it is not the building that is the church but the community and body of Christ. We are all joined to Jesus through communion and all of us are washed clean in His holy blood. \n My past has shown me that it is not the place that matters but what is in our hearts. I feel that my past experience has given me a perspective that may be lacking in several factions of our membership. Change is always difficult and for many people that are rooted to the building and it may be extremely difficult to adjust to the upcoming changes. I feel that we have been given a great opportunity here to change for the better. The old church was beautiful and I too cried at the fire. I realize that out of the ashes could rise a new Messiah. I beg of all of the members of this church not to squander, and waste the gift and blessing God has bestowed upon us. We have set before us a chance to take all the best parts of the old church and get rid of the things, such as the stairs that we all don&#8217;t like, and build a beautiful new future. I would challenge all of the members to become visionaries and think; do we want to go back into the old building and the last member turn the lights out? Or do we want to think about the future and grow the church. \n The meeting with Pat Dever, the lady from the Synod, has shone some light some on the limitations of the current church building. The current church building is not very visitor friendly. I do know and understand this as a visitor at one time. Ask yourself this if you were a visitor off the street and knew nothing about the building and the people, you wanted to go to church, you drove by messiah, decided to stop. Where would you park? How would you get into the building? Wouldn&#8217;t you go to the front door only to find them locked? Would you stay? If you decided to try and find another way in would you then be in the church? How would you find the sanctuary or the bathrooms for that matter? \n \n \n",
