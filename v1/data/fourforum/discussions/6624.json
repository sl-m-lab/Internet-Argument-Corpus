Why, then did God say that besides Him, ther is no other savior?(Isaiah 43:11)\n\n \n Yes, the writers of the tanakah thought there was sin, but the concept was a dualistic concept. Each person is born with \"the urge to do good\", and the \"Urge to do evil\". It has nothing to do with 'original sin' or a fall. That is not a JEWISH concept. That was a christian concept first hinted by Paul, then brought into full fruitation by Saint Augustus. \n \n Also, the concept of Salvation for the Jewish religion is different that the concept of salvation in the CHristian religion. The Jewish religion concentrates on THIS life, and does not really concentrate on 'The world to come'. There are even some Jewish groups that do not even believe in an afterlife. Salvation was for THIS life, not the next one.\n \n From http://www.convert.org/differ.htm\n \n \n\n FREE WILL AND ORIGINAL SIN\n \n Judaism does not accept the notion of original sin, the idea that people are bad from birth and cannot remove sin by themselves but need an act of grace provided by the sacrificial death of Jesus as atonement for all of humanity's sins. For Christians, there are no other forms of salvation other than through Jesus.\n \n In contrast, the Jewish view is that humans are not born naturally good or naturally bad. They have both a good and a bad inclination in them, but they have the free moral will to choose the good and this free moral will can be more powerful than the evil inclination. Indeed, Jewish ethics requires the idea that humans decide for themselves how to act. This is so because temptation, and with it the possibility of sin, allows people to choose good and thus have moral merit. The Jewish view is not that humans are helpless in the face of moral error. \n \n",

I know who said \"Religion is the opiate of the masses\" and the man was right about capitalism to a point also.\n\n \n The greatest single source of political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was cited in 34% of their own quotations (Origins of the American Constitution, 1987). The first mention of God as the foundation of American society was made in the 'Mayflower Compact,' dated November 11, 1620:\n \n \"....Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of\n the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a\n voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;\n Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of\n God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together\n into a Civil Body....\" \n \n Our founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained, \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine.....Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants....\"\n \n And where did the actual concept of our democratic form of government originate? It is argued that in the decades just prior to the American Revolution, the Marquis de Montesquieu, a French philosopher, quoted the following Bible verse as the Biblical foundation for a new form of government:\n \n \"The Lord is our judge; (Judicial branch)\n The Lord is our lawgiver, (Congress)\n The Lord is our king.\" (Executive Branch)\n (Isaiah 33:22)\n \n In his subsequent writings, the Marquis expressed his views against absolute monarchy and championed a new form of government built on \"checks and balances.\" As it came to pass, the founding fathers took notice of the Marquis' recommendations, and founded the United States of America.\n \n People today will try to tell you that America was not founded on Christian principles. But the founding fathers tell a different story. Twenty-one times they cited Biblical violations in writing the Declaration of Independence. In that epic document, God is clearly and unequivocally identified as the creator of mankind, and the source behind the unalienable rights that men enjoy:\n \n \n \"We hold these truth to be self-evident, that all men are created \n equal, that they are endowed by their CREATOR with certain \n unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the\n pursuit of happiness.\" \n \n Even the United States Supreme Court recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, \"We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....\"\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Finally, in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed that, \"We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"\n \n Of the fifty-five members who contributed to the writing of the U.S. Constitution, fifty-two were Orthodox Evangelical Christians, sharing the exact same Christian beliefs that liberals today refer to as \"right-wing religious extremism.\" \n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government\" (History of the United States, 1832). \n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared the same beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the \"Stamp Act Resolutions,\" made public after his death) we read:\n \n \"Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse \n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.\" \n \n Many people will try to tell you that Thomas Jefferson was a 'deist' who did not believe in Jesus Christ or an active, sovereign God. Listen to a few of his quotations regarding America's Godly heritage:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Speaking of the Bible, Jefferson stated:\n \n \"A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\"\n (Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)\n \n And what about George Washington, the \"Father of our Country?\" Did he believe in God? Absolutely. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:\n \n \"It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my\n fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over\n the universe.\"\n \n On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:\n \n \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of\n Almighty God.\"\n \n And so it goes, from one founding father to the next. It is very clear in reviewing American history that our nation was founded on the principles of Christianity. And although the founding fathers established freedom of religion for all men, so that we could all choose to worship the God of our choice, the God that was almost universally mentioned in the writings and quotations of the founding fathers was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - the Lord Jesus Christ.",

   "Anti-American. Please. Anyone who opposes your fundanmentalism is branded \"unamerican.\" Just because we don't agree with YOU doesn't mean we don't love our country (or at least like it.) You're making broad generalizations here, EZ, and being judgemental to an obscene extent. But then of course, being a judgemental prat is being a true american, then? It's a bloody shambles is what it is.\n\n \n Yada, yada, yada....\n \n Let's take the humanistic concept that man is inherently good. Not only is this in direct opposition to what the Bible says (Psalm 51:5), but the founding fathers of America were also very aware that man is born inherently sinful. That's why they instituted a system of checks and balances in our constitution. They did that because they knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The more power our elected officials receive, the more corrupt and greedy they tend to become. They tend to look after their own self interests, and ignore the more noble and pressing needs of their constituents. We need only to look at the historical record of the twentieth century to see the inherent \"goodness\" of mankind. Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, six-million Jews gassed and incinerated in Germany, forty million Russians murdered during the Lenin and Stalinist \"purges,\" and over 100 million people slaughtered during the horrendous wars of this century alone. If anything has become painfully clear, it is the fact that the more \"intelligence\" man acquires, and the more he quote, \"evolves,\" the more efficient he becomes at exterminating his fellow man. \n \n Today we live in a society that is only a shell of what the founding father's sought to establish in the original thirteen colonies. The revered and sought-out pseudo-intellectuals of today have redefined God into their own likeness and image; they have rethought and rewritten the resurrection of Jesus Christ to where He is nothing more than some fanciful imagination of pre-enlightened man. They are redefining government, redefining truth and redefining morality. Emoreno, take a good, honest look around you. Adultery and fornication are running rampant. Homosexuals are coming out of the closet and \"gracing\" the pulpits of America's churches. Sexually transmitted diseases are more prevalent and deadly than in anytime in history. And more than forty million unborn children have been ripped from their mother's wombs through the auspices of government sanctioned abortion. You human secularist's say that \"we have arrived,\" but I ask you, \"How far have we really come from Sodom and Gomorrah?\" \n \n Today, the secular humanists are trying to outlaw the Ten Commandments and do away with anything that remotely mentions the name of Jesus Christ. They've ripped a display of the Ten Commandments down from the walls of an Alabama courtroom. They're trying to tell us that we can't mention the name of Jesus Christ in our public schools. They're trying to take the phrase, \"In God We Trust\" off of our coins and currency. They're trying to tell us that God has no place in our public institutions. And we have let it happen. But let me say this in no uncertain terms, that if now we do not stand firmly on the word of God, this nation shall not stand at all.\n \n We speak of and endorse principles such as truth, honesty, integrity, character, and virtue; love for country, commitment to family, and dedication to God. On these great principles America the Great, one nation under God, was founded. And only on these principles and the strength of God can we hope to stand, now and in the future. Yet even today, these great foundations of wisdom are crumbling beneath us. The violent and decadent society that the liberals so despise is the very one they have created. As one Orlando Sentinel columnist noted, \"They wanted sexual promiscuity, drugs, disregard for the law, no censorship of pornography, no laws against sodomy or public profanity, abortion on demand, quick and easy divorces, acceptance of homosexuality, Miranda rights, a welfare system that paid women to have illegitimate children, a tax system that penalizes marriage, and a godless education system that utilizes metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs in our public schools. And they got it. Every last bit of it.\" \n \n In the late 1700's an unknown writer listed the nine common stages that democracies go through before they invariably degenerate into dictatorships:\n \n FROM BONDAGE TO SPIRITUAL FAITH;\n FROM SPIRITUAL FAITH TO GREAT COURAGE;\n FROM COURAGE TO LIBERTY;\n FROM LIBERTY TO ABUNDANCE;\n FROM ABUNDANCE TO SELFISHNESS;\n FROM SELFISHNESS TO COMPLACENCY;\n FROM COMPLACENCY TO APATHY;\n FROM APATHY TO DEPENDENCY;\n AND FROM DEPENDENCY BACK INTO BONDAGE. \n \n We are now somewhere between apathy and dependency, and our slide into bondage is not far ahead. \n \n If a society doesn't believe in the moral laws of God, then who can they look to define the tenets of their morality? Do they look to the government or a Clinton White House as an example of how they should conduct themselves? God forbid. Christian author Philip Yancey recently wrote that, \"A government can arrest and punish Ku Klux Klan murderers but it cannot cure their hatred much less teach them love. It can pass laws making divorce more difficult but cannot show husbands and wives how to love each other. It can give subsidies and welfare to the poor but cannot teach the rich and apathetic how to shower them with grace and compassion. It can ban adultery but not lust, theft but not covetousness. And it can encourage virtue but cannot bestow holiness. Only God can do that.\" So much for the \"pillars of government morality.\" \n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the force of that last statement, \"....without virtue there can be no liberty.\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions.\n \n And let me tell you what else they've done to America. In 1980 the Supreme Court ruled that the Ten Commandments could not be posted on school bulletin boards. One reason cited by the court for taking the commandments off the walls was, \"Some child might read, venerate, and obey them.\" God forbid some poor child might take a liking to God's eternal law.\n \n In 1985 they tore down the nativity scenes and the menorahs from one end of this country to the other, and in 1991 a Federal Appeals court ruled that a female student could not write an essay in freshman English class about Jesus Christ. \n \n And their godless agenda will not stop there. \n \n But greater is He that is within us than he that is in the world! \n \n And there seems to be a new litmus test in America today to define political correctness. In a New York Times Magazine poll dated December 7, 1997, it was found that 87% of Americans consider themselves Christians. But many of our teachers, politicians, and the like say that if you believe in Biblical truths and Jesus Christ you are automatically a \"right-wing religious extremist.\" We know well that Christian values have always been shared by both sides of the political spectrum in America - at least until this generation. So if today, the only true believers of Jesus Christ reside on the right side of that political spectrum, then it isn't the Christians who have moved, it is society that has degenerated to the left. \n \n What's more, people say this is the 1990's, and that moral values change with the times. Since when does time have anything whatsoever to do with morality? God is the same, yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and His moral code has never changed. Christian values are the same today as they were the day the ink was drying on the Declaration of Independence. God was the sovereign Creator and Protector of America then, and He is our only hope for tomorrow. \n \n And to those who do not answer to God we say, \"There is still truth and justice and freedom in this land, and there are still those who are willing to take a stand for what's right in the eyes of God. For we know that we do not stand alone. As long as there is breath in our bodies and the Spirit of the living God within us, we shall endeavor to restore America to the great Christian nation she once was, so that this nation \"Of the people, By the people, and For the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" So help us God.",

   "Yada, yada, yada&#8230;.\n \n Let's take the humanistic concept that man is inherently good. Not only is this in direct opposition to what the Bible says (Psalm 51:5), but the founding fathers of America were also very aware that man is born inherently sinful. That's why they instituted a system of checks and balances in our constitution. They did that because they knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The more power our elected officials receive, the more corrupt and greedy they tend to become. They tend to look after their own self interests, and ignore the more noble and pressing needs of their constituents.\n\n Ok, I'll let it slide on a simple issue of semantics. The checks and balances system are in place so bad people can't run amok in the government. You're right in the absolute power corrupting thing, but the man being born inherently sinful thing is kind of irrelevant. \n \n \nWe need only to look at the historical record of the twentieth century to see the inherent \"goodness\" of mankind. Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, six-million Jews gassed and incinerated in Germany, forty million Russians murdered during the Lenin and Stalinist \"purges,\" and over 100 million people slaughtered during the horrendous wars of this century alone. If anything has become painfully clear, it is the fact that the more \"intelligence\" man acquires, and the more he quote, \"evolves,\" the more efficient he becomes at exterminating his fellow man. \n\n \n Well, you're right about that. The more intelligent man becomes the more ways he comes up with to kill one another. But that doesn't mean we've evolved. It's a sign of us devolving, and doing it rather quickly. Such things could be seen in the Japanese fundamentalism, in their radical defense of the emperor, of the Germans and their Aryan superiority, of today's radical muslim extremists, in today's fundamentalist Christians lobbying to take away people's rights. This isn't evolution; it's just the opposite, in fact.\n \n \nToday we live in a society that is only a shell of what the founding father's sought to establish in the original thirteen colonies. The revered and sought-out pseudo-intellectuals of today have redefined God into their own likeness and image; they have rethought and rewritten the resurrection of Jesus Christ to where He is nothing more than some fanciful imagination of pre-enlightened man. They are redefining government, redefining truth and redefining morality. Emoreno, take a good, honest look around you. Adultery and fornication are running rampant. Homosexuals are coming out of the closet and \"gracing\" the pulpits of America's churches. Sexually transmitted diseases are more prevalent and deadly than in anytime in history. And more than forty million unborn children have been ripped from their mother's wombs through the auspices of government sanctioned abortion. You human secularist's say that \"we have arrived,\" but I ask you, \"How far have we really come from Sodom and Gomorrah?\"\n\n \n I'll let the pre-enlightened man remark slide, simply because I don't feel like having you quote bible verses to me. Anyway. Bla bla bla, adultery and fornication run rampant-- when haven't they? I mean, hell, it was around during the renaissance, now, whenever you look, adultery and fornication were running \"rampant.\" Big deal.\n Homosexuals are coming out of the closet-- Oh no! Oh horrors, say it isn't so! They refuse to be brow beaten by the Christian right, and now they're standing up and demanding their human rights? Oh no, EZ! Run for cover! Run!\n \n \nToday, the secular humanists are trying to outlaw the Ten Commandments and do away with anything that remotely mentions the name of Jesus Christ. They've ripped a display of the Ten Commandments down from the walls of an Alabama courtroom. They're trying to tell us that we can't mention the name of Jesus Christ in our public schools. They're trying to take the phrase, \"In God We Trust\" off of our coins and currency. They're trying to tell us that God has no place in our public institutions. And we have let it happen. But let me say this in no uncertain terms, that if now we do not stand firmly on the word of God, this nation shall not stand at all.\n\n The reason we do this is so that Jews won't ask, \"Well why don't we have passages from the Torah around?\" and the Hindus won't say, \"We need the Vedas taught in schools,\" and the Muslims saying, \"Let's get the Koran in here as well.\" It's showing favoritism of one religion over another, and that's not fair. Do we have anything that mentions allah? Where can you find a monument dedicated to Shiva or Brahma or Vishnu? Do we have currency that also says \"In Allah we trust\" or \"In Shiva the destroyer we trust?\" No, we don't. So why should your god and your book get priority over theirs? It shouldn't.\n \n \nWe speak of and endorse principles such as truth, honesty, integrity, character, and virtue; love for country, commitment to family, and dedication to God. On these great principles America the Great, one nation under God, was founded. And only on these principles and the strength of God can we hope to stand, now and in the future. Yet even today, these great foundations of wisdom are crumbling beneath us. The violent and decadent society that the liberals so despise is the very one they have created.

And they got it. Every last bit of it.\"\n\n I myself endorce the principles of telling the truth, honesty, integrity, and character, and I'm not christian! My goodness. How about that? Many other countries have managed to get by just fine without your Christian god, haven't they? Japan is doing mighty fine. Saudi Arabia is purty rich. All without your god. And what's wrong with miranda rights? I find it funny that your source seems to consider them nothing more than an inconvenience. And again, that old \"public acceptance of homosexuality\" thing is so worn out. It means we're becoming more tolerant. I mean, really, is that such a bad thing, to tolerate a person? You're of course going to come back at me with bible verses saying that homosexuality is abominable, that it's a sin, that we shouldn't foster sin, bla bla bla, but there are differing opinions on this, so just spare me the bible beating.\n What do the metal detectors and drug sniffing dogs have to do with anything? Nothing, that's what. And don't say \"If everyone was christian then we wouldn't need to have them,\" because all of the pot heads I know are christians. All of the racists i know are devout christians. You know, the racists who do things that require metal detectors being brought into schools. The only time a gun was brought into my school was brought by--guess who-- a Christian! \n \n \nIn the late 1700's an unknown writer listed the nine common stages that democracies go through before they invariably degenerate into dictatorships:\n \n FROM BONDAGE TO SPIRITUAL FAITH;\n FROM SPIRITUAL FAITH TO GREAT COURAGE;\n FROM COURAGE TO LIBERTY;\n FROM LIBERTY TO ABUNDANCE;\n FROM ABUNDANCE TO SELFISHNESS;\n FROM SELFISHNESS TO COMPLACENCY;\n FROM COMPLACENCY TO APATHY;\n FROM APATHY TO DEPENDENCY;\n AND FROM DEPENDENCY BACK INTO BONDAGE. \n \n We are now somewhere between apathy and dependency, and our slide into bondage is not far ahead. \n\n Amazingly, EZ, I agree with you here, for the most part. Our selfish people have become complacent; the complacent are apathetic to the less fortunate, and it's this that I see in our country, is mainly apathy. \n \n \nIf a society doesn't believe in the moral laws of God, then who can they look to define the tenets of their morality? Do they look to the government or a Clinton White House as an example of how they should conduct themselves? God forbid. Christian author Philip Yancey recently wrote that, \"A government can arrest and punish Ku Klux Klan murderers but it cannot cure their hatred much less teach them love. It can pass laws making divorce more difficult but cannot show husbands and wives how to love each other. It can give subsidies and welfare to the poor but cannot teach the rich and apathetic how to shower them with grace and compassion. It can ban adultery but not lust, theft but not covetousness. And it can encourage virtue but cannot bestow holiness. Only God can do that.\" So much for the \"pillars of government morality.\" \n\n Oh, please. When will you realize that your god is not the be all end all? You judge everyone based on their faith, their sexual orientation, their nationality. Is that what being a christian does for you? Then no thanks, I think our country could do without it. Yancey is full of XXXX; what could HE do better than the government in dealing with the KKK? Or with adulterous husbands? Teach them the Bible?\n OOOoooooh, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Like I said, the most racist people I've ever met are Christian. The most violent people I have met are Christians. Please, save me your morals-- they don't do much good anyway. \n \n \nBenjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n\n An opinion, pure and simple. I disagree with him. How is religion the foundation of a republic? DO you agree or disagree? Take it one step further-- do you think that religion is the only foundation for civilization?\n \n \nDon't miss the force of that last statement, \"....without virtue there can be no liberty.\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions.\n\n Virtue, not faith in Christianity's god. Virtue can mean different things, perhaps character integrity, or honesty, or being a good person. Yes, Christianity espouses these things, but so do other faiths, creeds, etc. I myself am an atheist and yet i still believe in these values. Strange, huh?\n \n \nAnd let me tell you what else they've done to America. In 1980 the Supreme Court ruled that the Ten Commandments could not be posted on school bulletin boards. One reason cited by the court for taking the commandments off the walls was, \"Some child might read, venerate, and obey them.\" God forbid some poor child might take a liking to God's eternal law.\n\n Please, see my above statements concerning government favoritism.\n \n \nIn 1985 they tore down the nativity scenes and the menorahs from one end of this country to the other, and in 1991 a Federal Appeals court ruled that a female student could not write an essay in freshman English class about Jesus Christ. \n\n Listen to you trying to sound like the victim here. Menorahs were taken as well, weren't they? So it wasn't just the poor defenseless Christians being bullied on, was it?\n As for the essay, did you take into account what the topic was? What her angle was? Was it more of a proselytizing effort or was it an biographical essay? Did it support Jesus as God and say that all the other faiths were false, and as one christian on this board called them, \"fake pieces of trash?\" \n \n \nAnd their godless agenda will not stop there. \n \n But greater is He that is within us than he that is in the world! \n \n And there seems to be a new litmus test in America today to define political correctness. In a New York Times Magazine poll dated December 7, 1997, it was found that 87% of Americans consider themselves Christians. But many of our teachers, politicians, and the like say that if you believe in Biblical truths and Jesus Christ you are automatically a \"right-wing religious extremist.\" We know well that Christian values have always been shared by both sides of the political spectrum in America - at least until this generation. So if today, the only true believers of Jesus Christ reside on the right side of that political spectrum, then it isn't the Christians who have moved, it is society that has degenerated to the left.\n\n *Yawn... Oh, poor, poor Christians, don't like being stereotyped. Huh, isn't that hypocritical! Here they are saying that gays are promiscuous, gays are sinful, feminists are lesbians, and yet they're still crying from being called extremists? Yeah, yeah, same old stuff. When haven't Christians been griping about how society is degenerating? It's just now they complain even louder, to much more annoying effect.\n \n \nWhat's more, people say this is the 1990's, and that moral values change with the times. Since when does time have anything whatsoever to do with morality? God is the same, yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and His moral code has never changed. Christian values are the same today as they were the day the ink was drying on the Declaration of Independence. God was the sovereign Creator and Protector of America then, and He is our only hope for tomorrow. \n\n What, so we should keep the morals from the dark ages? From the medieval times? What, should we kill our kids who talk back to us, then? Kill homosexuals? Never eat shellfish or wear clothes of more than two fibers? Get real. Times have changed, baby, and your outdated book is struggling to keep up.\n \n \n \nAnd to those who do not answer to God we say, \"There is still truth and justice and freedom in this land, and there are still those who are willing to take a stand for what's right in the eyes of God. For we know that we do not stand alone. As long as there is breath in our bodies and the Spirit of the living God within us, we shall endeavor to restore America to the great Christian nation she once was, so that this nation \"Of the people, By the people, and For the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" So help us God.\n\n In other words, \"There are those still willing to discriminate, segregate, brow-beat, condemn, judge, and maim you.\"\n \"There is still truth and justice for Christians in this land.\"\n This nation for the people, by the people me arse. This nation is becoming a nation for christians, by the christians. So help me, god. Please save me from your followers.",

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:4: \"Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church.\"\n \n (also note 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15).\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n\n Which Church? Different denominations will give you different answers.\n \n Also, do you think eating pork is a sin? Just out of curiosity.\n \n -Wez",

Exactly how does Jesus tell us to treat a pagan or a tax collector and was it before or after he said some of these other things like do unto others as you would have done for me....love thy neighbor......\n \n So which is it? DO you treat others like a neighbor, like Jesus, or like a pagan or tax collector......\n \n The bible only seems clear when you read each line and take it out of context....then it convienently says whatever ya want it to!",

What this means is if a believer sins, and does not heed the counsel of the brother or witnesses, then, he is brought before the church and subsequently removed from positions of responsibility (ie. ministries). Now, the goal is not rejection, but restoration, with the idea of how serious sin really is. So, yes the passage is very specific regarding church discipline.",
