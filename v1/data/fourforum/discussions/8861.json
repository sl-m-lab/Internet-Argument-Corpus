   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n A Coup d'\u00c9tat in Sweden\n By JOHNNY MUNKHAMMAR\n September 13, 2006\n STOCKHOLM -- In Sweden's general elections on Sunday it seems possible that voters will end 12 years of Social Democratic rule. As a matter of fact, the Social Democrats have been in power for 65 of the last 74 years, so a government change would really be historic. A group of four center-right parties known as the Alliance has been leading in opinion polls by three to five percentage points for weeks, but the race has tightened and appears too close to call now.\n \n The Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister G\u00f6ran Persson and his would-be successor, P\u00e4r Nuder, are hiding problems and campaigning on a non-reform agenda. The party is locked up with special interests and abuses its power, which has put a halt to further reform and created a democratic deficit.\n \n The Social Democrats have not always opposed free markets and limited government. Before the 1970s, Sweden remained a low-tax country despite decades of Social Democratic power. In the late 1980s, they cut marginal tax rates, proposed EU membership and deregulated the financial markets. But now, the Swedish Social Democrats are one of the least reformist parties in Europe.\n \n Leading up to the elections, they have presented no vision or ideas for the future other than to increase taxes and labor-market regulations, and prohibit private competition in traditional public services, such as health care. Instead of new ideas, they want to get re-elected on their past record. But Sweden still has the highest taxes in the West, a highly regulated labor market and public welfare monopolies with growing problems.\n \n The McKinsey Global Institute estimates Sweden's total unemployment rate to be 15%. That may surprise, as Eurostat puts the official unemployment rate at 7.8%. But when you add jobless people in temporary government programs, as well as those parked in early retirement and disability schemes, the figure roughly doubles. During the last 15 years, Sweden has decreased the size of the work force more than any other European country. But is has doubled the number of early retirees, who now total 550,000, outnumbering entrepreneurs. There are 22,000 early retirees under the age of 30, up from 13,000 in 1999. Youth unemployment is 22%, the fifth-highest rate in the European Union.\n \n So why hasn't the opposition already wrapped up the election? And why, over the years, have there been so few shifts of government in Sweden?\n \n The main reason is that the Social Democrats have become one with the state. They use and abuse public power to remain in government. Half of the taxes are hidden and people are not fully aware of the total tax burden. Labor-market regulations make it in practice mandatory for workers to belong to trade unions -- which, in turn, support the Social Democrats.\n \n The law forces employers to pay full-time wages to people even when they are engaged in trade union activities instead of working. During an election year, that means thousands of employees are working almost full time for the Social Democrats. The number of elected representatives for the biggest trade union, LO, is about 35,000. That is, they are party workers whose wages are paid by private employers, campaigning at the facilities of the companies. In addition, public authorities spent last year some \u0080200 million on activities to shape public opinion, called \"information\" by the government. The boards of universities are filled with Social Democrats. And so are the boards of civic organizations that are supposed to be independent from the state. They even installed the former deputy prime minister as the chairman of Swedish Public Television. All of this makes it harder for countervailing arguments to gain credence in the public debate. The Social Democrats' grip on power is so strong and has been so long-lasting that it seems almost abnormal to have a shift of government. A coup d'\u00e9tat is what the tabloid Expressen, only slightly tongue-in-cheek, called it last year -- indeed the same words once used by Social Democrat Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog.\n \n The Allliance recognizes the problems facing Sweden, particularly in the labor market, and proposes some deregulations and cuts in welfare benefits and taxes in order to increase employment and get people from welfare to work. The program is not radical, but every long journey starts with a few steps. Swedish voters face a choice between a relaunch of reforms of the kind that have been successful in the past, or standstill and worsening economic problems.\n \n Mr. Munkhammar is program director for Timbro, a think tank in Sweden.",

   "The Journal just can't stand the thought of what's going on in Sweden. They are having too much fun there.\n \n Swedish Remodeling\n September 15, 2006\n Elections in Sweden this Sunday are a good excuse, as if Europeans needed one, to once again wax enthusiastic about that \"Swedish model.\" Seen from the Continent, the Swedes manage to combine dynamic growth (a positively tigerish, for the EU, 3.4%) and low unemployment with a generous welfare state and high living standards. Utopia, to many Europeans -- and like that place, a fiction, too.\n \n The good economic numbers out of Sweden are for real, but the nanny-state enthusiasts get their causality backward. The country bounced back from a painful recession in the past decade in spite of its socialist system, not because of it.\n \n The \"Swedish model\" crowd conveniently ignores that the revival came after free-market reforms in the early 1990s, including cuts in marginal tax rates and welfare benefits, the creation of independent central bank, and deregulation. A nationwide school voucher program was put in place and pensions partially privatized. The ruling center-left Social Democrats, which took power in 1994, played their part, too, by repealing the death tax. If only American pols were as innovative.\n \n Yet the Social Democrats, in power for 65 of the past 74 years, have grown complacent. They're now running on a non-reform platform. Early polls gave an edge to the Alliance, a center-right block that for the first time puts all the opposition parties under the same roof. Not that the Alliance can be too radical in its plank. This is still Sweden, a conservative place. \"We want to show that we like the Sweden we have -- but also signal a will to change things through safe steps,\" said prime minister-hopeful Frederik Reinfeldt.\n \n The Alliance's outreach to the left, though, has given the incumbent an easy opening for attack. \"We have an opposition team saying: 'We are also Social Democrats: Vote for us',\" Prime Minister G\u00f6ran Persson said after a recent TV debate. \"Then of course you'd rather go with the original.\" And so, having trailed in the polls for many weeks, the Social Democrats have caught up with their challenger; the race is now too close to call.\n \n Whoever wins the elections will inherit big problems. Sweden still has one of the highest income tax rates and most expensive welfare systems in the OECD. Unemployment is officially 4.5%, but it rises to 17% if the hidden jobless (people on sick leave, retraining or in early retirement) are included, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. High labor costs and iron-clad firing rules prevent companies from hiring. Youth unemployment is 25.9%, according to Eurostat.\n \n The intellectual parents of the Swedish model in the 1930s, Gunnar and Alva Myrdal, thought the welfare state could work in Sweden because it was a small, homogenous country with a well-educated population. With their Protestant work ethic, the Myrdals reasoned, Swedes would continue to labor hard despite high taxes and social assistance. In the early days of the Swedish welfare state it was considered \"shameful to live on government handouts,\" Swedish economic writer Johan Norberg says. \"Problems began to surface in the next generations, which were brought up in this system. Attitudes have really changed.\"\n \n The young and immigrants, in particular, lack the kind of self-reliance seen in the past. Many are born into unemployment, growing up without ever seeing an adult work. According to polls, notes Mr. Norberg, about half of all Swedes think it is acceptable to call in sick for reasons other than sickness. That leads to gross abuses. In 2004, 16% of the government budget went to pay for sickness benefits. About 10% of the working age population has retired with disability benefits. There are 22,000 early \"retirees\" under the age of 30.\n \n Though his party pushed or supported reforms in the past, Mr. Persson today says the road to electoral victory lies in \"a fight for the Swedish model.\" In other words, he is shunning any fresh injection of market medicine that did so much good the last time around. Though hardly Thatcherite in its rhetoric, the Alliance proposes to cut welfare benefits and taxes for low-income earners.\n \n If Sweden does resume its reform path, it could become a different sort of model -- showing the rest of Europe how to overhaul a costly, sputtering welfare state.",
