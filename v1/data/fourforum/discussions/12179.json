   "I find it amusing that some people who staunchly defend the rights of gays do not support the rights of other consenting adults (from my experience on other fora - not sure about here as it isn't talked about much that I've seen). If consenting adults should be able to have sex and get married (they should as per their right to do what they want and right to contract with each other) than there is no argument to be made against incest. \n \n Consenting adults are consenting adults. I've heard the argument that they should not be able to get married because they can produce offspring with defects. If that is true than why do we allow those with genetic diseases to marry? They will also produce such offspring. If one should be banned for this reason than so should the other. Not allowing them to have sex is wrong because they have the right to do what they want with their own bodies. Not allowing them to marry is wrong because they have the right to contract, and stupid because they will still have sex with each other if they want to. \n \n \n As for polygamy, they are consenting adults as well. The same arguments made above and elsewhere for gay marriage apply just as well to polygamy.\n \n Thoughts? (open to both sides of the Gay rights debate)",

Matters of sex ruled by consent, matters of genetics ruled by genetics and so on.\n \n If an incestine coupling is dangerous due to genetic issues, let it be resolved by genetics. And if it is prohibited due to the genetic issues, I'm all for prohibiting all other similar instances - which will make me sound amazingly extreme, as it points to eugenics. If the other genetically questionable couplings are not not prohibited, however, why make an exception of incest?\n \n Ickyness should have no bearing on these issues.\n \n Similar to polygamy. It's not a problem if things do work out fine. The problems are when it leads to inequality between the sexes. If two men both love the same woman and are capable of coexisting, there's no problem. If however you see women cast away in old age just so the \"pater familias\" can get himself more kids, you're talking something else entirely.\n \n \n As I said: let's get to the actual issues.

   "On incestual marriage:\n Genetic disorders are often cited, and the State can argue it has a legitimate interest in preventing them. Although on this reasoning we *could* outlaw those with genetic disorders from procreating, this is not really an existing issue: those with severe genetic disorders generally do not procreate anyways, therefore there is not really a problem to legislate against. That is the reason why there isn't a law, not because of inconsistency in legal theory. Generally, we only pass laws to deal with problems that exist, otherwise there simply isn't motivation to act on it and is also a waste of effort.\n \n Sidenote: the degree to which incestual marriage is forbidden varies from state to state in the US. Many states outlaw first-cousins, other states permit it. As I understand it, the degree to which genetic disorders appear in marriages between first cousins is negligible. Even Einstein married a first-cousin.\n \n On paedophilia:\n It still baffles me why opponents of gay marriage continually bring this up. Persons under 18 years of age cannot and will never be able to legally give consent to a marriage. It is a fundamental tenet of law that there is a legal age where persons are presumed to be able to make informed consent. In the US, that age is 18. Anyone under 18 has very limited powers to provide consent. Although people under 18 can be married, they must have parent/guardian consent.\n \n On polygamy:\n I assume we're discussing simultaneous polygamy, because western countries already practice serial polygamy (aka divorce and remarriage). On the surface, I see nothing wrong with this practice, but admittedly haven't given it much thought. The sexist connotations are fairly relevant to the discussion; polygamy in the past was only permissable for men, but not women. There is also a tax implication which must be considered. Gifting is between spouses is not a taxable event, but gifting between strangers can be depending on the value of the gift. This raises the issue of abuse of polygamous marriages to avoid taxes. If you can come up with a proposal that avoids such abuse, I'd see nothing wrong with allowing it.",

WHETHER GAY MARRIAGE SHOULD SHOULD BE ILLEGAL OR NOT!\n\n Regarding thelmooses' statement, I didn't take it as to say THIS THREAD is about gay marriage.\n The point is that the PURPOSE of this thread is to back-door an attempted domino theory rebuttal of gay marriage.\n The first post is clear as to try to imply that if gay marriage is legal, then polygamy and incest must be allowed. That's just plain false.\n The first post also inaccurately claims to summarize the pro-gay marriage arguments as JUST \"two consenting adults\". That is false, and the additional distinguishing arguments which separate gay marriage from incest and/or polygamy have been explained here.\n \n If I could be so bold, I think thelmooses point is truly about \"Why is this incest / polygamy discussion on the gay rights threads?\"\n It's acknowledging the elephant in the room.\n \n \n \nGiant oreo states at the end of the post'As for polygamy, they are consenting adults as well. The same arguments made above and elsewhere for gay marriage apply just as well to polygamy'.\n\n And as I just stated, that summation is ridiculously fallacious.\n It pretends to boil down the \"gay marriage\" to a falsely limited claim.\n The argument for gay marriage is much more involved than JUST that.\n There are distinguishing factors which make \"polygamy\" legally more reprehensible than \"gay marriage\" can be painted to be...\n \n Ergo, to claim \"the same arguments\" is rather pointless, because this thread is FILLED with arguments which ARE applied to \"polygamy\" which cannot be applied to \"gay marriage\".\n \n As I pointed out earlier, \"the arguments for gay marriage\" are not EXCLUSIVE to gay marriage's legal recognition.\n The arguments are EXISTING PRECEDENTS in our judicial system, which can be used independently of \"gay marriage\" being legal or not.\n \n Moreover, on a pragmatic approach, I can't help but think this whole thing is absurd from the perspective of WHAT REALLY HAPPENS.\n Gay marriage is legal in a variety of places.\n How many of those countries and states have legalized polygamy???\n OBVIOUSLY there is more to the situation than what GiantOreo is admitting.",

   "Maybe it tries to explore whether accepting one 'alternative' lifestyle would lead to another previously taboo lifestyle becoming acceptable.\n I personally saw the incest and polygamy side and tended to ignore the gay part, only to point out that a gay relationship would be seen as an abomination in years past, just as incest is now and that eventually this may lead to accepting paedophilia. To be honest arguing about gay marriage has become quite boring especially when it comes with a large dose of paranoia.\n I personally do not see a brother and sister sexual relationship as any less acceptable a same sex one. Does that make me more liberal than you or is it that some gay people have become the new bigots going through the door of new found freedoms and trying to shut it behind them.",

   "I find it amusing that some people who staunchly defend the rights of gays do not support the rights of other consenting adults (from my experience on other fora - not sure about here as it isn't talked about much that I've seen). If consenting adults should be able to have sex and get married (they should as per their right to do what they want and right to contract with each other) than there is no argument to be made against incest. \n \n Consenting adults are consenting adults. I've heard the argument that they should not be able to get married because they can produce offspring with defects. If that is true than why do we allow those with genetic diseases to marry? They will also produce such offspring. If one should be banned for this reason than so should the other. Not allowing them to have sex is wrong because they have the right to do what they want with their own bodies. Not allowing them to marry is wrong because they have the right to contract, and stupid because they will still have sex with each other if they want to. \n \n \n As for polygamy, they are consenting adults as well. The same arguments made above and elsewhere for gay marriage apply just as well to polygamy.\n \n Thoughts? (open to both sides of the Gay rights debate)\n\n \n Well, heterosexuals are consenting adults too. Does this mean heterosexuals are obligated to support polygamy and incest? \n \n If incest and polygamy were simply about consent, as in the case of gay and straight relationships, then these things should be treated equally.\n \n This isn't the case with both incest and polygamy. Incestuous people have boundary issues, according to psychology. It creates a very shallow, undiversified, gene pool, which causes negative physical effects on the species and our ability to adapt and evolve, as well as more birth defects. Do you think we can get all incestuous couples to use birth control 100% of time, when we can't get non-incestuous couples to do so, no matter how much we advocate it, and no matter how much it makes sense in certain circumstances? Incestuous relations cannot be found in nature, unlike same sex and different sex ones.\n \n Many of us who do not support polygamy, including myself, have concerns about women's inequality to men in polygamous relationships. So that's another issue, besides consent. Also, on the same line of thought, I have to question how free and empowered women are to consent and choose, when brought up in polygamous societies, where they have no sense of their equality to men.\n \n \nPolygamous marriages\n \n 14. States parties' reports also disclose that polygamy is practised in a number of countries. Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman's right to equality with men, and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited. The Committee notes with concern that some States parties, whose constitutions guarantee equal rights, permit polygamous marriage in accordance with personal or customary law. This violates the constitutional rights of women, and breaches the provisions of article 5 (a) of the Convention.\n\n \n General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women",

Also, on the same line of thought, I have to question how free and empowered women are to consent and choose, when brought up in polygamous societies, where they have no sense of their equality to men.\n\n Not only that, but it affects males (children) as well.\n When you have men taking multiple wives, the male-to-female ratio is affected. Add on to that communities that actively adopt the polygamy standard, and you get what is referred to as \"Lost Boys\" in Utah.Critics of the FLDS say that, given the fact that roughly equal numbers of boys and girls are born in any community absent of gender selection for female births, the practice of polygamy leads unavoidably to bride shortages and a surplus of boys. In particular, FLDS men are each required to marry at least three wives[1], which is demographically unsustainable. Lost Boys are the surplus boys who are removed from polygamous sects in order to reduce competition for wives. While some boys leave on their own, many are ostensibly banished for misbehavior such as watching a movie, [3] watching television,[4] playing football, or talking to a girl.[2] Some boys are told not to return unless they can return with a wife. There are also young women[5] who have left or been pressured to leave because they did not want to be part of polygamous marriages.[6] Warren Jeffs' own niece, Naomi, left the sect at age 13.[7] While it is difficult to estimate how many boys have been thrown out, their numbers are estimated to be between 400 and 1,400.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_boys_(polygamy)\n \n Some people try to pretend that gay marriage \"affects\" other people and other people's marriages, like \"harming\" them. It doesn't.\n Polygamy DOES harm others.",

   "What happens when one wife out of the twenty wives, wants a divorce in legalized polygamy? How would we apply the 50/50 division of the marital assets to multiples, like we have for married couples? Would we need different laws when it come to polygamous divorce? How about child custody? I think the real winners with legalized polygamy will be lawyers. Unlimited multiple parters in marriage would represent a much more fundamental change to marriage, compared to simply removing discrimination based on gender as in legalized marriage for couples of the same sex.",
