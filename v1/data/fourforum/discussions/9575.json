   "....not only that but if you've been reading along with my recent threads, it vindicates everything -- and I mean EVERYTHING I've been saying on here regarding health.\n \n I would like to direct everyone to an experiment -- or set of experiments -- that was done many decades ago. The point of the experiment was not to prove or disprove evolution, it was to show how a particular diet influences the health -- including physical and mental traits -- of future generations. However any knowledgeable evolutionist can see that this verifies a lamarckian-style inheritance and invalidates ToE.\n \n I gave a link on this forum recently that showed how the kooks in medical science are trying to somehow justify diseases such as depression in a Darwinian light. They have found themselves in a nutball, precarious position of trying to justify why Depression, a trait linked to mutation, would be selected for. And of course, hearing them try to con the reading audience into believing that Depression is a beneficial trait is just really quite humorous. \n \n But anyway the following experiment was done on cats. As you will see, as the generations pass, skeletal structures change, moods change, allergies increase, bones become brittle, and -- most interestingly -- homosexuality increases. And all this was not caused from some rogue gene that randomly appeared and then got selected.....it was caused from nothing more the mother's diet!\n \n In that link you will not only see that a simple diet change caused future generations of cats to emerge with new, undesirable traits....and not only does it prove Lamarckian inheritance, but it does alot more than that. It disproves the way medical science treats patients with drugs, and it disproves that our genes tell us who we are, and it disproves that traits are dictated by randomly-occurring genes, and it disproves that selection is needed for new traits -- including traits that involve mutations, and it disproves reductionist science altogether.\n \n This is evolution, not of parts causing the whole to change, but of the whole causing parts to change. This is not reductionist evolution...this is holistic evolution. This is not selectionist evolution, this is environmental evolution.\n \n Lamarckism has been experimentally verified.\n \n http://www.liquid-vitamins.info/deadfood-vs-livefood.shtml\n \n \n (there is a bit of a lead-in to the Pottenger Cat story....if you scroll down about 1/4 the way down you can skip to the meat-and-potatoes.)\n \n Oh...and by the way......I think everyone will get a kick out of these....you know how the medical establishment has convinced people that we are what we are because what our genes say we are? This is reductionists XXXX at its finest. Please read about Pottenger's cats first...then have fun with the links below, which indicate that its our genes causing our problems.\n \n \n Brittle bone gene:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3382503.stm\n \n Scientists have identified a gene which they believe may play a key a role in determining who develops osteoporosis or brittle bone disease. \n \n Anxiety Gene:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9611/28/nfm/\n \n Researchers have found a gene that may dispute the notion that anxiety results from character flaws or weakness. \n \n A team of researchers at the National Institutes of Health reports in Friday's edition of the journal Science that variants of a gene may affect how disposed someone is toward anxiety. \n \n The variants in genes are not the flaws or abnormalities known as mutations.\n \n and drum roll:\n \n http://www.livescience.com/humanbiology/060224_gay_genes.html\n \n Mom's Genetics Could Produce Gay Sons\n \n The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study.\n \n Of course this article is certainly not going to admit that her diet is responsible. However, if you read the Pottenger cat article, you will see that all the degenerative traits I listed above (and more) were caused by simply diet -- including homosexuality. The links above verify that science thinks genes themselves cause disease, yet these same \"diseases\" were caused in the Cat experiment not by mutations, but by the enviornment -- in this case diet.\n \n Homosexuality is not caused by a defective gene -- or even by choice (in some situations) -- homosexuality is a degenerative mental disease passed on epigenetically.\n \n \n Evolutionary science -- including the medical establishment -- is absolutely, completely and totally pathetic.",

Traits, according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY. Get that, geniuses? RANDOMLY. This is not random. Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly....nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur, nervous systems, bones, allergies, and mental processes. Instead this was all dictated by the environment. Thus, despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population, it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection. This is a hole. A huge hole....it's environmental evolution...that is, animals simply changing with a changing environment. Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first, followed up by new traits. Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment, only to be then be selected.\n \n I win.\n \n And this is no different than the following:\n \n http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/\n \n  Normally, the fur of agouti mice is yellow, brown, or a calico-like mixture of the two, depending on the number of attached methyl groups. But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers, despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene (i.e., with no nucleotide differences), mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur, whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and cancer.\n \n LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829)  The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring. \n \n Checkmate, losers.\n \n Oh, and by the way, electro-loser.....it doesn't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not. (Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle)...the reality is, though, these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms. So did the mice in both experiments and so did the pigs. Are you truly trying to tell me that cats and mice and pigs evolve by way of the inheritance of acquired characteristics but humans don't?",

You run away like a scared little Chihuahua every time.\n \n \nit's the environment from within the whole that influences the parts.\n\n I think if I took out your lungs (i.e. changed \"the environment from within the whole\"), you'd be \"influenced.\" To call that \"Lamarckian evolution\" is ... well, incredible.\n \n \nThis is the antithesis of your theory, which says randomly-occuring parts show up and they get selected to make the whole.\n\n More dishonesty, or at least misrepresentation based on profound ignorance of the facts. \n It can't be the antithesis of \"my\" theory if that's what my theory predicts. Standard biology predicts that malnourishment will lead to problems, including with replication. (See folic acid.) The fact that cats today do fine on cooked food damns your understanding of the already flawed experiment.\n If Lamarckism were true, we'd expect sailors' kids to have repaired vitamin C genes; they don't. If Lamarckism were true, we'd have seen these cats' offspring born with repaired taurine synthesis pathways. We did not. How do you explain these profound failures?\n \n \n... epigenetics is the theory of how the environment controls gene activity.\n\n And none of us are denying that there are epigenetic effects. This doesn't invalidate the modern synthesis.\n \n \nTraits arise without going through DNA\n\n Please explain how all traits (every one of which you claim is genetic) arise without some association with DNA.\n \n \nthe fact remains that these animals inherited acquired traits.\n\n This is a fraudlent \"interpretation\" of the facts. How is a fetus supposed to get folic acid if both the body can't produce it and the mother doesn't ingest it? How can a cat use needed taurine if it can't be produced in the body and isn't in the diet? You're saying that taurine deficiency was an inherited acquired trait; for you, apparently, anything can be an inherited acquired trait. If a mother dies before completing parturition, and the baby is stillborn (or dies soon after birth), did the baby inherit the \"acquired trait\" of death? According to your rubric, it did.\n \n \nIf the offspring were born with scurvy I would.\n\n This is not what you said above. Is your position so weak that you're having to shift the goalposts again?\n Assuming an offspring were born with scurvy, that scurvy would disappear when the infant was supplied with vitamin C. This is -- clearly -- not evolution of any kind. Vitamin C is a cofactor that allows for the building of collagen; reintroducing it allows the collagen-building pathway to be completed, not genes to be expressed differently.\n \n \nLook at penicillin.\n ok...that's one.\n\n Then you admit you lied. Again. Good start.\n \n \nLook at cured cancer patients.\n Look at all the dead cancer patients......\n\n How many of those do you think would be alive without modern medical practices? Even your beloved \"Bruce\" relied upon medicine, and he did it again when his \"all-natural\" approach failed.\n \n \nThe reality is all they can do -- at best -- is prolong life with a removal of a tumor. Chemo kills and does not extend life.\n\n Tell that to Lance Armstrong and the millions of others who have beaten cancer.\n \n \nShow me one drug produced in the past 30 years that has cured any degenerative disease.\n\n Why do you restrict it to degenerative diseases? Why do you restrict it to the past 30 years? Penicillin can cure syphilis, which is otherwise fatal because it destroys the brain. We've already talked about cancer treatment, and you pooh-poohed it away.\n \n \nArticle: The researchers do not know what caused the shift in gene expression in humans but they suspect it could be due to changes in the environment, the acquisition of fire and a preference for cooked food.\n \n I know of no scientist who thinks that. And we're not about to listen to you about what prevailing scientific opinion is: aside from the blatant lying, you can't read for comprehension.\n \n You'll have to take that up with the researchers the article was referring to then. Oh wait...what a shock....someone else said the same thing.\n\n I express amazement not at the blatant dishonesty shown above, but by the fact that supersport apparently didn't think I'd call his XXX on it. Let's see what was really said (scroll up if you don't believe me):\n So in otherwords, we are just degenerated chimps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n I know of no scientist who thinks that. And we're not about to listen to you about what prevailing scientific opinion is: aside from the blatant lying, you can't read for comprehension.\nThere is no question that my statement was in response to supersport's ridiculous caricature of the conclusion, but in his last post, he quoted me as if my response was to the green text. And it's not just a matter of inconvenient placement: supersport goes on to say that I should take up my objection with the authors of the article, not with him, even though my statement was indisputably in response to his comment. It's a common supersportian tactic: He can't support his point, so he pretends I've said something I've not.\n The real hilarity ensues when he quotes a second post which supports my explanation of the suspicion and actually contradicts supersport's. Here's what I said earlier (repeatedly):We've already been over this. You're too dishonest to repeat our responses, though. Cooked food made certain changes in regulatory genes advantageous, so they were selected for.\nAnd here was supersport's \"support\":\"Perhaps something in the cooking process altered the biochemical requirements for maximal access to nutrients...\"\nHo-hum.\n \n \nI'm tired of debating you...you bore me.\n\n Translation: he's tired of having his XXX kicked six ways from Sunday.\n Run, Chihuahua, run!",

   "....\n I would like to direct everyone to an experiment -- or set of experiments -- that was done many decades ago. The point of the experiment was not to prove or disprove evolution, it was to show how a particular diet influences the health -- including physical and mental traits -- of future generations. However any knowledgeable evolutionist can see that this verifies a lamarckian-style inheritance and invalidates ToE.\n \n But anyway the following experiment was done on cats. As you will see, as the generations pass, skeletal structures change, moods change, allergies increase, bones become brittle, and -- most interestingly -- homosexuality increases. And all this was not caused from some rogue gene that randomly appeared and then got selected.....it was caused from nothing more the mother's diet!\n \n In that link you will not only see that a simple diet change caused future generations of cats to emerge with new, undesirable traits....and not only does it prove Lamarckian inheritance, but it does alot more than that. It disproves the way medical science treats patients with drugs, and it disproves that our genes tell us who we are, and it disproves that traits are dictated by randomly-occurring genes, and it disproves that selection is needed for new traits -- including traits that involve mutations, and it disproves reductionist science altogether.\n \n This is evolution, not of parts causing the whole to change, but of the whole causing parts to change. This is not reductionist evolution...this is holistic evolution. This is not selectionist evolution, this is environmental evolution.\n \n Lamarckism has been experimentally verified.\n \n http://www.liquid-vitamins.info/deadfood-vs-livefood.shtml\n \n \n\n \n I have a little doubt about this cat diet story. My great grandmother had cats, and she always fed them cooked chicken from the farm. I remember her showing me how she used the chicken parts. My grandfather raised kittens from this cat family and he fed them store cat food in cans, which had been cooked. (My grandmother passed away before I knew her. She drowned the unwanted kittens, according to family stories.) But I remember playing with the cats. And then my mother inherited cats from the same litters and she feeds them dry cat food and canned cat food. \n \n The cats I grew up with in our home had litters, and so our present cat is about 8 or 9 generations along and is perfectly healthy. All along they were house cats and never allowed outside to catch birds or mice, so far as my mother recallls. (There is only one kitty now, because my Dad doesn't like cats and my sister developed an allergy, which seemed related to cats--but she is over this now.)\n \n All of them were fed cooked food. \n \n So the story about cats does not ring true with me. BTW, all the cats I knew from my grandfather to present lived to about 16-20 years old. And none of them died due a specific disease.",

That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.\n \n \n.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier.\n\n \n Actually it isn't. No, really, it isn't; I'm not making this up; I think you've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there.\n \n Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. That's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer: frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures, whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment.\n \n Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback. Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier, which opens up some interesting possibilities.\n \n Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. The environment can only have an indirect 'say' in the genotype of organisms, by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others.\n \n That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better. Simmer for a couple of million years and... well, there you go.\n \n \nI'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism.\n\n \n Well, there certainly is here with these cats, because they're not actually inheriting a trait; the symptoms are being independently induced in all the cats, parents and offspring, by denying them all particular nutrients. \n \n \nDo you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?\n\n \n That definition isn't what I'm disagreeing with :) I'm just pointing out why it's not happening here.\n \n Retroviruses, as I said, open up some very interesting possibilities. I'm not aware of any conclusive research taking place - I know the immune system makes use of them but I don't think there's any evidence of immunity being passed down in that way: early mothers' milk is the mechanism for that (packed with a payload of antibodies to prime the infant's immune system).\n \n To be honest, I think the existence of that system rather stomps on the plausibility of Lamarckian inheritance; why bother going to all that trouble if the parent could simply code immunity into the genes it passes to its offspring?",

And from the very first generation onwards, the following problems were noticed with all the cats that were eating cooked foods: poor eyesight, heart problems, thyroid and bladder problems, nervous system problems, meningitis and paralysis, infections of various organs, ovary and testis problems, liver problems, bone problems, nearsightedness or farsightedness, inflammations, uterine congestion, atrophy of various organs, failure of reproductive systems, and so on. \n \n With each new generation, the cats became more unpredictable, were more irritable, were biting and scratching more, were less playful, and so on. The males also became very docile and experienced a drop in their libido and sexual interest while the females became very aggressive. There was also a huge increase in same sex sexual activity.\n \n In otherwords, their state of wellness did not start over as each cat was born......instead, the cats inherited their mother's physical problems plus, because of a continued unhealthy diet showed an increase of degeneration. The key is that there is a definate decline as each generation passed. This is an inhertance issue, plain and simple.\n \n \n \n \n \n Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. \n\n \n I honestly think it goes much much deeper than that...I think traits are dictated by the organism and genes are simply there for expressing them. Traits don't originate from single genes. This has been evolutionists big downfall....they have misconstrued the gene being correlated with physiological changes with the gene causing physiological changes. Big difference.\n \n \n \n Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback.\n \n Yes I see that I forgot to include \"The Central Dogma\" in my explanation along with Weismann's barrier.\n \n \n \n \n Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. \n\n \n It certainly used to. They used to tell us that the organism was just a collection of genes -- this, of course led to the fallacy that science could create a T-rex if they could just get a hold of some of the dinosaur's DNA. The reality is, the day your theory officially starts incorporating effects from the enviornment as playing a co-starring role in the dictating traits is the day it finds itself 6 feet under. Natural selection cannot act on non-random variaion. That is not how the philosophy was set up....it was set up soley on a platform of random variation -- this was in order to keep the theory a materialistic one. As soon as you accept nonrandom variation, it no longer can be said that the theory is mechanically materialistic.\n \n \n \n What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. \n\n \n Are you sure?\n \n http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho39.htm\n \n \n \n \n That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better. Simmer for a couple of million years and... well, there you go.\n\n \n Peeling....there is no natural selection mentioned in that article. They say nothing about some butterflies living because of their fit traits and some dying because of unfit traits. what it says is that butterflies emerge according to season or background conditions with specific wing variations. Nothing more.",

   "well actually if you read the aricle you'll see that each generation of cats got physically and mentally worse as each generation passed. <snip< In otherwords, their state of wellness did not start over as each cat was born......instead, the cats inherited their mother's physical problems plus, because of a continued unhealthy diet showed an increase of degeneration.\n\n \n This puts me in mind of a line of brain-surgeons, each asked to operate on the next one in turn after themselves undergoing surgery by the one before them. But before the first one starts, we get them all drunk, and keep them drunk as the day wears on. What kind of state do you think the last guy in line is going to be in?\n \n I understand where you're coming from in calling this 'inheritance', but I'm not convinced it vindicates the principle of Lamarckism. The most it can prove is that if you disrupt the development process that turns genes into an organism, you can get offspring that are themselves less able to properly perform their role in developing the next generation. This would be true regardless of whether Lamarckian inheritence is true in the general case.\n \n Consider the progressive onset of osteoporosis: the most common cause of this is pregnancy, where calcium is leeched from the bones of the mother to construct the child's. If a calcium-depleted diet is continued generation after generation, the problem will inevitably compound itself because the bones of each mother will contain less and less calcium. But offspring here are still not inheriting anything; rather each generation is being independently subjected to harsher and harsher deprivation during development.\n \n I'm also a little concerned about the other claims that site makes. For instance, it says:\n \n \nWhen the professor gave vitamin supplements to these animals to see whether these supplements would reverse the changes, nothing happened.\n\n \n Whereas the Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation says:\n \n \nAs an extension to this experiment, it would be of interest to study the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation in the diet of cooked food fed animals.\n\n \n Of course, I'm sure www.liquid-vitamins.info made an entirely honest mistake here... :)\n \n \nThis has been evolutionists big downfall....they have misconstrued the gene being correlated with physiological changes with the gene causing physiological changes. Big difference.\n\n \n Yes, it is a big difference. But also a readily verifiable one, and induced genetic change certainly does result in phenotypic changes.\n \n \nIt certainly used to. They used to tell us that the organism was just a collection of genes -- this, of course led to the fallacy that science could create a T-rex if they could just get a hold of some of the dinosaur's DNA. \n\n \n But as I already said, this has persisted as a popular myth far longer and far more widely than in scientific circles. Indeed, I can't find any scientific publication claiming anything of the sort.\n \n \nThe reality is, the day your theory officially starts incorporating effects from the enviornment as playing a co-starring role in the dictating traits is the day it finds itself 6 feet under.\n\n \n There are several senses in which that is not the case.\n \n Yes, chemical and thermal variations in the environment can affect development. However, whether the phenotypic variations this induces are actually adaptive to the environmental variation is still determined by the genes that are being influenced. Analogously, a temperature-sensor on your wall won't produce an 'adaptive response' if it's wired to a blender rather than a central heating boiler :)\n \n Pottenger's Cats exhibited phenotypic variation that was not adaptive to an environmental variation - they became sick and would have died out entirely after three generations. But we can also see in nature examples of phenotypic variation that is adaptive to environmental variation. If you'll allow me to re-order your post a little to bring a related point to hand:\n \n \nPeeling....there is no natural selection mentioned in that article. They say nothing about some butterflies living because of their fit traits and some dying because of unfit traits. what it says is that butterflies emerge according to season or background conditions with specific wing variations. Nothing more.\n\n \n If you pop back and read my previous post again, you can see I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm absolutely not saying that the butterflies were born with a random mixture of traits in all seasons and that NS was filtering out the unfit ones.\n \n What I'm saying is that over an extended period of time, NS has favoured those genes that, when subjected to the chemical or thermal variations associated with the different seasons during development, produce phenotypes adapted to those variations. The more adaptive the phenotypic variations, the greater the assistence those genes provide to the organism's success in surviving and breeding.\n \n If we go back to my blender/boiler example, the (awful) analogy here would be 'NS' favouring blenders with ever bigger and hotter-running motors, until a million years down the line we come along and say: \"Wow, look at that! A temperature sensor wired to a heater!\" :)\n \n The salient point is that interbreeding, RM+NS would still take a fair chunk of time to accomplish this feat, which is why I keep asking you for an example of \"adaptive phenotypic variability cued by environmental variation\" that has arisen suddenly in a species when exposed to a novel environmental variation.\n \n \nNatural selection cannot act on non-random variaion. That is not how the philosophy was set up....it was set up soley on a platform of random variation -- this was in order to keep the theory a materialistic one.\n\n \n Returning to this more general point, we are still left with the possibility that non-random variation is in some areas superceding random mutation and natural selection as the dominent adaptive process, but that it is itself arising via RM+NS and that historically RM+NS has been the dominant mechanism.\n \n In my opinion there will always be a need for RM+NS, because there's no evidence that sensitivity to endemic environmental variations has arisen by any other mechanism. Moreover, there's no evidence to suggest that these mechanisms can deal with novel variations - besides which if a species goes a long time without being exposed to a variation, their sensitivity can be eroded by unselected RM, undoing the evolved 'rapid response' mechanism.\n \n \nAs soon as you accept nonrandom variation, it no longer can be said that the theory is mechanically materialistic.\n\n \n Not true if the non-random variation is itself a mechanical trait that has been selected for. :)\n \n \nAre you sure?\n \n http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho39.htm\n\n \n The page you link to praises the thoroughness of the author's work, but does not go so far as to say anything have been proved, and actually raises significant objections as to why that kind of inherited immunity would even be beneficial. Interesting reading, but as I said, nothing more than that at the moment.",

   "Lamarck vindicated:\n \n http://www.erim.org/qas2001/quadrant.html\n\n \n I think that's a tad premature :)\n \n Perhaps I should clarify my position on this subject. Prior to this discussion, I wasn't even aware of Weismann's Barrier or the germline/somatic distinction; that hasn't been why I've raised objections to EAM or Lamarckism.\n \n Nor am I inseperably wedded to the idea that RM+NS must be the only adaptive process at work. In my god-awfully long debates with Wabbit my principle objection has been to his assertion that RM+NS can't work, from which he infers that EAM must be true. Sorry for talking past you, here, Wabbit :) There's compelling evidence, not to mention unassailable logic, that RM+NS can work, and we can repeatedly observe patterns of adaptation and genetic change in populations that correlate too closely with the predictions of RM+NS for it to be arbitrarily discarded as a functional mechanism.\n \n Steele's work raises some fascinating possibilities, but only serves to further highlight the concerns I have about full-on Lamarckian evolution or EAM.\n \n By means of a starting point, check out how the immune system works. It's impressive stuff, and is actually a microcosm of Darwinian random mutation and selection in action: an undirected yet successful heuristic search - in this case for pathogens.\n \n What cannot fail to strike one when reading about the immune system is its mechanical nature. Physical receptors, chemical triggers, mechanically triggered cell death and clonal reproduction, and so forth. Intricate but ultimately mechanical; at no stage in its operation do we have a psychical break where we must postulate direction or intent, or a decision being made, or a design being formulated.\n \n Now, we'll assume for the sake of argument that retroviral activity can and does transpose acquired immunities to the germline and even to the sex cells (though I'm not sure that has actually been shown to occur). The key point is there is a solid, mechanical process - involving very high somatic mutation rates and very harsh selection criteria - for actually establishing what counts as a 'successful' immune response. It's also, as I said, an undirected process: white cells undergo clonal reproduction or cell death based on purely empirical measurements of their success: did they bind to a pathogen? So at the end of the day, the immunity - though passed down in our hypothetical situation Lamarck-fashion, as an acquired characteristic - was still discovered by RM and isolated by a process completely analogous to NS.\n \n The obstacle I perceive between this tentative possibility (which I'm perfectly willing to entertain) and Lamarckism/EAM is not Weismann's barrier or the Central Dogma, but something more fundamental.\n \n In the immune system, we can see recombination occurring, DNA sequences being shuffled and 'tried out' at a fantastic rate. We see it is a fundamentally random process: before a pathogen can even 'stimulate' a cell to trigger an immune response, the immune system must randomly produce a physical 'sensor' that detects that stimulation. This is a highly physical and mechanical system, and we just can't see any evidence of one for creating, trying out and 'judging' the more rarified and conceptual characteristics Lamarckism or EAM requires an organism to self-develop.\n \n Saying that we don't need to observe such a mechanism (Hi WW :) ) flies in the face of the fact we very much can see a mechanism for autoimmune response. Moreover, the undirected, scattergun, empirical success based methods of the immune system can't possibly work for 'trying out' gross physical traits on the organismic level - only on the population level. Yet if a directed system were possible, as EAM insists is the case, why doesn't the immune system employ it?\n \n The point I'm constructing is essentially this: even if somatic expressions of genes can be retrotransposed and inherited - a bona fide Lamarckian inheritance of an acquired characteristic - we're still missing a huge chunk of the mechanism that the immune system implies the organism needs to find adaptive characteristics in the first place. For a start, the organism has no way of knowing or sensing what somatic expression has actually helped it - at least with the immune system we could speculate about receptor saturation leading to retrotransposition. But here there's just no coherent pathway for the information to follow.\n \n It's all very well talking about environmental influences on the developmental process shaping gene expression and phenotype, but as Pottenger's unfortunate cats demonstrate, there's no guarantee it's going to be in an adaptive manner. How does such an organism know not to retrotranspose somatically expressed genes in that situation? What basis for comparison does it have to judge whether it has been more or less successful than its parents or its peers, when in many species they aren't even around?\n \n And that's nothing compared to the problems we encounter in mature organisms. Here the development has been done, the genes expressed. Are we really expected to believe the organism 'thinks' (I know, not consciously) \"Boy, that long neck sure came in handy - I'd better keep that. Now, where did I put the expressed alelle that gave me that trait...?\"\n \n And even [I]that[I] is nothing compared to the headscratcher posed in the absence of an immune-system-style RM+NS method for generating traits. So far we've been balked by mere foothills of logical objection; beyond them rears the towering immensity of precisely how an organism is supposed to translate an abstract environmental requirement into a chunk of genetic code.\n \n That's why I'm saying it's a bit premature to say that Lamarckism has been vindicated. Even allowing for the inheritance of an acquired characteristic, Darwinian evolution still holds sway if its passage into future generations is based on empirical success (ie NS) and you can't demonstrate that the characteristic was designed.\n \n Anyway, maybe that will clear up my position on the matter.

Whether this last is solely represented by the devo-evo, biosemiotic, autopoietic, complex dynamic, productive systems hypothesis that I call EAM, or is actually something somewhat different, I do not say.

As for \"repeatedly observe[d] patterns of adaptation and genetic change in populations\", that is evolution, not its mechanism, while claims that these observations of adaptation and genetic change \"correlate too closely with the predictions of RM+NS for it to be arbitrarily discarded as a functional mechanism\" is just plain untrue, because RMNS cannot make a prediction in the scientific sense of the word (being founded upon chance, spontaneous generation and coincidence), and never has made a any such scientifically testable predictions. Projections, prognostications, forecasts and other statements about trend continuance are not scientific predictions, and they contribute nothing but trivially self-evident observations on established causes for that trend. And that self-evident truism triviality is the best that RMNS has ever been able to muster. With that lousy record, after so many decades and so many earnest believers struggling to vindicate it, then yes, it certainly is about time that the RMNS model was reasonably, not arbitrarily, discarded \"as a functional mechanism\" for evolution.",

I mean I believe the world was created, but I am open to possiblities as to how that happened. I also believe that lifeforms have not been on earth for very long, but then again I'm open to long ages if the evidence presents itself. When I first started investigating Darwinian evolution, I admit that it nausiated me, but I was willing to accept it if the evidence lead their. I like reading WW's stuff because it makes sense in a lot of ways. I also think reading stuff from the evo devo guys because alot of what they say makes sense, despite the fact that it's still grounded in darwinism....albeit barely.\n \n I think you guys' downfall is your premise that only populations change. I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism of change, but I am positive that individuals not only can change, but do change. Not only that, but they can pass these changes on to their progeny. This opens up a massive hole in ToE that simply cannot be patched up. If science wants to re-legitamize themselves they are going to have to rework a theory based on the reality of whole individuals as being the object of study. Not only that but they are going to have to start conducting science on a foundation of observation. All scientific principles should be the product of personal observation....any concepts that are derived from ideas or imaginations may be interesting, but they are not science -- they are wishful thinking.",

   "Granted that our debates do seem to expand exponentially, I do not think it fair that you and tastyfish simply ignore me in order to engage those who you apparently see as weaker opponents.\n\n \n Such was not my intention; I've been very busy over the past couple of weeks with a formal debate. Nor is it about anyone being an 'opponent' of any particular calibre; it's about the amount of time required to compose a post on a given topic.\n \n \nAs for my assertion that RMNS cannot be the engine of evolution, I have demonstrated that position with flawless logic and reasoning, even though that frustrates you people no end.\n\n \n I'm afraid that's simply not true - though I appreciate it might seem like that to you. \n \n Your arguments with respect to RM have been particularly weak. You say the claim that RM can result in improved fitness is 'metaphysical'. In response to that I simply shrug and point out that, for one thing, random mutation in simulated systems does result in improved fitness - and for another, where a one-step genetic adaptation has been observed and sequenced, the physical nature of that adaptation has been a point mutation, or insertion, or deletion, or duplication etc etc - exactly the kinds of mutation that can and do occur at random. So your assertion that those mutations could not have occurred at random flies in the face of both logic and empirical evidence.\n \n Our arguments regarding NS have been even lengthier, and throughout you have continually refused to engage with the process NS describes. I have asked you, on a number of occasions, to refute the logic that if an organism's genes give it a phenotypic advantage over its peers in a given environment it will tend to reproduce more successfully, increasing the representation of those genes in the gene pool and thus increasing the chance that further adaptive mutations (or beneficial combinations of genes through interbreeding) will 'stack'. You have, to be brutally honest, danced around the topic, saying that this shouldn't be called 'selection', sneering that it's a tautology, saying that distribution of genes is irrelevant and only the origin of new traits is important, throwing up insulting strawmen about moose standing around with their 'alleles fluctuating' - all in all a tremendous amount of noise ultimately signifying nothing.\n \n Differential reproductive rates logically and demonstrably cause adaptive mutations to stack. Adaptive mutations logically and demonstrably induce differential reproductive rates. Experiments (which you have alternately claimed to have successfully refuted several times before, and then to have never read - despite you having given me the link!) demonstrate the predicted rate of RM being validated, and the displacement of non-mutants occurring at a rate predicted by independent measurement of the reproductive rates of pre- and post- mutants: in other words, NS.\n \n I'm perfectly willing to entertain the possibility of other adaptive processes at work. It seems quite reasonable, for instance, that induced changes to the developmental process of turning genes into an organism could shape the phenotype in such a way as to propagate developmental changes to future generations. I remain to be convinced of the hypothesis that these induced changes are anything other than random wrt. fitness (Pottenger's Cat's being a non-adaptive example), but I'm open to the discussion. I'm quite aware of the limitations of RM, and that NS can be overwhelmed or rendered redundant by sexual selection or directed evolution (if observed). \n \n What I'm not going to do, WW, is sit here and be called vacuous and stupid without reply. You have in no way at any time shown that RM+NS cannot work. I've done my level best to discuss your hypotheses respectfully, but you don't seem to think reciprocation is in order.",

   "\n Your arguments with respect to RM have been particularly weak. You say the claim that RM can result in improved fitness is 'metaphysical'. In response to that I simply shrug and point out that, for one thing, random mutation in simulated systems does result in improved fitness \n\n \n **\n Whereupon I have to sadly shake my head and point out that that is simply untrue. What you call 'fitness', (meaning numerical increase of a certain entity, relative to the numerical quantities of other entities), is strictly numerical, statistical, and pertinent to statistical math, not empirical science. As such it is a metaphysical term, whereas where 'fitness' means morphological and behavioural suitability to the demands of a given environment, it is an empirical, i.e., scientific term. Biology is a science, not a branch of mathematics.\n \n Further, the 'random generation' you speak of is humanly constructed and designed to do what someone wanted it to do. That hardly qualifies as 'random'. Moreover, what it does generate, (i.e., passive electric 'blips'), have nothing in common with real organisms, and finally, that which actually creates the 'fitness' you speak of is an intentional, teleological, (intelligent)selecting/sorting mechanism that operates according within an externally imposed value system toward an externally determined/desired outcome/goal, without stipulating the precise path by which that goal is to be attained. That is how EAM operates, not RMNS darwinism. Darwinism denies values, goals, and directions. All outcomes are, according to it, value-free matters of chance.\n \n \n \n\n - and for another, where a one-step genetic adaptation has been observed and sequenced, the physical nature of that adaptation has been a point mutation, or insertion, or deletion, or duplication etc etc - exactly the kinds of mutation that can and do occur at random. So your assertion that those mutations could not have occurred at random flies in the face of both logic and empirical evidence.\n\n \n **\n You assume that the mutation is in the genes. I assume that the mutation is in the organism. The mutation in the organism is seldom if ever determined by a point mutation in a genome. Until you can demonstrate that an accidental point mutation can result in a positive, beneficial, adaptive organismic change, just when and where and how it is needed by the organism, solely by coincidence, you've demonstrated nothing but wishful thinking.\n Probability theory says that such a thing is mathematically impossible even once, let alone as a perpetually iterated matter of course (that is, as a regular mechanism) throughout the history of evolution.\n \n Yes, point mutations do happen. Yes, some are random. Yes, some are sometimes adaptive when expressed organismically. But these last are not randomly generated simply because you wish it so. Nor, simply because non-adaptive mutations arise in organisms thanks to accidental point mutations in their genomes, can you assume that if something accidental and inappropriate has a negative effect on a complex system, then such accidental events are also free to have a positive effect on a complex system. That is an irrational assumption if ever there was one, however you define 'complex system'. Ask any engineer.\n \n \n\n Our arguments regarding NS have been even lengthier, and throughout you have continually refused to engage with the process NS describes.\n\n \n **\n I do not know what you mean by this. \"NS\" does not describe a process, it is simply the label or name given by you darwinists to a certain biological effect--the fact that organisms that are maladapted (in terms of their inherited characteristics, traits, and properties), do not survive, thrive, and reproduce as well as other organisms that are adapted. This is tautologous, and therefore vacuous, as far as I'm concerned, since to be maladapted is to fail to successfully survive, thrive, and reproduce, and it is this failure that is the alpha and omega of your \"Natural Selection\". Natural Selection does not and cannot cause adaptive morphology and/or behaviour, it can only, even as an abstract anthropocentric literary metaphor, subtract maladaptive morphology or behaviour. It may, in some nebulous, non-specific, abstract way, 'explain' why we don't see any dinosaurs 'round here, but it does not at all explain what we do see. That is precisely why the metaphysical assumption of randomly generated beneficial mutations was tacked onto it by population geneticists some 70 years ago.\n \n \n \n\n I have asked you, on a number of occasions, to refute the logic that if an organism's genes give it a phenotypic advantage over its peers in a given environment it will tend to reproduce more successfully, increasing the representation of those genes in the gene pool and thus increasing the chance that further adaptive mutations (or beneficial combinations of genes through interbreeding) will 'stack'. You have, to be brutally honest, danced around the topic, saying that this shouldn't be called 'selection', sneering that it's a tautology, saying that distribution of genes is irrelevant and only the origin of new traits is important, throwing up insulting strawmen about moose standing around with their 'alleles fluctuating' - all in all a tremendous amount of noise ultimately signifying nothing.\n\n \n **\n Well, it's true that I consider RMNS darwinism to be a great deal of noise, signifying nothing, and that I considered my 'moose' example a perfect case of attacking your concept of 'fitness' (as differential gene statistics) via reductio ad absurdum. You've never shown how it failed.\n \n As for the rest, when you say, \"if an organism's genes give it a phenotypic advantage over its peers in a given environment\", you must then demonstrate that your 'if' exists in actual fact, and not just as a hypothetical possibility. You assume that genetic variations do confer a meaningful advantage (in terms of survival/reproduction) between individuals of a common genotype under normal conditions. I have never seen any empirical evidence to support that assumption, an assumption fundamental to darwinism. To the contrary, all meaningful differences in survival and reproduction within populations are, under normal circumstances, chance, not variation, dependent. Field tests demonstrate this. Now if you with to abandon darwinian gradualism, and with it random mutation, you can adopt a catastrophic view of 'natural selection', but catastrophes are matters of chance, so then where, in your hypothesis, is the regularity and universality, as opposed to luck, that a scientific mechanism requires?\n \n And when you say, \"it will tend to reproduce more successfully, increasing the representation of those genes in the gene pool\" you are simply saying that what succeeds will succeed, which to my mind is a vacuous truism. And when you say, \"and thus increasing the chance that further adaptive mutations (or beneficial combinations of genes through interbreeding) will 'stack'.\", you just aren't saying very much more. Sure, \"nothing succeeds like success\", but that's no explanation for that success.\n \n \n\n Differential reproductive rates logically and demonstrably cause adaptive mutations to stack.\n\n \n **\n Well, it is undeniably logical to say say that you cannot stack one thing upon another if the other thing isn't there to start with--it's entailed in the verb, 'to stack upon'. But so far as I can tell, all you are saying is that all later adaptive mutations happen to the descendents of survivors, and not to the non-descendents of non-survivors. Which doesn't enlighten me much.\n \n [quote]\n Adaptive mutations logically and demonstrably induce differential reproductive rates.[quote]\n \n **\n I know. That is one reason why we call them, 'adaptive', after all.\n \n \n\n Experiments (which you have alternately claimed to have successfully refuted several times before, and then to have never read - despite you having given me the link!)\n\n \n **\n Over the years I've read several variations on what was presented as the 1943 Luria and Delbruck Fluctuation Test. I read the one that I found, which seems to be the true paper, but I had trouble putting what it said together with what others had claimed. Excuse me for not being a geneticist or microbiologist. L&D'43 is your one and only support for your postulates, not mine, and so it is up to you to explain it to me, not me to you. All that I can discern from that paper is that it was set up on the false premise that e.coli act as unicellular organisms, instead of eusocial collectivities, and that the conclusions reached were entirely based on the assumption that what was not mechanically regular, was randomly irregular. The irregular outcomes were assumed, falsely, to indicate random (i.e., spontaneous) generation, simply because intelligent (developmental, revertant) generation was excluded from consideration. Moreover, the only empirical conclusion, i.e., that resistant cells arose from sensitive cells prior to this particular batch of e.coli. being directly exposed to its historic foe, the phage, in no way demonstrates that the resistance did not first arise, originate, in e.coli., gazillions of generations earlier in its history, by responsive, directed adaptation, and not random accident. Bottom line, your conclusion that L&D'43, and its clones, demonstrate that adaptive organismic changes can be and are generated by accidental and coincidental changes in their plasmid genes is simply unfounded.\n \n \n\n demonstrate the predicted rate of RM being validated, and the displacement of non-mutants occurring at a rate predicted by independent measurement of the reproductive rates of pre- and post- mutants: in other words, NS.\n\n \n **\n What \"predicted rate\"?!?! There is no \"prediction\" in a projection from an established statistical trend.\n \n \n\n I'm perfectly willing to entertain the possibility of other adaptive processes at work. It seems quite reasonable, for instance, that induced changes to the developmental process of turning genes into an organism could shape the phenotype in such a way as to propagate developmental changes to future generations. I remain to be convinced of the hypothesis that these induced changes are anything other than random wrt. fitness (Pottenger's Cat's being a non-adaptive example), but I'm open to the discussion. I'm quite aware of the limitations of RM, and that NS can be overwhelmed or rendered redundant by sexual selection or directed evolution (if observed). \n \n What I'm not going to do, WW, is sit here and be called vacuous and stupid without reply. \n\n \n **\n Nor would I expect you to do so. That is why I have never called you vacuous and stupid. I have always held you and tastyfish in high respect, something I cannot do for most of the darwindefenders posting to this forum.\n However, I do consider the darwinian hypothesis (of RMNS as evolution's driving mechanism and explanation), to be vacuous, and/or erroneous, and/or irrational, and I have sincerely attempted to justify that opinion in my argumentation. I don't remember saying that any of your opinions were 'stupid', but if I did I apologise.\n \n \n\n You have in no way at any time shown that RM+NS cannot work.\n\n \n **\n It is not my (impossible) responsibility to prove the negative proposition, that RMNS cannot work. It is the reponsibility of those who claim that it does work, to demonstrate via the scientific method, the truth of their assertion.\n The onus of proof of darwinism lies with the darwinists, and nobody else. Ands so far, including L&D'43, you have produced zero empirical evidence to support that assertion. Heck, the notion can't even be attacked successfully until you first present some empirical evidence that it is actually more than a metaphysical notion.\n \n \n \n\n I've done my level best to discuss your hypotheses respectfully, but you don't seem to think reciprocation is in order.\n\n \n **\n I don't know what you are referring to, specifically. I do know that I very deliberately attempted to avoid any kind of personal falling-out between us, and I cannot imagine what I said in our EAM discussion that gave you offense. Indeed, until just now you gave me no reason to believe that I had offended you. Perhaps if you quote the offwending passages I will be able to avoid such unintentional gaffes in future.",

So what? What does \"sensitive to the antibiotic\" mean? Either the antibiotic is unavoidably fatal to the bacterium, or it's not worth mentioning.\n \n \n \n Page 404, line 2 of the referenced Lederberg paper reveals that bacterial cultures had to be grown through many divisions on non-selective media before any resistant cells could be obtained. They noted that after resistance emerged, it was stably retained for subsequent generations (measured after 100 generations).**\n I'm not sure what this means. Which bacterial cultures are they refering to? Non-selective media is-- what, exactly? By \"emerged\", do they mean \"spontaneously self-generated\"? That phage/antibiotic resistance, once generated, was conserved over 100 hundred generations is anti-darwinian where there was no \"NS\" pressure to conserve it.\n \n \n 2) Good 'sterile technique' to prevent cross-contamination of strains is a fundamental & well-established practice in microbiology labs.**\n They aren't good enough, in this case, unless they meet the criteria I outlined in my previous post. I very much doubt that they were, 52 years ago, when these experiments were done.\n \n \n \n Pure cultures were used in the experiment -- e.g. Cultures were started from a single, isolated colony.**\n In what sense does this make them \"pure\"? With reference to prior exposure, that is?\n \n \n See page 402, line 8 of the Lederberg paper. (Background info: Single colonies grow from single cells). Consequently, there was no external source providing resistance to the experimental culture. \n \n **\n I don't follow the reasoning. I suspect that you are saying that these cultures are developed through repeated cloning, and that cloning means identical replication, FAPP. But we all know that not all of a genotype is expressed in any given phenotype, so in fact, even cloned cells can be different, while possessing identical DNA. So even if there was no \"external\" source,[debatable, as above], there could be an \"inherited\" source. \n \n pax,\n \n mturner \n \n From \n here.

   "Sorry to hop in here...but what do you think about what this Ph.D. molecular biologist says:\n \n Independent Birth of Organisms\n \n http://www.mattox.com/genome/synopsis.html#immut\n\n \n Being a synopsis it's hard to make any detailed assessment. One thing I will say, though, is that regardless of whether or not long DNA chains equivalent to those of - say - a dog today could have existed in a primeval 'soup', they wouldn't actually do anything without another dog for them to grow inside and supply them with processed nutrients and chemical stimuli. \n \n It's possible he's not actually talking about that kind of spontaneous eruption of fully formed animals; he might mean that the whole genome (or a close approximation thereof) was present in initial, single-celled organisms and that evolution has been a fed-back process of exposing the inherent potential of those genomes. I find that almost equally problematic, however. The author makes a big deal about how the length of the human genome is not a problem for independent simultaneous development, but doesn't seem to take into account the number of possible variations of a chain of that length, or explain why we wouldn't see billions of other equally valid variants. Nor does his hypothesis agree with the staggered appearance of fossils, or the phylogenetic tree; speaking of which, he says:\n \n \nInvertebrates contain body fluids that resemble vertebrate blood in both viscosity and function (if not color), and it is therefore only natural to assume that invertebrate \"blood\" is a very distant cousin to our own.\n\n \n He also mentions eyes, mouth parts, arms and legs.\n \n \nmolecular biologists have now determined that the vertebrate genes and invertebrate genes for most seemingly comparable organ systems, structural features and biochemical processes are utterly dissimilar. The development, composition and functionality of human blood, for example, is governed by more than 600 genes, but not one of them has yet been found to be even remotely similar in molecular structure to any of the known genes that code for invertebrate \"blood.\" If all life on Earth had descended from a common ancestor, then we would surely expect to find recurring patterns of structural similarities among different organisms' genes for comparable morphological and biochemical features.\n\n \n The bolded part contains a subtle but pretty major logical error. Common descent predicts genetic similarity of comparable morphological features in lineages that share an ancestor in which those features developed. Lineages that diverged prior to a particular feature evolving are extremely unlikely to develop exactly the same evolutionary 'solution' to the same or similar problem.\n \n The problem of 'locomotion' for example, has thousands upon thousands of possible solutions; it's not unreasonable to expect something conceptually recognisable as a 'leg' to evolve independently in different lineages. I think the author is making too much of that conceptual similarity. Plus he's only talking about differences and ignoring similarities: all mammalian limbs are genetically similar, and all organisms everywhere share the same very limited set of genetic bases; not what we would expect from independent abiogenesis. One of the main reasons we infer a branching tree of common descent is the pattern of shared and independently evolved genetic features.\n \n All in all... it's not setting my world on fire as such :)",

   "Me neither, but I'm really surprized to hear you spurn the darwinist explanation for L&D'43.\n\n \n Just to be clear on that point: I'm not. What I'm doing is querying why EAM would intelligently choose to induce a 'remembered' adaptation very occasionally and at random into unafflicted populations (thus making it look exactly like Darwinian RM) rather than doing what you began by claiming it should which is respond dynamically and teleologically to a stimulus: the presence of an antibiotic. In short, the random occurrence of resistance in those bacteria is inexplicable within an EAM framework, not within the Darwinian one. The Darwinian framework explains it just fine. \n \n The explanation you came up with, after backing down from your initial assertion that it was a response-to-stimulus, was this new idea of an adaptation being remembered outside the genome and reintroduced in a precautionary manner that just happens to mirror RM. That, to use the delightful term you introduced me to, is a 'just so' story :)\n \n \nSounds to me, even though you are being polite about it, that you've turned to the path of all the other darwindefenders here, and gone from arguing against my reasoning to arguing against me personally, ad hominem.\n\n \n No; not at all. I'm just being pragmatic regarding the low probability of further discussion bearing fruit. I could, as always, be wrong :)\n \n Though you've always couched it in derogatory terms, you've agreed that NS occurs in terms of genetic traits becoming more or less prevalent in a population. Just now you've agreed it biases the genome in favour of accumulating adaptive changes (however they arise) in preference to disruptive ones. \n \n You also say that none of this matters, because random changes must always be detrimental and that the adaptive changes we see must be directed. Trouble is, that doesn't follow logically: an adaptive point mutation from genome A to B is just a detrimental point mutation from B to A in reverse; it's perfectly possible for that physical change to the genome to occur, at random, in either direction; there's nothing to stop it. Equally pertinent, one must remember that only context defines genetic change as adaptive or disruptive. In the yeast experiment example, the changed genes that improved efficiency in that specific environment would have been neutral or disruptive in many others - does that mean those mutations could have happened at random in a different environment, just not in one where they were adaptive? How did the genome know to stop mutating like that at random and start doing it intelligently instead? How do we know it did, when the adaptive mutation rate was indistinguishable from background RM?\n \n Logically, if you can't say a mutation won't happen at random, and we observe it occurring with a frequency congruent with other (random) neutral or deletorious mutations at that locus and elsewhere, we can say with reasonable surety that it either is occurring at random, or that the 'intelligent' process directing that mutation is doing a no better than random job.\n \n Either way, when the ensuing population graph of non-mutant displacement follows the precise curve predicted by measured differential reproductive rates, and a further adaptive mutation occurs later within an almost mutant-saturated population, we can certainly say that NS caused those adaptive mutations to stack - an assessment verified by repeating the experiment and seeing the same adaptations occuring in a different order, indicating that they are rare and independent and would not, without the operation of NS betweentimes, be likely to stack within the same organism.\n \n Like I said, I'm not trying to exclude other adaptive mechanisms here or put RM+NS on a pedestal, even a correctly spelled one. I'm certainly not saying that L&D or the yeast experiments prove that RM+NS is responsible for all adaptation. But L&D and the yeast experiment unequivocally demonstrate RM+NS at work, and it does your EAM hypothesis no favours to contort itself beyond recognition in an effort to explain the same results. Better to simply accept that more than one mechanism might be at work, possibly in organisms of different complexity, possibly in different circumstances.

   "\n What I'm doing is querying why EAM would intelligently choose to induce a 'remembered' adaptation very occasionally and at random into unafflicted populations (thus making it look exactly like Darwinian RM) rather than doing what you began by claiming it should which is respond dynamically and teleologically to a stimulus: the presence of an antibiotic. \n\n \n **\n Where you get the idea that EAM posits any adaptation induced \"at random\", anywhere at any time, is beyond me. As for the possibility that some cells escaped the onslaught of the phage long enough to go into their developmental stage, I have taken your word for it that the protocols precluded any such probability. Proving that I, in stark contrast to your claim, in post 45, this thread, that, \"because you're convinced you have, you have no interest in improving your arguments.\" ,am capable, unlike yourself, of doing that very thing.\n \n Moreover, my claim was never limited solely to direct exposure in this instance being the stimulus to a last minute bacterial immune response. From the start I have maintained that since that phage resistance is a normal part of all developed eusocial e.coli. colonies, there is no reason not to believe that it is a normal part of eusocial e.coli. colonial development. This is to say that the presumed \"resistance mutation\" event, a supposed 'accident' that just happens over and over again, and with such regularity that it can hardly be considered the least bit 'random', might be part and parcel of the colonial design. And that that present design is traceable to the 'phage stimulus'/'colonial response' method, EAM, for its origins. \n \n You really don't like hearing this, but your dislike does not challenge it the least little bit.\n \n \n\n In short, the random occurrence of resistance in those bacteria is inexplicable within an EAM framework,\n\n \n **\n I just finished explaining it again, for the umpteenth time.\n \n \n\n not within the Darwinian one. The Darwinian framework explains it just fine.\n\n \n **\n Provided you can incorporate spontaneous generation and a generous Dame Fortune into your idea of science.\n \n \n\n The explanation you came up with, after backing down from your initial assertion that it was a response-to-stimulus,\n\n \n **\n Apparently you feel free to attack me both for not adjusting my arguments and for adjusting them. Sounds to me like you are more interested in 'scoring points' than in reasoning things out.\n \n \n \n\n was this new idea of an adaptation being remembered outside the genome and reintroduced in a precautionary manner that just happens to mirror RM. \n\n \n **\n It is not a new idea. I've presented it before, on this and other forums. And perhaps you'd like to tell us all just how you would distinguish a directed set of mutations developmentally induced, and a set of random mutations accidentally induced, simply on the basis of their numerical distribution across a number of subjects? Please do so. \n \n \n\n That, to use the delightful term you introduced me to, is a 'just so' story\n\n \n **\n 'Spontaneous generation' is a 'just so' story, especially when it 'just so happens' on a regular basis. The role of plasmids and their DNA in eubacterial development and immune responses is a legitimate scientific inquiry, in its infancy perhaps, but still developed to the point where L&D'43 is no longer as sacrosanct as you'd like to believe it is..\n \n \n\n Though you've always couched it in derogatory terms, you've agreed that NS occurs in terms of genetic traits becoming more or less prevalent in a population. \n\n \n **\n Yes, I've always agreed that the best meaning that natural selection can muster is the trivial truism that the living tend to have more offspring than the dead. That survival depends upon minute inherited trait differences, I've never accepted.\n \n \n\n Just now you've agreed it biases the genome in favour of accumulating adaptive changes (however they arise) in preference to disruptive ones. \n\n \n **\n How can anyone disgree with the truism that the descendents of survivors have a better chance of making further adaptive changes to themselves than do the unborn descendents of the already dead?\n \n \n\n You also say that none of this matters, because random changes must always be detrimental and that the adaptive changes we see must be directed. Trouble is, that doesn't follow logically: an adaptive point mutation from genome A to B is just a detrimental point mutation from B to A in reverse; it's perfectly possible for that physical change to the genome to occur, at random, in either direction; there's nothing to stop it.\n\n \n **\n Not when its causation is attributed to the magick of spontaneous generation. Once you accept the reality of magic in your metaphysic, and by extension your science, then anything is possible, and even entropy can act creatively, productively, and efficiently. Thing is, I gave up that reality somewhere around the age of seven, so I just can't go there.\n \n \n\n Equally pertinent, one must remember that only context defines genetic change as adaptive or disruptive.\n\n \n **\n Even if entropic action in the genetic information storage system, in and of itself, were held to be neutral,[which I do not grant], the genome per se is meaningless unless and until it is translated into a living organism, and in that meaningful context the organism a/tries to undo unintentional genetic changes and b/ suffers when it fails to do so.c/manipulates genes to suit itself during development.\n \n \n\n In the yeast experiment example, the changed genes that improved efficiency in that specific environment would have been neutral or disruptive in many others - does that mean those mutations could have happened at random in a different environment,\n\n \n **\n No. It means that even if those genetic mutations could happen accidentally, if they happened where and when inappropriate, they would have been prevented by the cells [repressed] from being expressed during the development phase, if possible. But since even in something so simple as yeasts the genome is so intricately interconnected re expressed/repressed genes and resulting traits, that some simple genetic accident could only be detrimental, and a sweeping genetic change keyed to a given environmental context could not be accidental. IMHO.\n \n \n\n just not in one where they were adaptive? How did the genome know to stop mutating like that at random and start doing it intelligently instead?\n\n \n **\n Don't follow you here.\n \n \n\n How do we know it did, when the adaptive mutation rate was indistinguishable from background RM?\n\n \n **\n Was it? And how did you establish the 'random mutation rate' for that particular mutation? Just setting a normal mutation rate across the entire genome is meaningless.\n \n \n\n Logically, if you can't say a mutation won't happen at random, and we observe it occurring with a frequency congruent with other (random) neutral or deletorious mutations at that locus and elsewhere, we can say with reasonable surety that it either is occurring at random, or that the 'intelligent' process directing that mutation is doing a no better than random job.\n\n \n **\n Again, how can you say anything about anything, unless and until you have an empirical criterion for discerning accidental from intentional mutations?\n \n \n\n But L&D and the yeast experiment unequivocally demonstrate RM+NS at work, \n\n \n **\n They do no such thing.\n \n \n\n and it does your EAM hypothesis no favours to contort itself beyond recognition in an effort to explain the same results.\n\n \n **\n There is no contortion or distortion anywhere in my responses to your assertion that the one and only reasonable explanation for the observations in LD43 and your yeasts is RMNS, in which I demonstrate that both could more scientifically be attributed to EAM rather than to the blind luck of RMNS.\n \n \n\n Better to simply accept that more than one mechanism might be at work, possibly in organisms of different complexity, possibly in different circumstances. I'm willing to entertain that idea; how about you?\n\n \n **\n Well, I'm willing to accept RMNS in viruses; trouble is, I don't consider them to be live organisms.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "Where you get the idea that EAM posits any adaptation induced \"at random\", anywhere at any time, is beyond me.\n\n That's not the point I'm making. What you continue to fail to explain is why EAM would 'intelligently' yield behaviour indistinguishable from random mutation consistent with background RM.\n \nAs for the possibility that some cells escaped the onslaught of the phage long enough to go into their developmental stage, I have taken your word for it that the protocols precluded any such probability. Proving that I, in stark contrast to your claim, in post 45, this thread, that, \"because you're convinced you have, you have no interest in improving your arguments.\" ,am capable, unlike yourself, of doing that very thing.\n\n Yet with this very statement you demonstrate that you still have not taken the salient facts of L&D on board. It's not about the protocol precluding adaptive response. It's about the experiment proving a direct link between the number of cell divisions prior to exposure in an initially non-resistant population, and the proportion of surviving resistant bacteria.\n \nMoreover, my claim was never limited solely to direct exposure in this instance being the stimulus to a last minute bacterial immune response. From the start I have maintained that since that phage resistance is a normal part of all developed eusocial e.coli. colonies, there is no reason not to believe that it is a normal part of eusocial e.coli. colonial development.\n\n I don't remember encountering that argument until fairly recently, but I could be in error. Consider the comment retracted.\n \nThis is to say that the presumed \"resistance mutation\" event, a supposed 'accident' that just happens over and over again, and with such regularity that it can hardly be considered the least bit 'random',\n\n It happens over and over again because the small but finite chance of that mutation occurring at that locus (as opposed to a different mutation at that or any other locus) is dwarfed by the number of cell divisions occurring in a population of hundreds of millions. The 'regularity' it exhibits is of a particular statistical kind, like radioactive decay: we can say that after X cell divisions there is a Y% chance of one or more resistant bacteria occurring, with Y tending to 100 as X increases.\n \n That's how L&D chose the number of cell divisions they allowed the tiny samples to undergo before exposing them to phage: they made a mathematical prediction of how many divisions would yield a particular pattern of survival (none in some, a jackpot in others) if the mutation was occurring at random during cell division rather than being a rarely successful response-to-stimulus. They did the experiment, and got the results they predicted. That's pretty darn good science.\n \nYou really don't like hearing this, but your dislike does not challenge it the least little bit.\n\n And your partiality to it does not elevate it from being a 'just so' story. \n \nIt is not a new idea. I've presented it before, on this and other forums. And perhaps you'd like to tell us all just how you would distinguish a directed set of mutations developmentally induced, and a set of random mutations accidentally induced, simply on the basis of their numerical distribution across a number of subjects? Please do so.\n\n The point I'm making is that these results are indistinguishable from random mutation, for which we have a mathematically predictive theory that gets the pattern of resistance bang on the money. \n \n What I'm trying to get you to see is that with or without EAM also going on, the random mutations we know occur all the time are perfectly capable of yielding these particular results. For EAM to be deemed responsible instead, we would have to hypothesise that EAM is both 'intelligently' inhibiting that particular mutation from occurring at random and then intelligently mimicking that same random pattern of mutation. Doesn't that seem just a bit far fetched?\n \n I'm not trying to use this to prove that EAM doesn't occur. All I'm trying to get you to see is that EAM has got better things to do than suppress and then mimic RM+NS.\n \n'Spontaneous generation' is a 'just so' story, especially when it 'just so happens' on a regular basis.\n\n As above: the regularity is statistical, based on compounded random chance. Shuffle a deck of cards and the top one will probably not be an ace. Repeat the process a hundred times and the probability of it being an ace at least once is very high. Regular? Not in the sense of knowing when it's going to happen, only in the sense of knowing that it's almost certain to happen sometime within a certain number of shuffles. \n \n The odds of the resistent mutation occurring are much lower than that of an ace hitting the top card - but the number of cell divisions (shuffles) are correspondingly enormous. Statistics don't suddenly stop working just because the numbers get bigger :)\n \nThe role of plasmids and their DNA in eubacterial development and immune responses is a legitimate scientific inquiry, in its infancy perhaps, but still developed to the point where L&D'43 is no longer as sacrosanct as you'd like to believe it is..\n\n All that would impact is the subsequent distribution of the resistant trait within the population, not its emergence.\n \nThat survival depends upon minute inherited trait differences, I've never accepted.\n\n But in the experiments under discussion here, this certainly is the case. The genetic difference to the e-coli was an all-or-nothing survival trait. The genetic changes sequenced in the yeast experiment were directly, causally linked to improved efficiency in that environment. In the latter, it wasn't an all-or-nothing survival trait but it demonstrably led to the numerical displacement of non-mutants, thus ensuring that any further adaptive mutations would (and as it turns out did) stack.\n \nNot when its causation is attributed to the magick of spontaneous generation. Once you accept the reality of magic in your metaphysic, and by extension your science, then anything is possible, and even entropy can act creatively, productively, and efficiently. Thing is, I gave up that reality somewhere around the age of seven, so I just can't go there.\n\n It would be so much easier to enjoy these discussions if you didn't keep making these offhandedly offensive jibes. So now I must have the mental age of seven, hmm?\n \n Many of the processes by which RM occurs are fairly well understood at a physical and chemical level. UV light, for example, induces a greater rate of random mutation.\n \n And here's an interesting little kicker for you to consider: bacterial exposure to UV doesn't just increase the rate of neutral or harmful mutations. If EAM were responsible for the yeast adaptation, or the L&G immunity, wouldn't we expect UV bombardment increasing the background rate of 'destructive' mutation to delay - or at best have no effect upon - the intelligent discovery of adaptive mutations? But no: adaptive mutations continue to represent the same proportion of all mutations in an environment, regardless of whether UV is applied or not.\n \n Still think this is the reasoning of a seven-year-old? :)\n \nBut since even in something so simple as yeasts the genome is so intricately interconnected re expressed/repressed genes and resulting traits, that some simple genetic accident could only be detrimental, and a sweeping genetic change keyed to a given environmental context could not be accidental. IMHO.\n\n There was no sweeping change; the adaptive differences were isolated and sequenced and found to be simple, local genetic change easily reached via one or two atomic mutations - the odds of two such mutations stacking in the absence of NS being comfortably congruent with the 140,000,000,000 cell divisions it took for the adaptation to occur.\n \nAgain, how can you say anything about anything, unless and until you have an empirical criterion for discerning accidental from intentional mutations?\n\n I do rather think the ball is in your court on that one :) Random mutations are known to occur; you've said as much yourself. Non-random ones are the unknown quantity.\n \nThey do no such thing.\n\n Yes, WW, they do. Like it or not, EAM - assuming it happens - proceeds against a background of RM that demonstrably can yield adaptive traits, and NS that demonstrably can cause them to stack.\n \nThere is no contortion or distortion anywhere in my responses to your assertion that the one and only reasonable explanation for the observations in LD43 and your yeasts is RMNS, in which I demonstrate that both could more scientifically be attributed to EAM rather than to the blind luck of RMNS.\n\n Apart from the 'more scientifically' part, absolutely - so long as one is prepared to assert that EAM both inhibits RM from finding these adaptive traits and then intelligently mimics the pattern in which RM would find them if it wasn't being inhibited :)\n \n That pretty much mirrors your argument all along: you infer EAM purely by denying RM the ability to generate those mutations - yet you've no logic to support that denial. The sequenced mutations in question are, in terms of physical change to the genome, indistinguishable from any other mutation, including destructive ones you'd be happy to deem 'random'. I mean, if the mutation had occurred a little bit to either side (as, statistically speaking, it almost undoubtedly would have done in the 140,000,000,000 cell divisions preceding the adaptation) it would have been either neutral or catastrophic - how come you're happy for that to happen at random, but not at the locus in between? On what scientific basis are you disallowing that locus as a site for RM?\n \nWell, I'm willing to accept RMNS in viruses; trouble is, I don't consider them to be live organisms.\n\n Now that is super interesting. Rest assured we will return to that topic in future!\n \n Just to reiterate and hopefully avoid confusion: I'm happy to discuss evidence favouring directed evolution, ideas involving inherited developmental variation and so forth. I'm not trying to make this a one horse race. I just don't see the point in proceeding on the false pretext that RM+NS has been eliminated as a source of adaptation, because we're bound to end up making false inferences from that, like L&D being evidence of EAM's 'precautionary' seeding of a population with variants resistant to a specific phage. We'd end up in a terrible mess.",

You're saying that, even though a particular mutation (which happens to be adaptive in that environment) occurs just as often as we would expect based on background mutation rates, and is one of the types of mutation we know RM can produce, it can't be accidental because it's beneficial.

You're asking RM - the R standing for random - to tiptoe around things it's 'not supposed to do'. Do you think it's going to listen? :)\n \n \nI cannot see where or how an accident which damages the current biosystems capacity to achieve the greatest outcome for the least input under a specified set of conditions, can somehow increase that capacity, rather than diminishing it, as appears to be the claim for random genetic mutations.

On the basis of that empiricist observation,\n\n \n I'm sure in retrospect you can appreciate the fallacy there: an 'empirical observation' that is pre-filtered based on the results you want to see isn't empirical at all. You personally don't see RM+NS yielding increased efficiency because everywhere you see increased efficiency, you say it must be intelligently driven. \n \n Here you are now, denying clear evidence of RM+NS yielding improved efficiency based on never having seen any evidence in the past. Trouble is, you could work your way through a mountain of evidence that way and at the end claim to have 'never seen any'. Is this the first evidence of RM+NS producing adaptation that you've denied? No? Well then; see what I mean? :)\n \n To be honest, I think you're considering this at too abstract and philosophical a level. At the end of the day, if improved efficiency in an environment is traced to a specific genetic mutation (which it was in the yeast experiment), the only question worth asking is: can RM induce that particular physical change to the genome? The answer in these cases is emphatically 'yes'. Whether that mutation happens to improve efficiency in that environment is really irrelevant; you can't expect a random system to considerately avoid inducing mutations that subsequently improve efficiency, and there's no EAM union official going to come round and complain about role demarkation :)\n \n \nFor some reason that totally escapes me you are convinced that it demonstrates random, accidental, yet adaptive and positive, genetic mutation. But right now I'm tired of re-hashing the same ol' same ol'.\n\n \n The pattern and number of survivors in the second half of the test shows the mutation occurring, at a random time (or never) in the growth of the colony, prior to phage exposure, during cell division. There's no mechanical developmental regularity (as there is in, say, foetal development), only the statistical regularity of the chance of it happening per cell division, and the consequent number of cell divisions required for the chance of a resistant bacteria existing to get close to 100%. Hence, the mutation occurs at random.\n \n \nThat's your interpretation. It's entirely based upon the notion that the magic of great big numbers allows everything and anything to 'just happen', repeatedly, by pure chance. I can think of no reason in the world why I should accept that assumption, especially where it bears directly on the survival of a self-directed, self-controlled, self-serving complex biosytem.\n\n \n Human beings are all those things, and it has bugger all to do with which of them wins the lottery if they are all given a ticket. Yes, winning the lottery is a random event - that doesn't mean we can't calculate the likelihood of it being won after a week, two weeks, three weeks etc, and be pretty darn sure it is going to be won by somebody in that time.\n \n Nor is it about 'anything and everything' just happening given enough time or cell divisions. There are several well-established physical mechanisms by which random mutations occur (including, at that scale, the Uncertainty Principle). We know what kinds of mutations can be thus induced. The yeast experimenters sequenced the adaptive changes in question and found them to be of the types permitted by RM.\n \n So if a mutation - a physical genetic change - can be produced by RM, and is observed to occur at a rate congruent with background mutation rates, what earthly reason do we have for postulating a different explanatory mechanism at work?\n \n As I pointed out, to credit EAM with these particular adaptive mutations we would have to suppose it was not only inducing them at a rate indistinguishable from RM, but was also actively suppressing RM from hitting upon that adaptation - if it didn't, EAM's success rate would be added to RM's success rate and the mutation would occur disproportionately often.",

What in the world do you suppose that to mean? It sounds tautologous to me, in the exact same circular fashion as your more famous, 'survival of the fittest'. Unless and until you can demonstrate that each and every single gene in that genome mutates at exactly the same rate as this particular gene, your 'background mutatation rates' are meaningless.But we both know that all genes do not mutate at the same rate. Try to explain that from 'random chance' causation.\n \n \n\n That's like saying that all the people who didn't win the lottery picked their numbers at random, but the one who did must have picked it with intelligent foresight because he won.\n\n \n **\n No, it is not. It is saying that he may have picked it non-randomly. He might have worked out an intelligent 'system' for adjusting to probabilities, or he may have simply 'put in the fix' to intelligently win by cheating. The point is, you have no way to know if he did such things, or was simply lucky. My point is, that if there is no gain, then why discuss whether someone acted intelligently anmd deliberately and analytically, but erroneously, in picking a losing ticket, or just accepted whatever ticket was issued them at random, and lost? It doesn't matter to me how somebody loses. Evolution is about 'winners', and how they 'win'. So it's the manner of 'winning' (I'm using the term very loosely) that concerns us.\n It's true that in coin toss and lottery wins are usually decided by the external behaviour of the coin or the numbered balls, provided that there is insufficient iteration to intelligently extrapolate probabilities, but they do not truly reflect nature, because in nature there are usually more than one 'winning' outcome to be had, and the game is played incessantly. The analogy is closer to playing poker, than to flipping coins or taking whatever loto ticket the storeclerk hands you. Why? Because every win is partly dependent on your playing ability, and not just the luck of the deal. But even the poker analogy does not truly mirror nature.\n You want to believe that every win is a matter of chance, but that doesn't have to be true even in a simple coin toss. And its plain to see, empirically, that in complex productive and efficient systems, 'winning' is due more to intentional and intelligent effort than lucky chance. Indeed, if winning consistently is the goal, no effort must be spared in eliminating luck, chance, and random outcomes. That is exactly what human 'gamblers' do, at least those who consistently win, and if that's good enough for one life form, it should be applicable to all others. Unless you adopt the creationist view that human life is qualitatively different from life as found in other organisms.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Just assuming that any or all changes in a genome are accidental won't cut it. You need a solid criterion for making such a judgement in each and every separate case. \n \n Which you don't have - precisely my point. You have no logical or empirical evidence to suggest that random mutation, a known factor in genetic change, was not responsible for these adaptations.\n\n \n **\n To the contrary--I've repeated my criterion a zillion times. My criterion for judgement is, in essence, the self-evident postulate, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit'. That is, nothing can, independendently and autonomously, generate out of itself that which it does not itself possess to begin with. The materialist/mechanist response to that logic is to appeal to the irrationality of 'magic', aka, 'spontaneous generation', or 'emergence', or, 'abiogenesis', or, 'adaptive organismic mutation by means of random genetic mutation', or 'fitness', or 'natural selection', or whatever. With specific application to \"adaptive organismic mutation by means of random genetic mutation', it means that added adaptedness in an organism to a novel set of conditions, can come about, ex nihilo, by subtracting from the adaptedness it had for a prior set of conditions, without adding anything else to the organism. It's the same idea as the postulate that you cannot increase information by accidentally subtracting data necessary to that information, you either increase 'noise' or misinformation, both of which are entropic. With biostems, and indeed all complex systems, 'noise' is inefficiently, unproductively neutral, and misinformation is truly destructive.\n \n So it is on the basis of whether a change empowers or debilitates and organism that I determine whether it was intentional, with intelligence and volition applied to the complex system and its interdependent parts, or accidental, a matter of chance. From that point of view, any accidental genetic mutation can no more increasingly empower an organism, increase its adaptedness, than a broken leg can increasingly empower an ungulate.\n \n Enough for now.

   "\n Quote:[ww]\n My criterion is the postulate that evolution is more than mere difference; it is as Bateson said, \"a difference that makes a difference\", which I interpret to mean a change that adds new meaning (from new data relating to old data and information). If a person starts from the position that the word 'meaning', or 'significance', is itself meaningless, that the only reality is raw data, then we can never come to any mutual understanding. \n \n \n You can't exclude one particular locus from experiencing RM on the basis that, if it did experience RM, it would violate certain philosophical beliefs about 'meaning' or 'significance'. You're asking RM - the R standing for random - to tiptoe around things it's 'not supposed to do'. Do you think it's going to listen? \n\n \n **\n Very colourful image, but what does it mean?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I cannot see where or how an accident which damages the current biosystems capacity to achieve the greatest outcome for the least input under a specified set of conditions, can somehow increase that capacity, rather than diminishing it, as appears to be the claim for random genetic mutations. In the world I see around me, real complex systems are only rendered more efficient and productive, even under novel conditions, by intentional acts directed by intelligence. On the basis of that empiricist observation, \n \n \n I'm sure in retrospect you can appreciate the fallacy there: an 'empirical observation' that is pre-filtered based on the results you want to see isn't empirical at all. \n\n \n **\n No, it certainly isn't, and there is no better example of that fallacy than L&D'43. IAC, my observations are of actual complex systems, including machine systems, existing as actual causal entities in empirical reality, and not of effects as abstract statistical possibilities.\n \n \n\n You personally don't see RM+NS yielding increased efficiency because everywhere you see increased efficiency, you say it must be intelligently driven. \n\n \n **\n No. I don't \"say\" it, I see it. Including in every data-processing computer system which falsely claims to be operating according to the darwinian RM+NS principle instead of human intelligence.\n \n \n\n Here you are now, denying clear evidence of RM+NS yielding improved efficiency based on never having seen any evidence in the past.\n\n \n **\n No. I am denying it for three reasons;--\n \n 1/There is no empirical example of any random, accidental, involuntary and accidental change in a complex system resulting in heightened performance for that complex system, in terms of productivity and energy efficiency, be that complex system artificial or natural, anywhere to be found. It is not a matterr that I have never seen such a thing,-- it is a matter that no-one has ever seen such a thing.\n \n 2/There is no such thing as 'selection' to be accomplished without the intelligence that creates a/ awareness of difference, b/value of difference, and c/ voluntary choice. Anything else is mechanical 'sorting', not selection. Sorting is passive, whereas selection is dynamic, and conflating the one for the other, as darwinists do, is a dishonest deception foisted upon a gullible public. Looking at \"NS\" as mechanical sorting, such as is accomplished by wind and rain, we find that unlike hydrology and such, \"NS\" has no empirical constituents that can be measured, defined, and mathematically modelled. There is, therefore, nothing in \"NS\" that can add to something or regulate and direct anything. In effect it is nothing but another word, another vacuous label, for the unintentional change inherent in all ecosystems, or even the entropic change unavoidable in all systems.\n 3/ Logic, from the rationally undeniable, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit' postulate, negates, as I have explained several times, the notion that subtracting efficiency or information from a complex system cannot, in and of itself, increase the efficiency, productivity, or information in that system. Put another way, nobody gets to eat their cake and have it, too.\n \n \n\n Trouble is, you could work your way through a mountain of evidence that way and at the end claim to have 'never seen any'. Is this the first evidence of RM+NS producing adaptation that you've denied? No? Well then; see what I mean? \n\n \n **\n Actually, the only \"evidence\" repeatedly offered as support for, and even \"proof of\" the validity of the RMNS principle are these 'usual suspects'--1/the peppered moth, 2/darwin's finches, 3/anti-malarial sickle cell disease, and 4/ L&D'43 (along with Lederberg & Lederberg). So, after 150 years, there really hasn't been all that much \"evidence\" to pick apart. Your \"yeast\" thing seems a recent addition (5) to the stable. But I can truthfully say I've denied all five, ( more a molehill than any 'mountain' I've known), and will deny as many more as you guys can come up with.\n \n \n\n To be honest, I think you're considering this at too abstract and philosophical a level.\n\n \n **\n Well, I'm the one arguing from empirical observation, and you're the one arguing from statistical assumption, so forgive me for saying that that shoe fits your foot, not mine.\n \n \n\n At the end of the day, if improved efficiency in an environment is traced to a specific genetic mutation (which it was in the yeast experiment), the only question worth asking is: can RM induce that particular physical change to the genome? The answer in these cases is emphatically 'yes'.\n\n \n **\n Not true at all. The only question worth asking is [b]did/b] random chance [make] the specific genetic change that induced improved efficiency in the yeast cells. Even if you could demonstrate that it 'could', the only real issue is whether or not it 'did'. And so far you have not even shown that it 'could' occur by blind chance. You simply assume that it could, and that since it could, then it did.\n \n On what basis do you make your assumption? Once again, it appears to me to be nothing more than the irrational presumption that 'anything is possible given the magic of great big numbers'. In this case, that the genome of a yeast can be accidentally modified, and as a direct effect, the yeast cell itself will be modified so as to fit a specific novel condition, all on the sole condition that that genome makes a sufficiently high number of mistakes over a sufficiently high number of self-reproductions, or is damaged enough times over that great big number of generations by a sufficiently large number of passing mutagens. On what possible rational grounds can you justify such an assumption?!?\n \n \n\n Whether that mutation happens to improve efficiency in that environment is really irrelevant; you can't expect a random system to considerately avoid inducing mutations that subsequently improve efficiency, and there's no EAM union official going to come round and complain about role demarkation \n\n \n **\n Again you assume that a certain change at a certain gene not only must happen, eventually, you also assume that the change that eventually does happen can and will correlate directly to a pre-specified condition experienced by the whole cell, by happy coincidence alone. You can only make that assumption, iut seems to me, if you first assume that, wrt to the organism, at least some genes are meaningless and inconsequential, and so any such 'meaningless' gene can be made meaningful and consequential by some purely accidental mechanical change, apparently just as they were created in the first place, without doing as much harm as good. That is, you conflate the medium, DNA, with the message it transmits. You never ask, just what was this gene before, 'mirabile dictu', it became something entirely different and somehow bestowed a brand new property, (serendipitously the very property needed), upon its organism. You simply say, \"It just happened, that's all.\", and, sorry, but that's a vacuous non-explanation in my book. \n \n Later, maybe.",

   "Very colourful image, but what does it mean?\n\n \n What it means is that you're trying to disqualify RM from inducing a perfectly ordinary, physical change to the genome based on your philosophical objection to randomness producing what turns out to be a 'meaningful' adaptation. I love latin as much as the next guy, but all this 'ex nihilo, nihil fit' stuff completely bypasses the point: in terms of what actually has to happen for the adaptive trait in question to arise, it's just a physical genetic change qualitatively indistinguishable from any other - moreover, it's one you would be perfectly happy to attribute to 'entropic RM' in any other environment because it wouldn't be adaptive!\n \n \n1/There is no empirical example of any random, accidental, involuntary and accidental change in a complex system resulting in heightened performance for that complex system, in terms of productivity and energy efficiency, be that complex system artificial or natural, anywhere to be found.\n\n \n You can't use a 'lack of empirical evidence' to justify disqualifying empirical evidence placed before you.\n \n \nIt is not a matterr that I have never seen such a thing,-- it is a matter that no-one has ever seen such a thing.\n\n \n Apart from L&D, and - what - a million? Two million?

Anything else is mechanical 'sorting', not selection.\n\n \n That part of the discussion is done, WW; you ended it a couple of posts ago when you conceded that NS helps adaptive traits to stack. Call it Natural Sorting if you like; doesn't make a blind bit of difference.\n \n \n3/ Logic, from the rationally undeniable, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit' postulate, negates, as I have explained several times, the notion that subtracting efficiency or information from a complex system cannot, in and of itself, increase the efficiency, productivity, or information in that system. Put another way, nobody gets to eat their cake and have it, too.\n\n \n Why is an insertion a 'subtraction' of information? Why is a duplication a 'subtraction'? If I take a wall and 'subtract' a door, does that not improve its efficiency at letting people through?\n \n Sorry, but this is just abstract hand-waving; the genetic changes in the yeast experiment were sequenced and shown to be run-of-the-mill mutations - and it's that you have to show couldn't happen at random, not some elevated notion of specified complexity.\n \n \n But I can truthfully say I've denied all five, ( more a molehill than any 'mountain' I've known), and will deny as many more as you guys can come up with.\n\n \n And that, my friend, is why I said earlier that there wasn't much point continuing my dialogue with you. Would you want to carry on talking to me, if I said \"sorry, ww, but no matter what evidence you show me, I'm still gonna deny EAM\"?\n \n \nWell, I'm the one arguing from empirical observation, and you're the one arguing from statistical assumption, so forgive me for saying that that shoe fits your foot, not mine.\n\n \n You have no empirical observation, only subjective interpretation of evidence.\n \n \nNot true at all. The only question worth asking is [b]did/b] random chance [make] the specific genetic change that induced improved efficiency in the yeast cells. Even if you could demonstrate that it 'could', the only real issue is whether or not it 'did'. And so far you have not even shown that it 'could' occur by blind chance. You simply assume that it could, and that since it could, then it did.\n\n \n Again the unfortunate statistical gap in your understanding proves your undoing.\n \n Allow me to make an analogy: imagine you take an ordinary 6 sided die, which has an equal chance of showing any face uppermost when rolled. This represents RM. Now imagine you install a mechanism within it which can 'intelligently' cause the number 6 to be uppermost. This represents EAM - and the number 6 represents the adaptive mutation. What we don't know is how often EAM kicks in, so we devise an experiment.\n \n We roll the dice over and over, and we see that the number 6 comes up 1/6th of the time, and in no special pattern - apparently random. What do we infer from this? That either EAM isn't doing a damn thing, or that it is somehow inhibiting the random chance of a 6 arising, and then deliberately mimicking that random chance. The latter option is simply absurd and can be discarded.\n \n That's why showing that RM can produce that mutation, and at a rate congruent with that observed, is sufficient to disqualify EAM from having any significant involvement. We don't need to show that one particular mutation resulted from EAM rather than RM, we just need to show that there aren't enough for any of them to be the result of EAM.\n \n \nAgain you assume that a certain change at a certain gene not only must happen, eventually, \n\n \n Just like someone 'must' win the lottery, eventually, if enough weeks go by and enough people take part. It's never 100%, but it asymptotically approaches it. In the case of the yeast it took 140 billion participants to win the first lottery and 220 billion to win the second. If my maths hasn't entirely deserted me, for the odds of the first mutation occurring within 140,000,000,000 divisions to be an acceptable 50/50, the odds of it occurring in any one division are 0.0000000000049510512, or 1 in 200 billion. Are you really prepared to assert that the odds of that mutation occurring were less than 1 in 200 billion?\n \n \nyou also assume that the change that eventually does happen can and will correlate directly to a pre-specified condition experienced by the whole cell, by happy coincidence alone.\n\n \n Sorry, but no. It is a fact that that particular mutation yields that particular adaptive trait; it's a direct causal link with no randomness involved. We've already encapsulated the improbability of the event by specifying the required mutation.\n \n \nYou can only make that assumption, iut seems to me, if you first assume that, wrt to the organism, at least some genes are meaningless and inconsequential, and so any such 'meaningless' gene can be made meaningful and consequential by some purely accidental mechanical change, apparently just as they were created in the first place, without doing as much harm as good.

You simply say, \"It just happened, that's all.\", and, sorry, but that's a vacuous non-explanation in my book.\n\n \n Dear lord, you overcomplicate matters sometimes!\n \n One of the adaptive changes - actually discovered and sequenced in a repeat of the experiment - was the duplication of an existing gene. That's it. Two genes, twice as much aphtase synthesised - efficiency in that particular phosphate-limited environment improved.\n \n Yes, it really was that simple. Forget sweeping genome change, forget developmental nuances, forget 'creating meaning'. Twice the genes synthesising a particular enzyme = increased efficiency in that particular environment. End of story.\n \n Doesn't that give you the slightest pause? All EAM had to do was duplicate a single gene that codes for an enzyme that makes up for an exogenous nutrilite deficiency - yet it took hundreds of billions of cells living and dying to 'figure that out'. Meanwhile RM is 'entropically' inducing point mutations, insertions, deletions and duplications...",

   " But they don't start thread after thread with by posting exactly the same thing on multiple sites. That seems to be a creationist tactic. \n\n \n When I first started debating on a creation/evolution board I was ridiculed, scoffed at, laughed at and demeaned by my belief that God created the world. It was a disgusting display by a group of disgusting elitists. I'm not saying every darwinist is disgusting I'm just telling what I experienced. After a few weeks of that treatment I decided to educate myself a bit more. I knew ToE was wrong but I could not pinpoint why at first. I mean I read links and stuff that said mutations were rare and natural selection was tautology, but I really didn't have anything concrete. But having a bit of a crummy health history, and overcoming it naturally, it eventually dawned on me that ToE was false because they did not believe that the environment effected the individual. I found it very strange that phenotypic plasticity was supressed....I found it very odd that no controlled experiments were done on animals interacting with their environment, and I found it very odd that they insisted beneficial traits had to arise randomly in just one or a few organisms -- which means that the population would basically have to start from scratch in order for that particular trait to spread throughout the population. This is ludicrous, especially considering many populations of animals are spread out across a whole country or continent.\n \n But anyway, with this backdrop I decided to get even. Now that I'm much more informed I am motivated to get even. This includes posting at more than one forum. Of course I realize getting even isn't necessarily a Christian thing to do, and someday I may get judged for that...who knows. But I will not stop my assault on ToE. It's a disgusting premise based on a non-scientific foundation and it needs to be stopped.\n \n Personally I think science should be neutral. It should not support one worldview or another. it should be much like solving a math problem. I don't resort to the Bible to solve equations....and neither should science resort to their materialist leanings. Science should be about the study of nature as it actually is....not of what it might be or what it should be or what science wants it to be. Science should be the study of the interaction of the whole organism with its environment.\n \n \n \n \n So you don't understand that malnourished mothers give birth to malnourished offspring? How is that an acquired trait? I guess that you think that fetal alcohol syndrome is an inherited trait.\n So it wasn't inherited. It was malnutrition. \n\n \n I'm sorry you are so blind you can't see it, but the following is the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Think about it....when the first healthy mother ate a crummy diet, her offspring emerged, evidently, with abnormal variations in skeletal structure. The following became worse...as did the next generation. Each generation inherited the parent's problems plus more.\n \n \n However, the cats that were eating cooked meat and milk increasingly, with each new generation, gave birth to other cats that had abnormal variations in their skeletal structure. Their bones became soft and brittle by the time they reached the third generation. And from the very first generation onwards, the following problems were noticed with all the cats that were eating cooked foods: poor eyesight, heart problems, thyroid and bladder problems, nervous system problems, meningitis and paralysis, infections of various organs, ovary and testis problems, liver problems, bone problems, nearsightedness or farsightedness, inflammations, uterine congestion, atrophy of various organs, failure of reproductive systems, and so on. \n \n By the third generation, the cats' bones from the group that ate the cooked foods had actually become rubber-like. Their mental status was also not normal anymore. With each new generation, the cats became more unpredictable, were more irritable, were biting and scratching more, were less playful, and so on. The males also became very docile and experienced a drop in their libido and sexual interest while the females became very aggressive. There was also a huge increase in same sex sexual activity.\n \n Besides any of that, I have been ridiculed to no end in here for my assertions that declining health and diseases are almost all diet related. This proves it. Not only that, but a return in healthy diet brought back healthy physiologies.\n \n I think we're seeing the same thing in humans today as in these cats. From article:\n \n Each new human generation being born today has even more complications and health issues at younger ages than previous ones. We now see children getting diseases that were previously only seen in older people.\n \n So the fact that humans are getting diabetes, osteoporosis, back problems, mental problems and all these other inflictions -- how do you explain that in a darwinian way? Do you think all these conditions started by a single mutation and then got selected? However you want to slice it, these traits are appearing in a non-darwinan way. They are created by the interaction of the developing organism with the environment -- in this case diet. According to darwinists, the environment is not is not to play a role in the emergence of traits. Traits are linked to genes -- and genes are unpredictable and mutate unoriented to the environment\n \n \n \n \n But the traits of malnourishment weren't inherited. \n\n \n you didn't read, did you?\n \n \n \n Malnourishment causes deformations in offspring. It isn't genetic. \n\n \n It doesn't have to be genetic. When \"evolution\" is observed in the fossil record or in the field they don't observe \"genetics\"...they observe changes in physical traits....and that's exactly what we have here. \n \n \n \n By the way, the word is spelled, \"environment.\" \n\n \n have you ever heard of a typing error?",

   "\n What it means is that you're trying to disqualify RM from inducing a perfectly ordinary, physical change to the genome based on your philosophical objection to randomness producing what turns out to be a 'meaningful' adaptation. I love latin as much as the next guy, but all this 'ex nihilo, nihil fit' stuff completely bypasses the point: in terms of what actually has to happen for the adaptive trait in question to arise, it's just a physical genetic change qualitatively indistinguishable from any other - moreover, it's one you would be perfectly happy to attribute to 'entropic RM' in any other environment because it wouldn't be adaptive!\n\n \n **\n You are a mechanist and a geneticist/molecular biologist of some kind, are you not? So that's the position you argue from. I'm just a fairly rational non-geneticist who argues from a rational and logical standpoint, bolstered by what he can learn from the popular press. Why should I give your mechanist arguments any credit if you feel free to condescendingly and airily dismiss my rational arguments?\n \n I've already said, in agreement with your own statement, that we can agree to disagree here, and just call it quits, but that isn't happening.\n \n On the issue--can changes, \"mutations\", in DNA sequences, \"genes\", that are brought about unintentionally, accidentally, randomly, spontaneously, either by internal copying \"mistakes\" or external mutagens, result in an increase in productivity, efficiency, that is, adaptedness, in a complex, self-directed biosytem, be it currently adapted or maladapted to conditions, I have argued the negative, you the positive.\n \n Your argument is the mechanist one that genetic changes follow a linear progression to a phenotypic change. That is, a physical change in a molecular pattern leads inevitably to a particular outcome in a complex system, in mechanical, lock-step, determinist fashion. That is the only way that a particular molecular change can lead to a particular change in the biosystem.\n And unless that is a given, your premise that an accidental or spontaneous molecular change could directly result in an adaptive change to a complex biosystem just won't fly. But the fact is, that view is entirel out of date. It was on its last legs before the great genomics projects, and now it has been shot all to hell. For instance--\n \n \"The novel scientific landscape, as it emerged during the symposium, can be summarized as an apparent paradox: how can a highly complex organism like the human one be codified by a number of genes, probably as small as 30,000, and in any case not greater than 60,000, which is only five to ten times greater than the number contained in a unicellular microbe like yeast? The solution of this paradox shows the complexities and difficulties facing today's biologists. In fact, even though we can identify the \"genes\" in the genome, i.e. the sequences that code for a protein - with a certain degree of uncertainty, as shown above - we are still far from even knowing the number of proteins actually present in a cell, let alone the organism. \n \n This may sound surprising and requires some explanation. The proteins are polymeric molecules made of linear chains of many monomers called amino acids - they are of twenty different kinds, whereas the long DNA chains codifying for them are polymers made of monomers, called bases, of four different kinds. The proteins are the effectors of all the reactions and interactions that characterize living organisms. \n \n The amino-acid sequence of any protein, having lengths ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands of amino acids, is codified in a sequence of bases on the DNA (each amino-acid being specified by three subsequent bases). In order to pass from the sequence of bases present on the DNA to that of amino acids of a given protein, the cell utilizes a short intermediate made of four bases similar to those of DNA called RNA. This \"messenger\" molecule copies the gene sequence, but immediately afterwards undergoes, in complex organisms like the human one (contrary to bacteria), a process of splicing that removes portions of the sequence and leaves a processed, \"mature\" RNA molecule bearing the information for a given amino-acid sequence. This splicing may occur in different ways on the same RNA molecule, which can therefore code for several different proteins, and we cannot yet predict exactly how many. Furthermore, a given protein can be split in different fragments, each with a different function and properties. \n \n But this is not all. Each protein may undergo a number of chemical modifications consisting in the addition in specific positions of chemical residues, like different sugar, acetyl, methyl or phosphate residues, and others still, each conferring different physico-chemical and functional properties to the protein. Thus, as indicated above, the number of different proteins producible in a cell is much greater than the number of genes, and we are not yet in a condition of even knowing the exact number. \n \n And this is not all. Another very important element of complexity is given by the fact that, particularly in complex multi-cellular organisms like the human one, the proteins do not function as single molecules but mainly as multi-protein complexes made by the combination, via weak chemical bonds, of different molecules; the same protein may thus be part of different multi-protein complexes performing quite different functions. It should be clear from all this that the complexity of a living organism is not a linear function of the size of the genome or of the related number of genes, but rather an exponential function of this number. \n \n What then are the challenges facing today's biologists in trying to give a comprehensive picture of the development and functions of a living being? In the first place, identify the detailed three-dimensional structure of any given protein or multi-protein complex of a cell, and relate this structure univocally to the function it performs. From what we have indicated above, it will be evident that this represents a formidable task that will mobilize the activity of thousands of laboratories worldwide for many decades. \n \n No less demanding will be the study of how novel functions and properties emerge from the dynamic web of interactions and feedbacks brought about by the molecules of a living organism. This task will require, among others, the exploitation of recently developed technologies, which allow the simultaneous analysis of the presence and amount of many different RNA or protein molecules, giving a great wealth of data often of arduous interpretation and integration.\"\n \n at; http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2002/issue3/0302p28_science_watch_falaschi.html \n \n So your \"RM from inducing a perfectly ordinary, physical change to the genome\" means nothing, because complex adaptive organismic mutations are not determined mechanically by simple molecular genetic mutations. So your your assertion that such a simple genetic change, accidentally produced, could be adaptive in one set of conditions, maladaptive in another, strictly on its own merits, no longer holds water. And neither does LD43 or anything else based upon that false, mechanical, one to one, linear, 'point-mutation' understanding of biology. As I say, I'm no biologist, but even I can understand that much.\n \n 'Nuff fer now.",

   "When I first started debating on a creation/evolution board I was ridiculed, scoffed at, laughed at and demeaned by my belief that God created the world. It was a disgusting display by a group of disgusting elitists.\n\n \n If it was as you describe, I quite agree, and for what it's worth I apologise in their stead. \n \n \nI'm not saying every darwinist is disgusting I'm just telling what I experienced. After a few weeks of that treatment I decided to educate myself a bit more. I knew ToE was wrong but I could not pinpoint why at first.\n\n \n I think you wanted it to be wrong, so you could smash it in the faces of those who had humiliated you. Perhaps, though, it would have been better to show them that evolution does not deny the existence of god, thus exposing their intolerance and hatred rather than indulging in it yourself.\n \n \nI mean I read links and stuff that said mutations were rare and natural selection was tautology, but I really didn't have anything concrete. But having a bit of a crummy health history, and overcoming it naturally, it eventually dawned on me that ToE was false because they did not believe that the environment effected the individual.\n\n \n This is a tragic misunderstanding, and one I have done my best to rectify in our recent discussions. What the ToE does say on the matter is that we can't assume all the effects environmental factors can induce in organismic development will be automagically adaptive - to be useful responses. We need to explain why some are and some aren't.\n \nI found it very strange that phenotypic plasticity was supressed....I found it very odd that no controlled experiments were done on animals interacting with their environment, \n\n But phenotypic plasticity isn't being suppressed. The salient point is, as I just said, that phenotypic plasticity isn't an answer in itself: we must still investigate the underlying mechanism that yields adaptive plasticity in some circumstances but not others. \n \n Why do street lights come on when it gets dark? The developmental plasticity answer \"Because it's dark, so they respond\" glosses over the actual mechanism and how it came to be in place. More importantly, it ignores the specificity of that mechanism, wrongly giving the impression that the street lights might be able to adaptively respond to other stimuli, like it starting to rain, or the temperature falling.\n \n \nand I found it very odd that they insisted beneficial traits had to arise randomly in just one or a few organisms -- which means that the population would basically have to start from scratch in order for that particular trait to spread throughout the population. This is ludicrous, especially considering many populations of animals are spread out across a whole country or continent.\n\n \n This is only true of bacterial populations, and it has been experimentally verified that this does, in fact, occur. In interbreeding populations things are more complicated: sexual selection often pre-empts natural selection in circumstances where a single healthy, dominant male attracts and services a large number of females. That introduces a 'choke point' where genes are much more strongly filtered than they would be otherwise, making it easier for one particular alelle to drift to fixation. All that means is that you can trace back the bulk of the current population through a single male or female ancestor at some point in the past; it doesn't imply both.\n \n The key word, though, is 'population', and how this fits in with speciation. Large interbreeding populations are, as you correctly deduce, inherently resistant to genetic fluctuation: it's nigh-on impossible for one particular alelle to become ubiquitous. However, breeding patterns in a geographically-dispersed population are rarely perfectly random: it's much more likely that members of a species in one locality will interbreed with each other, and if that pattern persists alelles can reach local saturation relatively quickly. We can see this in action in ring species; populations that have gradually spread out around some geographical feature or range: although organisms around the ring interbreed with their neighbours and have very similar phenotypes, where the ends of the ring have touched they do not interbreed, despite being geographically colocated, and the accumulated genetic and phenotypic differences are clearly detectable.\n \n This is why we observe 'punctuated equilibrium', and only rarely find the locality of speciation: evolution proceeds fastest in reproductively isolated groups, from which a much larger population may later descend.\n \n \nBut anyway, with this backdrop I decided to get even. Now that I'm much more informed I am motivated to get even. This includes posting at more than one forum.\n\n Unfortunately 'getting even' seems to have meant 'behaving equally badly and with just as little justification'.\n \nPersonally I think science should be neutral. It should not support one worldview or another.\n\n Nor does it, as I vehemently argued over the past few weeks vs Marc9000. \n \n Believing that all living creatures were created independently, and believing that they evolved from a common ancestor, are not worldviews. They are hypotheses that make physical statements about history, and only one actually fits the observable facts. By choosing to believe the former, you are deliberately extending your spiritual beliefs into areas science can make confident statements about. However, getting a bloody nose for your trouble is lamentable and speaks volumes about the characters of those you first encountered; I truly wish it had been otherwise.\n \n \nI'm sorry you are so blind you can't see it, but the following is the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Think about it....when the first healthy mother ate a crummy diet, her offspring emerged, evidently, with abnormal variations in skeletal structure. The following became worse...as did the next generation. Each generation inherited the parent's problems plus more.\n\n \n It's not necessarily about being blind, it's about judging the value of this example against the general principle you're trying to demonstrate. \n \n However, we should not ignore what is, to an extent, a very valid point you are making: here we've got a situation where malnutrition is causing physiological problems, and the malnutrition is worsening since each generation has less and less taurine to supply a foetus during gestation. It's tempting to just scoff and say 'that's not inheritance', but on the other hand one would certainly consider the passing-down of a knocked-out gene 'inheritance', yes? Even if it were detrimental rather than adaptive.\n \n The salient point here is not whether we should be calling this 'inheritance' - because when you really think long and hard about it, in a sense it is - but where it fits in an evolutionary system. After all, we 'inherit' our culture and the lessons learned by our parents; we 'inherit' their money. Yes, such characteristics are fluid and reversible, and they don't change our biological makeup, but as you rightly point out, modern organisms are more than just a bunch of genes.\n \n That said, I believe you are coming unstuck here:\n \n \nAccording to darwinists, the environment is not is not to play a role in the emergence of traits. Traits are linked to genes -- and genes are unpredictable and mutate unoriented to the environment.\n\n \n The term that's tripping you up - and I think the rest of us here too - is 'trait'. It's far, far too vague.\n \n If my parents are rich, and I stand to inherit their money, is being 'rich' a trait? Not in the biological sense - yet it certainly can influence my chances of reproduction, and potentially broaden my choices of who I reproduce with :) Being rich can also be an adaptive trait in some environments, and completely neutral in others (eg lost the middle of the desert with a suitcase full of money). Clearly, this 'trait' is not linked to genes - it may be associated with certain genes, but it's not a trait one can acquire via mutation, directed or random :)\n \n What we've got here, then, is a variable parameter 'wealth' which can be acquired and/or inherited, which can profoundly influence the fortunes of the organism in question and - indirectly - the genetic makeup of its offspring. \n \n However, it's not a parameter all organisms have in common; there are no 'wealthy' bacteria - and that's the crux of the issue: common descent implies a mechanism of developing and inheriting 'traits' that all living organisms must share. Even if other inheritance mechanisms have later stacked atop that common foundation and exerted influence over the course of events, even on occasion rendering the earlier mechanisms moot in some respects, we have to be careful not to conflate their scope and capabilities, or assume that because we see them at work in one species or genera that they must be common to all, or have always been in operation.\n \n Pottenger's cats inherited two things: a genome that was sensitive to taurine deficiency, and a taurine deficiency. The latter was, undoubtedly, acquired from/induced by the environment, and inherited by an exogenous mechanism. But it was their genome that provided the framework within which 'taurine deficiency' was an inheritable 'trait'. By way of contrast, cats can't get or inherit scurvy; their genome is not sensitive to a vitamin C deficient diet. They can't inherit scurvy (or wealth, for that matter, the efforts of certain mad old women notwithstanding), and humans can't inherit taurine deficiency. Neither species can inherit chopped-off limbs - there's just no exogenous or endogenous mechanism to transmit such a trait.\n \n When we consider the scope and capabilities of these variables - wealth, malnutrition etc - and their inheritance mechanisms, we can perceive definite limits. The cat's genome enables an inheritable and reversible trait of 'taurine deficiency', but that's pretty much as far as it goes. Malnutrition doesn't induce genetic change to fix the defective taurine-synthesising gene, any more than scurvy 'fixed' the human vit-C synthesising gene.\n \n I think it's therefore wrong to talk about Darwinists saying that 'traits are linked to genes and genes mutate unoriented to the environment' unless one is very specific about what kind of 'trait' you are talking about. In cats, for example, the whole system of sensitivity to Taurine deficiency is a genetic trait, which the environment modulates to produce the phenotypic traits of wellbeing or malnutrition. The inheritance mechanisms are hierarchical: inheriting the malnourished trait depends upon both inheriting the sensitive genome and exogenously inheriting Taurine deprivation. \n \n The reason Pottenger's cats aren't a good example in support of Lamarckism is not that it 'isn't inheritance of an acquired characteristic', but that it's a parochial, limited inheritance emergent from the interaction of genome and environment. The 'characteristic' is just a point on a line defined by the genome. Yes, the cats inherit both that 'line' and where they are upon it, but they can't budge the line.\n \n I'll have to leave it there for tonight, but I'm thinking of putting together a more detailed manifesto on evolution and adaptation (how I see it anyway) for your consideration, which I'll post in a new thread.",

This crusade you've undertaken was inspired by such thoughtless pigeonholing; let's not make it worse, eh? :)\n \n In response to the point you're making, I think you're oversimplifying quite a bit.\n \n Putting bacteria to one side for a moment and concentrating on macro species, there are countless examples of non-genetic, organismic-level adaptation. At the simplest level there's migration: finding an environment to which one is suited. But that's only one kind of behavioural adaptation; one could rattle off thousands, from elephants digging for salt to a small deer-like creature whose name escapes me eating a type of leaf that prevents the poison in its staple diet from killing it. \n \n And in terms of selection, in many species sexual selection at the organismic level is a far more powerful force than natural selection: choosing a fit and healthy mate who is clearly doing well not only selects genetic material but all the exogenous traits that organism possesses, like learned behaviour.\n \n It remains the case, however, that one set of genes - either via the set of potential phenotypes they outline or through some innate resistance or efficiency benefit they offer - can help one organism more than another. And because genes clearly do define the potential phenotypes for that organism, we have to try to understand how they have evolved.\n \n \nI can't even find that term in any of my evolutionist books. None. Not only that, but many evolutionists who debate on forums such as this have never even heard of this term. This has long been hidden and kept from view.

Pottenger's cats are an example of an environmentally cued phenotypic change - a (cough) catastrophic one.\n \n A developing organism involves a complex genome and a complex process for expressing it, yes? And the two are closely wedded. Meddling with the latter by introducing an environmental variation isn't going to just automatically result in a phenotypic change adapted to that environmental variation, is it? It might well induce phenotypic change - it might even expose an exogenous feedback/inheritance mechanism, like Pottenger's cats, but what the phenotypic change actually is will depend on the other half of the equation: the genes.\n \n So where we do see adaptive phenotypic variation - eg the butterflies we've talked about - we have to ask how it came to pass that the range of phenotypes produced are adaptive to the stimulus inducing the variation in the development process, rather than being neutral or catastrophic as so many are. What's making that difference?\n \n \nThe reality is, if a new trait shows up in one individual, the whole population would have to start over from that point. That means eventually every other creature must at some point cease to reproduce who doesn't have that mutation. This is ludicrous.\n\n \n As I said - only in bacteria.\n \n Observe the following simple example of a two-sex species. We start with a population of 10 organisms, one of which (in bold) has an adaptive trait:\n \n 0123456789\n \n Assuming that even numbers are male and odd female, we split them into breeding pairs:\n \n 01 23 45 67 89\n \n and we assume for simplicity they each have two surviving offspring, a boy and a girl. We'll also assume the adaptive trait is dominant:\n \n 01 23 45 67 89\n vv vv vv vv vv\n AB CD EF GH IJ\n \n Disallowing incest, we'll mix them up into breeding pairs again:\n \n AD BC EH FI GJ \n \n Let them breed again as before:\n \n AD BC EH FI GJ \n vv vv vv vv vv\n 01 23 45 67 89\n \n As you can see, the adaptive trait is spreading through the population, and (if cousins don't marry) will achieve fixation in two more generations without any organism ever having failed to reproduce.\n \n I know: it's totally counter-intuitive, but it's perfectly true. I'm genuinely sorry to have to yank that one out from under you.\n \n \nI agree but there's a problem with that....if you have a small group of isolated creatures, the odds of a beneficial random mutation shrink exponentially.\n\n \n Oh, absolutely - that's clear from clonal-line bacterial experiments where it takes hundreds of generations of billions of bacteria to develop an adaptive mutation. But the same is not true if you segregate a number of small populations from a large and already genetically varied population. \n \n \nAnd this does not take away from the fact that there are many animals that do, indeed, spread out over the whole country....thus for a trait to spread, the population must essentially start over from the point where the happy accident happend.\n\n \n As I've shown, that's not the case.\n \n \nConstructing a theory around a premise that material/mechanical created spiritual/mental is a scientifically-expressed worldview. Most of science does not believe the world was created purposefully as it says in the Bible, they believe that stemmed from a long string of accidents, starting with the origin of life itself. ToE is a materiast concept and it was constructed by design to be materialistic. It was not founded on neutrality or a platform of scientific truths.\n\n \n Common descent is absolutely inferred from empirical evidence. The ToE attempts to describe how that occurred. So far, we have no evidence whatsoever that organisms can direct or design mutations to suit a purpose, so right now it looks like that much is indeed out of their direct control. However, as I've explored in some depth in my debate with marc9000, it doesn't take anything out of god's hands - it just shows us what he did with them.\n \n \nI'm not sure I'm following you here....you seem to be agreeing with me. \n\n \n I pretty much am: the malnourishment was, logically, an inherited acquired characteristic. All I'm pointing out is the very limited scope of that particular inheritance 'mechanism' and its inability to actually feed anything meaningful back to the genome that enables it. It couldn't happen without that particular genome, so it's more of an emergent subcategory of inheritance.\n \n \nIf these traits were merely the effect of poor diet on the developing embryo, then the first generation of cats from mothers who were fed healthy diets should have been born healthy. (idea from WW)\n\n \n Not actually true; perhaps if the diet had been fortified with a superabundance of taurine we might have seen that, but it's likely that such taurine as was provided in the diet went straight into the depleted adult cat's system and only a little extra was passed on - with that being gradually rectified as each generation's taurine levels were replenished.\n \n \nI've run out of time at the moment...but I don't see how \"trait\" is vague at all. I'll come back later and finish up. S\n\n \n 'Trait' is vague because there's no indication of scope, or the possibility of sub-variables modulating it. We could say that being 'tall' is a trait, but in reality that's a combination of other 'traits' involving bone lengths, body proportions, posture... it's grossly imprecise.\n \n A genetic trait, for example, must logically encapsulate all the phenotypic variation that can be derived from it. That's why I describe the cat genome's sensitivity to taurine deprivation as a 'genetic trait', with the phenotypic state of the cat being a sub-variable, a point on a line.\n \n I look forward to your further thoughts, especially any re-evaluation you've done based on my demonstration that populations don't need to 'start over' for traits to spread.",

   "You are a mechanist and a geneticist/molecular biologist of some kind, are you not? So that's the position you argue from. I'm just a fairly rational non-geneticist who argues from a rational and logical standpoint, bolstered by what he can learn from the popular press. Why should I give your mechanist arguments any credit if you feel free to condescendingly and airily dismiss my rational arguments?\n\n \n You haven't made any arguments against RM that aren't abstract philosophical conjectures about 'meaning'.\n \n \nYour argument is the mechanist one that genetic changes follow a linear progression to a phenotypic change. That is, a physical change in a molecular pattern leads inevitably to a particular outcome in a complex system, in mechanical, lock-step, determinist fashion. That is the only way that a particular molecular change can lead to a particular change in the biosystem.\n\n \n Well, the outcome might not always be predictable just by looking at what the change is, but genetic engineering is based on that principle and works fairly well :)\n \n \nAnd unless that is a given, your premise that an accidental or spontaneous molecular change could directly result in an adaptive change to a complex biosystem just won't fly.\n\n \n Luckily for me:\n \n \"Thanks to the decoded genetic blueprints, seed producers can know with precision which plants carry a desired trait and which genes cause it.\"\n \n And here is an example of gene splicing yielding the same result as trial-and-error crossbreeding, with genetically identical plants yielding identical traits even though they had been derived by different methods.\n \n Your c&p description of how great complexity emerges from a surprisingly small quantity of genes is fascinating stuff, but completely beside the point. Gene splicing clearly demonstrates that one can, at least in some cases, mechanically 'bung in' a gene, or duplicate one, with regular, mechanical, even to a degree predictable phenotypic results.\n \n \nSo your \"RM from inducing a perfectly ordinary, physical change to the genome\" means nothing, because complex adaptive organismic mutations are not determined mechanically by simple molecular genetic mutations.\n\n \n Are you sure about that?\n \n Here we report that mutations in a single gene, identified as FLO11,\n separate these ''floating'' yeasts from their nonfloating relatives.\n \n Here, we link a single mutation in the coding region of a pigmentation gene to adaptive quantitative variation in the wild.\n \n The genetic tools of Escherichia coli K12 allowed us to construct isogenic strains differing only by a single mutation inactivating the mutS gene. Starting with the E. coli K12 MG1655 strain, of which the chromosomal DNA is fully sequenced, spontaneous mutants resistant to nalidixic acid (NalR) or streptomycin (StrR) were isolated.\n \n ... and so forth. These results are often confirmed by splicing the gene or alelle in question into another organism, just to make sure that trait emerges.\n \n So, let's recap. We've got single genes or alelles producing adaptive traits, RM causing mutations to genes, duplicating (amplifying) them and so on, and a yeast cell enjoying an adaptive benefit based on a single gene duplication. These are all empirically established facts.\n \n Do you still maintain the adaptive mutations in the yeast experiment physically could not have happened at random?",

So second-generation cats weren't just taurine-deprived and thus unable to fortify their bones, they were also calcium deprived during development: their mothers either didn't have or couldn't liberate calcium from their bones to assist in foetal development - in other words, calcium deficiency was a secondary, partially exogenous inherited trait.

   " I know, but I can't help but feel that's 'shooting the message' because the messenger delivered it rudely :) \n\n \n Any rude comments are generally made towards the theory. That's the nature of the beast on debate forums like this. Trust me, I've been the target of an incredible amount of personal ridicule. It goes both ways...I just direct my ridicule towards the theory I think is flawed. \n \n \n \n \n \n I've asked WW not to refer to me as 'you guys' and I'd appreciate it if you could do the same. This crusade you've undertaken was inspired by such thoughtless pigeonholing; let's not make it worse, eh? :)\n\n \n That's not an insult, it's just a short way of saying \"people who believe in ToE\". I can't promise I will discontinue this.\n \n SS: What I said is just another way of saying that beneficial traits in populations do not arise because of an adaptive response to the environment, according to you guys, selection -- and only selection -- can impart direction and can adapt an animal to its environment. This is about as plainly and simply as I can put this and I am right about it.\n \n In response to the point you're making, I think you're oversimplifying quite a bit.\n \n It's not oversimplified at all. According to you guys -- oops, sorry, ToE -- beneficial traits must pass through selection. There are no ifs ands or buts to it. They MUST. If a beneficial trait occurs that does not go through the selection process then there is a hole in the theory...which means groups of animals could all be acquiring beneficial traits in ways contrary to what ToE says. The butterflies we've talked about do this very thing: They all evolve as individuals and their traits are not formed by selection. If you want to then say some random mutations gave them this ability in the past, then fine....that's not scientifically proven to be able to happen, but at least you are admitting for the moment that a population can change beneficially without selection. And if butterflies can do it then so can mice and grasshoppers and bears and humans.\n \n \n Putting bacteria to one side for a moment and concentrating on macro species, there are countless examples of non-genetic, organismic-level adaptation. At the simplest level there's migration: finding an environment to which one is suited. But that's only one kind of behavioural adaptation; one could rattle off thousands, from elephants digging for salt to a small deer-like creature whose name escapes me eating a type of leaf that prevents the poison in its staple diet from killing it. \n \n And in terms of selection, in many species sexual selection at the organismic level is a far more powerful force than natural selection: choosing a fit and healthy mate who is clearly doing well not only selects genetic material but all the exogenous traits that organism possesses, like learned behaviour.\n \n It remains the case, however, that one set of genes - either via the set of potential phenotypes they outline or through some innate resistance or efficiency benefit they offer - can help one organism more than another. And because genes clearly do define the potential phenotypes for that organism, we have to try to understand how they have evolved..\n\n \n I don't discount behavioral adaptation or migration or sexual selection or genetic drift or any of that stuff. But ultimately, like I said, all beneficial traits must pass through natural selection. You simply cannot get around it. This is why evolutionists have long denied/ignored/hidden non-random mutations, adaptive/directed mutations, phenotypic or developmental plasticity, horizontal gene transfer, the inheritance of acquired characteristics (epigenetics), etc....it's because all of these would imply that the individual is in control of his own destiny, that populational adaptation is not necessary.\n \n Now that some of these things are coming out, darwinists are trying to incorporate them...but you can't have a population evolving a new trait over thousands of years if individuals evolve the same exact trait in just a generation -- or a few generations. It simply does not mix. You can't have both.\n \n SS: I can't even find that term in any of my evolutionist books. None. Not only that, but many evolutionists who debate on forums such as this have never even heard of this term. This has long been hidden and kept from view. Of course science knows it happens, but how have they incorporated it into ToE??? They haven't. And they certainly haven't admitted that phenotypic changes cued by the environment could be misconstued as RMNS in the field or in the fossil record. \n \n \n I obviously can't speak for the authors of any books you've read, but as to that last, I'd really like you to try to appreciate the point I've been making: it's all very well talking about the environment 'cueing' phenotypic changes, but we can't just assume the existence of an automagical system where environmental cues 'just do' result in an adaptive phenotypic change. Pottenger's cats are an example of an environmentally cued phenotypic change - a (cough) catastrophic one.\n \n A developing organism involves a complex genome and a complex process for expressing it, yes? And the two are closely wedded. Meddling with the latter by introducing an environmental variation isn't going to just automatically result in a phenotypic change adapted to that environmental variation, is it? It might well induce phenotypic change - it might even expose an exogenous feedback/inheritance mechanism, like Pottenger's cats, but what the phenotypic change actually is will depend on the other half of the equation: the genes.\n \n So where we do see adaptive phenotypic variation - eg the butterflies we've talked about - we have to ask how it came to pass that the range of phenotypes produced are adaptive to the stimulus inducing the variation in the development process, rather than being neutral or catastrophic as so many are. What's making that difference? \n\n \n The individuals in a population are all constructed in the same way. That's why when you look at a population of Monarch Butterflies they have a tendency to all look the exact same.\n \n http://www.learner.org/jnorth/images/graphics/monarch/monarch13.jpg\n \n Thus, when a new environment comes along, it will effect every creature within that population the same...which means they will all evolve at basically the same rate and speed and to the same extent. It doesn't matter if it's \"automatic\" or not...there are no guarantees of change...but like I said, since every individual is created the same as the next, the effect of the environment will be the same on each.\n \n \n SS: The reality is, if a new trait shows up in one individual, the whole population would have to start over from that point. That means eventually every other creature must at some point cease to reproduce who doesn't have that mutation. This is ludicrous. \n \n \n As I said - only in bacteria.\n \n Observe the following simple example of a two-sex species. We start with a population of 10 organisms, one of which (in bold) has an adaptive trait:\n \n 0123456789\n \n Assuming that even numbers are male and odd female, we split them into breeding pairs:\n \n 01 23 45 67 89\n \n and we assume for simplicity they each have two surviving offspring, a boy and a girl. We'll also assume the adaptive trait is dominant:\n \n 01 23 45 67 89\n vv vv vv vv vv\n AB CD EF GH IJ\n \n Disallowing incest, we'll mix them up into breeding pairs again:\n \n AD BC EH FI GJ \n \n Let them breed again as before:\n \n AD BC EH FI GJ \n vv vv vv vv vv\n 01 23 45 67 89\n \n As you can see, the adaptive trait is spreading through the population, and (if cousins don't marry) will achieve fixation in two more generations without any organism ever having failed to reproduce.\n \n I know: it's totally counter-intuitive, but it's perfectly true. I'm genuinely sorry to have to yank that one out from under you. \n\n \n Sorry I'm not following that. let's make it simple. Let's say we have a group of deer spread out over the U.S. Then one day along comes a magical mutation that makes a deer -- in Iowa, say -- larger or faster or physically superior and able to survive/reproduce better.\n \n So we've got thousands of deer spread out over the country, yet this one deer in Iowa gets lucky. It's at that point that this mutation would have to spread. That deer would breed with another deer....who knows if the offspring would emerge with that trait or not...who knows if that offspring would get run over by a car...who knows if that deer would not breed with another deer that is terribly \"unfit\". Not only that, but you still have the whole population of deer in the country continuing to breed! Even if your lucky mutation took hold, it would eventually get wattered down and washed out from all the other successful breeders.\n \n \n Of course this does not even mention the fact that there are no genetic mutations that I know of that cause animals to be larger or more physically fit. And in order for a trait to be selected it MUST be tied to a specific random genetic mutation -- a gene that is not found in the other deer. This does not happen. Traits are not linked to specific genes anymore -- traits are linked to genetic expressions.\n \n \n SS: Constructing a theory around a premise that material/mechanical created spiritual/mental is a scientifically-expressed worldview. Most of science does not believe the world was created purposefully as it says in the Bible, they believe that stemmed from a long string of accidents, starting with the origin of life itself. ToE is a materiast concept and it was constructed by design to be materialistic. It was not founded on neutrality or a platform of scientific truths.\n \n \n \nCommon descent is absolutely inferred from empirical evidence. The ToE attempts to describe how that occurred. So far, we have no evidence whatsoever that organisms can direct or design mutations to suit a purpose, so right now it looks like that much is indeed out of their direct control. However, as I've explored in some depth in my debate with marc9000, it doesn't take anything out of god's hands - it just shows us what he did with them. \n\n \n First of all that is a bum premise. Do you agree that a change in phenotype is recognized as \"evolution\" in the field or in the fossil record? If so, do you also agree that scientists can't see \"genetic mutations\" when they observe fossils? I would suggest that much of evolution has nothing to do with mutations. They do play a role, but as far as beneficial traits go, mutations are pretty much left out of a job. Mutations are destructive and degenerative and do nothing but deteriorate the genome.\n \n Lynn Margulis: \n \n Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues.\n \n Pierre Grasse:\n \n Some contemporary biologists, as soon as they observe a mutation, talk about evolution ... No matter how numerous they may be, mutations do not produce any kind of evolution.\n \n S.J. Gould:\n \n A mutation doesn't produce major new raw material. You don't make a new species by mutating the species.\n \n Fritjof Capra:\n \n A striking manifestation of genetic wholeness is the now well-documented fact that evolution did not proceed through continuous gradual changes over time, caused by long sequences of successive mutations.\n \n A.E. Wilder-Smith\n \n Mutations modify or destroy already existing genetic information, but they never create new information. They never create, for example, an entirely new biological organ such as an eye or ear. Herein lies an error of Neo-darwinism, which teaches that fundamentally new information is created by mutations.\n \n \n And I could give many more such comments. The point is that evolution cannot ride on the seat of mutations. And by the way, the actions of genes do not create morphology, they only modifiy morphology. \n \n \n Not only that but genes don't work in isolation, they work as a functioning unit.\n \n Francisco Varela\n \n The genome is not a linear array of independent genes (manifesting as traits) but a highly interwoven network of multiple reciprocal effects mediated through repressors and derepressors, exons and introns, jumping genes and even structural proteins.",

That makes perfectly rational sense, not only from metaphysical deduction, but from inductive inferences drawn from accidental changes and their effects upon every other observable productive, efficient, complex system in the physical universe. BUT since there is no empirical observation of a novel, original, genetic change that, arising by accident, resulted in an adaptive phenotypic change, you, like me, are stuck with metaphysical arguments.\n \n Except that, unlike me, you never make any logical arguments in support of your metaphysical contention. You just go on repeating it, over and over and over again, as if repetition alone would confer some kind of legitimacy upon it. It does not.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Your argument is the mechanist one that genetic changes follow a linear progression to a phenotypic change.

The fact of the matter is that genetic engineering has not always worked \"fairly well\". Sometimes, as in cloned animals, it has been as much a failure as a success.\n But in any case, intelligent design, as in bioengineering, is far more a case of teleological intelligent design, as per EAM, than your ateleological,\n 'productive organismic outcome out of complete lack of design or intention'. That is, your accidental genetic mutation linked fortuitously to accidental environmental circumstances.\n \n Once again you presume, metaphysically, that a beneficial genetic change is or can be just as unintentional and accidental as any harmful, entropic genetic change, and so you use an example of intelligent, intentional genetic changes to back up that metaphysical assertion.

The fact that human ingenuity and intention can override those natural self-regulatory systems says nothing at all about the powers of random accidents to do so, except of course, in a strictly destructive fashion.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n So your \"RM from inducing a perfectly ordinary, physical change to the genome\" means nothing, because complex adaptive organismic mutations are not determined mechanically by simple molecular genetic mutations. \n \n \n Are you sure about that?\n \n Here we report that mutations in a single gene, identified as FLO11,\n separate these ''floating'' yeasts from their nonfloating relatives.\n \n Here, we link a single mutation in the coding region of a pigmentation gene to adaptive quantitative variation in the wild.\n \n The genetic tools of Escherichia coli K12 allowed us to construct isogenic strains differing only by a single mutation inactivating the mutS gene.

I think not, and if not, they lend no aid or comfort to your premise. To the contrary. If original, adaptive organismic mutations require intelligence and volition in the genetics lab, then it is reasonable to believe that they require it in the wild as well. The only dif--in the lab it's the experimenter, in nature it's the organism.\n \n Now you may claim 'chance' production by claiming that the experimenter did not know ahead of time what result his genetic tinkering might have on the organism, but the assumption that what he did to its genome could, (and therefore, would), be done by accident, is simply that--a metaphysical assumption. \n \n \n\n So, let's recap. We've got single genes or alelles producing adaptive traits, RM causing mutations to genes, duplicating (amplifying) them and so on, and a yeast cell enjoying an adaptive benefit based on a single gene duplication. These are all empirically established facts.\n \n Do you still maintain the adaptive mutations in the yeast experiment physically could not have happened at random?\n\n \n **\n Of course!!! You have no proof whatsoever that any adaptive trait in a developed organism was the determined, linear, mechanical result of a simple chemical change in its genome, be it a complex of genes or a single point. The fact still remains,-- between the gene and its expression lies the organism itself.\n You have not shown empirically that the cellular mutation in the yeast, (or in any other instance), was accidental, because even if the actual DNA was altered accidentally, you have not shown that that accidental change led unavoidably, deterministically, to the expressed cellular/organismic trait. You have not shown that the adaptive part of the change, the part that happens at the organismic level, happened without organismic control or direction of any kind, as an uncontrollable, determined, mechanical result of the DNA change alone. This leaves you with an accidental genetic change that meant nothing, on one hand, and an adaptive organismic change, that meant something, on the other, and a great big metaphysical gap in between. A scenario in which the organism might easily be presumed to have filled that gap by using the accident to generate an intentional, adaptive organismic change. Or not. Indeed, as per my citation in my previous post, it is irrational to assume that it could have happened in any other fashion.\n \n Besides,, if accidents happen, as you claim, to all yeast genes, and it just a matter of time before each and everyone of them gets their turn, and there is no organismic control or direction wrt their expression, then why aren't such robust mutations observed to pop up all over the place in yeast populations, all the time, at the same rate as the standard genetic mutation rate? How many 'control' yeast populations in your experiment, (those not in that special contraption), also delivered themselves of that same mutation in that same length of time?",

   "BUT since there is no empirical observation of a novel, original, genetic change that, arising by accident, resulted in an adaptive phenotypic change,\n\n \n Apart from all the ones you philosophically, rather than logically, discount. You're filtering the evidence based on what you want to see. \n \n For instance, you look at a simple mutation occurring once in 140,000,000,000 cell lifetimes - an adaptation, moreover, requiring just a single duplicated gene - and just tweak EAM to fit it, despite EAM's party piece being its purported explanation of 'fast' adaptation, and your assertion that it is able to induce far-reaching genetic change in a single step.\n \n \nOnce again you presume, metaphysically, that a beneficial genetic change is or can be just as unintentional and accidental as any harmful, entropic genetic change, and so you use an example of intelligent, intentional genetic changes to back up that metaphysical assertion. Which, as you can plainly see, is just the wrongest way to go about it.\n\n \n Not at all; try as you might to drag this discussion into philosophical or metaphysical realms, genetic engineering demonstrates that genetic change on its own can confer adaptive phenotypic traits.

The link I gave where trial-and-error crossbreeding and gene splicing yielded genetically and phenotypically identical organisms proves this; it's not the how, it's the what\n \n Random mutation can cause duplication of genes. This is an empirical fact. The sequenced adaptive trait in the followup yeast experiment was the duplication of a single gene. This too is an empirical fact. Genetic engineering empirically proves that the mechanical insertion or replacement of genes also confers the adaptive phenotypic traits with which they are associated.\n \n I'm not asking you to say it was a random mutation. I'm just asking you to give up this obstinate denial that it could not have occurred at random. So far you've come up with only one explanation for why that particular gene might be immune to being duplicated by RM:\n \n \nMy point was that this does not and cannot happen by accident in complex systems that possess self-regulatory mechanisms. The fact that human ingenuity and intention can override those natural self-regulatory systems says nothing at all about the powers of random accidents to do so, except of course, in a strictly destructive fashion.\n\n \n Let's just think about that for a moment, shall we? These self regulatory mechanisms that it requires 'human ingenuity and intention' to override are so catastrophically incompetent that they are 100% effective at preventing adaptive random mutations from 'sticking', but let the destructive ones through?

I think not, and if not, they lend no aid or comfort to your premise.\n\n \n Well, actually yes they do, because they were addressed towards, and directly disprove, all the claims you've made about single mutations not causing adaptive traits; about organisms being 'too complicated' for that to happen. You were and are wrong about that.\n \n In all the words you've expended on this subject, you've still given not one reason, not one shred of logic, as to why the duplication of one particular gene should be excluded from RM's remit. Presumably, then, you're hanging your whole argument on this idea that the dna change doesn't confer the trait:\n \n \nOf course!!! You have no proof whatsoever that any adaptive trait in a developed organism was the determined, linear, mechanical result of a simple chemical change in its genome, be it a complex of genes or a single point. The fact still remains,-- between the gene and its expression lies the organism itself.\n\n \n Plenty of proof: the mechanical transplanting of genes and the consequent transfer of associated adaptive traits done on a regular basis in both genetic engineering, and in the final stages of rigorously testing whether a gene codes for a trait. I linked to several earlier.\n \n \nYou have not shown empirically that the cellular mutation in the yeast, (or in any other instance), was accidental, because even if the actual DNA was altered accidentally, you have not shown that that accidental change led unavoidably, deterministically, to the expressed cellular/organismic trait.\n\n \n I have shown precisely what you demand: that the mechanical insertion of genes can and does lead deterministically to a particular trait being expressed. As I also said, part of the experimental method of making sure that a gene is responsible for a trait is transplanting it to make sure the trait is also transferred. Guess what? It is! :)\n \n \nYou have not shown that the adaptive part of the change, the part that happens at the organismic level, happened without organismic control or direction of any kind, as an uncontrollable, determined, mechanical result of the DNA change alone.\n\n \n Yep, done that, over and over and over with several linked examples. Genetic engineering: insert gene - obtain trait. Gene/trait matching: identify putative mutation, transplant to a different organism - obtain trait. Whatever 'organismic response' translates those genes into traits, it's deterministic. And since it's deterministic, it doesn't matter how the DNA change occurs, the organism will process that DNA the same way, yielding the same trait.\n \n \nThis leaves you with an accidental genetic change that meant nothing, on one hand, and an adaptive organismic change, that meant something, on the other, and a great big metaphysical gap in between.\n\n \n Nope, we've got an accidental genetic change on one hand, which has been empirically demonstrated to deterministically yield an adaptive trait on the other (by transplanting just that gene, effectively reproducing the occurrence of that mutation, to see what happens). No metaphysical gap.\n \n \nBesides,, if accidents happen, as you claim, to all yeast genes, and it just a matter of time before each and everyone of them gets their turn, and there is no organismic control or direction wrt their expression, then why aren't such robust mutations observed to pop up all over the place in yeast populations, all the time, at the same rate as the standard genetic mutation rate How many 'control' yeast populations in your experiment, (those not in that special contraption), also delivered themselves of that same mutation in that same length of time?\n\n \n Well, let's consider that for a moment. In a different environment where that mutation is not beneficial, it would not significantly displace non-mutants or yield a macro change in nutrilite uptake - the scientists would have to physically sequence all 140,000,000,000 cells to see if the mutation had occurred.\n \n This is not a problem, as it turns out. No, really - because that's the essence of the L&D test. \n \n How do you know if a population contains mutants adapted to an environment in the absence of that environment? Easy: you grow the colony for a while in one environment and then expose it to the new environment. Measuring the overall performance of the colony (eg the uptake of a particular nutrilite), you'll see an immediate dip. Now, if the colony already contains some adaptive mutants, the dip will immediately begin to curve back up, as they outbreed the rest and come to dominate the colony, at which point you can actually put your hands on some mutants and sequence their DNA.\n \n However, if there are no pre-existing mutants, the dip will not start to curve back up until the mutation occurs. In the original L&D test that meant never, because non-mutants were killed outright by the phage, but non-fatal variations on that test are conducted routinely.\n \n You don't accept what the fluctuation test tells us, instead constructing an alternative 'just so' story that it's actually EAM intelligently mimicking the random occurrence of that mutation in the growth of a colony; as a precautionary or pre-emptive safeguard against phage - based on another 'just so' story that the bacteria were 'remembering' a prior encounter. \n \n What you've yet to explain is why the fluctuation test works with every environmental variation we ever apply - is EAM 'remembering' all those, too?\n \n In any case, it doesn't matter since I'm not shooting for you to say the mutation was a random one. I'm just asking you to be honest and admit you can't exclude the possibility of RM inducing that simple, physical duplication of a gene, which simply and physically increased the amount of an amino acid synthesised and thus helped the organism thrive in an environment where a particular nutrilite was in short supply.\n \n I'm open to the idea that adaptation sometimes is as complex as you describe, and I'm happy to talk about it. But here I've proved, with links, that single mutations can and do deterministically induce traits. And since you've made zero progress towards excluding the mutation in question from happening at random, it follows that you've made zero progress towards excluding the adaptive trait from arising at random.\n \n See you tomorrow :)",

   "It's not oversimplified at all. According to you guys -- oops, sorry, ToE -- beneficial traits must pass through selection. There are no ifs ands or buts to it. They MUST. If a beneficial trait occurs that does not go through the selection process then there is a hole in the theory...which means groups of animals could all be acquiring beneficial traits in ways contrary to what ToE says.\n\n \n Well, as my little example earlier showed, a dominant allele can spread without being adaptive - that's genetic drift.\n \n \nThe butterflies we've talked about do this very thing: They all evolve as individuals and their traits are not formed by selection. If you want to then say some random mutations gave them this ability in the past, then fine....that's not scientifically proven to be able to happen, but at least you are admitting for the moment that a population can change beneficially without selection.\n\n \n Thing is, it's no more significant than, once again, the iris closing in bright light - it's a beneficial change, sure, but it's not evolution and what's inherited is the whole rapid-response system.\n \n \nAnd if butterflies can do it then so can mice and grasshoppers and bears and humans.\n\n \n Absolutely, but only in ways their genes delineate, just like the adaptive phenotypic variations experienced by the butterflies are genetically inspired. We can build different types of muscle according to the kind of excercise we do - this is non-genetic adaptation but it's still enabled by our genome. \n \n \nBut ultimately, like I said, all beneficial traits must pass through natural selection. You simply cannot get around it.\n\n \n Er, yes, I can and have :) Sexual selection preempts natural selection; less genetically favoured offspring hardly get a chance to naturally survive or reproduce less successfully because they never even get born: the previous generation intelligently chose only the most successful-looking creatures for their mates. Nor must the direction of sexual selection even align with natural selection.\n \n \nThis is why evolutionists have long denied/ignored/hidden <snip< it's because all of these would imply that the individual is in control of his own destiny, that populational adaptation is not necessary.\n\n \n No, this is why, as I keep saying, your strawman version of the ToE is so woefully inaccurate. \n \n \nNow that some of these things are coming out, darwinists are trying to incorporate them...but you can't have a population evolving a new trait over thousands of years if individuals evolve the same exact trait in just a generation -- or a few generations. It simply does not mix. You can't have both.\n\n \n You can if the 'quick' adaptation isn't evolution - which in the case of the butterflies it isn't, any more than the iris 'evolves' shut in bright light. It's a slowly-evolved fast-response mechanism.\n \n \nThe individuals in a population are all constructed in the same way. That's why when you look at a population of Monarch Butterflies they have a tendency to all look the exact same.\n\n \n I'd be willing to bet nobody's actually examined every Monarch butterfly to check whether they're all exactly the same. Looking grossly similar is no indication.\n \n \nSorry I'm not following that. let's make it simple. Let's say we have a group of deer spread out over the U.S. Then one day along comes a magical mutation that makes a deer -- in Iowa, say -- larger or faster or physically superior and able to survive/reproduce better.\n\n \n Ok, let's run with that. Deer reproductive patterns are highly bottlenecked: one male rounds up and mates with a herd of females, and will pass any dominant genes on to all the offspring, male and female. So in one generation there's a big increase in the number of mutation-carrying deer in the population (here, 1's and A's are breeding males, all other numbers and letters are females:\n \n 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890\n vvvvvvvvvv\n AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF\n \n Young males are excluded from the herd as they approach maturity, live in roaming batchelor herds, and will fight and compete with each other and with established males to attract breeding herds of their own. So not only will the roaming male offspring of our mutation-bearing ancestor carry his genes into new territory, so will female bearers of those genes attracted into neighbouring territories:\n \n 12346890BCEF 1246790BEF 12356890BCDEF 1235789BCDEF\n \n Again, we've not really invoked his 'adaptation' to achieve much except give him a bit of an edge; genes generally tend to spread around and intermingle just based on breeding patterns. Of course, other variants are doing the same; NS just tips the balance one way or the other.\n \n \nOf course this does not even mention the fact that there are no genetic mutations that I know of that cause animals to be larger or more physically fit. And in order for a trait to be selected it MUST be tied to a specific random genetic mutation -- a gene that is not found in the other deer. This does not happen. Traits are not linked to specific genes anymore -- traits are linked to genetic expressions.\n\n \n 'Larger' or 'more physically fit' is a bit of an oversimplification; why not 'resistant to a disease' or 'produces more of a particular enzyme, thus deriving more nutriment from a particular source'?\n \n But even if we focus on epigenetically inherited traits, as you request, we're still forced to rely upon inheritance, and thus breeding patterns/NS, to cause those traits to proliferate. There's no evidence of widespread, simultaneous adaptive evolution - again, the butterflies are not 'evolving' their seasonal colouring back and forth from one season to the next: the 'evolved trait' is the sensitivity to that particular variation. I'm sure you can see that it would be very, very unlikely that genuine evolutionary change would yield the exact same response across the whole population, in every spring, every summer etc etc, year after year.\n \n \n Mutations are destructive and degenerative and do nothing but deteriorate the genome.\n\n \n Except, of course, when they don't :) See my parallel argument with WW for directly sequenced examples, and consider how Genetic Engineering demonstrates that transferring genes transfers adaptive traits.\n \n As to the quotes you give, it would be easier to understand their context if it was supplied. I'd be happy to go through them and see what the thrust of the argument was in each case. Only this one:\n \n \nA.E. Wilder-Smith\n \n Mutations modify or destroy already existing genetic information, but they never create new information. They never create, for example, an entirely new biological organ such as an eye or ear. Herein lies an error of Neo-darwinism, which teaches that fundamentally new information is created by mutations.\n\n \n strikes me as fundamentally barmy, or an outright lie. Not creating an eye or an ear in one go does not mean mutations don't create information: mutations can both duplicate genes and modify them; just based on that alone one could take the word 'hello' and construct from it, via intermediate stages, a long meaningful sentence. It would take a long time, but time we got :)\n \n \nNot only that but genes don't work in isolation, they work as a functioning unit.\n \n Francisco Varela\n \n The genome is not a linear array of independent genes (manifesting as traits) but a highly interwoven network of multiple reciprocal effects mediated through repressors and derepressors, exons and introns, jumping genes and even structural proteins.\n\n \n Oh, of course - but that doesn't preclude an evolutionary history where that interdependence and complexity has formed gradually rather than having always existed.",

You're filtering the evidence based on what you want to see. \n\n \n **\n Ho hum. What's the difference bertween philosophically and logically, in your world. UI've shown rationally and with logic so flawless that you don't even arttempt to challenge it, that adaptive phenotypic mutations are not, because they cannot be, the direct, mechanical, linear result of an accidental genetic mutation. You do nothng but repeat the vacuous assertion that they 'can so'. It's really tiresome to listen to. If anyone is \"filtering the evidence based on what [they] want to see\", from LD43 on up, it's you, not me.\n You apparently still believe that accelerated mutation rates are not a self-generated organismic survival device, but simply accelerated entropic system failure. You seem also to believe that 'mutator' genes, and the strong differential rates between some genes compared to others, is just some mindless accident, some quirk of fate. Even in bacteria, modern biology has shown that their exists a developmental state, a 'stationary-phase', out of which cell division and mutation arises. Even at the most simplistic mechanical level you can reduce life to, by pretending that eubacteria operate as single cells, which is manifestly untrue, there is none of your direct, one to one, 'linear DNA change--< cellular change' assumption in evidence. Your next step is to try it on viruses and prions. To say nothing of all the generated activity that multi-cellular organisms engage in between a genetic change and a phenotypic change. \n You still think that an accidental change, an entropic event at the genotype level, can, all on its own, unaided and unconstrained, lead inevitably to an adaptive phenotypic event. There is still no rational and logical basis on which to believe that any such thing is possible. Only the contrary is logical. \n And so you go on repeating your claim in positive terms without proving it logically or demonstrating it empirically, all the while accusing me of failing to do the impossible, i.e., prove a negative premise. The onus is always on he who asserts the positive premise, in this case, that adaptive phenotypic mutations occur in organisms as a direct, inescapable and unmitigated (uncontrolled and undirected) result of a purely chance accident at its genetic level, or that of its parent organism. Until you do prove that premise, you have nothing buit a philosophically filtered view of reality.\n \n \n\n For instance, you look at a simple mutation occurring once in 140,000,000,000 cell lifetimes - an adaptation, moreover, requiring just a single duplicated gene - and just tweak EAM to fit it, despite EAM's party piece being its purported explanation of 'fast' adaptation, and your assertion that it is able to induce far-reaching genetic change in a single step.\n\n \n **\n What's this \"tweak\" refer to? I've never said that EAM was so simplistic as to, \" induce far-reaching genetic change in a single step\"--that's your 'happy chance' premise, and nothing like EAM, which requires complex action to generate complex changes in complex systems. Which would apply to all living cells, including yeast cells, and yeast cell development.\n \n As to whether the adaptation was comparitively fast, as opposed to magically instantaneous, that comparison is there to be made with respect to the experiment's 'control' yeast populations. How many generations did it take them to cough up this same genetic and cellular mutation? It should have taken them the exact same number of generations as the yeasts in the contraption, if your 'pure chance' premise is correct. Did it? Or did somebody forget that scientific experiments require controls, and decide to just play another statistical game, like LD43??\n \n Quote:\n Once again you presume, metaphysically, that a beneficial genetic change is or can be just as unintentional and accidental as any harmful, entropic genetic change, and so you use an example of intelligent, intentional genetic changes to back up that metaphysical assertion. Which, as you can plainly see, is just the wrongest way to go about it. \n \n \n Not at all; try as you might to drag this discussion into philosophical or metaphysical realms, genetic engineering demonstrates that genetic change on its own can confer adaptive phenotypic traits. This empirically disposes of your argument that the physical DNA change itself is somehow irrelevant or 'not enough'.[/quote]\n \n **\n Oh for Pete's sake!! The argument is that random genetic accidents derived from pure chance and entropy cannot \"confer adaptive phenotypic traits\" on complex organisms--NOT that highly intelligent, highly trained, and highly motivated genetic engineers cannot do so! What in the world are you on about?!? \n And in what instance did a genetic engineer, without inserting a gene from say, a fish into a tomato, something which nature cannot do, (as I have been told by electrolyte, et al, that lateral gene transfer does not apply to anything above the protist level), ever generate an adaptive change in an organism?\n And if you think that simply inserting that foreign gene into the passive recipient was all there was to it, or that the change induced was truly adaptive in the organism's terms and not ours, then I challenge you to provide a case of genetically engineered organisms that are, on their own terms, truly better off in a natural ecosytem, thanks to the artificial tinkering.\n \n So far all you've shown is that changing genes changes organisms, and that is not the issue, and never was the issue.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I repeat--where is the 'random accident' of your postulate involved in this gene-splicing? \n \n \n If intentional, exogenous duplication of a gene can confer the trait, there's no reason why the random occurrence of same would not induce the same trait. The link I gave where trial-and-error crossbreeding and gene splicing yielded genetically and phenotypically identical organisms proves this; it's not the how, it's the what.\n\n \n **\n OTC--it's not the 'what', it's the 'how', that is the issue before us.\n \n \n\n Random mutation can cause duplication of genes. This is an empirical fact.\n\n \n **\n The only 'fact' is that 'gene duplication happens'. You assume that it happens by accident, and only by accident. Neither assumption has any empirical\n support. Even if it could be proven that, in nature, gene duplications arise by pure chance, that would still not negate the opposing premise that they also arise by organismic action. Therefore a finding of gene duplication, per se, does not decide the cause of its existence.\n \n \n\n The sequenced adaptive trait in the followup yeast experiment was the duplication of a single gene. This too is an empirical fact.\n\n \n **\n Not in the least. The \"adaptive trait\" in the organism is something entirely distinct from any gene, duplicated or otherwise. They simply are not the same things. You meant to say, I'm sure, that the efficient cause of a newly developed adaptive trait in the yeast cell was the direct, linear, inevitable and thus pre-determined result of a biochemical change in the writing of its parent's original inheritance information. But you do nothing to prove this mechanical linearity in a non-linear, self-organizing system like a yeast cell.\n \n \n\n Genetic engineering empirically proves that the mechanical insertion or replacement of genes also confers the adaptive phenotypic traits with which they are associated.\n\n \n **\n I've already spoken to genetic engineering, above.\n \n \n\n I'm not asking you to say it was a random mutation. I'm just asking you to give up this obstinate denial that it could not have occurred at random. So far you've come up with only one explanation for why that particular gene might be immune to being duplicated by RM:\n\n \n **\n Once again, the onus is not on me to prove a negative. I have proven, logically and rationally, the positive premise that increased productivity and efficiency wrt the goal achievement of complex biosystems requires teleological input. You have not even attempted to prove, logically and rationally, that simple entropic accident can accomplish the same thing, ateleologically. You simply repeat that bald assertyion, if you'll excuse the expression, ad nauseum.\n Empirically, I have pointed out that nowhere in the universe is there any complex system that generates a non-entropic product that, as a result of a random/accidental/entropic change in its infrastructure, increases the level of efficiency and productivity with which it generates that non-entropic outcome.\n With both logic and empirical observation dead set against you, you simply carry on as usual, over and over again.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n My point was that this does not and cannot happen by accident in complex systems that possess self-regulatory mechanisms. The fact that human ingenuity and intention can override those natural self-regulatory systems says nothing at all about the powers of random accidents to do so, except of course, in a strictly destructive fashion. \n \n \n Let's just think about that for a moment, shall we? These self regulatory mechanisms that it requires 'human ingenuity and intention' to override are so catastrophically incompetent that they are 100% effective at preventing adaptive random mutations from 'sticking', but let the destructive ones through? Pull the other one, WW \n\n \n **\n No idea what you're trying to say. If you cannot see that an entropic accident in a complex system is not a matter of 'letting something novel \"get through\"', but merely a matter of preventing something previous from \"getting through\", (namely an inherited adaptive/productive trait), then what can I say? Throwing a rock through the screen on my monitor will let entropy 'get through', because there isn't a whole hell of a lot that my monitor can do about the wreckage.

You were and are wrong about that.\n\n \n **\n So you keep saying, without ever attempting to justify that opinion.\n \n \n\n In all the words you've expended on this subject, you've still given not one reason, not one shred of logic, as to why the duplication of one particular gene should be excluded from RM's remit.\n\n \n **\n The issue is not, and never has been, what can happen to a DNA sequence, intentionally or by accident. The issue is, and always has been, the cause of adaptive trait mutations at the organismic, phenotypic level. Whether or not such changes in organisms are directly caused by accidental molecular events, or are directed and informed by internal organismic controls. You assume that there is a direct, linear, biochemically determined mechanical process leading from a change in a certain molecule to a systemic change in a complex system. You never try to prove it; you take your assumption for fact.\n \n \n\n Presumably, then, you're hanging your whole argument on this idea that the dna change doesn't confer the trait:\n\n \n **\n My argument is that dna alone does not confer traits.\n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n Of course!!!

One gene can create different traits in different organisms, and more than one gene can produce a trait in the same organism, and on and on. That is because the organism has some control over genes; that is, organisms are not the helpless, hapless playthings of bits of dna.\n The issue is, what creates a certain configuration of dna 'code' for this or that 'trait', and what is the chain of events between something writing a code in dna for an organismic trait, and the interpretaion of the 'code' in the dna to enable, or as you seem to believe, force, another organism reconstruct what was intended, or not. It is quite interesting that when genetic engineers insert or delete a genes in a developing organism they get one thing, but when that altered organism self-reproduces, its offspring do not mechanically follow in genetic lock-step, as far as the expressed trait is concerned. Less so and less so in ensuing generations. Or so I've been told.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You have not shown empirically that the cellular mutation in the yeast, (or in any other instance), was accidental, because even if the actual DNA was altered accidentally, you have not shown that that accidental change led unavoidably, deterministically, to the expressed cellular/organismic trait. \n \n \n I have shown precisely what you demand: that the mechanical insertion of genes can and does lead deterministically to a particular trait being expressed. \n\n \n **\n You have shown that in a given instance an artificial re-write of the genetic code produces a different reading expressed as a different trait.

The issue is not so much what happens when pre-written, pre-packaged genes are inserted here or there, but how the new ones get written in the first place, and what editing process they go through before they set in motion a complex chain of events in development that ends in the expression of the trait they signify. So lets let genetic engineering go and concentrate on natural behaviours of natural organisms behaving naturally.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n This leaves you with an accidental genetic change that meant nothing, on one hand, and an adaptive organismic change, that meant something, on the other, and a great big metaphysical gap in between. \n \n \n Nope, we've got an accidental genetic change on one hand, which has been empirically demonstrated to deterministically yield an adaptive trait on the other (by transplanting just that gene, effectively reproducing the occurrence of that mutation, to see what happens).

At least in any other organism sufficiently similar so that it can be expressed in similar fashion. The issue here is, how did a certain, novel trait get to be coded, dna fashion, in the first place. You say it all happens by accident. That the code isn't written, it just sort of 'falls together' fortuitously.

In a different environment where that mutation is not beneficial, it would not significantly displace non-mutants or yield a macro change in nutrilite uptake - the scientists would have to physically sequence all 140,000,000,000 cells to see if the mutation had occurred.\n \n This is not a problem, as it turns out.

Easy: you grow the colony for a while in one environment and then expose it to the new environment.

However, if there are no pre-existing mutants, the dip will not start to curve back up until the mutation occurs.

All you show here is that a maladapted population can become better adapted over time. That was never the issue.\n \n \n\n You don't accept what the fluctuation test tells us, instead constructing an alternative 'just so' story that it's actually EAM intelligently mimicking the random occurrence of that mutation in the growth of a colony; as a precautionary or pre-emptive safeguard against phage - based on another 'just so' story that the bacteria were 'remembering' a prior encounter. \n\n \n **\n Yeah, right. Immune reponses and revertant mutations are 'just so' stories. It's not a 'just so' story to say that e.coli. have survived for millions of years because by pure chance phage resistance just keeps on popping up in their colonies, over and over and over again. Excuse my chuckles.\n \n \n\n What you've yet to explain is why the fluctuation test works with every environmental variation we ever apply - is EAM 'remembering' all those, too?\n\n \n **\n Maybe if it \"works\" (whatever that means) no matter what, then it's just meaningless assumptions based upon statistical similarities? And it isn't EAM remembering anything--it's organisms that do that, not abstractions. And if you deny that organisms 'remember' things, than what is organismic inheritance, including both genetic and epigenetic inheritance?\n \n As to the 'fluctuation test', I've shown why it proves nothing but how keen darwinists are to accept anything they think can somehow support their irrational contention that chance generates productivity and efficiency in complex biosystems.\n \n \n\n In any case, it doesn't matter since I'm not shooting for you to say the mutation was a random one. I'm just asking you to be honest and admit you can't exclude the possibility of RM inducing that simple, physical duplication of a gene, which simply and physically increased the amount of an amino acid synthesised and thus helped the organism thrive in an environment where a particular nutrilite was in short supply.\n\n \n **\n Not being a microbiologist I'm not party to the latest news wrt how plasmid genes are controlled by eubacteria cells in terms of expression, depression, repression, or whatever the terms. And I do not know how individual cells are controlled and directed by the colony as a collective entity. So I simply do not know, empirically, if that particular gene duplication was entropic (accidental) or teleological (organismically intentional). BUT neither do you!!\n \n However, living in a rational universe and no great fan of 'magick', I know from reason and rational thought that the notion that vital operations in complex systems, even eubacteria cells, arise by 'spontaneous generation' and pure luck, is more akin to superstition than to science. And so I am forced by reason and logic to believe that the genetic change AND the subsequent biochemical operations that follow developmentally in the new cell, (as mechanical as they may be now, after a trillion generations of refinement), never originated in e.coli. by sheer chance.",

   "SS: It's not oversimplified at all. According to you guys -- oops, sorry, ToE -- beneficial traits must pass through selection. There are no ifs ands or buts to it. They MUST. If a beneficial trait occurs that does not go through the selection process then there is a hole in the theory...which means groups of animals could all be acquiring beneficial traits in ways contrary to what ToE says.\n \n \n Well, as my little example earlier showed, a dominant allele can spread without being adaptive - that's genetic drift. \n\n \n oops...that's where your argument cracks....genetic drift plays no role in beneficial traits.\n \n \n \n \n Thing is, it's no more significant than, once again, the iris closing in bright light - it's a beneficial change, sure, but it's not evolution and what's inherited is the whole rapid-response system. \n\n \n Peeling, I've got you on the ropes, brother.....are you truly trying to tell me that when a population changes traits -- traits of which are beneficial to the population, traits that could be misconstrued as evolution -- are not really evolution???????????? I agree! that's what I've been telling you. Evolution is mostly an illusion...it mostly happens like this example with the butterflies: it's not really evolution at all -- it's merely the illusion of evolution. Your contention that the genome has to change in order for a population to \"evolve\" new, beneficial traits is a fairytale born in an evolutionist book! It's simply not true. \n \n And if butterflies can do it then so can mice and grasshoppers and bears and humans. \n \n \n Absolutely, but only in ways their genes delineate, just like the adaptive phenotypic variations experienced by the butterflies are genetically inspired. We can build different types of muscle according to the kind of excercise we do - this is non-genetic adaptation but it's still enabled by our genome. \n\n \n Thank you. I see we are getting somewhere. Now...hold that thought, and now think of the fossil record. If it can happen in humans just like it happened butterflies -- that the environment cues genetic/phenotypic expression then on what basis can scientists make evolutionary/hereditary assumptions? If physiological differences are dictated by the interaction between organism and environment, then the fossil record is not an indication of \"evolution\"....ie changes in genes. It's more like what you said above: \"it's not evolution at all.\" When scientists dig up fossils or observe changes in populations in the field they just generally assume that RMNS happened to form these changes.......but we are now learning that this is a false assumption...and thus, all molecular assumptions and supposed relationships/phylogenetic trees must be discarded.\n \n \n \n \n Er, yes, I can and have :) Sexual selection preempts natural selection; less genetically favoured offspring hardly get a chance to naturally survive or reproduce less successfully because they never even get born: the previous generation intelligently chose only the most successful-looking creatures for their mates. Nor must the direction of sexual selection even align with natural selection. \n\n \n Yes but sexual selection operates just like natural selection on the individual level, it is a stablizer, not a creator. Animals have an amazing ability to \"select\" a mate...and they select mates that are \"stable\"...they don't select freaks or runts. They select the bold and the beautiful, the best representatives of a population. This is not an accident...I'm amazed evolutionists admit to this because this requires some degree of decision making or, gasp -- intelligence. But this does not take away from the fact that in order for a beneficial trait to spread through the population it must go through the selection process. Even with sexual selection, the reality is the same: offspring must pass through selection.\n \n SS: This is why evolutionists have long denied/ignored/hidden <snip< it's because all of these would imply that the individual is in control of his own destiny, that populational adaptation is not necessary. \n \n \n No, this is why, as I keep saying, your strawman version of the ToE is so woefully inaccurate. \n\n \n sigh......please, when you get a chance, read through this article. It's from a molecular lab and they are telling the reader that they have had tremendous success with \"biased\" variation. Not only that but they tell the reader that the \"new\" theory of evolution is nothing like what darwin or neo-darwinists envisioned. Not only that, but the object of selection is the population. Do you know what that means? It means since the individual is not the object of selection, ie....since selection no longer adapts individual organisms because they adapt themselves....that selection is now between groups.\n \n Please tell me, Peeling....what is the object of selection in your view?\n \n http://www.molevol.org/camel/projects/synthesis/\n \n \n \n \n \n Ok, let's run with that. Deer reproductive patterns are highly bottlenecked: one male rounds up and mates with a herd of females, and will pass any dominant genes on to all the offspring, male and female. So in one generation there's a big increase in the number of mutation-carrying deer in the population (here, 1's and A's are breeding males, all other numbers and letters are females:\n \n 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890\n vvvvvvvvvv\n AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF AAAAABCDEF\n \n Young males are excluded from the herd as they approach maturity, live in roaming batchelor herds, and will fight and compete with each other and with established males to attract breeding herds of their own. So not only will the roaming male offspring of our mutation-bearing ancestor carry his genes into new territory, so will female bearers of those genes attracted into neighbouring territories:\n \n 12346890BCEF 1246790BEF 12356890BCDEF 1235789BCDEF \n\n \n Fine....It doesn't matter. I realize you have a plan for making it happen quickly, but that does not stop the fact that the population must start over from wherever the mutation initially happened.....(this, of course, is assuming that there's such thing as a mutation that causes new, beneficial body parts.)\n \n And your fatal flaw in all that is, when new animals spread out over a countryside they are likely to encounter new and different environments from the location where the mutation originally happened! Not only that, but darwinists tell us that evolution is a very slow process -- thousands, millions of years -- well heck....how many times might the environment change in a million years? 50? 100? 1000? 10,000? who knows? The environment can change in numerous ways -- not just weather or temperature, but predators, diet, new competition, migration/disappearance of prey -- man the list goes on and on. Your beneficial random mutations simply cannot keep up because they happen so unusually -- and you are at their mercy.",

   "I've shown rationally and with logic so flawless that you don't even arttempt to challenge it, that adaptive phenotypic mutations are not, because they cannot be, the direct, mechanical, linear result of an accidental genetic mutation.\n\n \n You've shown no such thing at all, WW, not even slightly.\n \n On the contrary, I've shown empirically that if one transplants a gene identified as conferring a particular trait to a different organism, the trait is also conferred. This proves a deterministic link between the presence of the gene and the trait: it doesn't matter how the gene got there, the trait will arise.\n \n \nYou still think that an accidental change, an entropic event at the genotype level, can, all on its own, unaided and unconstrained, lead inevitably to an adaptive phenotypic event. There is still no rational and logical basis on which to believe that any such thing is possible.\n\n Of course there is. If it can be shown that random mutation can duplicate genes, and that duplicating the gene - by whatever method - imparts an adaptive trait, then logically and rationally random mutation can generate that adaptive trait. It's perfectly straightforward.\n \nWhat's this \"tweak\" refer to? I've never said that EAM was so simplistic as to, \" induce far-reaching genetic change in a single step\"--that's your 'happy chance' premise,\n\n I beg to differ:\n \nThat is, neo-lamarkism can account for the punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record that is reasonably impossible under \"RM+NS\". Much more robust and radical changes are permissable when self-directed to suit a certain environmental situation, than could ever occur by chance and without regard to the environment.\n\n And in this thread:\n \nWell, if you cannot see for yourself that complex systems, where every part must function in concert with every other part for the good of the whole, cannot have their function and efficiency enhanced by any accidental breakdowns/changes in any of their parts, then of course we can only agree to disagree.\n\n Traits arising via a single mutation, and transferred by gene splicing shows that to be a fallacy. Traits can be deterministically induced by a single mutation - in the case in question a duplication - and it doesn't matter how that happens.\n \nHow many generations did it take them to cough up this same genetic and cellular mutation? It should have taken them the exact same number of generations as the yeasts in the contraption, if your 'pure chance' premise is correct.\n\n Really? Does it take the 'exact same' number of dice rolls to show a six, every time? :)\n \nOh for Pete's sake!! The argument is that random genetic accidents derived from pure chance and entropy cannot \"confer adaptive phenotypic traits\" on complex organisms--NOT that highly intelligent, highly trained, and highly motivated genetic engineers cannot do so! What in the world are you on about?!?\n\n As one of the links I gave you showed, it doesn't matter how the gene gets there, the effect is the same: trial-and-error crossbreeding vs gene splicing produced genetically and phenotypically identical organisms.\n \nI challenge you to provide a case of genetically engineered organisms that are, on their own terms, truly better off in a natural ecosytem, thanks to the artificial tinkering.\n\n Same link, I believe. Transplanting the gene made the recipient organism resistant to blight.\n \nSo far all you've shown is that changing genes changes organisms, and that is not the issue, and never was the issue.\n\n On the contrary, that has been the issue all along - your contention has been that RM can't induce adaptive traits because it requires more than just a DNA change for a new trait to deterministically arise. I've shown that to be false. Ergo, the question reduces to 'is it possible for RM to produce that genetic change?'\n \nYou meant to say, I'm sure, that the efficient cause of a newly developed adaptive trait in the yeast cell was the direct, linear, inevitable and thus pre-determined result of a biochemical change in the writing of its parent's original inheritance information. But you do nothing to prove this mechanical linearity in a non-linear, self-organizing system like a yeast cell.\n\n Apart from inserting that gene into a different yeast cell and observing the same adaptive trait, you mean? :)\n \nEmpirically, I have pointed out that nowhere in the universe is there any complex system that generates a non-entropic product that, as a result of a random/accidental/entropic change in its infrastructure, increases the level of efficiency and productivity with which it generates that non-entropic outcome.\n\n And, once again, I remind you that that is your interpretation of the evidence, not the evidence itself. If in reality I am correct about these mutations being random and adaptive, then the world is full of empirical evidence of complex systems increasing their efficiency etc via RM.\n \n What's interesting is that when I point out the many man-made complex systems in which RM is leveraged to increase efficiency, you say that doesn't count because the subsequent selection process is intelligent. But the fact that the most efficient randomly-permuted design is being intelligently chosen and replicated doesn't change the fact that it is more efficient than its predecessor and that the change that made it so was random!\n \n \nNo idea what you're trying to say. If you cannot see that an entropic accident in a complex system is not a matter of 'letting something novel \"get through\"', but merely a matter of preventing something previous from \"getting through\",\n\n \n Ah ah ah, that's not what you said. You said that a self-regulating system would not allow the specific mutation we were talking about - a gene duplication that happened to be adaptive - occur at random. But that same system, good though it is, demonstrably does allow the 'leak through' of all kinds of random mutations, including duplications. So what you're asking me to believe is that it makes a special and successful effort to prevent all adaptive mutations but doesn't try quite so hard with the destructive ones. Sorry; I don't buy it.\n \n \nThe issue is not, and never has been, what can happen to a DNA sequence, intentionally or by accident. The issue is, and always has been, the cause of adaptive trait mutations at the organismic, phenotypic level.\n\n \n No: both are the issue. From your attempt to distance yourself from the former I'm assuming you've got nothing to back up your assertion that the particular genetic change in question could not happen at random - now you're trying to say that even if it did, it wouldn't cause the adaptive trait.\n \n So at what stage, do you think, would the random origin of that DNA change induce a different result from an identical gene-spliced DNA change? You're suggesting perhaps that one would simply not produce the extra aphtase? Or that the organism would eschew taking advantage of the extra aphtase because it didn't come with a science-lab 'GM modified' sticker? :)\n \n Sorry for being facaetious, but it seems to me that if an organism can't distinguish between a mutation arising within itself, one inherited via crossbreeding, and one that has been forcibly inserted by scientists rummaging through its genetic top drawer, it's not likely to turn its nose up at a mutation that occurs at random, either :)\n \n \nOf course genes, 'code for traits'. That is what they are for. However, there is not a linear, 1 gene to 1 protein pathway. One gene can create different traits in different organisms, and more than one gene can produce a trait in the same organism, and on and on. That is because the organism has some control over genes; that is, organisms are not the helpless, hapless playthings of bits of dna.\n\n Oh, absolutely, but that's entirely beside the point. However an organism leverages the information in its genome, the raw material it has to work with is still what's in the genome, not how it got there.\n \nThat is your assumption, but you have not demonstrated that the organism must process the same dna info into the same trait regardless of the needs of the organism wrt environmental circumstances.\n\n And if you think about it, nor do I need to. Perhaps the organism is deterministically forced into exhibiting a particular trait regardless of the environment. Perhaps there will be phenotypic variations in other environments - it really doesn't make any difference to our assessment that the genetic change was both necessary and sufficient (gene splicing being the conclusive proof) We're still left with a single fundamental question: could that genetic change have occurred at random?\n \n \nAs far as genetic engineering is concerned, if a certain gene is written as instructions to a certain trait, then it should reproduce that trait. The issue is not so much what happens when pre-written, pre-packaged genes are inserted here or there, but how the new ones get written in the first place, and what editing process they go through before they set in motion a complex chain of events in development that ends in the expression of the trait they signify. So lets let genetic engineering go and concentrate on natural behaviours of natural organisms behaving naturally.\n\n \n No, let's not :) The adaptive trait in question was induced by the duplication of an existing gene. Now you're trying to say the issue isn't 'what happens when genes get inserted/duplicated but how new ones get written'. Sorry; in this case the issue very much is whether RM could have duplicated that gene, because if it can, then RM can induce adaptive traits.\n \n \nSure, once you get a gene that does a certain thing that favours an organism, why wouldn't it favour, in like fashion, every other like organism? At least in any other organism sufficiently similar so that it can be expressed in similar fashion. The issue here is, how did a certain, novel trait get to be coded, dna fashion, in the first place. You say it all happens by accident. That the code isn't written, it just sort of 'falls together' fortuitously. That is a metaphysical assertion, and it strikes me as an irrational one, and certainly unworthy of a scientific mechanism.\n\n \n Excellent :) So if a gene can favour other like organisms (as gene splicing proves) regardless of how it gets there, then it doesn't matter if it gets there via random mutation instead, does it? A random duplication of a gene will lead to the same beneficial trait as an intentionally, endogenously duplicated, or intentionally, exogenously amplified gene, yes? As I've said all along, the only salient question is: can RM duplicate that gene?\n \n And I'm not, in fact, saying that 'it all happens by accident'. All I'm asking for is the perfectly reasonable concession that we cannot exclude RM from producing adaptive mutations once in a while. I promise, I'm not going to go parading this concession around, or falsely trumpeting it as the death-knell of EAM; I'm quite aware it's nothing of the sort. I just want to be able to know, when we're discussing EAM or any other evolutionary proposition, that our reasoning is going to be based on some kind of common logical ground.\n \nIf the L&D43 test is repeated many times, and gives the same result every time, then guess what--you've got mechanism, not random causation and 'chance' outcomes.\n\n As I recall, you complained many moons ago that RM+NS was not testable or repeatable, so it didn't count as science. So I show you an experiment yielding repeatable, testable results and you're still not happy. I truly, seriously believe we would have a much better time together if you would take an hour or two to familiarise yourself with the basics of statistics :)\n \n The L&D experiment shows a distribution of results mathematically congruent with the mutation being a finitely improbable chance event during cell division. It shows such a distribution of results every time you repeat the experiment. The actual values will differ, because they're random, but the distribution of those values indicates the same underlying chance per cell division.\n \n \nGood gravy, man. All you show here is that a maladapted population can become better adapted over time. That was never the issue.\n\n \n With respect, these repeatable results show that the mutations occur irrespective of whether the environment to which they are adaptive is actually present - which is what you asked me to show. Immediate exposure of initially non-adapted population to new environment = long delay before adaptation arises. Allow that same delay to occur, and cells to divide a similar number of times, before imposing the new environment instead, and in a predictable proportion of cases some adapted cells will already exist. QED.\n \n \nYeah, right. Immune reponses and revertant mutations are 'just so' stories. It's not a 'just so' story to say that e.coli. have survived for millions of years because by pure chance phage resistance just keeps on popping up in their colonies, over and over and over again.\n\n \n Well, for a start off that phage only exploits one particular receptor, so it's a 'just so' story to postulate that that same receptor was even there millions of years ago. \n \nAnd if you deny that organisms 'remember' things, than what is organismic inheritance, including both genetic and epigenetic inheritance?\n\n There's nowhere for the bacteria to 'remember' that trait if it doesn't possess it. Again, we're in the realms of 'must have' because the alternative isn't to your liking. The empirical facts are that the mutation arises in a random distribution, during cell division, just like other random mutations arising from duplication error. It's an even simpler mutation than the yeast one we've been discussing. We have something that looks, and quacks, exactly like a random mutation - if you have some reason to believe it's not, please share it with me! Surely a precautionary, intelligent mutation on the part of the colony would arise, like cell differentiation in a foetus, in a slightly more regular manner, for example.\n \nSo I simply do not know, empirically, if that particular gene duplication was entropic (accidental) or teleological (organismically intentional). BUT neither do you!!\n\n The point is, if we can't exclude random mutation, then we ought to see teleological mutations and random ones - even if we can't distinguish which has occurred in any one instance, we should see numerically more of them than we could reasonably expect from RM, yes?\n \n But if the mutation occurs in a random distribution at a rate congruent with duplication error, where are the extra teleological ones?",

How do you explain that change of organismic function empirically, since the actual 'bits of stuff', genes, remain constant? Or does the word 'gene' have no empirical significance, either?

But it does seem to me that yeasts are a special case, and that your reasoning from yeast's exceptional genetic properties is an example of 'special pleading' re genetic determinism.\n But for the time being, out of ignorance, I conditionally accept that wrt yeasts and possibly other protists, there exists strong evidence for genetic determinism.\n \n And on that note, I'll take another break.",

   "\n Quote:\n Empirically, I have pointed out that nowhere in the universe is there any complex system that generates a non-entropic product that, as a result of a random/accidental/entropic change in its infrastructure, increases the level of efficiency and productivity with which it generates that non-entropic outcome. \n \n And, once again, I remind you that that is your interpretation of the evidence, not the evidence itself.\n\n \n **\n No, that's matter of fact. No 'interpretation' necessary.\n \n \n\n If in reality I am correct about these mutations being random and adaptive, then the world is full of empirical evidence of complex systems increasing their efficiency etc via RM.\n\n \n **\n Your \"if\" is neither evidence nor interpretation--it's just speculation.\n \n \n\n What's interesting is that when I point out the many man-made complex systems in which RM is leveraged to increase efficiency,\n\n \n **\n I'm not aware of any such thing that you've mentioned, but many darwinists like to point to computer programs that operate EAM fashion, i.e., goal-directed trial and error given a set of pertinent variables. They like to pretend that these systems are stochastic, as per RM, but they're not.\n \n \n\n you say that doesn't count because the subsequent selection process is intelligent. But the fact that the most efficient randomly-permuted design is being intelligently chosen and replicated doesn't change the fact that it is more efficient than its predecessor and that the change that made it so was random!\n\n \n **\n The fact is that the variables input into those programs are systematic and limited, and not haphazard, anomalous, and open-ended, and so their output is heuristically directed/limited. That's not stochastic, as you would have 'stochastic' applied to real genomes.\n Moreover, unless you are in the rare position of achieving an immediate result following a single 'mutation', then the ensuing intelligent selection that leads to an eventually successful result, in one more try or a thousand, is entirely non-random, and the entire process is heuristic, as per EAM, and not stochastic, as per RMNS. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n No idea what you're trying to say. If you cannot see that an entropic accident in a complex system is not a matter of 'letting something novel \"get through\"', but merely a matter of preventing something previous from \"getting through\", \n \n \n Ah ah ah, that's not what you said. You said that a self-regulating system would not allow the specific mutation we were talking about - a gene duplication that happened to be adaptive - occur at random.\n\n \n **\n And do you have a gene duplication that is adaptive that you can empirically prove is random, as opposed to systematic? No, you do not. All you have is your other interpretation of 'gene duplication', where you link the expression to the egenetic engineering practice of inserting an identical gene to one that induces a given trait in a developed organism, into another like organism and observing the development of that same trait. Given these initial conditions in simple structures, such as yeast cells, you make a special case for genetic determinism. But coming back to what 'gene duplication' is generally taken to mean, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication , there is no reason to believe that it is any less intelligently systematic than any of the supposedly \"random\" generators invented by human beings. Which, as I said earlier, would make 'gene duplication' a part of the EAM heuristic system of self-organization, and not a matter of lucky chance.\n \n \n \n\n But that same system, good though it is, demonstrably does allow the 'leak through' of all kinds of random mutations, including duplications.\n\n \n **\n You may make a case for mutagen caused mutations as 'random', as they are externally imposed upon the genome, but there is no way that you can defend the assertion that gene duplication is just a matter of stochastic events arising out of some kind of systemic 'weakness'. Just like the e.coli.'s regularly re-iterated resistance, it's no accident.\n \n \n \n\n So what you're asking me to believe is that it makes a special and successful effort to prevent all adaptive mutations but doesn't try quite so hard with the destructive ones. Sorry; I don't buy it.\n\n \n **\n Neither do I, and I never said it did. If anything, the reverse is true. But destruction is not always reparable or resistable, creation may be difficult, extended, and complex endeavor. IAC, there seems to be some equivocation in your conflation of gene duplication with mutation, as per wikipedia.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The issue is not, and never has been, what can happen to a DNA sequence, intentionally or by accident. The issue is, and always has been, the cause of adaptive trait mutations at the organismic, phenotypic level. \n \n \n No: both are the issue. From your attempt to distance yourself from the former I'm assuming you've got nothing to back up your assertion that the particular genetic change in question could not happen at random - now you're trying to say that even if it did, it wouldn't cause the adaptive trait.\n\n \n The issue from my point of view was never that DNA sequences do not change. Of course they do, sometimes, in some ways. I cannot think why you think that that is an issue?!? The only issues have been your insistence that all such changes are accidental, irregular, ateleological, chance occurences, and following from that premise, that adaptive genetic changes are just as stochastic as any others.\n \n What I am saying is what I've said all along--that you have no evidence to support your contention that a yeast's gene duplication is strictly a stochastic, i.e., chance, event, instead of the outcome of a systematic process of gene duplication driven by cellular mechanisms as a part of the dynamic self-organization and preservation processes that come with being a live biosystem. A mechanism that frees the organism to use the duplicated gene to heuristically explore novel phenotypic outcomes, different from the established function of the original. These different functions being referred to as 'mutations' in the wiki article.\n \n \n\n So at what stage, do you think, would the random origin of that DNA change induce a different result from an identical gene-spliced DNA change?\n\n \n **\n Why do you keep trying to link your 'random generation' premise to an 'intelligent design' fact? You still haven't demonstrated that what humans do intentionally is comparable to what happens naturally, by chance.\n \n When gene duplication takes place in a natural organism, the 'spare' gene is not harvested and donated to a sibling like a spare kidney. It stays with its originator.\n \n \n\n You're suggesting perhaps that one would simply not produce the extra aphtase? Or that the organism would eschew taking advantage of the extra aphtase because it didn't come with a science-lab 'GM modified' sticker? \n \n Sorry for being facaetious, but it seems to me that if an organism can't distinguish between a mutation arising within itself, one inherited via crossbreeding, and one that has been forcibly inserted by scientists rummaging through its genetic top drawer, it's not likely to turn its nose up at a mutation that occurs at random, either .\n\n \n **\n You are still assuming that gene duplication is chance, not system, driven. The problem is mostly that you seem to be conflating gene duplication, a natural and regularly occurring phenomenon, with bio-engineered gene insertion.\n \n Moreover, there is confusion between the words, 'mutation' and 'duplication'. The wiki piece makes a distinction. A mutation being a change in the molecular composition of a particular gene, a duplication being a doubling of a particular molecular composition into two identical copies. It would be nice to straighten that out, since where there is genetic determinism, it is based upon a changed molecular composition, that is, a 'mutated' gene, not a duplicated one.\n \n \n Anyhoo, breaktime.",

   "You, OTH, have never argued any universal principles, logically and rationally\n\n Correct. I've stuck to knocking empirical holes in your 'universal principles', because they're the only arguments you've come up with against the possibility of random mutation causing adaptation.\n \n Look at what's being claimed here; the actual physical event I'm asking you to accept could have happened at random: the duplication of a single gene.\n \n We've argued around whether that duplication, via its influence on/usage in the development process would be sufficient to give rise to the trait in a deterministic fashion, and agreed that it most likely would. This principle is empirically verified by the practice of gene splicing, which is not only used to transfer desirable traits, but routinely used to check whether the gene coding for a trait has been correctly identified. Some minor confusion has arisen latterly about the connection between 'duplication' and gene splicing, and I'll get to that shortly.\n \n Before I go into that in detail, I think we need to clear something up. In your last posts you've said:\n \nyou can assume that it is only and always a matter of stochastic accident, (mechanically determined from unknown causes),\n\n \n, that are what they are, do what they do, and become what they become, stricltly according to the diktat, the mechanical determinism, of 'bits of stuff' impacting physically, accidentally, stochastically, with some of their own 'bits of stuff'.\n\n \nOh, really? Where and when was it demonstrated the gene duplication is a stochastic, random, accidental, non-systematic, entropic event?\n\n \nAnd do you have a gene duplication that is adaptive that you can empirically prove is random, as opposed to systematic? No, you do not.\n\n \nThe only issues have been your insistence that all such changes are accidental, irregular, ateleological, chance occurences, and following from that premise, that adaptive genetic changes are just as stochastic as any others.\n\n You seem to think I'm aiming to prove that all adaptive mutations are random. Such is not the case here. As I've tried to make plain from the start, I'm simply demonstrating that your 'universal principle' is flawed by giving an example of an adaptive mutation that you cannot logically or empirically place beyond the remit of RM.\n \n So, back to gene duplication and gene splicing etc. You've raised a few issues:\n \nMy amateur understanding of gene duplication is that during reproduction a chromosome ends up with two copies, instead of only one, of the exact same molecular configuration, call it a 'gene', 'allele', or whatever, and that those two identical molecular 'bits of stuff' can each go on to determine entirely different functions in the organism, 'explained' vacuously as 'mutation'. How do you explain that change of organismic function empirically, since the actual 'bits of stuff', genes, remain constant?\n\n It's a lot more straightforward than that in this case. The gene in question codes for Aphtase, and doubling the gene doubles the quantity of aphtase produced, chemically increasing the cell wall's affinity for the limiting phosphate in that environment, yielding a competitive advantage. I linked to the full text earlier; it's pretty heavy-going but the author is extremely thorough in his investigations.\n \nIt would be nice to straighten that out, since where there is genetic determinism, it is based upon a changed molecular composition, that is, a 'mutated' gene, not a duplicated one.\n\n Hopefully the extra detail I've given should clear that up - duplication very much is a 'mutation'. This page has a fairly good 'lite' overview - although he also goes on to talk about how further mutations can then modify one copy of the gene without harming the function of the other, which is beyond the scope of this example. \n \n He also mentions how gene duplication can in some cases be harmful - implying it can happen accidentally, yes? And if gene duplication can happen accidentally, at random, we've no logical way to exclude it from accidentally duplicating a gene that happens to confer a deterministic advantage, do we?\n \n \nWhen gene duplication takes place in a natural organism, the 'spare' gene is not harvested and donated to a sibling like a spare kidney. It stays with its originator.\n\n \nThe problem is mostly that you seem to be conflating gene duplication, a natural and regularly occurring phenomenon, with bio-engineered gene insertion.\n\n Oh, no; the point is that gene splicing can mechanically replicate the occurrence of a duplication event, just as it can mechanically replicate other mutations. Sorry; I see now I didn't make that clear enough - I wasn't saying that gene duplication passes genes to other organisms :)\n \n To recap, then: we have a closely-studied adaptive trait deterministically linked to the duplication of a single gene, and we have empirical proof - in the form of detrimental duplications of genes - that duplications can happen accidentally. Indeed, in an environment with a different limiting nutrilite, that very same duplication would have been maladaptive, since it would have reduced the cell wall's affinity for a different limiting nutrilite.\n \n So, unless you can think of a reason to exclude RM from duplicating that gene in that environment, the point is made: since RM could have produced that mutation and that trait, RM can in principle produce adaptive traits; there is no 'universal principle' precluding it from happening.",

   "oops...that's where your argument cracks....genetic drift plays no role in beneficial traits.\n\n \n Dear me, no :) Genetic drift plays a role in all allele variation - NS is an additional depressing or elevating factor in the case of maladaptive or adaptive traits respectively.\n \n \nPeeling, I've got you on the ropes, brother.....\n\n \n Sadly, once again it's your strawman of the ToE we both have on the ropes, and are giving him a good kicking from both sides :) Poor guy.\n \n \nare you truly trying to tell me that when a population changes traits -- traits of which are beneficial to the population, traits that could be misconstrued as evolution -- are not really evolution???????????? I agree! that's what I've been telling you. Evolution is mostly an illusion...it mostly happens like this example with the butterflies: it's not really evolution at all -- it's merely the illusion of evolution.\n\n \n In the case of the butterflies, and the method by which they adapt to the differing seasons, I entirely agree: that is not evolution - and unless we're both missing something, I think any biogeneticist would agree too. Perhaps if one is reading this they can correct me if I'm wrong.\n \n If that comes as a surprise - well, I did say you were attacking a strawman :)\n \n \nYour contention that the genome has to change in order for a population to \"evolve\" new, beneficial traits is a fairytale born in an evolutionist book! It's simply not true. \n\n \n Ah, now, this is where we part company I'm afraid. You see, the 'trait' here is, as I've said, the whole mechanism of sensitivity to a particular environmental variation and the ensuing response. Evolution is how that mechanism came to be in place. Without it, those butterflies could not adapt the way they do - so we do need to ask the question: how did that mechanism come to be?\n \n \nIf physiological differences are dictated by the interaction between organism and environment, then the fossil record is not an indication of \"evolution\"....ie changes in genes. It's more like what you said above: \"it's not evolution at all.\" When scientists dig up fossils or observe changes in populations in the field they just generally assume that RMNS happened to form these changes.......but we are now learning that this is a false assumption...and thus, all molecular assumptions and supposed relationships/phylogenetic trees must be discarded.\n\n \n Woah, hang on, back up a bit :) Let's take that logical plunge a bit more carefully before we crack our head on something.\n \n For a start, we've suddenly leapt from observing specific, genetically-enabled developmental sensitivities (eg the butterflies, or Pottenger's Cats) to this general statement that 'physiological differences are <all< dictated by interaction between organisms and environment' <implication made explicit by me<. Sorry; no. In the Pottenger example particularly, that would be like saying \"Because a crash can change the shape of a car, all the changes in car shapes since the model T can be attributed to crashes.\" :) We certainly don't have any kind of generally applicable adaptive method here. Nor have we excluded the genome as being significant, since it implicitly defines the sensitivity and response.\n \n Now, regarding the excavation of fossils: chronologically and morphologically intermediate fossils are seen as confirmatory evidence of common descent because they're what we would expect to find if two species were, in fact, related. Though you disagee with the conclusion, I'm sure you can appreciate the rationality of the premise, yes?\n \n You propose an alternative explanation, which is that the species were never related at all and that phenotypic variation alone is sufficient to explain the apparently 'transitional' fossils; is that about right?\n \n I have a couple of problems with that hypothesis.\n \n First of all, it strikes me as incredible that phenotypic variation - out of all the ways it presumably could have distorted, say, the human skull - just happened to come up with a chronological and morphological progression that connects us to our closest genetic match: chimps - across more or less exactly the span of time inferred from accumulated neutral mutations. It didn't have to do that, after all; it could have led in any direction.\n \n And on top of that, it's apparently done the same with all the other intermediate fossils: phenotypic variation just happening to generate forms intermediate between genetically proximate species, rather than off on a tangent unrelated to their genetic neighbours.\n \n That's one hell of a coincidence, don't you think?\n \n Secondly - where do you stop this exercise in phenotypic plasticity? The human/chimp intersection? Or further back? To me it seems bizarre enough to talk about ancient humans being phenotypically indistinguishable from ancient chimps and yet retaining seperate genetic identities - but we can't just stop there. We have to keep going - to the root of mammalian life, say. A million phenotypically identical species of proto-voles, but with one of those still genetically and spiritually 'human'? Hmmm... :)\n \n \nThey select the bold and the beautiful, the best representatives of a population. This is not an accident...I'm amazed evolutionists admit to this because this requires some degree of decision making or, gasp -- intelligence.\n\n \n Look, if you batter this strawman much more I'm going to have to start propping it up for you :)\n \n \nBut this does not take away from the fact that in order for a beneficial trait to spread through the population it must go through the selection process. Even with sexual selection, the reality is the same: offspring must pass through selection.\n\n \n Simply not true. I showed you an example of a trait spreading in the absence of selection, with all members of the population reproducing equally. It's an inevitable consequence of interbreeding in populations where incest is avoided or discouraged.\n \n \nsigh......please, when you get a chance, read through this article.\n\n \n I shall do as you ask, and report my findings directly.\n \n \nFine....It doesn't matter. I realize you have a plan for making it happen quickly, but that does not stop the fact that the population must start over from wherever the mutation initially happened.....(this, of course, is assuming that there's such thing as a mutation that causes new, beneficial body parts.)\n\n \n Sorry, but yes it does lift the requirement for the population to start over. Yes, if a trait reaches fixation then all members of the population will be able to trace their ancestry back through the originator of that trait - but he or she will be only one of possibly thousands of ancestors that far back. How many parents do you have? Grandparents? Great-grandparents?\n \n I know it's horribly counter-intuitive. But if you take a population of, say, a hundred organisms and set them to interbreeding, then even without bottlenecks, within fifty generations or so it's likely that almost every living member of the population will be able to trace their ancestry back to every founder member. And if one of those founder members had a particular dominant allele, almost every member of the population will now have it.\n \n Go back and look at the first interbreeding example I showed you: the third-generation offspring all had four grandparents, didn't they? The population didn't 'start over'.\n \nAnd your fatal flaw in all that is, when new animals spread out over a countryside they are likely to encounter new and different environments from the location where the mutation originally happened!\n \n At which point, their intelligent self-interest can keep them within the envionment to which they are suited :)\n \nNot only that, but darwinists tell us that evolution is a very slow process -- thousands, millions of years \n\n I think you just knocked the strawman's head clean off.\n \nYour beneficial random mutations simply cannot keep up because they happen so unusually -- and you are at their mercy.\n\n Seriously, you need to get past this idea that darwinists say RM is directly responsible for everything. It does work, but as you point out, not rapidly enough outside the petri-dish to directly account for all the variation and selection we see in the wild. \n \n I have to head home now, but I'll try to return to this topic tomorrow. In the meantime, please try to consider the possibility that if something seems utterly stupid to you, the reason hundreds and thousands of equally intelligent and rational people seem to accept and use it in their day to day research might, just might be because you've got the wrong end of the stick somewhere along the line, and not because they're all god-hating cretins :)\n \n Take care; see you tomorrow.",

   "[quote]\nCorrect. I've stuck to knocking empirical holes in your 'universal principles', because they're the only arguments you've come up with against the possibility of random mutation causing adaptation.\n\n \n **\n Logical arguments are the only kind that it is possible to make with regard to any metaphysical postulate, such as your postulate that complex systems can be rendered more efficient and productive by stochastic ateleological changes to their structure. \"Positive Random Chance Causation\" is purely and simply a metaphysical postulate. But instead of arguing philosophically, logically, deductively, using reason to support your postulate,'a priori', you went straight to empirical obervation and then made inferences from observed data, and with these inferences arrived, inductively, at certain conclusions, 'a posteriori'. Those conclusions, by your reasoning, demonstrate your supposed universal principle, as stated above.\n \n I do not blame you for attacking the issue that way, because empiricism/induction, 'a posteriori' reasoning from the individual case to the general principle, is the natural way of science and scientists. As opposed to the deductive method I was using, arguing from a logical and universal, 'a priori' , principle to individual cases.\n \n The upshot of that is that we are talking past each other, and that you will accept no argument that is not an inductive one, that is, where you can say that your general principle, as above, can be arrived at validly by looking at an array of specific cases and abstracting their common element, which can then be stated as an abstract universal principle, even a scientific 'law' or 'constant', or whatever.\n \n In our argument all you have to do is stipulate a single case where your principle holds true, and even if that case is anomalous, you feel justified in presenting that case as proof of a general principle. I could argue against the idea of presenting the exception as if it were the rule, but I won't.\n \n I am forced to argue on your terrain, your home advantage, from the field of genetics, as formulated over the past century from a materialist/mechanist worldview. This is manifestly unbalanced, since you are a geneticist, and I am not. Unlike in a court of law, there is no rule forcing disclosure, that is, forcing you to reveal genetic information of which you are aware that might weaken your own case. You can cherry pick what you choose to reveal and what you choose to conceal from me. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, or even that you do it. I'm simply pointing out the severe disadvantage that my ignorance of genetics places me under when we are restricted to arguments based solely on particular, selected genetic observations made by geneticists with an axe to grind. Namely, that the contra-entropic behaviour of complex systems can be initiated and enhanced by entropic events. Without which principle they have to allow teleological causation into the universe, a finding any atheist would rather die than accept.\n \n Of course, you claim that you are not arguing against teleological causation of positive outcomes in complex systems; that you are merely arguing for 'some' ateleological, chance driven, accidental, spontaneously generated positive outcomes in complex systems. But that is unacceptable to me, because to allow even one instance is to destroy a universal principle, and leave the issue, (of whether any given change in a complex system is accidental or teleological), essentially undecidable. Leaving materialists/atheists free to claim that they are all accidental, and that teleological change in complex systems does not exist in nature, but only in human artefacts. Which is, in fact, exactly what they do claim. Including all the geneticists within their number.\n \n \n\n Look at what's being claimed here; the actual physical event I'm asking you to accept could have happened at random: the duplication of a single gene.\n\n \n **\n You claim that 'gene duplication' is a stochastic, accidental, entropic event. That is, a \"random mutation\". I disagree with your supposition. I believe that change in complex systems takes two general forms--the entropic and the systematic. I believe that accidental chance-driven change in complex systems is by definition, not systematically driven. Which means that chance-driven change in an organism must be entropic.\n But I've argued this many times, and you just go back to arguing from inductive inferences and presuppositions. Such as, you presupposition, assumption, that internally driven processes such as gene duplication are just as random chance-driven as point mutations deforming a gene thanks to the destructive action of an externally sourced mutagen. I do not believe a mutation in a genome, as a system, is the same thing as mutation in a single gene, as a molecular bit of stuff. I see gene mutation as stochastic in anomalous cases, but systematic where regularly recurring, as in LD43. I see gene duplication as an heuristic, systemic process wherebye a complex, self-organizing, self-serving system directs its own development in a trial-and-error, goal-driven, teleological manner. That is, as per EAM.\n \n That means your claim to have demonstrated random, chance-driven, accidental, advantage-bestowing change in yeasts does not hold up, or support your primary premise. Again, as with LD43, you simply assume that it does.\n \n \n\n He also mentions how gene duplication can in some cases be harmful - implying it can happen accidentally, yes? \n\n \n **\n Tricky point, but mistakes can be made volitionally, as well as accidentally, and in any heurist, 'trial-and-eror', goal-directed problem-solving process, more 'wrong answers' are apt to be generated than 'right answers'. That does not render those wrong answers \"accidental\"; simply systematically erroneous.\n For example, believing that 2+2=3 is not an accident, but it is an error.\n \n \n\n And if gene duplication can happen accidentally, at random, we've no logical way to exclude it from accidentally duplicating a gene that happens to confer a deterministic advantage, do we?\n\n \n **\n Not if you insist on conflating heuristic behaviour with stochastic behaviour. You really shouldn't do that. Heuristic behaviour is what live organisms do, as per EAM. Stochastic behaviour is what pure chance induces. For example--\n \n \"Heuristic algorithms\n Two fundamental goals in computer science are finding algorithms with provably good run times and with provably good or optimal solution quality. A heuristic is an algorithm that gives up one or both of these goals; for example, it usually finds pretty good solutions, but there is no proof the solutions could not get arbitrarily bad; or it usually runs reasonably quickly, but there is no argument that this will always be the case.\n \n Often, one can find specially crafted problem instances where the heuristic will in fact produce very bad results or run very slowly; however, these instances might never occur in practice because of their special structure. Therefore, the use of heuristics is very common in real world implementations. For many practical problems, a heuristic algorithm may be the only way to get good solutions in a reasonable amount of time.\n \n There is a class of general heuristic strategies called metaheuristics, which often use randomized search for example. They can be applied to a wide range of problems, but good performance is never guaranteed.\"\n \n [wikipedia via answers.com]\n \n and--\n \n \"stochastic process--\n \n Meaning #1: a statistical process involving a number of random variables depending on a variable parameter (which is usually time)\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------[answers.com]\n \n The essential difference in a heuristic vs. a stochastic process being that the former has an invariable, constant element--the goal.\n \n \n\n To recap, then: we have a closely-studied adaptive trait deterministically linked to the duplication of a single gene, and we have empirical proof - in the form of detrimental duplications of genes - that duplications can happen accidentally. Indeed, in an environment with a different limiting nutrilite, that very same duplication would have been maladaptive, since it would have reduced the cell wall's affinity for a different limiting nutrilite.\n\n \n **\n All true, but you have failed to show that the cause of gene duplication is stochastic/chance-driven, not heuristic/systematic.\n \n \n\n So, unless you can think of a reason to exclude RM from duplicating that gene in that environment, the point is made:\n\n \n **\n As I keep pointing out, the only arguments against that metaphysical postulate that can be made by anyone are metaphysical arguments from logic and its axioms. But you won't consider such arguments, but insist upon argument from induction. As I say, fine, let's do it your way, then. But to argue from induction you need a large number of very similar observations in diiferent cases, and then all you can do is make a judgement call, an inference. Inferences can be, and often are, false, errroneous.\n \n Your inference that since gene duplications are not each, in and of themselves, mechanically pre-determined, that the process of gene duplication is a stochastic/entropic, as opposed to heuristic/teleological, process, is nothing but your own metaphysical assumption.\n \n It is strange to me that geneticists will use computerized heuristic/teleological programs to help solve their own problems, but deny that capability to all other life-forms. \n \n \n \n \n\n since RM could have produced that mutation and that trait, RM can in principle produce adaptive traits; there is no 'universal principle' precluding it from happening.\n\n \n **\n Again, you assume that \"RM could have produced that mutation\", stochastically. That's a metaphysical assumption that can only be upheld by arguing logically from first principles. Arguing inductively from inferences generated by observations can never do that for you. Assert it until the cows come home, you can never 'prove' that any observed outcome, 'just happened, that's all', spontaneously self-generated. Spontaneous self-generation is what \"random genetic mutation\" used to mean, back in the days of LD'43. You are arbitrarily trying to expand it to include internal system behaviours such as gene duplication and systematically iterated immune responses. But I'm not buying that.",

   "The point I'm making is most accurately summarised by you here:\n \n \nOf course, you claim that you are not arguing against teleological causation of positive outcomes in complex systems; that you are merely arguing for 'some' ateleological, chance driven, accidental, spontaneously generated positive outcomes in complex systems.\n\n \n This is more or less correct - what I'm saying is that we cannot logically exclude such an event. Your fundamental objection to conceding the point is not logical but essentially political:\n \n \nBut that is unacceptable to me, because to allow even one instance is to destroy a universal principle, and leave the issue, (of whether any given change in a complex system is accidental or teleological), essentially undecidable. Leaving materialists/atheists free to claim that they are all accidental, and that teleological change in complex systems does not exist in nature, but only in human artefacts.\n\n \n I can understand why that would be anathema, but I think it's a bad - and moreover unnecessary - reason to hold fast to a faulty universal principle. And it is faulty, even arguing from the 'top down':\n \nI believe that change in complex systems takes two general forms--the entropic and the systematic. I believe that accidental chance-driven change in complex systems is by definition, not systematically driven. Which means that chance-driven change in an organism must be entropic.\n\n What you're missing in making this deduction is that random events are only entropic on average. It is not true to say that because an individual event is effectively random and undirected it must be entropic.\n \n Take the sequence of letters 'HEAM'. I can teleologically induce meaning - in the complex coding context of the English language - by changing the last letter to 'P'. Most random changes to that sequence of letters won't create meaning, but a few can: HELM, HEAD, HEAP, HEAL, BEAM etc. It's a trivial example, but then the duplication of a single gene isn't all that complex either.\n \n When I said earlier that it 'didn't matter' how a mutation arose, I wasn't trivialising the subject in hand, I was pointing out that from the point of view of the organism, how the mutation got there has no bearing on what comes next. Analogously, the meaning of the word 'HEAP' is the same whether it's created randomly or teleologically. \n \nThe essential difference in a heuristic vs. a stochastic process being that the former has an invariable, constant element--the goal.\n\n The logical error here is to assume that the existence of a goal means that the heuristic itself must be non-random. Stochastic variation is quite capable of yielding results closer to the goal, which can then be chosen as the starting point for the next exploratory variation. Furthermore, stochastic variation is often the only option when the link between what is varying - in this case genes - and the desired goal - in this case an adaptive phenotype - is, as you point out, so stupefyingly complex as to defy conceptual reverse-engineering.\n \nTricky point, but mistakes can be made volitionally, as well as accidentally, and in any heurist, 'trial-and-eror', goal-directed problem-solving process, more 'wrong answers' are apt to be generated than 'right answers'. That does not render those wrong answers \"accidental\"; simply systematically erroneous.\n For example, believing that 2+2=3 is not an accident, but it is an error.\n\n Sure; I appreciate the point that making a change you think is going to help and being wrong is not the same as making random changes and seeing what works. But that doesn't invalidate the latter as a method of achieving success, does it? That's the point I've been trying to impress upon you: there is no logical reason, argued from any direction, to exclude the possibility of random variation - in this case mutation - producing an adaptive result. And in the absence of any evidence for an intelligence capable of mentally reverse-engineering a desired phenotypic change into the appropriate genetic change, we must seriously consider the possibility that, even to teleological organic systems, stochastic variation and filtering is the only practical option.\n \nI do not believe a mutation in a genome, as a system, is the same thing as mutation in a single gene, as a molecular bit of stuff. I see gene mutation as stochastic in anomalous cases, but systematic where regularly recurring, as in LD43.\n\n Again, we have to be careful about what kind of 'regularity' we're talking about. Someone wins the lottery almost every week; that doesn't mean there's a systematic process ensuring the right numbers will be picked. It's just very improbable that nobody will pick the right ones. The significant features of the LD43 results are that 1) the resistance arose prior to exposure (the meaning of which we've already disputed plenty of times) and 2) it arose in single bacteria at random, unpredictable, irregular times in colony growth, completely consistent with the mutation being a fixed, finitely improbable event during cell division.\n \nAgain, you assume that \"RM could have produced that mutation\", stochastically. That's a metaphysical assumption that can only be upheld by arguing logically from first principles.\n\n I appreciate the point that if we did have a rock-solid first-principles derivation of the impossibility of RM inducing an adaptive trait, we would have to interpret empirical evidence in a certain way.\n \n However, there's more than one way of disproving a derivation that claims to be 'rock solid':\n \n 1. One can argue against its logic.\n \n 2. One can provide examples of systems where the variation is known to be stochastic, yet still yields increased performance or efficiency.\n \n 3. One can show that a system known to generate increased performance is statistically stochastic.\n \n (1) I've done in this post, by correcting the misapprehension that individual random events must be entropic (that is only true on average, if allowed to accumulate unfiltered), and correcting the misapprehension that a goal-oriented heuristic search must involve directed variation (it can instead be stochastic and filtered).\n \n (2) I've attempted previously, but we have got bogged down in discussions of whether the variation is directed/constrained. Two important points you should bear in mind here: first, stochastic does not mean unconstrained. One can have a random pattern of 1's and 0's, a random series of movements in a 2D plane - these are stochastic processes despite having clear limits. So the mere fact that there are constraints upon the axes of variation, as there are physically in genes and, say, microchip design, does not mean the possible variation is not explored stochastically. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, man-made systems so complex as to necessitate evolutionary optimisation are usually too complex for a directed heuristic search to be practical: there's often no way to reverse-engineer a direction of variation from the knowledge of what we want to achieve. Having personally constructed successful evolutionary simulations in which I know the variation is stochastic, I find this particularly compelling :)\n \n (3) is where LD43 comes in. We have a variation known to be adaptive, and we show that it arises stochastically - with evenly distributed likelihood per cell division - in the absence of stimulus.\n \n It would be really nice to be thrown a bone after all that effort :)",

But you never take the time to show your reasoning to that conclusion. You just keep on repeating it, over and over and over again. Not only reasoning from first principles, but the 2LoT itself, refutes this assertion of yours.\n \n Random, stochastic events are always and everywhere entropic. Only systematic heuristic and mechanical events are, shall we say, 'negentropic' or, 'entropy resistant'. \n \n \n\n Take the sequence of letters 'HEAM'.

Most random changes to that sequence of letters won't create meaning, but a few can: HELM, HEAD, HEAP, HEAL, BEAM etc. It's a trivial example, but then the duplication of a single gene isn't all that complex either.\n\n \n **\n Language, and any other form of coded communication, requires both a writer and a reader who understand the abstraction they convey via a concrete medium. If you are typing a page with no regard for the symbology involved, your abstract message will be corrupted. That is why language consists of more than a simple arrangement of letters making words, but also requires words making sentences, and for complex communications, pages, chapters and books.\n \n But even if we reduce English semiotics to the basic fundaments, i.e., single words of 4 letters or less, there is no coded communication going on unless the writer writes HEAP when he means to communicate the meaning of HEAP to the reader. You simply cannot erase the writer/sender from an act of communication, anymore than you can erase the sign/medium or the reader/receiver. All three are necessary or there is no meaningful act of communication, but simply pointless stimulus/response. Randomly changing HEAP to HEAL to HEAD, or whatever, communicates nothing from the writer/sender, because there is no 'meaning intending writer/sender'. There is only the medium, its imprinted symbology, and the receiver/reader.\n There is nothing but the reader's subjective response to the stimulus afforded by what he sees. This is no more 'semiotic', or 'coded' or 'communicative' than a large pothole in the road, or an electric shock.\n \n Now in terms of simple stimulus/response events that's all very well. But simple stimulus/response events are qualitatively different to the entangled and interdependent mechanics of a complex, self-organizing, productive system. Molecular events are strictly 'stimulus/response' per se, and are meaningless unless and until related to an intended product. Thousands of them are incorporated into the operations of complex systems, including yeast cells and bacteria colonies, but they are only non-entropic when they are systemic, that is, an intrinsic and purposeful part of the co-ordinated operation of the system as a whole in furthering its own ends and goals. \n \n That is why I do not deny the existence of _accidental_ genetic mutations, but do not accept that they can cause an improvement in productivity or efficiency in a complex system to which they have no systematic, purposeful connection.\n \n For example, experimenters set up 'evolutionary' computer simulations. They invent limited 'randomness' generators for their experiment. But their experiment is \"systematic\", as all experiments are by definition. Moreover, this 'system' is both complex and non-specifically goal-oriented. The limited randomness required for any successful run of this experimental system is therefore not stochastic, not purely accidental, but systematically heuristic, i.e., non-mechanically intentional. \n \n That is why I can claim that gene duplication is an inherent part of the heuristic of cellular self-organization and goal-achievement, along with the whole of the systemic process of adaptive increase in mutation rates, all part of the heuristic process of self-direction and adaptation, and that regular iterations of stimulus/response molecular events, such as found in the e.coli. rtesistance, are also systemic in eubacterial colonies.\n \n There is nothing anomalously accidental, i.e., 'stochastic', about them. Mind, you use the word 'stochastic' in the statistical sense. I use it in the sense, --'undirected wrt to goal, purpose, or outcome; arbitrary',-- in order to distinguish it from 'heuristic'. Most materialists arbitrarily ignore that distinction, but that's their problem.\n The closest definition to my sense of the word is--\n \n \"Stochastic, from the Greek \"stochos\" or \"goal\", means of, relating to, or characterized by conjecture and randomness. A stochastic process is one whose behavior is non-deterministic in that the next state of the environment is partially but not fully determined by the previous state of the environment.\"\n [answers.com]\n \n I would say that in the modern sense it means, 'without goal (stochos)', and that a stochastic process is one that is in no way influenced, directed, or determined by a final cause, and that a stochastic event is strictly anomalous mechanical event involving only an arbitrary, irregular, and proximate efficient cause.\n \n And that is why stochastic events and stochastic processes can have no positive part in in complex productive systems, because such systems are by definition, goal-directed.\n \n I know that's just my opinion, so if you want to critique it go ahead.\n \n Break time.",

But the fact is that the metaphysical axiom, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit', is unassailable and explicitly denies 'spontaneous generation'. It doesn't need me, my emotional needs, or my politics to remain self-evidently true.\n\n \n That particular axiom does not apply, since I am not postulating spontaneous generation, I am postulating unpredictable external interference - such as bombardment with energetic UV photons. (You haven't commented, incidentally, on the observation that adaptive mutations form the same proportion of all mutations even when the mutation rate is increased through UV bombardment)\n \n \nThat is and has always been your assertion. But you never take the time to show your reasoning to that conclusion.\n\n \n Actually, I do, over and over. I ask you, for example, to refute the statement 'random changes to letters can create english meaning out of a meaningless sequence of letters, eg HEAM', and what do I get? An essay on the philosophy of meaning. That's not a refutation, that's just obfuscation.\n \n I'll ask you again: does your 'universal principle' preclude random change from producing the word 'HEAP' - a meaningful word that could be understood and acted upon by a reader - from the non-word 'HEAM'?\n \n \n but the 2LoT itself, refutes this assertion of yours.\n\n \n As pointed out above, it does not.\n \n \nRandom, stochastic events are always and everywhere entropic. Only systematic heuristic and mechanical events are, shall we say, 'negentropic' or, 'entropy resistant'. \n\n \n Nope. I've given you examples of random events that increase meaning.\n \n \nLanguage, and any other form of coded communication, requires both a writer and a reader who understand the abstraction they convey via a concrete medium.\n\n \n But for a message to be acted upon it need only be intelligable to the decoder; the identity of the author - be it an intelligent entity or random chance - is irrelevant to the meaning derived from that message. Here, I'll prove it:\n \n HEAP HEAP\n \n I just wrote a program to stochastically permute the word HEAM, and cut'n'paste part of the output above, next to the typed word 'HEAP'. If you can tell me which is which, I'll drop the subject :)\n \n NB: Before you say this doesn't count because I selected the output - remember, we're asking whether the change can be produced at random, that's all. What happens next is beyond the scope of RM.\n \n \nIf you are typing a page with no regard for the symbology involved, your abstract message will be corrupted. That is why language consists of more than a simple arrangement of letters making words, but also requires words making sentences, and for complex communications, pages, chapters and books.\n\n \n No, you see now we're back to traits requiring genome-spanning change. They don't. One duplicated gene, that's all we're talking about here. If this were a recipe book, this mutation would be the line 'Add 1tsp Aphtase' being duplicated.\n \n \nthere is no coded communication going on unless the writer writes HEAP when he means to communicate the meaning of HEAP to the reader. You simply cannot erase the writer/sender from an act of communication, anymore than you can erase the sign/medium or the reader/receiver. All three are necessary or there is no meaningful act of communication, but simply pointless stimulus/response. \n\n \n Well, I'm terribly sorry if that means there's no coded communication going on, but that's completely irrelevant :) We've already agreed that if the duplicated gene is present - by whatever means - the result is deterministic. So whether the duplication of the line 'Add 1tsp Aphtase' was coded communication or a printing error, the dish still tastes better that way.\n \n \n but they are only non-entropic when they are systemic, that is, an intrinsic and purposeful part of the co-ordinated operation of the system as a whole in furthering its own ends and goals. \n\n \n See above; randomness is only entropic on average. This is what I mean by philosophical rather than logical argument: you've got this black-and-white, good-and-evil philosophy going on that dictates that there are only two kinds of event: systemic and entropic. It doesn't match reality. And when I point that out, by showing you non-entropic random events, you come up with some other philosophical reason for ignoring the plain and simple fact that a random system just produced a result you would happily describe as non-entropic if you weren't aware of its random origin.\n \n \nThat is why I do not deny the existence of _accidental_ genetic mutations, but do not accept that they can cause an improvement in productivity or efficiency in a complex system to which they have no systematic, purposeful connection.\n\n \n The inconsistency here is that if we were talking about this mutation in any other context - any other environment - you would right now be insisting it was random and entropic. The same physical genetic change. I mean, be honest now: if I showed you an e-coli bacterium with a deformed receptor that impaired its ability to 'survive, thrive and reproduce', you'd fall over yourself to call it an entropic random mutation - right up to the point where I bunged in phage and showed it to be adaptive. Same with the duplicated gene saturating the yeast cell wall with aphtase - clearly random and entropic since it harms the cell's ability to 'survive thrive and reproduce' - oops, hang on, it happens to be adaptive to a limited-phosphate environment. Must have been precautionary and teleological then. \n \n See what I mean about filtering observations to fit? :)\n \n \nFor example, experimenters set up 'evolutionary' computer simulations. They invent limited 'randomness' generators for their experiment. But their experiment is \"systematic\", as all experiments are by definition.\n\n \n That doesn't mean stochastic randomness is not integral to the experiment. Remember, we're not asking whether or not the process of evolution as a whole is systematic, we are talking about one element, RM. And I can assure you, stochastic variation plus filtering yields improved efficiency.\n \n \nMind, you use the word 'stochastic' in the statistical sense. I use it in the sense, --'undirected wrt to goal, purpose, or outcome; arbitrary',-- in order to distinguish it from 'heuristic'. Most materialists arbitrarily ignore that distinction, but that's their problem.\n\n \n No; I'm not ignoring it at all, I've been taking that as read all along. Limited variation, but not limited wrt to any specific goal; just inherently limited.\n \n \nAnd that is why stochastic events and stochastic processes can have no positive part in in complex productive systems, because such systems are by definition, goal-directed.\n \n I know that's just my opinion, so if you want to critique it go ahead.\n\n \n You're still ignoring the fact that stochastic peturbation - limited, but undirected wrt the goal - is a perfectly valid part of a heuristic search, and mandatory in circumstances where 1) the space of possible 'next steps' is too great to be exhaustively evaluated, and 2) the link between the variation induced and the actual change in fitness wrt the goal is too complex to be conceptually reversible.\n \n The only pertinent question when considering whether peturbation can find improved fitness is the extent of the variation, not its distribution wrt the goal. If we were talking about unlimited stochastic variation, as in a whole new random genome every time, then sure, it would be effectively useless at achieving improved fitness. But we're not talking about whole new random genomes, we're talking about what are essentially atomic, indivisible mutations - more or less the simplest changes that can be made to DNA. And as I've shown, such single mutations can yield improved fitness. Stochastic peturbation is every bit as capable of finding such solutions as directed peturbation - it's just a bit more hit'n'miss.\n \n I know you don't like it, but I'm afraid you haven't got a logical leg to stand on here.\n \n \nAnd I am saying that you do not know that it happens randomly unless and until you can show that the cause of the internal molecular rearrangement is linearly linked to a specific radioactive or toxic agent originating from outside the system itself, as an arbitrary but efficient cause of that internal molecular rearrangent, i.e., genetic mutation. Anything other is systemic, i.e., possessing an internal logic and direction\n\n \n Well, for one thing, cause undecided means 'undecided'; it does not favour one explanation or another. More directly pertinent is that I am so far only arguing that we cannot exclude RM from inducing that mutation and thus the adaptive trait.\n \n \nThis is, in fact, the approach darwinists take, falsely, in their attempt to make RMNS scientific by labelling NS a heuristic process, when in fact natural environmental pressures can only behave stochastically, since they have no intended ends or goals.\n\n \n Well, I don't want to get into NS again here; I'll stick with RM for now :)\n \n \nBut, as I said earlier, such activity is teleological and systematic, not accidental, arbitrary and stochastic, and in my view is not truly random.\n\n \n I'd like to request clarification here: are you saying it's not 'truly random' because the variation is induced in a teleological attempt to reach the goal? Because if that's the case you've no reason to exclude detrimental and neutral mutations from your system - they just become 'failed attempts' instead of 'entropic accidents'. At which point, EAM at the genetic level becomes indistinguishable from intelligently leveraged RM.\n \n I do think the most telling fact is that experimental UV bombardment does not increase the proportion of neutral or destructive mutations, just the overall mutation rate. I think that's far more congruent with RM being an environmental 'feature' leveraged by organisms for their own benefit.\n \n \nAbsolutely not. Endogenously generated heuristic variation, constrained by systemic operations, (EAM), can do everything you attribute to exogenously generated, stochastic, arbitrary variation subject to external filtering by chance-driven events (RMNS).\n\n \n Oh, I don't doubt it could, but we need to demonstrate it even exists. Meanwhile, we know and you accept random mutation occurs, so whatever EAM manages it's going to be superimposed on top of any lucky hits RM produces.\n \n \nActually, it's hard to see how your RMNS could possibly accomplish anything at all, except destruction and chaos.\n\n \n Very hard, when you hold fast to wrong interpretations of the 2LOT and falsely equate random with 'always entropic'. I've given you empirical examples of non-entropic random events; what you do with them is up to you :)",

If a heatwave comes and wipes out a whole bunch of butterflies, for instance, will there be some butterflies in the population who just happen to have a heat-sensitivity gene?\n\n Yes, but just being sensitive to heat isn't that important in this case. :)\n \n I assume you meant something more like: will there be a butterfly with a higher heat tolerance than the other butterflies?\n The answer to that question is yes. Within a population of living organisms, there is always a certain range of variation. Humans have different skin tones, different heights, and different metabolism rates (just to name a few). Birds have different colors, wingspans, etc. I could go on, but I think that would be too much of a tangent.\n The importance of what I am saying is that butterflies (like other organisms) have a range of heat tolerances. If the butterflies' habitat continually got warmer, individuals which could survive hotter temperatures would reproduce more, and more such individuals would be born.\n Just so you can visualize directional selection, here is a graph of a possible before/after scenario.\n \n The example above is an example of gradualism, the view that evolution happens slowly but steadily. Your proposed scenario (a heat wave) would actually be more of an example of punctuated equilibrium. The result of a rapid increase in heat would be the same as the result outlined above, except that the butterflies would have to be adapted to more heat to survive.",

For a simple reason. Removing the larger speciments takes their genes out the pool and favors the survivial of smaller individuals. Over time as individuals that have traits to grow smaller then normal species will come to be the majority population and the overall catch becomes smaller, which is detrimental to the commercial seafood industry. Maine does this with lobsters and I believe California and Oregon do with various species of fish. Preserving the larger species ensures that their genes for larger sizes do not leave the gene pool.

I think that when you start to look at productive systems you have to look teleologically at such terms as energy, entropy, random, organization, efficiency, and information, and teleology simply is not a factor in the original understanding of thermodynamics, but must be in any understanding of biosystems. \n \n \n\n Having read more of your posts I think I understand where you are coming from in terms of viewing organisms as 'information-based systems' and this helps me understand why you see randomness always equalling entropy, but this is simply not the case in reality!\n\n \n **\n That kind of depends upon how you define \"random\", and \"entropy\", I've found.\n \n \n\n I know our previous discussion got way off track and maybe my explanations of the 2LoT were badly handled, but when Peeling says random events are only entropic on avaerage, he is absolutely right and the 2LoT fully supports him on this.\n\n \n **\n Well, that is the issue we are arguing, and its fine that you side with him, but that still doesn't make you right in your opinion, or me wrong in mine.\n \n \n\n I will also agree that I believe you are looking at this on too abstract a level; maybe in terms of 'information' order cannot be 'spontaneously generated', but on the non-abstract, physical level, a genetic mutation can absolutely in no way be sensibly described as an example of 'spontaneous generation'.\n\n \n **\n So long as you limit yourself to a meaningless change in physical 'bits of stuff', i.e., acid molecules, you may claim that the mechanical event, (a molecular collision), having an externally sourced physical cause (an anomalous, unpredictable, and unprovoked particle) may be given the label, 'random', as defined statistically. (Always keeping in mind that, \"Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has a private jargon deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from non-practitioners.\" - G. O. Ashley) at answers.com \n \n However, once you look past the molecule to find its role in communicating meaning via a code, then you are claiming that meaning can be created where and when it was not meant to be. That the unintended and accidental can create productive communication, as opposed to meaningless noise.\n \n To do that you reduce organisms to bacteria, yeasts, and simple cells, and reduce cells to point mutations, and presume cellular point mutations to be externally generated random events, without any organizing input from the cell itself. That assumption is just that, and nothing else.\n \n \n\n The 2LoT explicitly allows, even for random events, an increase in order/complexity/efficiency (whatever you want to call it) as long as entropy increases somewhere else.\n\n \n **\n So tell me, when an itinerant, wayfaring particle smacks into a genetic molecule, and that random event increases the meaning (decreases the entropy) conveyed by the code of which that molecule is an integral part, where is this 'somewhere else' where the entropy is increasing? Leaving aside the assumption that a meaningless event is capable of adding meaning to a meaningful system, creatio ex nihilo.\n \n \n\n Just my 2 pence, I don't want to get dragged into this, but WW you cannot keep using the 2LoT as part of your defence, because you are simply mistaken.\n\n \n **\n Well, so long as everyone comports themselves as is expected of sincere adults, there is no reason that our discussions should be something nasty, something to avoid. But you don't prove a point by simply repeating it, either.\n \n Feel free to join with peeling in trying to put together an explanation of the application of the 2nd law to complex, teleological, information-based, autopoietic biosystems.",

In whatever thread a few weeks ago where wabbit started peddling this \"entropy\" argument, he was adamant that his mystery form of \"entropy\" was very much not thermodynamic entropy. We went back and forth for several posts discussing what was thermodynamic entropy and what was related to thermodynamic entropy. When wabbit was finally able to convince me that his version of \"entropy\" has absolutely, positively no relationship whatsoever with thermodynamics, I reminded him that the second law of thermodynamics wouldn't apply to this fairy-tale \"entropy.\"\n Now here he is, singing a different tune and insisting that the second law applies to his argument. And his defense of this inanity is to say that whether or not he's off his rocker concerning the second law of thermodynamics is \"a matter of interpretation.\"\n \n While it's always fun to expose the utter hypocrisy of fringe loudmouths, Peeling has him dead to rights on the point that I haven't been able to put so clearly in the past: wabbit's method of determining whether a mutation is entropic or not (i.e. caused by randomness or by EAM) depends on whether the mutation is adaptive. Ignoring of course the fact that this is completely circular, entropy (as applicable within the second law of thermodynamics) is a state function that cannot be changed by our knowledge of the system. If wabbit's determination is that a change is entropic (by whatever definition he is using that he still claims is encompassed by the 2LoT), and it turns out to be beneficial, then he has acknowledged that \"entropic\" mutations can be beneficial. Period.\n \n Aw hell, one more:\n \n \nRandom, stochastic events are always and everywhere entropic.

But evidently his informed opinion does not tally with yours. So I do not accept your opinion that, \"you've agreed that mutations can happen at random - and being random, that they cannot be excluded from producing the particular mutation in question -\". As a matter of fact I do exclude random point mutations from specified adaptations, and will do so until you guys can empirical demonstrate that any particular point mutation that leads to a specified (by need) organismic adaptation is arrived at arbitrarily, stochastically, ateleologically. There simply is none of the \"logical inevitability\" that you suppose.\n \n For instance, multi-cellular organisms have immune systems, and these immune systems seem to operate using hyper-mutation in somatic cells DNA, rather than germ cell DNA. I don't know if plasmid DNA in unicellular collectivities serves a corresponding 'immune response' role to somatic cells (wrt systematic, teleological, adaptive hypermutation in eubacteria, protists, ), or not. But if they do, then your \"adaptive point mutations\" are not random, but systematic and teleological, just like any vertebrate's immune system.\n \n From answers.com\n \n \"Plasmid \n Plasmids are naturally occurring, stable genetic elements found in bacteria, fungi, and even in the mitochondria of some plants. They may be composed of DNA or RNA, double-stranded or single-stranded, linear or circular. Plasmids almost always exist and replicate independently of the chromosome of the cell in which they are found.\n \n Types of Plasmids\n \n Plasmids are not usually required by their host cell for its survival. Instead, they carry genes that confer a selective advantage on their host, such as resistance to heavy metals or resistance to naturally made antibiotics carried by other organisms. Alternatively, they may produce antibiotics (toxins) that help the host to compete for food or space. For instance, antibiotic resistance genes produced by a plasmid will allow its host bacteria to grow even in the presence of competing bacteria or fungi that produce these antibiotics.\n \n Plasmids are subgrouped into five main types based on phenotypic function. R plasmids carry genes encoding resistance to antibiotics. Col plasmids confer on their host the ability to produce antibacterial polypeptides called bacteriocins that are often lethal to closely related or other bacteria. The col proteins of E. coli are encoded by plasmids such as ColE1. F plasmids contain the F or fertility system required for conjugation (the transfer of genetic information between two cells). These are also known as episomes because, under some circumstances, they can integrate into the host chromosome and thereby promote the transfer of chromosomal DNA between bacterial cells. Degradative or catabolic plasmids allow a host bacterium to metabolize normally undegradable or difficult compounds such as various pesticides. Finally, virulence plasmids confer pathogenicity on a host organism by the production of toxins or other virulence factors.\n \n Replication\n \n One common feature of all plasmids is a specific sequence of nucleotides termed an origin of replication (ori). This sequence, together with other regulatory sequences, is referred to as a replicon. The replicon allows a plasmid to replicate within a host cell independently of the host cell's own replication cycle. If the plasmid makes many copies of itself per cell, it is termed a \"relaxed\" plasmid. If it maintains itself in fewer numbers within the cell it is termed a \"stringent\" plasmid. Two different plasmids can coexist in the same cell only if they share the same replication elements. If they do not, they will be unable to be propagated stably in the same cell line, and are termed incompatible.\n \n In nature, plasmid inheritance can occur through a variety of mechanisms. During conjugation between two bacterial strains, plasmids can be transferred along with the bacterial DNA, and this activity is controlled by a set of transfer (tra) genes that are located on the plasmid and not on the bacterial chromosome. The proteins produced by these transfer genes bind to the DNA at the ori site to form a DNA-protein complex known as a relaxosome. This complex makes a nick, or break, in one of the two strands of the double-stranded plasmid DNA molecule. The place where this break occurs is called the \"nic\" site, and the nicked DNA is said to be \"relaxed\" because the DNA unwinds as a result of the nick in one of the strands. The single-stranded DNA that is generated by the nick is thought to be unwound and transferred through the pilus, or mating bridge, that connects the two bacteria entering the recipient bacteria. The other strand is left in the donor bacteria. It acts as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary DNA strand forming a double-stranded plasmid DNA molecule.\n \n Some nonconjugative plasmids can also be transferred into bacteria by means of a process called mobilization, as long as they carry the necessary (mob) genes. Others are taken up by bacterial cells during the process known as transformation. Finally, plasmids that exist in a host cell that undergoes fission (cell division) are simply divided between the resultant two daughter cells.\"\n \n There is more at the link, but this is enough to make my point, that is, if plasmid DNA hypermutation, without chromosomal mutation, is a systematic, adaptive immune response in eubacteria, yeasts, etc., then your argument to 'random' adaptive mutation falls apart.\n \n Break time",

If you placed your 'stochastically created' HEAP next to the intentional HEAP, then going by their positions on the page, the HEAP closest to the edge is intentional, and had to be typed first, before the 'random' HEAP had a specified place to be 'cut'npasted' into. ;)\n \n But seriously--just supplying an arrangement of letters that spells a certain English word, (and in this case, one which can be taken as either a noun or a verb, depending on context), does not impel or stimulate or activate any behaviour beyond simple recognition, and a hole in a doughnut can do that much! There is no 'message' or 'instruction' or 'meaning' involved at this level.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n If you are typing a page with no regard for the symbology involved, your abstract message will be corrupted. That is why language consists of more than a simple arrangement of letters making words, but also requires words making sentences, and for complex communications, pages, chapters and books. \n \n \n No, you see now we're back to traits requiring genome-spanning change. They don't. One duplicated gene, that's all we're talking about here. If this were a recipe book, this mutation would be the line 'Add 1tsp Aphtase' being duplicated.\n\n \n **\n Again, you assume that gene duplication is a random event, and not the result of systematic process by which a self-serving, self-organizing system is enabled to re-adjust its internal configurations in response to changing circumstances, if and when necessary.\n \n \n\n Well, I'm terribly sorry if that means there's no coded communication going on, but that's completely irrelevant \n\n \n **\n Wrong. With regard to systems, it's entirely relevent.\n \n \n\n We've already agreed that if the duplicated gene is present - by whatever means - the result is deterministic.\n\n \n **\n The issue is not \"the gene\", per se, but it's origins--its how and why.\n \n \n\n So whether the duplication of the line 'Add 1tsp Aphtase' was coded communication or a printing error, the dish still tastes better that way.\n\n \n **\n You are assuming that gene duplication equates to entropic errors in the printing process. Why do you make that assumption?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n but they are only non-entropic when they are systemic, that is, an intrinsic and purposeful part of the co-ordinated operation of the system as a whole in furthering its own ends and goals. \n \n \n See above; randomness is only entropic on average.\n\n \n **\n You guys keep repeating this statement of faith, without giving anyone but your own choir any reason to believe it..\n \n \n\n This is what I mean by philosophical rather than logical argument: you've got this black-and-white, good-and-evil philosophy going on that dictates that there are only two kinds of event: systemic and entropic.\n\n \n **\n If anyone is 'dualist' in this situation, it your insistence that that which is not mechanically determined is, ipso facto, random.

   "\n See above; randomness is only entropic on average. This is what I mean by philosophical rather than logical argument: you've got this black-and-white, good-and-evil philosophy going on that dictates that there are only two kinds of event: systemic and entropic. It doesn't match reality. And when I point that out, by showing you non-entropic random events,\n\n \n **\n You have yet to demonstrate any adaptive event that was arbitrary instead of systematic; that was driven by chance rather than internal systematization.\n \n \n\n you come up with some other philosophical reason for ignoring the plain and simple fact that a random system just produced a result you would happily describe as non-entropic if you weren't aware of its random origin.\n\n \n **\n An organismic outcome is either positive or negative on its face. The point is that you assume that there is such a thing as a \"random system\". There is no such thing. There are heuristic teleological systems, and there are stochastic\n (random), purposeless anomalous exercise. They are not the same thing at all.\n \n To expand on this--flipping a two-sided coin to no purpose but to note which comes up, heads or tails, is a stochastic exercise. Flipping that coin in order reach a decision regarding a larger matter, such as to which movie to watch, or which team goes first, etc., is a systematic approach to conflict resolution (as an end or goal), and as such is an heuristic teleological system. The actual coin outcome maybe indeterminately arrived at, but the entire process is teleological. Trying to say afterward that Team A got to start first as a matter of stochastic chance, is not strictly true. Team A got to start first thanks to a predetermined teleological system, a heuristic coin toss, which was according to the rules (organization, systematization) of the game.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n That is why I do not deny the existence of _accidental_ genetic mutations, but do not accept that they can cause an improvement in productivity or efficiency in a complex system to which they have no systematic, purposeful connection. \n \n \n The inconsistency here is that if we were talking about this mutation in any other context - any other environment - you would right now be insisting it was random and entropic.\n\n \n **\n No, I would not. No, wrt to gene duplication, I would be saying that it was systematic; at worst a systematic mistake, but not a stochastic,arbitary, anomalous accident. I'm not sure that mistakes are always entropic, since they exist only in intentional, teleological situations, where they can teach lessons, i.e., information can be acquired through them. Heuristic systems depend on them to do just that.\n \n \n \n\n The same physical genetic change. I mean, be honest now: if I showed you an e-coli bacterium with a deformed receptor that impaired its ability to 'survive, thrive and reproduce', you'd fall over yourself to call it an entropic random mutation - right up to the point where I bunged in phage and showed it to be adaptive.\n\n \n **\n No, I would not. Not once I found out that it was a plasmid mutation that arose naturally and systematically as an immune mechanism.\n \n \n\n Same with the duplicated gene saturating the yeast cell wall with aphtase - clearly random and entropic since it harms the cell's ability to 'survive thrive and reproduce' - oops, hang on, it happens to be adaptive to a limited-phosphate environment. Must have been precautionary and teleological then. \n \n See what I mean about filtering observations to fit? \n\n \n **\n Yeah. Characterizing gene duplication as an accidental stochastic event is certainly \"filtering observations to fit\", no question.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n For example, experimenters set up 'evolutionary' computer simulations. They invent limited 'randomness' generators for their experiment. But their experiment is \"systematic\", as all experiments are by definition. \n \n \n That doesn't mean stochastic randomness is not integral to the experiment. Remember, we're not asking whether or not the process of evolution as a whole is systematic, we are talking about one element, RM. And I can assure you, stochastic variation plus filtering yields improved efficiency.\n\n \n **\n See the distinction I made earlier, between 'stochastic' and 'heuristic'. Injecting a controlled amount of variation, in a quasi-random fashion, into a system does not render that system or its output random--not in a deciding coin toss, not in an artificial 'evolutionary computer simulation', and not in eubacteria and protist systematic plasmid DNA variation and 'gene' duplication. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Mind, you use the word 'stochastic' in the statistical sense. I use it in the sense, --'undirected wrt to goal, purpose, or outcome; arbitrary',-- in order to distinguish it from 'heuristic'. Most materialists arbitrarily ignore that distinction, but that's their problem. \n \n \n No; I'm not ignoring it at all, I've been taking that as read all along. Limited variation, but not limited wrt to any specific goal; just inherently limited.\n\n \n **\n You don't consider survival and prosperity to be sufficient goals? Perhaps you believe that a 'goal' is not specific enough unless it is completely specified before it is achieved? If you were in a burning building, I don't think that you would consider your escape a 'random' event, simply because you failed to stipulate the exact door or window you escaped from before you did it.\n \n I'll save some of this for tomorrow.",

   "\n Quote:\n And that is why stochastic events and stochastic processes can have no positive part in in complex productive systems, because such systems are by definition, goal-directed.\n \n I know that's just my opinion, so if you want to critique it go ahead. \n \n \n You're still ignoring the fact that stochastic peturbation - limited, but undirected wrt the goal - is a perfectly valid part of a heuristic search,\n\n \n **\n You may think that this is mere semantics, especially with the already equivocal semantics of 'random' and 'stochastic' as they have been muddied by statisticians the past years, but in my view those words only apply to ateleogical events that arise out of no purpose or end of any kind. If they arise as part of a trial-and-error heuristic search process (such as human \"brain-storming\"), then they are no longer ateleological events that arise for no purpose or end of any kind, but are in fact intentional, not accidental. There is no \"stochastic perturbation\", because the 'perturbation' is intentionally built into the teleology of the system. It is \"systemic\". See my \"coin-flipping\" analogy in previous posts. Or think about 'brain-storming'.\n \n The same applies in intelligent and volitional science experiments re 'evolutionary algorithms and 'simulations', in which options are quasi-randomly generated, (i.e., loosely constrained within a broad but limited search space delineated by pre=determined subject matter at hand), then intelligentlly and intentionally selected according the pre-determined value criterion set out optimum goal correlation, leading by informational feedback to an increasingly narrowed search space, until the best possible 'solution' is found. This is the chief mechanism of Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, and has been since I invented the term six years ago at IIDB, and then promoted it at ARN until last year. \n \n \n\n and mandatory in circumstances where 1) the space of possible 'next steps' is too great to be exhaustively evaluated, and 2) the link between the variation induced and the actual change in fitness wrt the goal is too complex to be conceptually reversible.\n\n \n **\n Number one, true wrt to organisms.\n Number two, dubious, (even without clarifying the term, \"fitness\") wrt to the assertion, \"the goal is too complex to be conceptually reversible\". A trial solution may be erroneous, but information re that trial is 'conceptually reversible' via biofeedback, although the 'trait' or outcome of an erroneous 'trial' may be mechanically irreversible. None of which applies to the actual goal involved, which is usually foreseen in the simplest, most straightforward, and general terms allowable. In organisms those goals are 'survive', 'thrive', and 'be able to reproduce'.\n \n \n\n The only pertinent question when considering whether peturbation can find improved fitness is the extent of the variation, not its distribution wrt the goal. \n\n \n **\n Not so. The reverse is true. Apply the concept to 'brain-storming. It does not operate successfully thanks to sheer numbers of different suggestions made, but only through the generation of suggestions that are 'on topic', that bear on the issue at hand.\n \n \n\n If we were talking about unlimited stochastic variation, as in a whole new random genome every time, then sure, it would be effectively useless at achieving improved fitness. But we're not talking about whole new random genomes, we're talking about what are essentially atomic, indivisible mutations - more or less the simplest changes that can be made to DNA.\n\n \n **\n Exactly, and that is the first limitation on what is called a 'stochastic, open-ended, undirected event'. It isn't open-ended. Just as tossed coins have only two ends--heads or tails. But the outcome is still called 'stochastic', despite the limitation. That is because in the materialist worldview, as I continuously point out, there are only two sorts of change events--determined (i.e., only one possible outcome), and stochastic (more than one possible outcome, and for that, as few as two is sufficient). But materialists, in their dualist approach, do not consider any degree of direction that is not mechanically determinist. That is because they allow only for 'efficient' causes, ateleologically applied, and deny 'final' causes (goals) teleologically sought. That because it would make 'mind' not only a causal reality(motive), but is the basic property of live biosystems to which the physical properties acting as efficient causes are supervenient. Instead of the reverse, as they claim.\n \n \n\n And as I've shown, such single mutations can yield improved fitness. Stochastic peturbation is every bit as capable of finding such solutions as directed peturbation - it's just a bit more hit'n'miss.\n \n I know you don't like it, but I'm afraid you haven't got a logical leg to stand on here.\n\n \n **\n I know you don't like it, but I have once again demonstrated a very sturdy logical leg indeed! As always, I assume, you will just ignore logic and leap to assumptions about empirical observations of fact, as if those observations, per se, demonstrated a logical conclusion, instead of another assumption based solely on appearances and wishful thinking (see L&D'43).\n \n \n\n Quote:\n But, as I said earlier, such activity is teleological and systematic, not accidental, arbitrary and stochastic, and in my view is not truly random. \n \n \n I'd like to request clarification here: are you saying it's not 'truly random' because the variation is induced in a teleological attempt to reach the goal? Because if that's the case you've no reason to exclude detrimental and neutral mutations from your system - they just become 'failed attempts' instead of 'entropic accidents'.\n\n \n **\n That's true, and I don't. Neither do I falsely attribute to them any direct responsibility for an organism's evolution, as darwinist's do.\n And in the case of any mutation arising thanks to the action of an external, non-systemic mutagen, like toxic molecules or radiation, ( and these are the original and still supposed to be the principal cause of the 'random mutation' \n in RMNS, the entropy is undeniable.\n \n \n\n At which point, EAM at the genetic level becomes indistinguishable from intelligently leveraged RM.\n\n \n **\n \"[I]ntelligently leveraged [random mutation]\" is a contradiction in terms.\n \n \n\n I do think the most telling fact is that experimental UV bombardment does not increase the proportion of neutral or destructive mutations, just the overall mutation rate. I think that's far more congruent with RM being an environmental 'feature' leveraged by organisms for their own benefit.\n\n \n \n **\n I have no idea where you get this notion?!?! Over 80 years of irradiation has never once produced an adaptive mutation for any of its victims.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Absolutely not. Endogenously generated heuristic variation, constrained by systemic operations, (EAM), can do everything you attribute to exogenously generated, stochastic, arbitrary variation subject to external filtering by chance-driven events (RMNS). \n \n \n Oh, I don't doubt it could, but we need to demonstrate it even exists.\n\n \n **\n Empirical observation has already demonstrated that live biosystems are autopoietic, not mechanical automatons.\n \n \n\n Meanwhile, we know and you accept random mutation occurs, so whatever EAM manages it's going to be superimposed on top of any lucky hits RM produces.\n\n \n **\n Are you admitting that RMNS is just a scientific-sounding euphemism for \"Lady Luck\"?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Actually, it's hard to see how your RMNS could possibly accomplish anything at all, except destruction and chaos. \n \n \n Very hard, when you hold fast to wrong interpretations of the 2LOT\n\n \n I don't misinterpret the 2LoT. But unlike materialists, I distinguish between energy, entropy, and dynamics as applied in information-based self-serving complex systems, and energy/entropy relations as displayed in the thermodynamics of strictly physical, mechanical systems. You people ape and moan about it, but as always you are unable to prove that reality is simply 'bits of stuff' moving about.\n \n \n\n and falsely equate random with 'always entropic'.\n\n \n **\n If I'm wrong, produce those studies you claim exist, the ones where irradiated fruitflies, or whatever, were gifted with adaptive mutations that made them better at surviving and thriving, and/or enhanced their ability to reproduce themselves. I've never ever heard of any actual case. \n \n \n\n I've given you empirical examples of non-entropic random events; what you do with them is up to you \n\n \n **\n Thanks.

   "There is more at the link, but this is enough to make my point, that is, if plasmid DNA hypermutation, without chromosomal mutation, is a systematic, adaptive immune response in eubacteria, yeasts, etc., then your argument to 'random' adaptive mutation falls apart.\n\n \n From this, and other quotes from your subsequent responses, I'm starting to get a better handle on what you're saying: if randomness is employed as a tool for finding solutions then it's not 'really random'. You give the example of a coin toss as an illustration.\n \n Ok, let's think about that for a moment. A coin toss is, as far as the system in which it occurs is concerned, an event with a random outcome. Its distinguishing qualities are that 1) the parameters of that event are chosen to match the range of decisions (ie binary) and 2) it occurs as a deliberate event; it wouldn't happen on its own.\n \n Immune systems emphatically fail to match the first quality possessed by that analogy. The mechanics of our own immune system demonstrates the need for filtering of the output to prevent the randomly varied 'recognisers' the lymphatic system hoses out from triggering in response to our own cells and the things we consume. Simplistically put, all trigger events must be 'co-signed' by a T-cell that has run the gauntlet of the official 'parts list' in our thymus. In other words, the random variation in the immune system is not directed wrt the goal - it is undirected and filtered.\n \n One must also call into question the aptness of the second quality of that analogy: that mutation is a deliberately instigated event. That doesn't fit with the facts. What we do see is evidence of single-celled organisms relaxing the checks and balances that inhibit or correct mutations in response to environmental stresses. In some cases, feedback mechanisms exist to selectively relax those restrictions on particular segments of the genome.\n \n That's what I mean by intelligent (or at least systemic) leveraging of RM. Rather than being something deliberately specified and undertaken, like a coin-toss, random mutation is an ever-present fact of life and is, in modern organisms anyway, leveraged rather like sunlight or oxygen as a natural resource.\n \n \nNot so. The reverse is true. Apply the concept to 'brain-storming. It does not operate successfully thanks to sheer numbers of different suggestions made, but only through the generation of suggestions that are 'on topic', that bear on the issue at hand.\n\n \n You misunderstood what I meant; I wasn't talking about the number of variations but the degree of them - as should have been clear from my following paragraph where I explained how unconstrained, genome-spanning random change could not find improved fitness but constrained - yet still undirected wrt fitness - peturbations can.\n \n So can brainstorming of course - trouble is, you've no evidence to suggest that this is going on. All you've got are some adaptive mutations and some maladaptive ones, and a 'just so' story about how the adaptive ones are intelligently 'on topic', while the maladaptive ones are entropic and random - or just heuristic 'errors' - with the open-ended caveat that you reserve the right to retrospectively promote any and all of the latter categories to the former should they later turn out to be adaptive to some environmental change. And you justify this open-ended I'm-always-right-no-matter-what-the-evidence attitude with the logical fallacy that random events are individually always entropic.\n \n \nAnd we haven't even started on adaptive deactivation or deletion of genes yet - I was giving you a head start by choosing a duplication\n \n These sound like systematic mechanisms, to me, not stochastic anomalies.\n\n \n See what I mean? You aren't interested in what the actual event is that deactivates these genes, you see the word 'adaptive' and the red mist descends :)\n \n Gene deactivation can occur when a point mutation disrupts a gene or an upstream promoter. It's a textbook 'entropic' event - one of which historically knocked out our ability to synthesise Vitamin C. Yet deactivated genes are also routinely isolated as the root cause of adaptive traits. So what's going on here? Does it really make sense to say \"Ok, well, all the deactivations that were adaptive were deliberate and intelligent - and so were any that look maladaptive now but turn out to be adaptive to some unspecified later environmental change that might never come to pass.\" That's not a scientific hypothesis; that's the deliberate construction of an unfalsifiable belief. What if tomorrow a new virus comes along and, by exploiting correctly-functioning vit-c synthesising genes, wipes out all living creatures possessing such genes - does the loss of VitC functionality suddenly become a surpassingly shrewd move on the part of primate ancestors millions of years ago? :)\n \n You have thus far provided no method for physically distinguishing allegedly 'brainstormed' mutations from random mutations that you readily accept occur. The only distinctions you make are abstract and after-the-fact, requiring knowledge of the system's goals, and therefore cannot be used to exclude the possibility of the actual, physical event from having occurred at random.\n \n Look at the actual evidence available to us:\n \n 1. Mutations are on average not directed wrt fitness. \n \n 2. Informationally entropic mutations (deactivation, deletion) can be adaptive, and information-increasing mutations (duplication) maladaptive. Even factoring in your wrong belief that random events are all individually entropic, Information Theory is not your friend :)\n \n NB: This idea that we should redefine 'information' so that anything adaptive is an 'increase in information' regardless of the actual physical change to the data is meaningless, since 'losses of information' magically become 'increases in information' when the environment changes. Even if we pretend poor old RM can only be 'entropic' according to your definition, a simple change in environment after the fact would catch it out. What does it do then, apologise for stepping on EAM's toes? \"I'm really sorry; I should never have misaligned those strands and caused that duplication, or corrupted that intron and disabled that gene - I had no idea they would turn out to be adaptive in another environment. You don't know how hard it is, trying to avoid doing anything that might accidentally be helpful in some unknown future situation...I promise to try harder...\" :)\n \n 3. Immune systems employ stochastic variation - again, empirically not directed wrt the goal - instead mechanically filtering the results to leave just those that are helpful. Again, no evidence of directed brainstorming, and empirical evidence that stochastic variation plus filtering is useful and adaptive.\n \n 4. Feedback mechanisms, where they exist, selectively or uniformly relax RM-suppression measures under stress, clearly leveraging the propensity of DNA to randomly mutate.\n \n 5. Mutations are all simple, local and atomic. Unless you want to start claiming that there's no such thing as a random mutation, the inescapable conclusion is that RM is, though stochastic, still inherently limited - and limited to the same kinds of physical genetic change that you attribute to EAM. Stochastic RM therefore explores the same fitness space, once again debunking your claim that it cannot in principle hit upon adaptive traits.\n \n I have to head home now, so I'll leave it there.",

That is, a \"constrained perturbation\" cannot be said to be undirected, and in the immune system, or any other complex self-organizing system, such as a cell, the 'constraint' involved is always wrt the 'goal', i.e., good health, thriving, surviving, prospering. Any event that is truly 'random', i.e., entirely disconnected from those goals, i.e., 'fitness', would be entropic. But if that event is part of a systematic heuristic approach to 'problem-solving', then it is 'intentional', albeit unconsciously so. Such as duck-hunting. Ducks are hard to hit, so instead of single bullets, many pellets are discharded at once from a shotgun.\n It doesn't matter which, or even any, of those pellets hit a duck. None of them arose randomly wrt to the goal of shooting a duck.\n \n \n\n So can brainstorming of course - trouble is, you've no evidence to suggest that this is going on. All you've got are some adaptive mutations and some maladaptive ones, and a 'just so' story about how the adaptive ones are intelligently 'on topic', while the maladaptive ones are entropic and random - or just heuristic 'errors' - with the open-ended caveat that you reserve the right to retrospectively promote any and all of the latter categories to the former should they later turn out to be adaptive to some environmental change.\n\n \n **\n Not true at all. If variation arises systemically, even if it arises out of 'permitted' and 'constrained' relaxation of anti-entropic mechanics, then it is heuristic, i.e., non-random wrt fitness.\n \n An entropic, stochastic event is one which is a part of of a non-heuristic process, a simple anomalous event disconnected from any system, in particular any self-serving system's own values and goals. Examples, as I've said before, would be gene destruction directly, (i.e., efficiently) caused by radiation or an externally imposed molecular toxin. Gene transformations that arise heuristically out of a systemic attempt to counteract the entropic effects of stochastic radiation or other poisoning are not 'random' in the sense that the radiation/poisoning themselves are random.\n \n \n\n And you justify this open-ended I'm-always-right-no-matter-what-the-evidence attitude with the logical fallacy that random events are individually always entropic.\n\n \n **\n You're starting to sound as irritating as electrolyte and crew.\n \n \n\n Gene deactivation can occur when a point mutation disrupts a gene or an upstream promoter. It's a textbook 'entropic' event - one of which historically knocked out our ability to synthesise Vitamin C. Yet deactivated genes are also routinely isolated as the root cause of adaptive traits.\n\n \n **\n So what's your criterion for distinguishing entropic from adaptive 'gene deactivations'? None? They are always entropic, but some are also 'adaptive', i.e., contra-entropic?!?! No contradiction in terms there, no sirree bob.\n \n What in the world leads you to assume that all gene deactivations, or any other genetic phenomenon, always arises by accident, stochastically, and that there is never anything systematically heuristic about them? From where I stand there is more reason to believe that they all arise systematically than accidentally, i.e., stochastically wrt 'fitness'. My empirical distinction re causation is that 'efficient causes' spontaneously originating from outside the system itself are always accidental and 'random wrt 'fitness', that is, entropic, whereas causes arising out of the system itself are systemic and 'heuristic wrt 'fitness', and may be, in some cases, adaptive, and/or in others, erroneously entropic. But like a lead pellet that is shot and hits a duck, or that misses a duck, falls in the water and contributes to lead-poisoning the environment, they are both parts of an intentional 'hunting' system, both are heuristically generated, and that one is productive and the other entropic waste does not make either of them 'random'. \n \n \n\n So what's going on here? Does it really make sense to say \"Ok, well, all the deactivations that were adaptive were deliberate and intelligent - and so were any that look maladaptive now but turn out to be adaptive to some unspecified later environmental change that might never come to pass.\" That's not a scientific hypothesis; that's the deliberate construction of an unfalsifiable belief.\n\n \n **\n Adaptive or entropic depends upon what causes the deactivation. If the efficient cause of the deactivation is a collision with a wayward particle, it's random. If it's random, it's entropic. End of story.\n OTH, if the efficient cause is not externally sourced, but arises out of the system itself, then it is a self-caused change. It may be adaptive, or it may be entropic, but it is systemic, and there is no reason to suppose that it is accidental, i.e., 'random', unless your metaphysics leads you to make that assumption. Which, of course, is exactly what it does do, since in a materialist universe all events are either mechanistically pre-determined, or they are not; that is, they are 'random'. Ironically, in darwinism, all heuristic self-organization/self-determination, i.e., 'selection', is forbidden to all non-human biosystems-- with the notable exception of an abstract phantasm that practices something called, 'natural selection'.\n \n \n\n What if tomorrow a new virus comes along and, by exploiting correctly-functioning vit-c synthesising genes, wipes out all living creatures possessing such genes - does the loss of VitC functionality suddenly become a surpassingly shrewd move on the part of primate ancestors millions of years ago? \n\n \n \n **\n I have no idea what caused the loss of vit-c synthesizing, and neither do you. You assume that it was, a/, an accidental, random event, and b/, that it was entropic wrt to our 'fitness'. I make no such assumptions.\n \n But whatever it was, that was then, and this is now, and your scenario is only a hypothetical scenario. What do you think evolution is for? do you think that it is something that, 'just happens, that's all, will-nilly, thanks to randomly arriving radiation? I believe that that's what you do believe. I believe that organisms deal with what's on their plate at the moment. They don't sit and wait for the radiation fairy to bestow an adaptive mutation upon them. If a novel virus starts killing all animals on earth that can synthesize vit-c, accepting such a preposterous scenario for argument's sake) that instance would have no connection to the original event experienced by our ancestors. Any fortunate outcome for us would be pure good luck, just as being submerged under water by melting icecaps would be pure bad luck for those animals without gills or an ability to float. The point is that an evolutionary trait change does not confer or guarantee permanent fitness, and any evolutionary trait change, such as loss of vit-c synthesization, is not necessarily entropic, and does not necessarily diminish fitness, and lastly, is not necessarily a random accident. But even supposing it was caused by a wayward gamma ray, was accidental, i.e., random, was entropic, and did diminish our overall 'fitness', (a global population of six and a half billion notwithstanding), the fact that it makes us incompatible with a virus, just as water is incompatible with a fire, is just a disconnected fact of existence that has nothing to do with evolution. Of course, anyone who has convinced themselves that evolution is nothing more than a statistical change in allele frequencies in the biosphere will never understand or accept that fact.\n \n \n\n You have thus far provided no method for physically distinguishing allegedly 'brainstormed' mutations from random mutations that you readily accept occur. \n\n \n **\n Yes, I have. And more than once. I have empirically specified random mutations as those arising from without the system, such as cosmic rays.\n \n As for internally generated mutations, if you wish to claim that they are 'random wrt fitness', then you must assume that organisms have no control over their own 'fitness', which is self-evidently false. That includes no control over their vital sub-system, the genome. Once you concede that organism's do possess some degree of control over their own genetics, then you no longer have any logical, rational right to assume that any internally generated genetic change is not systematically, non-randomly, generated, even where the generation consists of relaxing controls against externally sourced mutagens.\n \n \n \n\n 1. Mutations are on average not directed wrt fitness.\n\n \n **\n That is not the darwinist position, which is, in fact, that ALL mutations are not directed wrt fitness.\n \n \n\n 2. Informationally entropic mutations (deactivation, deletion) can be adaptive, and information-increasing mutations (duplication) maladaptive. Even factoring in your wrong belief that random events are all individually entropic, Information Theory is not your friend.\n\n \n **\n Only if you assume that all information is pertinent, and therefore contra-entropic. Information is only contra-entropic insofaras it relate to productivity and efficiency. Too much information, if it interferes with productivity and efficiency in the system, can become entropic noise.\n \n \n\n NB: This idea that we should redefine 'information' so that anything adaptive is an 'increase in information' regardless of the actual physical change to the data is meaningless, since 'losses of information' magically become 'increases in information' when the environment changes.\n\n \n **\n What's \"magical\" about that?!? Information is always relative to occasion.\n That which is adaptive is adaptive relative to a given occasion, and wrt that occasion, information is increased. Change the occasion and you change the information related to it. What's so hard to understand about that?\n \n \n\n Even if we pretend poor old RM can only be 'entropic' according to your definition, a simple change in environment after the fact would catch it out. What does it do then, apologise for stepping on EAM's toes? \"I'm really sorry; I should never have misaligned those strands and caused that duplication, or corrupted that intron and disabled that gene - I had no idea they would turn out to be adaptive in another environment. You don't know how hard it is, trying to avoid doing anything that might accidentally be helpful in some unknown future situation...I promise to try harder...\" \n\n \n **\n This kind of argumentation is beneath you.\n \n \n\n 3.

   "Well, this has taken a rather disappointing turn:\n \n \nThat is transparently absurd.\n\n \n As JH points out, it's biological fact.\n \n \nAnd yet you still claim that mutation is not \"a deliberately [I would say \"systemically\", since 'deliberate' implies 'conscious'] instigated event\"?!?\n\n \n Take a breath and look at what I described again: RM being an ever-present risk against which organisms possess mitigating, error-correcting systems - systems which in some organisms relax - globally or selectively - in response to stress. That does not make the mutations systematically induced, and it does not make them 'brainstormed'.\n \n \nWhat you are saying is that \"[entropy] is an ever-present fact of life and is, in modern organisms anyway, leveraged rather like sunlight or oxygen as a natural resource\", although you don't seem to realize it.\n\n \n Again, this is rooted in your fallacious belief that because random events are entropic on average, they are all individually entropic.\n \n \nOTH, \" but constrained - yet still undirected wrt fitness - peturbations can\" is, as you did earlier, another contradiction in terms. That is, a \"constrained perturbation\" cannot be said to be undirected, \n\n \n Totally incorrect, I'm afraid :) Consider the Brownian motion of bacteria impacted by water molecules - the motion imparted is undirected (wrt anything, let alone something as abstract as fitness) and therefore stochastic, yet completely constrained by the mass of the bacterium and the temperature of the water.\n \n Likewise, RM only produces local, simple, atomic genetic change at a single step because of the nature of the inciting event and the DNA strand being perturbed. It is constrained (you don't get genome-spanning change, ie a whole new randome genome, at a single step) yet undirected wrt the fitness of the organism.\n \n \nand in the immune system, or any other complex self-organizing system, such as a cell, the 'constraint' involved is always wrt the 'goal', i.e., good health, thriving, surviving, prospering.\n\n \n Actually, the 'constraint' upon what is randomly produced by the immune system is simply the physical limits of the DNA being recombined - and as I've shown, that is not directed wrt good health etc. Only an additional mechanical filtering of what is produced eliminates the deletorious.\n \n \nAny event that is truly 'random', i.e., entirely disconnected from those goals, i.e., 'fitness', would be entropic. But if that event is part of a systematic heuristic approach to 'problem-solving', then it is 'intentional', albeit unconsciously so.\n\n \n Even if the event is externally and randomly instigated (RM) and merely permitted by a relaxation of error-correction systems? Hmm...\n \n \nAn entropic, stochastic event is one which is a part of of a non-heuristic process, a simple anomalous event disconnected from any system,\n\n \n Then RM is not stochastic, since it is 'unconsciously' part of the overall heuristic process of evolution.\n \n \nExamples, as I've said before, would be gene destruction directly, (i.e., efficiently) caused by radiation or an externally imposed molecular toxin.\n\n \n And if that happens to occur to a gene whose deactivation confers an advantage, the random event will have induced an adaptive trait. So, what you're saying is that, in principle, RM can produce adaptive traits. Or do you have some logical reason why the genes whose deletion would be adaptive are exempt from random destruction? :)\n \n \nGene transformations that arise heuristically out of a systemic attempt to counteract the entropic effects of stochastic radiation or other poisoning are not 'random' in the sense that the radiation/poisoning themselves are random.\n\n \n It's a shame you have no evidence of that occurring.\n \n \nSo what's your criterion for distinguishing entropic from adaptive 'gene deactivations'? None? They are always entropic, but some are also 'adaptive', i.e., contra-entropic?!?! No contradiction in terms there, no sirree bob.\n\n \n No, there isn't, because you changed the meaning of the word 'entropic' half way through the sentence :) Gene deactivation and deletion is informationally entropic, yet can confer an advantage. I'm still waiting for your explanation of why some genes are immune to random destruction (because it would illegally confer an advantage) while others are not.\n \n Thing is, I don't think I'm likely to get one, because you've yet again fallen back on the same old strawman:\n \n \nWhat in the world leads you to assume that all gene deactivations, or any other genetic phenomenon, always arises by accident, stochastically, and that there is never anything systematically heuristic about them?\n\n \n Hello? Is this thing on? How many times have I said this now: I'm not saying it always happens that way. I'm just pointing out that you can't logically exclude it from ever happening that way.\n \n \nAdaptive or entropic depends upon what causes the deactivation. If the efficient cause of the deactivation is a collision with a wayward particle, it's random. If it's random, it's entropic. End of story.\n\n \n Interesting. So even if the gene destroyed is one whose destruction confers an advantage, the fact it was destroyed at random means... what? That no advantage is conferred? Sorry; we've already been through the determinism argument. You seem to be contradicting yourself: you're saying that 'entropic' means 'maladaptive' - but here you're saying it's entropic because it's random, even though it's adaptive... which is it?\n \n \n If a novel virus starts killing all animals on earth that can synthesize vit-c, accepting such a preposterous scenario for argument's sake) that instance would have no connection to the original event experienced by our ancestors.\n\n \n Now you're getting the idea!\n \n \nAny fortunate outcome for us would be pure good luck,\n\n \n Doesn't change the facts of what would occur, does it? We'd still be alive and everything else would still be dead, and RM still induced a trait that turned out later to be adaptive.\n \n Just like if a bacteria gets a gene knocked out by a cosmic ray or a toxin - if that gene is one which, in that environment or one that occurs later, the bacteria is better off without, that lucky little bacteria will enjoy a competetive advantage completely indistinguishable from what he would have enjoyed had he deleted the gene intelligently.\n \n In principle, RM can induce adaptive traits. Go on; it wouldn't kill you to say it :)\n \n \nOf course, anyone who has convinced themselves that evolution is nothing more than a statistical change in allele frequencies in the biosphere will never understand or accept that fact.\n\n \n Strawman again, WW. Try to stay focused: I'm saying that RM can induce traits that happen to be adaptive; you can redefine evolution all you like to exclude such events on philosophical grounds, but it doesn't change the fact you've so far been unable to logically prove they can't happen. \n \n \nYes, I have. And more than once. I have empirically specified random mutations as those arising from without the system, such as cosmic rays.\n\n \n But that's not an answer, is it? Sure, you've said that random mutations would occur as a result of external influence and 'brainstormed' mutations would occur as a result of internal processes, but you've still given us no way to actually distinguish between the two kinds by looking at them. If I show you a physical genetic change, you've absolutely no way of deciding whether it occurred at random or as part of a systematic process, have you? All you do is wait and see if it confers an advantage, and then say it 'must have been' systematic. Worse still, you hedge your bets by saying 'and any that turn out to be adaptive later in a different environment are also systematic'.\n \n That's not a scientific hypothesis, WW. It's just seeing what you want to see.\n \n \nAs for internally generated mutations, if you wish to claim that they are 'random wrt fitness', then you must assume that organisms have no control over their own 'fitness', which is self-evidently false. That includes no control over their vital sub-system, the genome. Once you concede that organism's do possess some degree of control over their own genetics, then you no longer have any logical, rational right to assume that any internally generated genetic change is not systematically, non-randomly, generated, even where the generation consists of relaxing controls against externally sourced mutagens.\n\n \n Oh, absolutely, there's empirical evidence in spades for modern organisms possessing complex physical feedback mechanisms to relax anti-RM measures. \n \n However, the mutations that are permitted are still random and undirected wrt fitness - it is only the region of the genome that is selected (and often not even that). Plus we must still ask how those feedback mechanisms came to be in place - which puts us in an awkward chicken-and-egg situation: if organisms use selectively-permitted RM to evolve, how did the anti-RM measures themselves arise in the first place? And if organisms could evolve something that complex without selectively leveraging RM, why are they using it now to explore new genetic space?\n \n \nWhat's \"magical\" about that?!? Information is always relative to occasion. That which is adaptive is adaptive relative to a given occasion, and wrt that occasion, information is increased. Change the occasion and you change the information related to it. What's so hard to understand about that?\n\n \n What's so hard to understand is that you're describing a constantly-moving target for RM to avoid hitting :) \n \n You say a mutation in one environment is maladaptive and therefore 'entropic' according to your new definition - a decrease in information. Ok, fine. You then say the same mutation in another environment is adaptive and therefore contra-entropic, again according to your new definition. Still fine.\n \n Yet, when I ask \"Ok, so does that mean RM can produce entropic, maladaptive mutations in one environment that turn out to be adaptive in a different environment later on?\" you say \"No, no, no, because RM is always entropic.\" I mean; what? In such a situation RM is introducing an entropic mutation; it's the change in environment later that makes it adaptive and, according to you, contra-entropic.\n \n \nThis kind of argumentation is beneath you.\n\n \n Sorry; just trying to lighten the mood a little. But I note you have no actual rebuttal. Just how can RM - which according to you is unlimited and therefore can produce any genetic change - be excluded from producing a genetic change that is maladaptive in one environment but adaptive in another?\n \n \nNothing \"random\" is \"inherently limited\".\n\n \n As I've proved logically and empirically, this is wrong. Where and which kind of mutation occurs in any given cell division may be random and stochastic, but the kinds of one-step mutation that it is possible to induce in a DNA strand are naturally limited: point mutation, insertion, transposition, duplication, deactivation, deletion... all of which have been observed to be adaptive or maladaptive. Whatever RM is doing in there, it's exploring the same fitness space as EAM.",

That's very different from what the immune system does, which is produce completely random peturbations and then mechanically filter them after the fact - it is the filtering that is directed wrt to the goal. The constraints upon the initial random generation are not directed wrt to the goal. Do you appreciate the distinction? \n \n Consequently, the immune system is not an example of 'brainstorming'; the cells it produces are not 'on topic'. It is an example of stochastic variation plus filtering.\n \n Returning to the issue of chromosomal mutation (and, incidentally, all the mutation links I've given in this thread, including the yeast mutation, are chromosomal, since you ask), consider what we actually observe: mutations occurring all the time across the genome, with error-correction systems (still fallible, mind you) to minimise the chance of them getting through. In some organisms, these error-correction systems have been found to relax under stress, allowing more mutations (adaptive and maladaptive) to be retained and passed on. This is not indicative of brainstorming; it's indicative that the organism systemically 'knows' something's not right, but doesn't know how to make it better, and is allowing RM to have freer reign in the hope of finding an adaptive solution. The organism is not 'generating' the mutations; it doesn't have to. All it has to do is stop inhibiting them.\n \n The significance of this is that it gives us a way out of the EAM 'chicken and egg' conundrum, in that we can find a consistent evolutionary route leading to complex systems of suppressed and leveraged RM like these. For example, an error correction system that is equally fallible but not systemically relaxed in response to stress will still 'find' adaptive solutions; it'll just take longer.\n \n EAM, on the other hand, runs into trouble here: any organism capable of devising such a system clearly has no use for it, since it must already possess the ability to create complex adaptive traits, yes? Do you see the contradiction? \"I, a primitive organism, will now design a system that will allow me to design systems.\" ... hmmm :)",

If you wish to characterize the purposeful, systematic, and methodical inner operations of a complex biosystem, in this case the immune system, as a matter of chance accidents 'sifted' by some mystical mechanical device, a la RMNS\n\n \n Well, if you could take a moment to read up on the subject, and look again at what I'm actually saying, you'll see that the only point I was making is that the immune system does not 'brainstorm' as you define it. The random variation it leverages is undirected wrt to the goal - hence the necessity for a 'co-signing' process to prevent autoimmune response. There is nothing mystical about it; this is well-established biological fact.\n \n I am in no way denying the purpose of the overall process - merely pointing out that the immune system demonstrates stochastic variation plus filtering - where only the filtering is directed wrt the goal - is a perfectly valid method of generating adaptive traits.\n \n \nBut I must say that I find your desperate addiction to meaninglessness more than a little depressing.\n\n \n With respect, you are profoundly misjudging me. Not to mention being insulting - again.\n \n All I've asked is for you to give a logical rebuttal of the following:\n \n RM can induce point mutation. Point mutation can disrupt genes or disable upstream promoters, deactivating genes. Deactivation of genes is routinely found to be the deterministic cause of adaptive traits. Therefore, in principle RM can induce adaptive traits.\n \n Or the slightly more complex construction:\n \n Gene duplication can be adaptive or maladaptive, suggesting that at least some of the time it occurs randomly, in a manner undirected wrt fitness. This tentative conclusion is reinforced by this experiment, in which a higher rate of duplication events was induced in genetically identical strains of yeast via UV bombardment in an otherwise identical environment. Moreover, the duplication that conferred an advantage in that environment (again, a gene coding for aphtase) was not a neat, accurate duplication of just that gene, but in every case a different rough chunk of one chromosomal arm that happened to contain that gene somewhere within it (along with other whole and truncated genes). The UV-induced nature of the duplication, along with its apparent lack of purposeful focus, strongly suggests it is accidental.\n \n Your counter arguments thus far have fallen into three categories:\n \n 1. The repeated assertion that I'm trying to prove all adaptation is random.\n \n A glance at the structure of my arguments shows this not to be the case. I am clearly focusing only on the impossibility of logically excluding RM from generating adaptive traits.\n \n 2. Demands for me to prove that an individual mutation occurred at random.\n \n Since it is at the moment practically impossible to witness a mutation event as it occurs, this is an unreasonable request - which is why I have not asked that you directly prove that any individual mutation was systemically designed.\n \n 3. The assertion that random variation is, not merely on average, but in every instance entropic.\n \n I disproved that several posts ago by providing an example of stochastic peturbation increasing meaning in an existing context (HEAM-<HEAP). You disallowed that by saying that because the changes were constrained in type and deliberately induced, they were not 'truly random'. \n \n However, the changes my simulation induced were physically equivalent to point mutations, one of the kinds of random mutation known to be induced by, amongst other things, UV bombardment. My simulation was therefore analogous to RM, with my deliberate induction of random point mutations serving as a stand-in for the stochastic induction of point mutations via UV bombardment.\n \n There being no meaningful difference between the two situations (both peturbations are externally induced and undirected wrt a goal), my empirical debunking of your claimed 'universal principle' stands firm. The article linked above, demonstrating a clear causal link between UV bombardment and the duplication of chunks of chromosome, solidifies the point further.\n \n I further debunked your 'random=always entropic' argument against RM inducing adaptive traits by pointing out that entropic mutations (gene deactivation or loss) are routinely found to be adaptive. In response you redefined what 'entropic' means, making it context-sensitive; essentially defining it to be the opposite of 'adaptive' in the hope of winning the argument semantically. \n \n This counter-argument fails on two counts: first, RM, being random, cannot respect context when inducing point mutations. Second, if changing context can turn a 'WW-entropic' mutation into an adaptive one, then even if RM can only induce 'WW-entropic' mutations, it can still induce mutations that will later be revealed as adaptive in a new environment.\n \n I used the example of the damaged human vit-c gene hypothetically providing protection against a virus, and though this was disparaged as being a ''meaningless and unconnected event' you essentially conceded that it would have the same final effect as an intelligently authored corruption of that same gene under those circumstances. Since this hypothetical situation differs from actual observed adaptive gene deactivations (which, by fluctuation test analyses, also occur prior to encountering the environment to which they are adaptive) only in timescale, it follows that they too - though it would render them equally 'meaningless and unconnected' in your eyes - could nevertheless also have occurred at random.\n \n This being the situation as it stands, with no significant headway having been made towards eliminating RM as a potential source of adaptive traits, it would be very disappointing if your last words on the subject were to create a strawman caricature of my supposed 'philosophy' and declare it too repugnant for me to be worth talking to.\n \n I hope you can bring yourself to formulate a more on-topic response, and look forward to discussing things further.",

It is thus assumed that the \"purpose\" of the immune system is to protect the body from threats posed by toxic substances and pathogens, and to do so in a way that minimizes harm to the body\n and ensures its continued functioning1.\" The reason that the teleological approach is so effective is because teleology, purpose, is the fact of the matter, and not just a contorted materialist rationalization based upon a superstitious faith in spontaneous generation, 'creatio ex nihilo', and the absurdity of existence from the \"Big Bang\" all the way to the human heart.\n \n \n\n The random variation it leverages is undirected wrt to the goal \n\n \n **\n Oh, please! In what sense is the variation produced unintentional and accidental? Why is anything produced at all, if nothing is being produced save by unintentional accident? Where do you get the right to say that what is being produced has nothing to do with the organism producing it, save by some lucky quirk of coincidental happenstance? I know that asking \"why\" questions is anathema to materialists, since they entail teleological answers, but the fact is that for most of humanity, 'why' is always the most pertinent and important question that can be asked of anything, most especially meaningful things, like organisms and their self-generated, self-organized, self-directed immune systems.\n \n \n\n - hence the necessity for a 'co-signing' process to prevent autoimmune response. There is nothing mystical about it; this is well-established biological fact.\n\n \n **\n The part that is mystical is the part where materialists pretend that this complex 'co-signing' process, and all the rest, is simply a mechanical device that arose, accidently, by spontaneous generation, serves no purpose now or ever, but simply \"IS\"! And as such, blindly 'does its thing', ateleologically, just because 'bits of stuff' gratuitously force it to do whatever it just so happens to be doing.\n \n \n\n I am in no way denying the purpose of the overall process\n\n \n **\n Yes you are. By denying the purposeful productivity of one integral part of a complex productive system, you deny the purposefulness, the teleology, of the entire system. If you admit to the teleology, the underlying, basic, fundamental purposefulness of the system, then you must admit every part of that system to that teleology. Even including all of the indeterminate products thrown up for consideration but never used thanks to the 'editing' part of the process. Please note that I do not see \"indeterminate\" as being synonymous with accidental and unintentional and purposeless and meaningless and ateleological, the way I see the word, \"random\". Nor do I see the word, \"indiscriminate\" and \"non-discriminatory\" and \"unrestrained\" as synonymous with the word 'random' as I employ it, although it is synonymous with 'random' in some senses of that word. But if materialists are not using \"random\" and \"stochastic\" in the sense of being synonymous with accidental and unintentional and coincidental and purposeless and meaningless and ateleological, just as I do, then what do they mean by those words? \n \n \n\n - merely pointing out that the immune system demonstrates stochastic variation plus filtering - where only the filtering is directed wrt the goal - is a perfectly valid method of generating adaptive traits.\n\n \n **\n Do you deny that \"stochastic\" has, (i.e., denotes or connotes), when you use it, the following senses--accidental, unintentional, coincidental, purposeless, meaningless and ateleological? None of which apply where the system is seen to indiscriminately and indeterminately produce variations that are to be discriminately selected from, (as per the requirements of a certain end), and then applied in determinate fashion to that end.\n \n \n\n With respect, you are profoundly misjudging me. Not to mention being insulting - again.\n\n \n **\n I certainly do not mean to insult you, simply by pointing out that this argument seems to have two sides, and that the side that you are on seems intent upon upholding the postulate that spontaneous generation, creatio ex nihilo, random accident, sheer happenstance, can account for the universe and everything in it, including highly complex self-directed biosystems, and that to that end you wish me to accede to your premise that that at least 'might' be the case, at least 'sometimes'. But logically and rationally there is no such possibility, and every time you bring up an instance, such as immune systems, that you think makes your point for you, your assumption falls apart under analysis. \n \n Break time.",

   "peeling\n All I've asked is for you to give a logical rebuttal of the following:\n \n RM can induce point mutation.\n\n \n **\n You are saying that \"Random Mutation\" can induce point mutation. Even if you change that to \"Randomness\" can induce point mutation it would still be incorrect, since randomness can induce nothing, being but an abstract label, like 'natural selection', for a class of events or occasions. To be accurate you need to say that random, accidental, ateleological entities can cause genetic 'point' mutations, (i.e., a change in a single base pair in the DNA molecule, caused by the substitution of one nucleotide for another). So what entity can purely mechanically (by collision or whatever) substitute one nucleotide for another? A passing particle, perhaps? So the statement becomes,-- a random variable in the form of an undirected particle, simply by colliding accidentally with a single base pair in a DNA molecule, can alter that molecule by substituting one nucleotide for another. So ends part one.\n \n Part two reads, \" Point mutation can disrupt genes or disable upstream promoters, deactivating genes. Deactivation of genes is routinely found to be the deterministic cause of adaptive traits.\" Oh, really?!? Outside of eubacteria and protists using plasmid DNA as part of their immune sysyems? We've dealt with this, and shown that there is no reason at all to believe that the plasmid 'point mutations' are anything but systemic products as opposed to random accidents. Your assumption of random accident is not supported by any modern understanding of bacteria and protist adaptation.\n \n \n So, part three--\"Therefore, in principle RM can induce adaptive traits. \" simply does not follow follow from your falsified premise.\n \n \n\n Or the slightly more complex construction:\n \n Gene duplication can be adaptive or maladaptive, suggesting that at least some of the time it occurs randomly, in a manner undirected wrt fitness.\n\n \n **\n We've been over 'gene duplication', and shown it to be systemic, not accidental. Unless you know of some way that a colliding particle can create two identical genes, where once there was only one. Your belief that 'gene duplication' is some kind accidental event instead of a systemic one is just that--an assumption prompted by a materialist/mechanist linear understanding of organisms, rather as complex self-organizing, self-maintaining, non-linear feedback systems.\n \n \n\n This tentative conclusion is reinforced by this experiment, in which a higher rate of duplication events was induced in genetically identical strains of yeast via UV bombardment in an otherwise identical environment. Moreover, the duplication that conferred an advantage in that environment (again, a gene coding for aphtase) was not a neat, accurate duplication of just that gene, but in every case a different rough chunk of one chromosomal arm that happened to contain that gene somewhere within it (along with other whole and truncated genes). The UV-induced nature of the duplication, along with its apparent lack of purposeful focus, strongly suggests it is accidental.\n\n \n **\n Personally I would point to the UV bombardment itself as a reason for a systemic increase in gene duplication, as mutation rates in eubacteria and protists are routinely seen become hyper-rapid under adverse environmental conditions, in what can only be described as an adaptive immune response. Moreover, if the control, i.e., the identical yeasts in the identical environment, were perfectly adapted sans bombardment, then how can the gene duplication and resultant mutation in the test yeasts have had anything to do with anything but the bombardment itself, if it is to be called, 'adaptive'?!? I mean, otherwise, adaptive to what?\n \n Break time.",

   "Oh, please! In what sense is the variation produced unintentional and accidental?\n\n \n Did I say that? No. The variation is undirected wrt fitness. That is the salient lesson of the immune system: variation that is statistically undirected wrt the goal can still yield individual outputs that are useful in pursuit of that goal. That's what 'undirected' means - it doesn't speak to why variation is occurring, it refers to the distribution of that variation, and whether it's biased towards a particular objective. In the immune system it isn't; hence the need for mechanical filtering of the output. Do you see? Intentionally instigated/permitted or not, the immune system does not brainstorm. It employs stochastic - statistically undirected - variation.\n \n Please tell me we haven't been arguing past each other because you didn't know what I meant by 'undirected wrt goal'! :)\n \n \nPlease note that I do not see \"indeterminate\" as being synonymous with accidental and unintentional and purposeless and meaningless and ateleological, the way I see the word, \"random\". Nor do I see the word, \"indiscriminate\" and \"non-discriminatory\" and \"unrestrained\" as synonymous with the word 'random' as I employ it, although it is synonymous with 'random' in some senses of that word. But if materialists are not using \"random\" and \"stochastic\" in the sense of being synonymous with accidental and unintentional and coincidental and purposeless and meaningless and ateleological, just as I do, then what do they mean by those words?\n\n \n We're getting lost in a quagmire of semantics here, WW; let's see if I can extricate us from it. You say there's a difference between deliberately induced non-determinacy and accidental non-determinacy. You're right - all the way up to the point where the non-deterministic event occurs and we see what happens next.\n \n Going back to the meaning of 'undirected', above: the immune system generates variation that is, in your opinion, teleologically instigated in pursuit of a goal, yes? But the actual variation is statistically undirected wrt to that goal - hence the need for filtering.\n \n Random Mutation, clearly, is not teleologically instigated. But does that matter? The variation it induces is statistically undirected wrt any goal - but the immune system does exactly the same, and that works just fine. We must ask ourselves: is intent required for consequences to ensue?\n \n If a point mutation knocks out a gene, the effects are the same regardless of the story behind that point mutation. Perhaps that specific mutation was deliberately induced. Perhaps it occurred at random after the organism selectively relaxed error-correction protocols on that stretch of genome in response to stress. Perhaps it occurred at random after the organism relaxed error-correction protocols across the whole genome in response to stress. Or perhaps the organism didn't relax any error-correction protocols, and the mutation was just one of the few that manage to sneak through regardless.\n \n In terms of what happens next, none of the above makes any difference. The gene is deactivated. If that's helpful, the mutation was adaptive however it occurred and whether it was teleologically instigated/permitted or not. Can point mutation occur randomly; accidentally? Yes. Can we logically exclude it from deactivating a gene? No. Can we logically exclude that gene from being one whose deletion is adaptive? No. Therefore, we cannot exclude RM from accidentally inducing an adaptive trait.\n \n \nSo the statement becomes,-- a random variable in the form of an undirected particle, simply by colliding accidentally with a single base pair in a DNA molecule, can alter that molecule by substituting one nucleotide for another.\n\n \n Fine - however you want to phrase it :)\n \n \nPart two reads, \" Point mutation can disrupt genes or disable upstream promoters, deactivating genes. Deactivation of genes is routinely found to be the deterministic cause of adaptive traits.\" Oh, really?!? Outside of eubacteria and protists using plasmid DNA as part of their immune sysyems?\n\n \n Er, yes, actually :) Sorry. I think a couple of the links I gave earlier mentioned adaptive traits being traced to chromosomal gene deactivation. We have, as you said 'been through this'; you were just a bit quick to write it all off as 'plasmids'.\n \n So, my point actually stands just fine, thanks :)\n \n \nWe've been over 'gene duplication', and shown it to be systemic, not accidental.\n\n \n Er, when was this? You've asserted that it is systemic, but shown no such thing at all.\n \n \nUnless you know of some way that a colliding particle can create two identical genes, where once there was only one. \n\n \n The experiment link I provided in my last post describes and tests such a mechanism. Again, it's fairly heavy-going, but the science is good. \n \n During meiosis, chromosomes line up and crossovers can occur:\n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n \n 1111222233334444\n 1111222233334444\n \n becoming\n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n \n 1111222233334444\n 1111222233334444\n \n which then get segregated into the offspring:\n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n 1111222233334444\n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n 1111222233334444\n \n As I understand it, (and please, anyone with more detailed knowledge on the subject, do step in and correct any stupid mistakes I'm making) the role of a random energetic particle is merely to break one DNA chain after mitosis. If the DNA is snapped, and the severed strand recombines with a different chromosome: \n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD[334444] < severed and recombined strand\n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\n \n 1111222233\n 1111222233334444\n \n crossover can send one of them away with two copies of a gene (4444):\n \n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD[334444] < two copies of this section in two chromosomes, including a complete gene (4444)\n 1111222233[334444]\n \n which in subsequent cell divisions can be passed on to offspring.\n \n \nPersonally I would point to the UV bombardment itself as a reason for a systemic increase in gene duplication, as mutation rates in eubacteria and protists are routinely seen become hyper-rapid under adverse environmental conditions, in what can only be described as an adaptive immune response.\n\n \n I absolutely agree that the relaxation of mutation-inhibiting controls constitutes an adaptive response to stress. However, UV bombardment inevitably increases mutation rates because high-energy particles cause mutations. They are one source of the 'non-determinism' leveraged by such adaptive responses.\n \n Think for a moment what the relaxation of error-correction implies. This is not an organism brainstorming new ideas; this is the systemic equivalent of thinking \"Ok, the genes I've got right now somehow aren't right for me in this environment; let's see if letting these random mutations that I've been correcting through can help my offspring.\" When the organism is well-suited to its environment, it systemically 'thinks' \"I'm fine, I don't need to explore new genetic fitness space,\" and clamps down on RM with its usual vigor.\n \n \nMoreover, if the control, i.e., the identical yeasts in the identical environment, were perfectly adapted sans bombardment, then how can the gene duplication and resultant mutation in the test yeasts have had anything to do with anything but the bombardment itself, if it is to be called, 'adaptive'?!? I mean, otherwise, adaptive to what?\n\n \n Y'know, actually reading the contents of the link would be terribly useful preparation for trying to debunk it :) \n \n The experiment, like the one I linked to several posts ago, was conducted in a phosphate-limited environment in which hyper-active production of aphtase would be an adaptive trait. The experiment was repeated a number of times with a an initially non-adapted population of 1,000,000,000 cells, which took an average of 1000 generations for the duplicated gene to arise. In one case it didn't arise at all within the timescale of the experiment. The experiment was then repeated under UV bombardment, which, through increasing the mutation rate, increased the chances of that particular trait emerging during division roughly tenfold.\n \n As I hope you will agree, this is a strong indication that - regardless of whether RM-inhibitors were being systemically relaxed in response to stress - the actual source of variation being leveraged was in fact stochastic RM.\n \n Reluctant though I am to expose the General Fluctuation test to another tongue-lashing, it does demonstrate that even in the absence of stress - or in the absence of biofeedback mechanisms sensitive to stress - mutations do 'sneak through' the correction process and can induce traits that later turn out to be adaptive. So systemic permission of RM is certainly a useful optimisation, but it isn't necessary.",

No. The variation is undirected wrt fitness.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. The immune system is directed towards organismic fitness. In fact, that's its entire 'raison d'etre'. Therefore any intrinsic part or portion of that system is also directly oriented towards the goal of organismic fitness. Including, 'trial balloons'.\n \n \n\n That is the salient lesson of the immune system: variation that is statistically undirected wrt the goal can still yield individual outputs that are useful in pursuit of that goal.\n\n \n **\n I don't know from \"statistically undirected\", but I do know that from an empirical POV that variation is systemically(purposefully) generated, from a direct impulse from organismic need or standard operation.\n \n \n \n\n That's what 'undirected' means - it doesn't speak to why variation is occurring, it refers to the distribution of that variation, and whether it's biased towards a particular objective. In the immune system it isn't;\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is. Or did you think that the immune systems coughs up random variations on decorative sewing, or games of solitaire, or cloud formations, instead of remedies for organismic ailments?\n \n \n\n hence the need for mechanical filtering of the output. Do you see?\n\n \n No, of course I don't. And any systemic action, if it is at all variable wrt to proximate circumstances, rather than permanent, fixed, predetermined and immutable, is actually 'informed selection' and not \"mechanical filtering\" at all.\n \n \n\n Intentionally instigated/permitted or not, the immune system does not brainstorm. It employs stochastic - statistically undirected - variation.\n\n \n \n **\n You know perfectly well that the word brainstorm applies oly to human heuristic processes. I've told you that unconscious, non-analytical heuristic problem-solving processes are not 'brainstorming', but only heuristically analogous. So why, after 2-3 corrections, do you continue to misuse the word? And again--\"statistically undirected\" simply means nothing more than that, post hoc, the variations produced showed no 'overall' predetermined linear correlation to the successful variation. So what? In any heuristic process the variations offered need only be applicable, not necessarily correct, or even partially correct. Your \"statistically random\" _effects_ mean nothing in terms of empirical, systematic _causes_. A systemic cause can methodically generate \"statistically random\" effects, but those effects are NOT randomly, spontaneously, accidentally, unintentionally generated without regard for the system's purpose and immediate goals. So to anyone but a statistician they are just plain non-random. Non-random causation versus random causation is the issue here, as it is always is wrt the question of organismic evolution, not to mention the larger issue of existence itself. After-the fact observations of how the cards were distributed does not change the fact that they were shuffled and dealt purposefully and systematically and methodically, and the only random factor involved was their position ex post facto. Which was also, in the sense of 'final cause', intentional, and so not 'random' or 'stochastic' in anything but a 'statistical' sense. A sense that has not the least importance to an understanding of evolution's mechanisms.\n \n \n\n Please tell me we haven't been arguing past each other because you didn't know what I meant by 'undirected wrt goal'! \n\n \n **\n Not at all, as I've just reviewed.\n \n \n\n Random Mutation, clearly, is not teleologically instigated. But does that matter?\n\n \n **\n Absolutely it matters. It is the entire heart of the issue.\n \n \n\n The variation it induces is statistically undirected wrt any goal \n\n \n **\n The statistical pattern discerned in effects is immaterial. Causation is the only issue. As with LD43, statistical patterns in after-effects do not determine the quality of their causation, save only the distinction, mechanically determined/not mechanically determined. The category, 'not mechanically determined' is not necessarily 'randomly caused'. As I continuously pointed out re the assumptions of LD43, those effects could also be teleologically generated.\n \n \n\n - but the immune system does exactly the same, and that works just fine. We must ask ourselves: is intent required for consequences to ensue?\n\n \n **\n Yes, it does, and it appears that plasmid DNA rearrangement in eubacteria is every bit as systemic and 'intentional', i.e., teleological, as the glandular work of higher organisms. So, as ever, my reply is that consequences can happen by accidental, random causation, but only negative or 'non-positive' consequences can accidentally arise in complex, productive, self-ordering systems. In those cases, as I've said since forever, only intentional, i.e., teleological systemic operations can have adaptive, positive, production and efficiency increasing effects or consequences.\n \n Break time.",

First, they seem to be a case of 'special pleading', since effective point mutations seem only to happen in the plasmid DNA of eubacteria, protists, and a few simple plants. The same group that goes through HGT in their plasmid DNA. NOT their chromosomal DNA. Organisms using cells containing plasmid DNA seem to be a special case. Only a few basic lifeforms, as above, possess them.\n More importantly, the use of plasmid DNA to solve adaptation challenges, both in terms of immune defenses and evolutionary responses, is systemic in these types of organisms, and mutations in plasmid DNA are only evolutionary, i.e., semi-permanent, when they are incorporated into the chromsomal DNA, which never happens if they are destructive and entropic, so far as I can tell.\n Speaking of what I can tell, I am not a geneticist and the onus is not on me, wrt to this debate, to go out and earn a phd in genetics. The onus is on those geneticists in this debate to prove that evolution can be adaptively accomplished by randomly occurring point mutations, or randomly occurring genetic mutations of any degree of complexity. So far in our discourse only the lightest skimming of the genetic literature to be found online is enough to convince me that even the deletion of a plasmid gene is of accidental origin when it brings benefit to the bacteria or yeast that undergoes it. Accident seems to be no more than an assumption.

   "Yes, it is. Or did you think that the immune systems coughs up random variations on decorative sewing, or games of solitaire, or cloud formations, instead of remedies for organismic ailments?\n\n \n Does RM do any of those things? No, it doesn't; it causes genetic change, so let's have no more silly strawmen, hmm? \n \n \nNo, of course I don't. And any systemic action, if it is at all variable wrt to proximate circumstances, rather than permanent, fixed, predetermined and immutable, is actually 'informed selection' and not \"mechanical filtering\" at all.\n\n \n We are discussing the nature of variation, not of the filtering that follows it.\n \n \nYou know perfectly well that the word brainstorm applies oly to human heuristic processes. I've told you that unconscious, non-analytical heuristic problem-solving processes are not 'brainstorming', but only heuristically analogous. So why, after 2-3 corrections, do you continue to misuse the word?\n\n \n Probably because you earlier gave two analogies for organismic exploring of genetic fitness space: 'coin tossing' and 'brainstorming'. You specifically highlighted the applicable quality of the latter being that it produced 'on topic' solutions, and asked that we distinguish between accident and an error. So I respond by demonstrating that the immune system does not do anything analogous to 'brainstorming'. Lower down, you agree with me by saying the output is statistically random! Yet you leap down my throat because I spent time refuting your misuse of a term you introduced! If it's a bad term, retract or amend your claim!\n \n \nAnd again--\"statistically undirected\" simply means nothing more than that, post hoc, the variations produced showed no 'overall' predetermined linear correlation to the successful variation. So what? In any heuristic process the variations offered need only be applicable, not necessarily correct, or even partially correct.\n\n \n You've answered your own question. RM also induces genetic change that is statistically undirected wrt a goal. You've just agreed that so long as the variations are applicable, that's irrelevant when considering whether they can yield results closer to a goal. Thanks :)\n \n \nYour \"statistically random\" _effects_ mean nothing in terms of empirical, systematic _causes_. A systemic cause can methodically generate \"statistically random\" effects, but those effects are NOT randomly, spontaneously, accidentally, unintentionally generated without regard for the system's purpose and immediate goals.\n\n \n You've still not explained why only methodically generated statistically random genetic change can induce a trait. Instead you continue to lecture me about a causal distinction I grasped perfectly well in our very first exchange of posts, months ago. Please try to understand: I get it; I really do. A deliberately rolled dice is different from one accidentally dropped.\n \n What I want you to explain is why, if (as we agreed) an organism is deterministically influenced by which face shows uppermost, the dropped dice isn't capable of inducing an adaptive trait when the deliberately rolled one is.\n \n \nNon-random causation versus random causation is the issue here, as it is always is wrt the question of organismic evolution, not to mention the larger issue of existence itself. \n\n \n That's certainly what you care most about, yes - but that still doesn't constitute a logical argument disallowing the occurrence of random, adaptive mutations. You've just said straight out that it doesn't matter if the mutations supposedly 'induced' in pursuit of the organism's goal are statistically random - why the heck would the organism need to bother doing that, when RM is ever-present? More to the point, why do we see no evidence of 'methodical statistical randomness' (whatever that is), and plenty of evidence of genes being deliberately exposed to the rigors of RM when the organism is under stress?\n \n \nAfter-the fact observations of how the cards were distributed does not change the fact that they were shuffled and dealt purposefully and systematically and methodically, and the only random factor involved was their position ex post facto.\n\n \n But neither you nor anyone else has seen intentional 'shuffling', only the relaxation of safeguards against external random shuffling. One is forced to conclude that the externally instigated shuffling is therefore the source of random variation, and that this 'selective permission' of its activity is an optimisation of a process that would occur anyway.\n \n \n As I continuously pointed out re the assumptions of LD43, those effects could also be teleologically generated.\n\n \n Yes, if we assume RM was teleologically inhibited and then emulated, in the most pointless waste of effort imaginable :)\n \n \nHere is my feeling re 'point mutations'. First, they seem to be a case of 'special pleading', since effective point mutations seem only to happen in the plasmid DNA of eubacteria, protists, and a few simple plants. The same group that goes through HGT in their plasmid DNA. NOT their chromosomal DNA.\n\n \n Er, hello? Chromosomal DNA examples posted several times now. Pretending they haven't been isn't going to make them go away.\n \n \nAnd I have still to hear from you on an example of a novel beneficial trait expressed by an organism, such as a fruit fly, or even a yeast, as the result of a random point mutation brought on by deliberate hyper-radiation.\n\n \n I've done just that; you simply asserted they were systemic and not accidental, and justified that by saying they 'must have been' because they were beneficial. Again and again we bump up against that unsubstantiated belief. Don't you think it's a little ironic that the evidence you keep asking for before you'll consider amending your belief is precisely the sort of evidence your belief allows you to discount? \n \n I show you adaptive gene deletions - you say they're in plasmid DNA (they're not). I show that they occur in a statistically random pattern - you just say it 'must be' teleologically emulated randomness.\n \n Did you ever read Charlie Brown? I feel like I'm trying to kick that football: \"Show me random adaptive traits and I'll reconsider.\" \"Ok, here you go.\" \"SUCKER! That can't be random because it's adaptive!\" *whump*\n \n \nIf so, then no doubt you'll be able to to re-link to those papers on complex, plasmid-free organisms, wherein an unambiguously random point mutation deactivated/deleted a chromsomal gene, which in turn removed an organismic trait, making the organism more productive and efficient.\n\n \n Y'know, I think I'll just let you go back and reread them; they're linked in this thread.\n \n \nDo you deny that any procedure or activity that accurs repeatedly and methodically within a system, rather than as an arbitrary anomaly, is systemic? If the answer to these questions is no, then why try to maintain that gene duplication is accidental and not systemic?\n\n \n Repeatedly is not the same as methodically, WW; try to remember that. And don't forget we're talking about something that happened twice in 2,000,000,000,000 cell generations. 'Methodical'? 'Repeatedly'? Hmmm....\n \n \nSorry, but I missed the part where a collision with a wayward particle accomplished this. They're kind of small, so I can see them splitting a gene--but a complete chromsome?!?! And just at the right time, too! Please forgive my scepticism.\n\n \n Er, the gene is part of the chromosome, WW; you're expressing skepticism about the length of a piece of string scissors can cut :) If you read the article, everything in that arm of the chromosome downstream of the break was translocated and then duplicated.\n \n And again, it happened once in 1000,000,000,000 cell divisions. Not exactly methodical, eh?\n \n \nHow is radiation sickness an 'adaptive' response?\n\n \n Exactly my point. Stress-induced relaxation of error-correction is an 'adaptive response'. Increasing the mutation rate through UV bombardment is not - yet as the linked article showed, it hastened the 'discovery' of a trait adaptive to the current phosphate-limited environment.\n \n \nActually, it sounds a whole lot less like a process of natural evolution, and a whole lot more like an artificial breeding experiment. There seems a ton of non-random intelligence and volition, i.e., teleology, invested in the end result, even if it is human and not the organism's own. So much for 'random' outcomes. It's about as 'random' as breeding cats and dogs.\n\n \n Putting yeast in a phosphate limited environment is 'like' dictating which individual dog breeds with which individual other dog so as to select and amplify traits already empirically present? I rather think not :)\n \n Every environment has some limiting factor on reproduction; the only distinction here is that the scientists knew what it was. It was the same limiting factor as the other experiments I've linked you to in the past, in which two different adaptive traits arose. You can't seriously be suggesting that RM can produce adaptive traits, but only if the environment is 'intelligently chosen', thus shoehorning teleology in somewhere completely unrelated to how the trait actually arose. Because if you are, we'd have to start arguing about how much of any organism's environment is 'teleologically shaped' by the actions of other organisms, and I'm convinced that way, madness lies :)\n \n Intentional enforcement of a particular environment is, as far as the yeast is concerned, indistinguishable from an arbitrary, happenstance occurrence of that environment. I'm willing to discuss mechanisms of directed adaptation, but I'm not prepared to treat 'intent' as some magical quality which, so long as we can find it somewhere in the same room as an adaptive trait somehow makes the adaptation 'intentional'. That's just being silly. The adaptive trait was not already present, and its nature was not chosen by the scientists; your 'dog breeding' analogy is not applicable.\n \n \nAs always, you assume that the plasmid mutation evinced by e.coli. in LD43 is 'accidental', when in fact it is clearly systemic.\n\n \n And, as always, you go back to LD43 when I specifically referred to the Generalised Fluctuation Test, and asume the LD43 mutation involved plasmids when to my knowledge it was not actually identified at all. It's very unlikely it was anything of the kind, since plasmid-based phage immunity is lysogenesis: incorporation of the phage in such a way that it is replicated with the bacteria rather than at the expense of the bacteria. It is only called 'immunity' because lysogenic phage occasionally becomes lytic, bursting out of the host cell and infecting any non-phage-carrying bacteria with the destructive lytic variant. Virulent phage, on the other hand - which the strain used in LD43 was - cannot be accommodated lysogenically, and invariably destroys the host cell at the end of its lifecycle. The only way to survive is to avoid infection entirely.\n \n So LD43 almost certainly wasn't a plasmid-based immunity. Care to advance any other hypotheses? :)",

No, it doesn't; it causes genetic change, so let's have no more silly strawmen, hmm?\n\n \n **\n Strawman?!? My point was made wrt your,--\n \n \"That's what 'undirected' means - it doesn't speak to why variation is occurring, it refers to the distribution of that variation, and whether it's biased towards a particular objective. In the immune system it isn't;\",\n \n -- and I was showing that _the immune system_, and not some hypothetical 'random cause', is in fact causing genetic changes that are biased towards a particular goal--that being restoring or enhancing the well-being of the organism'\n \n More importantly than that, even, is that when darwinists use the term, \"random mutation\" they denote or connote, \"random causation\", rather than \"random effect\", even though they they know that they can only speak to \"random effect\". This is dishonest, or at least misleading, depending upon how deliberate it is. The assumption and implication intended to be accepted by their listeners being that discovering no mechanical pattern in a series, set, or collection, or isolated group of outcomes, that in those instances in those sets results can be classified as 'random', in the statistical sense. And that much is true and honest. So long as one speaks to genetic mutations strictly wrt to outcomes/effects, 'statistically random' is a valid term.\n \n But the fact of the matter is that these debates are not about all the variation in life forms that we see on earth, and find in the fossil record, as evidence of the EFFECTS of the evolutionary process, nor is it at all concerned with labelling all the variation within the planet's biosystem as 'statistically random', and finally, it is not about, in the present narrower sense, about the broad, non-mechanically restrictive, open variation found in the genome. It is always and and only about the CAUSE or causes of that 'statistical randomness'.\n The assumption repeatedly asserted by darwinists is the false and misleading one, that is, that statistically random effects can only arise from a statistically random array of causes, instead of intentional and systemic causes. Since quite obviously the assumption that effects which are statistically random are only and always the result of causes that are statistically random, the appeal to \"statistically random\" effects in the study of evolutionary causation is not only irrelevent, but false and misleading and deceptive.\n \n Bottom line, the assertion that, \"Does RM do any of those things? No, it doesn't; it causes genetic change\", is false, misleading, and deceptive, because it implies emphatically that all causes of genetic change are the same-- anomalous, arbitrary, non-systemic and accidental. But aside from destructive mutations brought about by anomalous, arbitrary, non-systemic, accidentally involved radiation or other toxic particles mutationally imposed upon the organism by chance, there is no empirical evidence that any 'causes' of genetic mutation are 'random' as opposed to 'systemic', or that all endogenously generated genetic mutations are not systemically intentional, for better or for worse. Most importantly of all, there is absolutely no reason to assume, as do the darwinists, that the causes of any 'beneficial wrt the organism' genetic mutations are exogenously sourced in those accidental and entropic collisions/interactions with particles/toxic molecules.\n This is strictly a metaphysical assumption prompted by out-dated materialist mechanics.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No, of course I don't. And any systemic action, if it is at all variable wrt to proximate circumstances, rather than permanent, fixed, predetermined and immutable, is actually 'informed selection' and not \"mechanical filtering\" at all. \n \n \n We are discussing the nature of variation, not of the filtering that follows it.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!? You're the one who insists upon interjecting \"mechanical filtering\" into our discussion of immune systemics! Suddenly I can't respond to that?!?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You know perfectly well that the word brainstorm applies oly to human heuristic processes. I've told you that unconscious, non-analytical heuristic problem-solving processes are not 'brainstorming', but only heuristically analogous. So why, after 2-3 corrections, do you continue to misuse the word? \n \n \n Probably because you earlier gave two analogies for organismic exploring of genetic fitness space: 'coin tossing' and 'brainstorming'.\n\n \n **\n So if I use imperfect analogies as an aid to comprehension you are justified in attacking them as literal pronouncements of fact!?!?! Talk about strawmen!\n \n \n \n\n You specifically highlighted the applicable quality of the latter being that it produced 'on topic' solutions, and asked that we distinguish between accident and an error. So I respond by demonstrating that the immune system does not do anything analogous to 'brainstorming'.\n\n \n **\n Like heck you did! The analogy, albeit imperfect, as all analogies tend to be, is spot on, for all your attempts to attack it, not as an alalogy, but as a matter of fact. Which it was never intended to be, and was clearly introduced, by me, as an analogy only. This sort of sophistry dulls the lustre of your arguments, to say the least.\n \n \n\n Lower down, you agree with me by saying the output is statistically random! \n\n \n **\n Agree with what?! As pointed out, above, the issue is causation, not output!\n The output of human 'brainstorming', 'cointossing', and 'random number generating' is also 'statistically random', but the generation/causation of those effects is purposefully non-random, i.e., systematic. And that is all that matters to this debate. The issue of \"the output is statistically random\" is a big 'so what?!', and a red herring as far as this debate is concerned.\n \n \n\n Yet you leap down my throat because I spent time refuting your misuse of a term you introduced! If it's a bad term, retract or amend your claim!\n\n \n **\n You give yourself far too much credit. Knocking down your strawman is not,\n \"refuting your misuse of a term you introduced\", as you claim, since in any legitimate sense I've never misused the term.

So what? In any heuristic process the variations offered need only be applicable, not necessarily correct, or even partially correct. \n \n \n You've answered your own question.\n\n \n **\n You mean my \"So what?\"? Of course I have, showing that your objection, i.e., \"statistically undirected\", is immaterial.\n \n \n\n RM also induces genetic change that is statistically undirected wrt a goal.\n\n \n **\n First of all, once again, \"RM\" induces nothing at all. \"RM\" is that which is induced by something else. For metaphysical reasons post-fisherian darwinists have claimed that that unidentified 'something else' was purely and simply background radiation and environmental toxicity. But after nearly 90 years of bombarding bacteria, yeasts, and fruitflies with radioactivity, they have absolutely nothing, including your vaunted yeast experiment, with which to back up that metaphysical assumption empirically. Instead the offspring of those cells and organisms treated with radiation and poisonous additives were always maimed, crippled, and disfigured monsters. The sort of 'mutants' that the Japanese, thanks to Hiroshima no doubt, used to make movies about.\n \n These past few decades the focus, after so much failure, has shifted to internal system breakdown, that is, the supposition of 'copying errors' assumed to have taken place internally, but still accidentally, meaninglessly.\n The real reason behind it all,-- the driving metaphysical motive, that being to convince the world that creation, including the creation of life and new biological traits, is essentially meaningless and unintentional. But that, too, is a failure, since all that is ever demonstrated is that the course of biological change, evolution, is not mechanically predetermined, linear, and inflexible. It can be, and often is, (seen 'ex post facto'), \"statistically random\". Which says nothing more than a billion irradiated fruitflies have already told us--i.e., that birth defects happen. The origins of anything that is not defective is assumed, illegitimately, to arise from vague and unspecified (aka, 'random') causes, supposedly of exactly the same kind as those which bring about birth defects. Population geneticists have spent tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of grant dollars to this express metaphysical purpose. With nothing of substance to show for all that effort and expence, save a few dubious showpieces such as your yeast experiment and the infamous LD43.\n \n \n\n You've just agreed that so long as the variations are applicable, that's irrelevant when considering whether they can yield results closer to a goal. Thanks \n\n \n **\n I don't know what it is that you refer to when you say, \"that's irrelevant\". I say the _range_ of variation (within the parameters of general applicability) is irrelevant. If they are within that range then what they each are, specifically, is irrelevent, because within that range are some that can/might \" yield results closer to a goal\"; the goal that, heuristically, itself establishes the parameters of the range. Such as survival, well-being, and the ability to reproduce.\n I've been saying that for years, and long before I started repeating it in this thread. I don't know what it is that you think I'm saying, if not that.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Your \"statistically random\" _effects_ mean nothing in terms of empirical, systematic _causes_. A systemic cause can methodically generate \"statistically random\" effects, but those effects are NOT randomly, spontaneously, accidentally, unintentionally generated without regard for the system's purpose and immediate goals. \n \n \n You've still not explained why only methodically generated statistically random genetic change can induce a trait.\n\n \n **\n When have I ever made that claim?!? I have clearly stated that radiation and other toxins can generate the kind of traits we call birth defects. The issue is whether or not adaptively novel traits can arise accidentally, albeit that being 'statistically random' is immaterial and irrelevent to the fact of systemically generated novel adaptive traits. The gene duplication in your yeast experiment is not 'statistically random', but straightforward as far as the organismic need is concerned. OTH, it was probably a 'statistically random' mutation within a range of mutations systemically generated in the process of heuristically determining the best available solution to the immediate nutrition problem.\n \n \n\n What I want you to explain is why, if (as we agreed) an organism is deterministically influenced by which face shows uppermost, the dropped dice isn't capable of inducing an adaptive trait when the deliberately rolled one is.\n\n \n **\n Because you are assuming a world in which an accidentally dropped die can yield the same pay-off as one deliberately rolled in a #### shoot. Believe me it can't and won't. Try dropping a die accidentally and then demanding a pay-off from your companions. All you'll get is hoots of laughter, or maybe worse.\n Pay-offs, including adaptive traits, are system and methodology dependent. That is, no outcome produces a pay-off unless it has first been correlated, systemically and methodologically, to that pay-off.\n \n Quote:\n Non-random causation versus random causation is the issue here, as it is always is wrt the question of organismic evolution, not to mention the larger issue of existence itself. \n \n \n That's certainly what you care most about, yes - but that still doesn't constitute a logical argument disallowing the occurrence of random, adaptive mutations.[/quote]\n \n **\n No, you are quite correct, that is the issue, not the logical argument I have put forward supporting my side of the debate. The argument you blithely ignore, and pretend has never been made, no matter how many times I repeat it.\n \n \n\n You've just said straight out that it doesn't matter if the mutations supposedly 'induced' in pursuit of the organism's goal are statistically random - why the heck would the organism need to bother doing that, when RM is ever-present?\n\n \n **\n I've always said that, because it's true. Heuristically, the statistically random variation in systemically generated output is, within the parameters established by correlation to a desired outcome, immaterial to the question of causation, and causation, not outcome, is the issue here. Intentional systemic generation can heuristically produce, within a broad range appropriate to a certain goal, various outputs. But the issue is still this-- can a stochastically random, accidental, arbitrary _cause_ of any kind produce an adaptive, novel, increase in systemic efficiency and productivity in output, such as has yet to be observed above the molecular level in which geneticists and molecular biologists _assume_ it to take place? You never prove that to be the case, but demand instead that people such as myself prove a negative by demonstrating empirically, inductively, that it cannot take place. An empirical impossibility, but rationally demonstrable, deductively, as I have done repeatedly with the argument that you pretend I've never made.\n \n \n\n More to the point, why do we see no evidence of 'methodical statistical randomness' (whatever that is), \n\n \n **\n Call it systemically generated heuristic variation and you'll trip all over it, including in your own evolutionary computer simulations.\n \n \n\n and plenty of evidence of genes being deliberately exposed to the rigors of RM when the organism is under stress?\n\n \n **\n There you go again, conflating \"random mutation\", that is, statistically random output/effects, with a metaphysically 'random' cause!! Stress is a real organismic response that does not arise, 'accidentally', but systemically, in a self-adjusting productive complex system that is being negatively impacted by some externally introduced agency. Hyper-mutation, for instance, is a systemic genetic response to stress, (along with other organismic responses). None of these responses are 'accidental'. They are the output of an heuristic methodology that is part and parcel of that biosystem, and randomness has nothing to do with that kind of causation.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n But neither you nor anyone else has seen intentional 'shuffling', only the relaxation of safeguards against external random shuffling.\n\n \n **\n So you say. I say that when organisms reconfigure themselves to be better suited to the immediate circumstances in which they find themselves, that that self-adaptation is no less intentional and systemic than anything a human being might do in the same position, even without the conscious, analytical deliberation that humans undertake. When you are cold do you have to make yourself shiver, or when hot, make yourself sweat? When our fellow humans are starving, do they have to wilfully overcome the bacterial poisoning that comes with dumpster-diving?\n \n That fact is that self-serving, self-adjusting, self-organizing, self-adapting biosystems act intentionally, i.e., intelligently and voluntarily, when they act systemically, because if they could only act mechanically, they could never adapt, and if they could only wait passively for an externally arriving fortuitous accident to occur, they could never survive long enough. The constrained flexibility of the whole organism, its individual cells, the immune systems it employs, and so on, demonstrate intentional 'shuffling' in direct response to present, immediate need, to anyone whose eyes are not blinkered by materialist ideology.\n \n \n\n One is forced to conclude that the externally instigated shuffling is therefore the source of random variation,\n\n \n **\n No, it is only the stimulus. The actual source/cause of the internal 'shuffling' is the intentional heuristic systemic response to that external stimulus by the organism as one whole, autopoietic, complex system. Sometimes the scenario has been replayed so many times that organisms have automated their immune responses to the point where they have what might be seen as a mechanical or inherited or instinctive response behaviour. Even at the most primitive and simple levels of cell-based lifeforms, such as eubacteria and protists. LD43 being a case in point.\n \n The fact is, only \"one\" already convinced of the materialist/mechanist spontaneous generation, i.e., magical creation, scenario \"is forced to conclude that the externally instigated shuffling is therefore the source of random variation\", by totally ignoring the internal control exercised by the organism over what gets 'shuffled' and how. \n \n \n\n and that this 'selective permission' of its activity is an optimisation of a process that would occur anyway.\n\n \n **\n Oh, puhleeze!!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n As I continuously pointed out re the assumptions of LD43, those effects could also be teleologically generated. \n \n \n Yes, if we assume RM was teleologically inhibited and then emulated, in the most pointless waste of effort imaginable \n\n \n \n **\n You keep forgetting that RM is an effect, and repeatedly refer to it as a cause, which it is not. Heuristic methodology is no emulation of stochastic amethodical accident. Heuristic, methodical, system-caused variation bears only a very shallow, facile resemblance to stochastic, i.e., random, multicausal variation. You might as well compare shuffling and dealing a deck of cards according to the rules of a game, to simply throwing them up in the air for the fun of it.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Here is my feeling re 'point mutations'.

You presented one highly dubious, from the point of view of the scientific method, yeast experiment. And even in that terribly unnatural, unscientific, arithmetical exercise, you appealed to gene duplication, which has nothing whatsoever to do with externally generated radioactive bombardment;-- unless you dare claim that a very particular set of conditions, wherein not only the place where a code may be cut, but the instant when it might be cut, which are very tiny windows of opportunity, along with the remote chance that the cut pieces might fortuitously find each other, is not FAPP, mathematically impossible. If you are willing to put that much faith in fortuitous chance accident, you might as well put your faith in magic while you're at it. AFAIC, they are equally impossible.\n \n \n\n Again and again we bump up against that unsubstantiated belief.\n\n \n **\n Which ones?

Instead you keep throwing up tendentious inferences drawn from arithmetical, statistical exercises such as LD43 and your yeasts. You don't seem to realize that science determines causation by observing the correlation between a narrowly circumscribed cause/effect test event, i.e., experiment, with controls built in to avoid tendentious speculation.\n Instead, you offer statistically based 'after-effect', 'ex post facto' comparisons, without controls, that allow nothing but speculation wrt causation!!

You you show me effects that resemble stochastic effects, and on the basis of appearance alone you deny that those effects are heuristically generated. But the fact of the matter is that on the basis of appearance alone, only the degree of correspondence between the effects generated and the state of the organism can decide whether or not those effects are non-coincidental, non-accidental, non-stochastic, systemically intentional, and heuristically self-induced. Despite the fact that they are in fact closely correspondent to immediate organismic need, and there, prima facie evidence of heuristic generation, you simply insist that they 'must be' the result of various unstipulated and gratuitous chance accidents that, utterly disconnected from the state of the organism, fortuitously supplied it with the very thing it needed at that exact time and place. It truly beggers belief!!\n \n \n\n Did you ever read Charlie Brown?

That can't be random because it's adaptive!\" *whump*\n\n \n **\n Charley may be a good analogy, but if I'm to be Lucy, I'm not pulling the ball out of spite, but simply because you repeatedly fail to scientifically prove that what you call, 'randomly generated adaptive traits', actually are generated randomly, rather then systemically and systematically, stochastically rather than methodically and heuristically.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n If so, then no doubt you'll be able to to re-link to those papers on complex, plasmid-free organisms, wherein an unambiguously random point mutation deactivated/deleted a chromsomal gene, which in turn removed an organismic trait, making the organism more productive and efficient. \n \n \n Y'know, I think I'll just let you go back and reread them; they're linked in this thread.\n\n \n **\n Well, thanks very much, but I've already read them once without seeing what you think I should see, so unless you wish to direct my attention to something specific that you think supports your argument, I'll pass on doing it for you. But again I thank you for the link to the human immune system. Practically makes my argument for me, all by itself!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Do you deny that any procedure or activity that accurs repeatedly and methodically within a system, rather than as an arbitrary anomaly, is systemic? If the answer to these questions is no, then why try to maintain that gene duplication is accidental and not systemic? \n \n \n Repeatedly is not the same as methodically, WW; try to remember that.\n\n \n **\n Actually, I have an above average grasp of the meanings of English words, peeling. For instance, in this case--\n \"SYNONYMS orderly, methodical, systematic.[bold added] These adjectives mean proceeding in or observant of a prescribed pattern or arrangement. Orderly especially implies correct or customary procedure or proper or harmonious arrangement: an orderly evacuation of the burning building; orderly and symmetrical rows. Methodical stresses adherence to a logically and carefully planned succession of steps: methodical instructions for assembly. Systematic emphasizes observance of a coordinated and orderly set of procedures constituting part of a complex but unitary whole: systematic research into antigens to combat immune disorders.\"[answers.com]\n \n These three synonyms apply to systemic procedures and operations and processes, all of which tend to entail a specified methodology repeated under \n varying circumstances.\n \n \n\n And don't forget we're talking about something that happened twice in 2,000,000,000,000 cell generations. 'Methodical'? 'Repeatedly'? Hmmm....\n\n \n **\n I've been thinking that you were referring back to the yeast experiment in the EAM thread, but this talk of radiation made me look back to see what else you might be referring to, and your post #118 refers to a different yeast experiment, but with a failed link, \n http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1213812&blobtype=pdf\n \n Therefore I have been unable to read that paper and thus am unable to discuss it.\n \n If you wish to fix the link I'll look at it.\n \n Later, ww.",
