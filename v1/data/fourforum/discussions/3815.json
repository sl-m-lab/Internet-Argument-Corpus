   "Reincarnation\n \n Throughout human history people have wondered about life after death. Is death the end of existence, an entry into eternity, or an intermission between earthly lives? These questions have intrigued and haunted mortals for the millennia. \n \n Some Eastern religions such as Hinduism teach that the soul reincarnates in many different bodies. Because of the influence of the New Age movement, approximately twenty five percent of Americans now believe in reincarnation. Celebrities such as actress Shirley MacLaine and country singer Willie Nelson believe they have lived before and will live again. \n \n In Eastern religions, reincarnation is connected with the law of karma; it teaches that good deeds from past lives produce rewards in the next life or lives. Bad deeds produce punishments in the next life or lives. The law of karma is understood as an unbending and impersonal rule of the universe. We all get what we deserve. This consoles some who agonize over the apparent injustices in the world. And by working off one&#8217;s bad karma over many lifetimes, a person can finally escape the process of rebirth and attain enlightenment. \n \n Can reincarnation realistically offer hope and a sense of justice to a troubled world? Can it answer the nagging problem of death and what lies beyond?\n \n We should take a second look at reincarnation. Even reincarnationists admit that the vast majority of humans do not remember their previous lives. \n \n How can we learn from our past mistakes if we cannot remember them?\n \n In cultures such as India, the law of karma has justified not helping the suffering because it is thought that they are working off their bad karma. The lowest social class (caste) in India, the Untouchables, have been traditionally viewed as deserving their fate because of actions in previous lives. To help an Untouchable would be like releasing a guilty felon from prison. \n \n According to reincarnation, the innocent do not suffer. All suffering is deserved on the basis of bad karma. The baby born without legs deserved it, as did the woman who was raped. There is no injustice&#8212;and no forgiveness. None are innocent, and there is no grace available&#8212;only the demands of karma. \n \n Karma or Gospel?\n \n Jesus spoke of people receiving either eternal reward or eternal punishment according to how they responded to him during their one lifetime on earth (Matthew 25:31-46; see also Hebrews 9:27). He also declared that he would raise the dead at the end of history; those who believed in him would experience life, those who rejected him would be condemned (John 5:24-29). \n \n Discuss these two contrasting views and stop and think about an important question. Can we put these ideas about eternal life or another life after this life, and our death to a Test? In this lifetime?",

   "To me the promise of a better \"next life\" is akin to the Christian promise of a better \"afterlife\". Both concepts serve to keep the \"have-nots\" in their place while the \"haves\" live it up.\n\n \n Actually, the opposite is the proven case in history and in current events.\n \n The lower caste peoples of India are set free and released in Jesus Christ to change and become who ever they please. As an example, prostitutes can set free to change in India or the USA!\n \n Rev. Paul Swarup .....is a young man not long back from Cambridge University, where he earned his Ph.D. in Old Testament. \"The exciting thing is,\" he says, \"God is really at work in India&#8212;in every part of India.\n \n In the last ten years, our situation has definitely changed.\" He laughs. \"Even in the mainline churches, God is at work.\"\n \n Swarup tells how home groups at St. James have recently taken form. Members are beginning to invite their neighbors from other faiths.\n \n \"Christians don't feel cut off from their neighbors?\" I ask.\n \n \"I don't think so,\" Swarup answers. \"At the local level, I don't think there is any animosity.\"\n \n Each week, he says, two or three people seek him out wanting to become Christians. \"They don't know the gospel. They just know this God may answer my prayer.\" A Hindu couple began to worship every Sunday, even though they speak no English. \"They were troubled by evil spirits. I got them a Hindi Bible, and they began to read it. They said they wanted to be baptized.\"\n \n Students from nearby university dormitories often come to the church to pray. Some ask for Bible study, to learn about Jesus. At Christmas, hundreds will come for special services, and will, at Swarup's invitation, approach the altar to receive a blessing. Even here in North India, where Christians are few and resistance can be fierce, boundaries are porous. Spiritual seeking leads people to St. James Church.\n \n As for the persecution that makes international news, St. James experiences none. \"There's complete freedom of worship here. We experience no pressure. Hindu militants will not make a noise in the city. If a church were burned in Delhi, it would be front-page news in every paper.\"\n \n Growth Amid Threats\n \n A week later I worship in a very different church&#8212;a poor, rural Pentecostal congregation outside Bangalore, in the south of India. A new, plastered structure, almost devoid of furniture, vibrates to earsplitting rhythms of song, accompanied only by drum. Women in brilliant saris sit on mats and lift up their hands; men take plastic chairs in back. The air is close with body heat and perspiration. I am scheduled to preach&#8212;a fact I discovered upon my arrival an hour before. No matter. I have visited rural churches in Third World countries before. I know it pays to keep a three-point outline handy.\n \n After the service, I am besieged with people seeking spiritual help, so many crowding around me that I get backed into a corner and can't move. My translator tells me the request of each person, and I lay hands on their heads or hold their calloused hands while I pray. Some are sick; some need work; some want husbands to return home. They are oppressed by spirits, worry about pending school exams, or have family disputes. One complaint I do not immediately understand. \"She has Fitz,\" my translator says. \"What?\" I ask. \"Fitz,\" he says again. \"You know, Fitz! Fitz!\" It dawns on me: the lady has fits. Epilepsy, perhaps. I pray for her.\n \n Over lunch Pastor Jayakanth explains how the church came into existence. He is a matter-of-fact young man with a handsome face. Seven years ago, his job with the electricity utility brought him to town. Coming from a thriving Assemblies of God congregation in the city, he found no church of any denomination, and no Christians. The region was known for its staunch Hindu beliefs. Local people said they had murdered the last Christian who came to win converts.\n \n Nevertheless Jayakanth rented a 10-by-10-foot room, recruited a handful of believers whose work had also transferred them into the region, and began to hold services. It took a year to make his first convert. A breakthrough came with the local prostitutes, whom he witnessed to on the street late at night. A congregation began to grow. When Jayakanth's wife gave birth to premature twins, each weighing less than two pounds, doctors predicted they could not live. Pastor Jayakanth fasted and prayed for three days, the children survived, and word of a miracle spread. More people came to church and were baptized. Temple leaders began to ask why they didn't come to temple anymore, or contribute to temple offerings. Some of the former prostitutes' customers complained about their changed way of life.\n \n On Good Friday, a mob interrupted church services and forcibly dragged Jayakanth to the temple. He estimates that a thousand people gathered, shouting insults and cursing him. He was beaten and threatened, then hauled to the police station. Police officers accused him of disturbing the peace. Hadn't he come into the district trying to convert people to his religion? They browbeat him into signing a statement that he would no longer go out into surrounding villages to preach.\n \n After that, the pastor says, \"We don't go to villages, but we are on our knees, and people are coming to us.\" The church continued to grow, which led to a second attack. This time Jayakanth was away when a mob came to the church, beating up those they could catch before taking the church's sound equipment and all its books&#8212;including 5,000 New Testaments&#8212;and burning them.\n \n This time, to Jayakanth's surprise, the police arrested the men who had attacked the church. (He did not press charges.) They even assigned seven officers to provide protection to the church&#8212;all of whom, with their families, have since become Christians.\n \n Opposition has vanished, Jayakanth says. One of the men who led the mob came to the church before his wedding and gave money to help the church obtain electricity. \"Thank you for your testimony,\" he said. Altogether 400 new Christians have been baptized&#8212;including ten upper-caste Brahmin families&#8212;and seven churches have been launched in surrounding villages. (Later in the day I visit one, 75 to 100 people jammed shoulder to shoulder in a small apartment.) Jayakanth still works for the electric utility, using his salary for expenses, such as rent for the outlying churches. Money is tight. But he sees no limit to the growth of the church.[/box]\n \n ChristianityToday.com - Click and Learn!",

They desecrated Hindu idols and destroyed photos of the slain religious leader revered by both Hindu tribals and Bengalis. The Christian converts also raped two female devotees and brutally attacked two men who had come to the ashram for puja (religious rituals).\n \n The next day, Christian converts brutally desecrated another ashram at Jirania Khola and forced the inmates to stop all Hindu rituals and practices at gunpoint. A group of seven armed converted Christian terrorists barged into the ashram and threatened the 150 Hindus with dire consequences if they continued to perform Hindu rites at the ashram. The terrorists fled only after a large group of locals rushed to the ashram.\n \n Due to threats by violent Missionaries and their Christian converts, altogether 11 ashrams, schools and orphanages set up by the murdered Hindu leader in various parts of the state have been forcibly closed down by the Christian fundamentalist terrorist organization known as \"National Liberation Front of Tripura\" (NLFT).\n \n In early October the same Christian fundamentalists had issued a diktat ordering the indigenous tribal Hindus to stay away from Durga Puja celebrations (Hindu Festival) and warned that any tribal members seen taking part in the festival would be instantly killed. In its official public statement, the NLFT said it wanted all tribals in Tripura to become Christians. They also stated that salvation for Tripura lies only in Christianity and would eliminate anyone who dared to come in the way of their plans to forcibly convert all of Tripura to Christianity.\n \n NFLT is still an active and powerful terrorist organization that operates in Northeast India. They have converted many Hindus and tribals forcibly at gunpoint, and are involved in rapes, and assassinations.

   "karma is, inevitably, a true mystery, which applies to what my post in the forum in phycology, subject truth. you can believe what you want, but this is my truth. \n \n Scientists have proven that there is indefinitly an aura-like energy that surrounds every human. i believe that, with this proof, and that even the bible and pictures of Jesus (which i believe that the bible says is forbiddin) say and show an aura-like substance floating usually around the head and shoulders. i have concluded that this is our soul, and this soul does, indeed have karma, and only it is reborn. not our looks, or certin branches of our personality, just spirit, and that is the reason that there is such a thing as karma, judging that of which you have portrayed (negitive and positive energys) and the net energy depends on where and who your soul is born.\n\n \n Graven images of God are forbidden and considered idoltry.\n \n Jesus was also fully human, and in Byzantium, after much strife and battles over icons, it was decided that the representation of Jesus was not idoltry.\n \n Not that some haven't crossed the line to worship an image, and in truth, perhaps all Christians are guilty of some kind of idoltry.\n \n As far a Karma goes, I'm not sure what you are saying, do you think you could discern Bad Vs. Good Karma???",

   "If any group of religions seeks to deny the very objectivity and existence of ideas like corruption and good and evil, it is Hinduism. (and Buddhism, and New Agers)\n\n \n Woah! Bold claim, saying Hinduism denies the existence of corruption and good. I wish you would read my previous posts. If you still believe that Hinduism denies any such thing, please tell me why you think so. I can help clear the confusion up for you.\n \n \nSwedish physicist Krister Renard writes: \n \n In the worldviews of the East, the starting point is that all observations are of an illusionary character. A Hindu considers that the western (Judeo-Christian) division of reality into opposite poles as true-false, good-evil, etc., is a sign of an immense immaturity. \n\n \n Not really. It is just that Hindus do not think anything can be so easily catogorized into this or that, black or white.\n \n \n \nThe Hindu philosophers regard our conceptions as empty of content. Conceptions as true, false, good, evil are to them Maya, i.e., void and illusion.\n\n \n This guy (Krister Renard) should read up a little on Hindu vedas before he speaks. Hinduism does not say that \"true, false, good, evil\" are fake. They are very real. The concept of Maya states that reality itself is what is not existing. Maya does not speak about moral issues being fake. Maya speaks about existence (as is physical existence).\n \n \n \nHowever, the Eastern way of thinking which also includes the view that something simultaneously can be true and false, does not work when we study physical reality. \n\n \n No, when studying physical properties, it does not work. Hinduism never claims the dual nature of physical properties. It does claim the dual nature of intangible concepts. For example, if you were to kill someone in self defence, Hinduism states that your killing cannot be reduced to something as simple as, \"you killed. you are a murderer.\"\n \n Please, if you have any more misconceptions about Hinduism, do not be afraid to ask. I don't want you come to false conclusions.\n \n BTW, this is the third time you've posted this exact same post over two different forums.",

I am sorry your faith has made you believe so (though i seriously doubt the christian faith says anything to that effect).\n \n Atleast i agree with you that it is hard to tell where evil came from.\n \n And your last point there makes no sense, especially the part of God being both good and evil.\n \n And though your closed mind may think so, Shiva was in no way evil. I challenge you to point out any time when he is.\n \n Finally, SINCE YOU OFFERED NO REBUTTAL TO ANY OF THE POINTS LISTED IN MY PREVIOUS ARGUMENT, let it be known that you (Richbee) concede that Hinduism does not believe evil and good and etc. to be illusionary.",
