   "Further proof that Global Warming is a farce just perpepuated by left wing whackos.........\n \n http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-329es.html\n \n Policy Analysis\n Long Hot Year:\n Latest Science Debunks Global Warming Hysteria\n \n by Patrick J. Michaels\n \n Patrick J. Michaels, a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia, is a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute.\n \n Executive Summary\n \n The national media have given tremendous play to the claims of Vice President Al Gore, some federal scientists, and environmental activists that the unseasonably warm temperatures of this past summer were proof positive of the arrival of dramatic and devastating global warming. In fact, the record temperatures were largely the result of a strong El Ni\u00f1o superimposed on a decade in which temperatures continue to reflect a warming that largely took place in the first half of this century.\n \n Observed global warming remains far below the amount predicted by computer models that served as the basis for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Whatever record is used, the largest portion of the warming of the second half of this century has mainly been confined to winter in the very coldest continental air masses of Siberia and northwestern North America, as predicted by basic greenhouse effect physics. The unpredictability of seasonal and annual temperatures has declined significantly. There has been no change in precipitation variability. In the United States, drought has decreased while flooding has not increased.\n \n Moreover, carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere at a rate below that of most climate-change scenarios because it is being increasingly captured by growing vegetation. The second most important human greenhouse enhancer -- methane -- is not likely to increase appreciably in the next 100 years. And perhaps most important, the direct warming effect of carbon dioxide was overestimated. Even global warming alarmists in the scientific establishment now say that the Kyoto Protocol will have no discernible impact on global climate.",

   "You are citing an article that is 7 years old.\n \n Here is NASA on what we would need to \"prove\" human caused global warming:\n \n \nWe would have needed 50 to 100 years of accurate satellite observations (not model-based inferences) of the radiative components of the Earth's radiation budget: at least the amount of absorbed sunlight and the amount of emitted infrared radiation. It has been exceedingly difficult from the limited record of satellite measurements to extract a signal of radiation imbalance in the climate system (let alone diagnose what has caused it). Over the period of a sufficiently accurate satellite record, we would need to be able to measure an increasing imbalance between absorbed sunlight and Earth-emitted infrared radiation. Then, through additional global-scale measurements, we would need to be able to rule out natural changes in clouds, water vapor, deep ocean heat storage, and any other process that could explain some or the entire radiation imbalance.\n\n \n That is also what you need to DISPROVE global warming. \n \n We DO know that increased co2 (and other greenhouse gasses)in the upper atmosphere leads to global warming. We do know that there is currently more CO2 in the atmosphere, and we knwo that it is there becuase wqe put it there. These facts are beyond dispute.\n \n The only question is, is the CO2 we put there significant enough to produce global warming? There is absolutly no wuaetion as to whether or not global warming is happening now. In 1998 there was some question, now there is none. The only question is, is the global warming we are seeing a result of human activity, or merely part of a cyclic change that the earth is going through?\n \n Nto only are you living in the past, you are hunting up articles from the past.",

If consumers desire \"green\" products, corporations will make an effort to produce products that at least appear green, and so long as false advertising laws are enforced, this can be expected to have an effect.\n \n You do have a sort of tragedy of the commons going on with air pollution, and it is a difficult issue to deal with. The most common market based approach of course is charging for pollution, which could be done in an at least initially revenue neutral way, resulting in actual tax cuts for those who pollute less, though there are more radical methods available.\n \n Perhaps the most radical solution is to one of the really big polluters, and one I know you have a bone to pick with, cars and trucks. The privatisation of the road system would immediately end the enormous subsidy of it by the taxpayer, and bring economic incentives into line with the real costs of motorised travel. With such a system, \"public\" (as in private, but carrying many people) transportation systems would be expected to prosper. It might be expected that road users would be charged for use with some rough approximation to vehicle weight (due to the much greater wear caused by heavy vehicles), further incentivising the production of light (fuel efficient) vehicles.\n \n Oh, and on the urgency issue again - the ideal issue is one which can be stretched out over decades, and yet remain constantly urgent within that timeframe. One of the \"have to act within 6 months\" campaigns was instigated in 1998 and to my knowledge is still running, because it was so successful in inciting support.",

It is essential for life on Earth and is one of Earth's natural processes. It is the result of heat absorption by certain gases in the atmosphere (called greenhouse gases because they effectively 'trap' heat in the lower atmosphere) and re-radiation downward of some of that heat. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, followed by carbon dioxide and other trace gases. Without a natural greenhouse effect, the temperature of the Earth would be about zero degrees F (-18\u00b0C) instead of its present 57\u00b0F (14\u00b0C). So, the concern is not with the fact that we have a greenhouse effect, but whether human activities are leading to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect.\n \n Are greenhouse gases increasing?\n Human activity has been increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mostly carbon dioxide from combustion of coal, oil, and gas; plus a few other trace gases). There is no scientific debate on this point. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide (prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution) were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv), and current levels are about 370 ppmv. The concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today, has not been exceeded in the last 420,000 years, and likely not in the last 20 million years. According to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration). \n \n Is the climate warming?\n Yes. Global surface temperatures have increased about 0.6\u00b0C (plus or minus 0.2\u00b0C) since the late-19th century, and about 0.4\u00b0F (0.2 to 0.3\u00b0C) over the past 25 years (the period with the most credible data). The warming has not been globally uniform. Some areas (including parts of the southeastern U.S.) have, in fact, cooled over the last century. The recent warmth has been greatest over North America and Eurasia between 40 and 70\u00b0N. Warming, assisted by the record El Ni\u00f1o of 1997-1998, has continued right up to the present, with 2001 being the second warmest year on record after 1998. \n <snip<\n http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate...warming.html#Q1\n \n NOAA gets their funding from the US Government. \n \n Who are you going to believe?",

In the end, it's essentially neither good or bad, it's just a reality that has to be dealt with when you're after the actual truth. That's why the dismissal of anything not produced by an environmental group as being without merit is absurd.\n\n \n NOAA is not an environmental goup. There is much data from non-environmental groups as well. Such as the White House. Of course they dismissed its findings as it was counter the adminstration's current pro-business line. I've already posted all this. You ignored it of course.\n \n \nAs for the tobacco companies, they knew cigarettes were killing people, their science was just fine, the only problem is, they didn't report the results. \n\n \n No, it was more insidious than that. They produced false scientific results and hid the results that showed how bad cigerettes were.\n \n \n\n If you have, then you're well aware of it, if you haven't, then let me explain funding like that provided by the likes of the NOAA to you.\n \n\n I worked at JILA and spent some time working with NOAA in Boulder CO. I also signed up for grants. \n \n What you are studying and what kind of funding you want makes a difference.\n \n \n It set me back big time, but the rocks don't lie, and I wasn't about to lie for them.\n \n\n And others will say anything for big bucks.",

I'd love to see proof of that, but considering you, you'll never be able to prove such a statement. \n \n Seeing how you completely ignored my mockery of your post, here is it again. \n \n Of course Vor, you're right, toxic waste, absestors, known cancer causing agents, rat poision in child toys, arsenic and all sorts of known killers aren't bad at all and the EPA should be disbanded from ever thinking that we shouldn't all such things into the enviroment! In fact, we should be lineing nurseries and day care centers with absetors, we should dump toxic waste into the nation's drinking water, arsenic should be a snack food, and rat poision should be in every meal and every sort of cancer causing agent should be marketed as age slowing drugs!\n \n In fact, the EPA is wrong on alot of things too! Coal and oil power plants should be free to let all sorts of stuff into the air. Acid rain isn't bad. Who cares that we won't be able to fish or hunt or sell land for decent rates? Screw it! We don't need past times such as hunting and fishing. Furthermore, agents that reduce our costs should be free to used whenever. It doesn't matter that many are known to produce birth defects, early death, cancer, blindess, impotency, loss of nervous system, depression, brain chemical imbalances, dementia and all sorts of good stuff. People can deal with it for the $5 they save on eletricity and gas. \n \n The entire thing should be banned. The EPA shouldn't ensure that the nation's enviroment is protected. We should be allowed to rape, pillage, burn and screw the enviroment all we want. \n \n DAMN LIBERAL EPA!",

   "\n \n I'll start my contribution to the debate by simply posting this link -\n \n http://www.friendsofscience.org/index.php?ide=3\n \n Waxy\n\n Thanks alot for the link.\n \n It's great to hear what we aren't taught ABOOT global warming.\n \n \n Ah! But I'm noticing some misdirection tactics in the first clip.\n They start talking about temperatures in cities and a spike from El Nino.\n But these things are not how global temperatures are determined. \n It's usually done with ice cores drilled from glaciers.\n http://www.daviesand.com/Choices/Precautionary_Planning/New_Data/\n \n \n http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/globalwarmA.html\n I like the last diagram that makes the recent upswing in average global tempratures look pretty natural.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3792209.stm\n The way this reads, we are in a warm spell between ice ages.\n Maybe we can stop the next ice age by burning fossil fuels. :)\n \n Clip 2 is good.\n \n The rest of the clips are good too, so why was clip 1 a little shady?\n {shrug} O well.\n \n Another thing: They go on about how water is the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th greenhouse gas and CO2 is a distant 5th, but you know what else comes out of tailpipes or anything that burns hydrocarbons in air, right? Yep, water. Water that wasn't in the atmosphere or the Earth's surface anytime recently. For every molecule of CO2 put out, you have one or two or so molecules of water released also, depending on what hydrocarbon is being burned. \n \n So, without a doubt, burning fossil fuels release large amounts of greenhouse gases. Large amounts of the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th, and 5th top greenhouse gases. Water, water, water, water, and carbon dioxide. \n \n We still haven't figured out if releasing all this into the atmosphere at a rapid and steadily increasing rate, as we have been doing for almost a century, will affect global climate, but why not at least try to curtail usage of fossil fuels until we understand more about it.\n \n The Daily Show last night showed Bush from 2000 saying about global warming \"We need to know more about it before we can do anything.\" Then they showed him the other day in 2005 saying the exact same thing. \n \n If we don't know what harm we may or may not be doing, why do we just keep on doing what we are doing? It's foolish, but maybe we just don't have an alternative. The point is, it's stupid to keep doing something that may be affecting global climate, but we don't know one way or the other. If we don't know what's going on, the stupid thing to do is what we are doing now: ignoring the Kyoto treaty and just burning fossil fuels at ever increasing rates. The smart thing to do would be to at least TRY to curb our appetite for oil and find new sources of energy, set up infrastructure to deal with them, and hopefully we'll have something to run on when gas hits $7/gallon.",

   "Actually allot of the Republican strategy is misdirection. Of course maybe the reason that the Bush administration knows nothing about Global Warming is because their last person in charge of studying that was from deep inside the oil companies. No conflict of interests there!\n \n Now let me try and shed some light on global warming. First off, it is a poor name. It SHOULD be called Global Change. Why? Because not everything will warm! Only certain areas. Here is how it all works.\n \n CO2 and other such chemicals go up and eat away the Ozone layer and add to the greenhouse gases. The Ozone layer, which protects us from radiation, weakens and more of the sun's UV lights are allowed the reach earth. \n \n Now the Greenhouse gases act the same way that your car does. If you ever leave your car outside on a hot day you know that the inside of the car will be much hotter than outside. The reason for this is the glass. It allows hot air to come in, but then traps it by only allowing part of the heat to escape. That is why the inside of a car can be more than 30 degrees hotter than outside! \n \n This is what is happening, u have these UV rays coming to earth and getting stuck here, and they warm the planet. But now you say the temperatures aren't raising as fast as we predicted, that is because we forgot, or were unable to predict other factors. You see glaciers melting and and ice-caps retreating... well what happens when the ice caps melt? That cold war has to be accounted for!\n \n It goes SOUTH, and messes up the Mid Atlantic jet-stream. the MA jet-stream travels from about Maine to the Caribbean islands. It picks up warm water from the islands and brings it north, only to travel south and repeat. The melting ice-caps are interfering with this jet-stream and pulling it more and more off course. This means that the water in our area stays colder, which impacts temperatures in the entire USA, to make them COLDER! In addition it also makes weather more unpredictable and water levels rise.\n \n Any questions class?",

Would increased CO2 in the atmosphere allow plants to grow more heartily and therefore produce more oxygen? \n \n When carbonaceous fuels are burned (let's say hydrocarbons) we make CO2 and water (and CO and some other stuff depending on the impurities). That CO2 and water is just what you need for photosynthesis. The leftover CO2 dissolves in the oceans, and whatever didn't get used by photosynthetic plankton, has a chance to precipitate out with ions like calcium, iron, copper, all kinds of stuff, to make carbonate minerals. These precipitate out of the ocean. They might even go on to make more fossil fuels in the future. So the cycle of life continues. :)\n \n It all depends on the relative rates.\n Are we putting more CO2 and water into the atmosphere than the plants and oceans can handle? Will they be able to process it into organic material and oxygen as fast as we pump it out?",

However there is now strong evidence  that significant global warming is occurring1. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely  that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001)2. This warming has already led to changes in the Earth's climate.\n\n Sure global temperatures have been rising.\n We think that it is likely because of humans due to strong evidence.\n What strong evidence?\n Footnote 1:\n \n1 This statement concentrates on climate change associated with global warming. We use the UNFCCC definition  of climate change, which is 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods'.\n\n Ridiculous definition of climate change.\n \n \nAction taken now to reduce significantly the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lessen the magnitude and rate of climate change. \n \n How the hell do they know that? \n \n \nAs national science academies, we commit to working with governments to help develop and implement the national and international response to the challenge of climate change.\n\n As scientists we will tell you that there is a major problem that can only be solved through science ;), which can only be done with money. We're scientists and we really like grant money to do research. Wouldn't it be great if we had a global initiative to fund this research indefinitely, or until the global warming problem is solved...\n \n Yeah, keep saying there's no debate. :)",

   " It's time to stand up and deal with the problem. There is no 800 year lag: that is pure fabrication\n\n Look dude, first, in order to make a graph like that you have to scale temperature and CO2 levels in such a way that they look like they fit in \"lock step\". Obviously CO2 levels are not measured in degrees celcius. Then, even after you do that, you see that there is a real lag of 800 years. CO2 levels don't rise until after temperatures rise.\n \n Here is a silly explanation of why this doesn't mean anything:\n http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=13\n \n \nSo, in summary, the lag of CO2 behind temperature doesn't tell us much about global warming.\n\n But I'll bet if it were the other way, CO2 increase preceding warming, then he would say that there is a definite cause/effect relationship.\n \n I'd like to know how these ice-core studies are done. I'd like to know what they take into account and how they calculate temperatures and how they take into account anything that may affect the gas concentrations in the ice, things like diffusion and such. Well, this paper linked to in the article explains a lot of methodology.\n \n But think about what this guy is saying.\n \n\n In other words, CO2 does not initiate the warmings, but acts as an amplifier once they are underway. \n\n Then why would temperatures ever go down?\n Shouldn't the Earth be Venus by now?\n \n If CO2 didn't cause the initial 800 years of temperature increases, what did? and why would CO2 amplify anything if it didn't in the first place for 600-1000 years? \n \n\n Moreover, the Taylor Dome ice core, also reveales a lag of 1200 +/- 700 years between CO2 and temperature on shortes time scales (D-O events). See: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/paleo/taylor/indermuehle00grl.pdf\n\n \n And the UN statement is now \"imfamous\".\n \n http://maconareaonline.com/realtalk/reply.asp?mid=8539&threadid=8531&mPageNo=3\n \n I didn't realize that their computer models were off.\n Anyway, this page really tells it better than I ever could.\n \n My whole point is that people are going around saying that the sky is falling and they don't really have any proof of what they are claiming.\n \n \n \nJust like with smoking, there will be \"scientists\" prepared to \"sell their souls\" and say the is no global warming by the money men. Thankfully most of the world has learnt to not listen to such people: to recognise they lie in an attempt to sow doubt and cause inaction. There sadly though remains a number of naive people (all of them in North America as far as I can tell) that accept these lies for selfish reasons or through idiocy. There is no rational doubt: global warming is proven and it is caused by human action. Those that say otherwise argue against reality.\n\n You wanna talk about idiocy and selfishness. The Kyoto protocol is based on junk science, politically influenced and motivated, and even by their own projections, the economically crippling cut in CO2 emissions would have a minor effect on global temperatures at best.\n \n But this is based on computer models, and the computer models used by the IPCC that predicted certain levels of temperature rise have been shown to be wrong. We didn't see the rises predicted by them in 1998.\n \n \nThere clearly is debate still going on, but it is debate about what the medium and long term affects of global warming will be and what, if anything, we can realistically do about it. Any \"debate\" on whether global warming is occuring though is like debating whetehr the Earth is flat: it's assinine people who can't accept the reality of global warming being quietly laughed at, or stared at in disbelief, by the rest of humanity.\n\n Ok, chicken little, yes, during the past 20 years, average global temperatures have risen, so in that sense, in the last 20 years there has been global warming. But to say that we know what is causing it with any degree of certainty and saying that humans have any control over it or knowing \"what, if anything, we can realistically do about it\" is, in your words, assinine.\n \n Like homie here says:\n \nAre you really saying that we have no idea what starts to warm up our world from an ice age but know with near certainty what has caused the warming of the last three decades?\n",

Obviously CO2 levels are not measured in degrees celcius. Then, even after you do that, you see that there is a real lag of 800 years. CO2 levels don't rise until after temperatures rise.\nThe 800 year lag comes from looking at what happens at the end of a glaciation period. You may have your head so buried in the sand that you missed it, but we ain't at the end of a glaciation period at the moment. There has been no 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature rise in the last 800 years: CO2 rise and temperature rise have gone hand-in-hand since the recording of them began. Any claim to the contrary is pure fabrication.\n \n \nI'd like to know how these ice-core studies are done. I'd like to know what they take into account and how they calculate temperatures and how they take into account anything that may affect the gas concentrations in the ice, things like diffusion and such. \nTemperature is calculated by comparing the ratio of O18 and O16 isotopes. CO2 levels are measured directly. Good quality smaples come from sites that have had negligible melting of the ice surface plus a high snow fall rate and little wind turbulance. This gives rise to clear stratigraphic layering. If the impurities are low too, then the air bubbles trapped in the ice contain good quality uncontaminated air samples from the past.\n \n \nThen why would temperatures ever go down?\nFor a variety of reasons: fluctuations in the Earth's orbit and tilt, movement of the continents, changes in volcanic activity, mass extinctions, changes in ocean currents are just some of the things that can affect global weather and mean temperatures.\n \n \nShouldn't the Earth be Venus by now?\nWithout life, it quite possibly would head that way as the carbon cycle would collapse and there would be a run-away build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's where the idea of Gaia came from (before it was hijacked by silly Earth-mother worshipers and turned into a joke): life on Earth keeps the Earth in a semi-stable state suitable for life.\n \n \nIf CO2 didn't cause the initial 800 years of temperature increases, what did? and why would CO2 amplify anything if it didn't in the first place for 600-1000 years? \nThe second half of your question is the easier to answer: CO2 did amplify in the first 800 years, it is just that another cause of temperature rise had a greater affect at such low CO2 concentrations. As to what triggers the start of an interglacial, that is a much more contraversial subject. The most likely cause AFAIK is the Milankovitch cycles.\n \n \nI didn't realize that their computer models were off.\n Anyway, this page really tells it better than I ever could.\nAnd like a mug, you soak it all up. Ignore 99% of the scientific world, because you found a website that says what you want to hear! Pure idiocy.\n \n \nMy whole point is that people are going around saying that the sky is falling and they don't really have any proof of what they are claiming.\nAnd my whole point is: you are wrong: we have the proof. You just won't listen to it.\n \n \nYou wanna talk about idiocy and selfishness. The Kyoto protocol is based on junk science, politically influenced and motivated, and even by their own projections, the economically crippling cut in CO2 emissions would have a minor effect on global temperatures at best.\nIndeed claiming that the Kyoto protocol is based on junk science is idiocy and insisting that the USA do nothing despite other \"developed\" nations signing up to do something is selfishness.\n \n \nOk, chicken little...\nKeep that head firmly stuck in the sand mate, for the bulk of the world is turning \"chicken little\" around you.

Anyone that claims otherwise, is IMHO, outright lying or ignorant of the data.\n \n I think Kyoto was good is essence - it raised awareness of the problem, and it's a first step, but I think the actual plan, or more specifically, the lack of any actual plan, that characterizes the accord just points out how little we know and just how half cocked the whole thing is. \n \n There's a healthy dose of political pandering that's closely intertwined with Kyoto. In these times, any type of a stance that can be spun as anti-environment is political suicide, especially in Europe. I'm sure you're aware of that.\n \n I'm all for continued study of the issue. I'm not sure we'll ever really understand it, and I'm actually quite sure that we'll never be able to control or affect it intentionally, there are too many variables. \n \n Like any other topic though, the more we know and understand, the better we'll be able to manage the situation.\n \n Waxy",

   "You may have your head so buried in the sand that you missed it,\n\n Are we emotionally invested in this debate?\n \nAny claim to the contrary is pure fabrication.\n\n Of course.\n \n\n For a variety of reasons: fluctuations in the Earth's orbit and tilt, movement of the continents, changes in volcanic activity, mass extinctions, changes in ocean currents are just some of the things that can affect global weather and mean temperatures.\n\n Yep.\n \n\n Without life, it quite possibly would head that way as the carbon cycle would collapse and there would be a run-away build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's where the idea of Gaia came from (before it was hijacked by silly Earth-mother worshipers and turned into a joke): life on Earth keeps the Earth in a semi-stable state suitable for life.\n\n So you're saying that we shouldn't be so worried. ;)\n \n\n And like a mug, you soak it all up. Ignore 99% of the scientific world, because you found a website that says what you want to hear! Pure idiocy.\n\n Here's another one with a Chinese scientist saying exactly what I've been saying.\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/worldbalance/voic-yihu.html\n \n\n NOVA: Is global climate change real? Is the human race altering the climate?\n \n Ding: There is no question about the fact of climate change. From the readings of global temperature over the past 140 years, the temperature has increased by 0.4 to 0.8\u00b0C. Another fact without question is that greenhouse-gas emissions are on the rise. Over the past 200 years, greenhouse-gas emissions have increased by about 268 to 372 parts per million this year.\n \n The question remains on the causes of climate change. Some believe it is caused by human activity. Their research is mostly based on model simulation. Yet some scientists think it's probably too early to draw the conclusion that it is caused by human activity. They believe natural forces such as radiation from the sun might be more important. The question is not whether the globe has become warmer; that is a fact. The question is how to explain it.\n\n \n\n And my whole point is: you are wrong: we have the proof. You just won't listen to it.\n\n This proof you speak of, do you have it?\n Can you show it to me?\n \n \nIndeed claiming that the Kyoto protocol is based on junk science is idiocy.\n\n Hasn't it been shown that the conclusions drawn by the IPCC were politically influenced?\n \n and insisting that the USA do nothing despite other \"developed\" nations signing up to do something is selfishness.\n\n I never said that the US or anyone should do nothing.\n I think we need to find a way to harness more renewable resources.\n Fossil fuels are finite, even though there is probably enough oil to last hundreds more years and coal to last thousands, something cleaner and \"renewable\" has to be found.\n \n And no matter what the effects may be we can't keep pumping CO2 into the atmosphere at ever increasing rates.\n \n But what Kyoto asked the US to do is too much.\n We agreed to cut back, but not as fast as Kyoto asked.\n Besides, if the computer models are right afterall, a few years before cutting back won't make a bit of difference to global temperatures, but it would be economically stifling.\n \n \nKeep that head firmly stuck in the sand mate, for the bulk of the world is turning \"chicken little\" around you.\n\n I think you might be imagining things.\n Even if the \"bulk of the world\" were as frightened as you, it's not going to change my opinion that we don't have enough information to draw the conclusions that you and \"the bulk of the world\" have drawn.\n \n \nYou lost the argument years ago. Give up already: it's pathetic watching people continue to fight after the war is lost.\n\n Wow, you're so sure of yourself.\n Women must love you. emoticon_xlove",

It`s about as convincing as any random oppinion piece on the authencity of man-made global warming you could find on an enviromentalist site (like green peace).\n \n Edit\n \n To give an even more serious response (I guess you deserve it, I was just in a bad mood), the projections for the cost of rattifying the Kyoto treaty is very, very different depending on which economic model you would choose to use and none I`ve read about predicts an annual cost of 150 billion (allthough at least one study has claimed that the cost could peak between 100 and 300 billion in 2012, but that is not an average which would be several times lower).

Now, dazzle me :p\n\n \n \n Ok. \n \n Just look at what Kyoto is already doing to New Zealand, a dinky little country .\n http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=26&ObjectID=10334971\n \n\n When New Zealand ratified the protocol in 2002 the projections were that they would earn 100 million tonnes worth of carbon credits.\n \n That would be more than enough to cover the projected increase in emissions of greenhouse gases from other sources, principally the exhaust pipes of vehicles, power station chimneys and the throats of cattle and sheep.\n \n As the credits are internationally tradeable, Climate Change Minister Pete Hodgson argued that not to ratify the Kyoto agreement would be not only environmentally irresponsible, but setting fire to a very big cheque.\n \n The cheque has bounced.\n \n Revised projections for the net emissions released last month show we are likely to exceed our Kyoto target.\n \n The commitment is to add no more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere on average between 2008 and 2012 than we did in 1990.\n \n It now looks like we will exceed that by 36 million tonnes - which will have to be covered by buying credits from countries with a surplus - instead of being in credit to the tune of 33 million tonnes.\n \n At an indicative price of $15 a tonne (the value used to set the carbon tax due to come into force in 2007) that is a switch from a gain of nearly $500 million to a cost of more than $500 million.\n \n It may be much more: if the current carbon price on Europe's internal carbon market is used, the taxpayer would have to find around $1.5 billion.\n \n\n \n They can try to make up for it by planting more forests, but it doesn't look like they'll be able to meet their Kyoto agreements.\n \n Here's how Kyoto works:\n \n http://www.bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/site/articleIDs/574DFF88B98E2A56CA25703400111095?open\n \n \nHelen Clark wasn't wrong; there is good money to be made from the Kyoto processes, just not by New Zealand. Because pollution outputs are measured against each Kyoto signatory's own previous performance, a clean joint like NZ need only enjoy a few prosperous years of economic growth (new factories, increased car use, more building) to overstep its old mark. But Russia is measured against filthy Soviet practices - meaning it can make a total pig of itself and still come in under commie-era pollution levels (which were massively high; unlike NZ, the Kremlin never got around to appointing a Climate Change Minister). Behold the economic masterpiece that is Kyoto: Russia easily generates more pollution than NZ in any given year, yet the latter cops huge penalties and the Russkies get rich selling them carbon credits. Anyone who advocates signing on to Kyoto beyond this point, now we've seen how it works, should be confined.\n\n \n This is what politicians in the US don't want to see, the US owing developing countries hundreds of billions of dollars because of economic growth.",

   "First of all, we are not talking about New Zeeland... We are currently talking about the US with huge carbon sinks in the form of national forests.\n\n Huh? New Zealand is pretty much all forest.\n It doesn't work that way though and you know it. \n Just because CO2 is released in the US doesn't mean a plant in the US is going to use it. That's why Kyoto deals with trying to manage a gross carbon budget for the whole world. \n \n Besides if the US is such a great carbon sink then what's the problem?\n \n \nTrying to apply theories about projected figures from the New Zeeland economy unto the US economy is not good enough...\n\n Right, but only because it would be multiplied in the US, not only because of the huge population and fuel usage, but because the US is the country that would spend the most on new technology. \n \n Not only would we spend bazillions more than we do now scrambling to cut emissions and rework infrastructure to handle non-fossil fuels, but it would never be enough to get us to pre-1990 levels. So not only would we have a huge technology and infrastructure bill, but we would surely have a carbon tax \"deficit\" to pay to other countries, like Russia, etc. But the whole time, China is doing whatever it can to compete economically in the globe, pumping out as much CO2 as it can, wiping out all this effort and expense that the US would have to endure.\n \n \nAs a side note, 500 million dollars over 4 years is not a \"wreck\" to the economy. Not even for a small economy like the New Zeeland. It would cost the individual New Zeelander around 31 dollars per year... Hardly the evidence for an economicly cripling polycie.\n\n that's if it doesn't reach 1.5 billion = $375 per person, which was another number they threw out. \n \n That's with doing NOTHING.\n The US could do nothing, pay at the very least $100-200 billion to other countries for their carbon bill, and the only difference is that we get nothing for $100-200 billion. \n \n But the US wouldn't just sit there.\n We'd want to keep the money somewhat within the borders so we'd invest $100 billion in research and trying to revamp infrastructure to handle new energy sources (building nuke plants, hydroelectric stations, etc) so we wouldn't have to pay such huge bills to other countries for nothing. \n \n \nYeah, they tried to make a cash-cow out of it and they apparantly failed. I don`t see how this is any indication of the kyoto protocol being economicly disasterous.\n\n Ok, it wasn't disastrous because it was NZ (they don't have a $7 trillion national debt)\n It was just one example using a small country.\n Just multiply it by 75 or so and you have the US, but again there are so many implications for the US, because it puts out more CO2 per capita than NZ ever dreamed. \n \n So 75 times the problem in NZ is the very lowest it could possibly be.\n \n \n \nAnd yet you fail to show how the US economy would be wrecked by the polycies.\n\n Hey, I can't sit around all day googling XXXX for this message board, that was just the first thing I came across in 5 minutes.\n \n Besides predicting economic disaster is only slightly less complicated than predicting global climate patterns over hundreds of years.\n \n But here is a DOE report on the economic effects of Kyoto:\n http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/kyotorpt.html\n \n Believe me I haven't read the whole thing.\n \n Here is something:\n http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/cost.html\n \n \nThe estimates of unavoidable (irreducible) losses- income losses that cannot be recovered-for the U.S. economy range from $32 billion (DRI Case 2) to about $62 billion (EIA) in 2010. There are many frictions that can increase costs above the irreducible minimum. These include business cycles, international trade and capital constraints, regulation, use of imperfect instruments instead of auction permits, coal subsidies, CAFE standards, exemptions, efficiency losses from taxation, etc.107 Various Federal Reserve and Federal Government policies might mitigate actual GDP losses. There is considerable uncertainty regarding all the above actions.\n \n The EPRI analysis, because of its perfect foresight and optimizing framework, yields actual GDP losses that are closest to its estimated unavoidable losses. CRA estimates actual GDP losses that are almost 3 times its unavoidable losses in 2010, and estimated actual GDP losses in 2010 for the DRI and EIA 1990+14% cases are 3 to 4 times the unavoidable losses. Because DRI's and EIA's actual GDP losses are based on a detailed macroeconomic model that has limited foresight, focuses on the transitional process rather than the steady-state condition of the economy, their projected GDP losses are expected to be the largest and perhaps more appropriate in the mid term (through 2010). WEFA and EIA incorporate revenue recycling, while DRI redirects the revenues through higher profits to business. \n\n If I'm reading this right, GDP losses would be ~$180-240 billion in 2010, $60 billion or so in non-recoverable losses. \n \n You could say \"The war in Iraq costs that much.\"\n But that's just tax money going into the pockets of defense.\n It's not a loss in GDP.\n \n Anyway, it would make electricity prices soar in most markets, making the whole country like California was a few years ago (that alone is scary to me).\n \n It would make gas prices go through the roof.\n Hell, it would make all energy prices go through the roof, which makes everything go up. That's what's going on with gas prices now.\n \n Of course the oil guys are loving every minute of it, but the average american is not only getting hit at the pump, but at the grocery store, everywhere. \n \n Prices are inflating now just because of a slight rise in gas prices.\n Just think what would happen if energy prices were hiked significantly across the board.\n \n \nI can understand that american politicians, consumers and producers don`t want to pay for what their pollution.\n\n You just said that a forest is a great carbon sink and that forests love CO2.\n CO2 is not pollution, it's a necessary part of the atmosphere. \n A hydrogen car would pump out nothing but water, the most potent greenhouse there is. 100% greenhouse gas emission is just too much pollution.\n \n Someone has to pay for this pollution.\n \n \nI don`t either. In fact, I would prefer to be paid for what I pollute (or just be paid gigantic sums of money). It`s called self-interest or by some, greed.\n\n Well, I try to keep my pollution to a minimum, but I don't consider CO2 to be a pollutant. CO and hydrocarbons that eek out of the tailpipe are what I would consider pollution. Black smoke from burning coal in a Chinese kitchen, THAT's pollution, not CO2. Those Chinese are just greedy because they want other people to pay for their pollution. Or at least they don't want to pay a dime for it.\n \n Look, if you want to curb your CO2 emissions then YOU drive less or not at all.\n \n Personally I ride a bike to work most days and drive as little as possible.\n I fill up the 10 gallon tank in my little Corolla once every month or so.\n I set about 1/4 the trash out on the street as most of my neighbors and recycle about half of what I throw away. \n \n I live in Tennesse, and like most states we have to meet strict emissions standards (with regard to CO and hydrocarbons - real pollution).\n \n I wonder what the standards are in Sweden.\n I looked it up, you JUST NOW (in 1996) required that cars have catalytic converters!! Is this right? Maybe your greed stopped you from requiring them on cars before then.",

If I break your window, that would increase GDP in the short run as well. Would you consider it as an economic gain for your country?

We could get into a debate about hydrogen fuel cells and the so-called \"hydrogen economy\" if you want, but maybe that's material for another thread.\n \n The only real alternative for electric power generation is nuclear and that has it's own problems not counting the costs.\n \n\n And if it was profitable, I don`t see the problem at all with spending more resources developing new technologies.\n\n What technologies did you have in mind?\n Which of these is profitable or can be made to be and which could be a viable alterative to fossil fuels?\n \n\n In fact, it could easily be argued to be a reason why the kyoto protocol would hurt less in the US than it would do otherwise.\n\n You'll have to elaborate on that one.\n mainly because the first thing the Kyoto treaty would do is send a huge carbon bill to the US and then the US would have to pay other countries for doing nothing but staying poor.\n \n\n \n The link you provided to the AEI study goes through these costs. They are nowhere near catastrophic levels. In fact, US would still experience significant economic growth acording to the projections.\n\n Well, I'm no economist so maybe you'll have to explain this a little better.\n How would Kyoto HELP the US and how would it help economic growth?\n If that's truly the case, then people who really know about this stuff would have advised signing the thing.\n \n\n \n 375 dollars per person for four years is still not an indication of something catastrophic, or even very harmful for the economy (and it would land at 93/capita dollars per year). \n\n How many times is NZ going to have to cough up $1.5 billion?\n What will it be next time? 3 billion?\n And that's basically just ripping money out of the economy.\n \n The more I look at it, the Kyoto protocol is nothing but a wealth distribution program, something akin to welfare.\n \n \nBigger country yes. But also far bigger economy. And even if your debt is a problem, most countries have problems with some aspects of their economy. The US economy is not IMO in any worse shape than any other economy (I would in fact argue that it is among the best performing in the world at the moment)\n\n And that's precisely the reason the Kyoto bills would be so huge.\n \n\n The NZ economy has a GDP of 92,51 billion (2004 estimate)\n The US economy has a GDP of 11,75 trillion (2004 estimate)\n Source CIA World Factbook\n \n You do the math ;)\n\n Ok, so what?\n Now I'm sorry I ever pointed out that Kyoto was causing economic problems for NZ. That's really the only point I was trying to make by bringing it up. People who thought that Kyoto would be good for them were wrong and it turned out to be bad for them.\n \n Comparing NZ to the US is really not accurate for any kind of discussion, especially one about economics.\n \n \nSort of my point actually ;) But then again, there are no indiciations what-so-ever that the Kyoto protocol would bring about any economic disaster for any single country. On the other hand, there are some indications that man made global warming might be quite worrysome...\n\n And there are other indications saying that there is no such thing.\n \n So what are we going to have a battle of the computer models?\n \n Economic models vs. Climate models? \n \n Even if man is the cause of global warming, that doesn't mean that the Kyoto treaty is in any way beneficial to anyone economically or the planet climatically.\n \n \nMe neither, but I`ve read substantial parts of it. It`s the AEI study I`ve been refering to in other posts...\n\n This study was done by the EIA of the DOE not the AEI.\n If the AEI did the study it wouldn't be credible to me.\n But, I can't seem to find what you're talking about, can you link to it?\n \n \n\n Yup. See my other posts. I`ve talked about this cost before. It`s still only estimates and hardly unchallanged. And yet, even if these criticized numbers where correct, it would still be far from an economic disaster. The US econbomy is even projected in the study to grow substantially, even during the year the costs would max out...\n\n This whole argument is about estimate.\n Estimates about what the climate will be like in 50 years (we can't even predict the weather a week ahead and we can't even measure or estimate the mean global surface temperature accurately today), estimates about how much CO2 will be put out 20 years from now, estimates about how economies will suffer or not...\n \n It's all speculation about the future. That's the basis for this whole argument.\n \n\n Defense is generally considered as a cost. Not as something that produces wellfare for the citizens.\n\n I didn't say that it generates welfare.\n I said that defense spending of $200 billion dollars does not take $200 billion dollars out of the US ecomony to put it into other countries.\n This is what Kyoto would do (the first few years anyway).\n \n\n If I break your window, that would increase GDP in the short run as well. Would you consider it as an economic gain for your country? (If you want a more thourough explanation, I can give you one, it`s just late over here) \n\n Yeah, and if you went to Monte Carlo and blew your life savings it would be a decrease in GDP for your country and an increase for Manaco's.\n \n This, I think, is a fair analogy to what would happen with Kyoto.\n It would be like millions of americans pouring their money into the pockets of rich foreigners (leaders of poor countries).\n \n \n \n\n This is all a part of the AEI study. It still doesn`t look omnious.\n\n if everything you bought and paid for trippled in price you don't think that would be ominous?\n \n\n The oil guys would hate it as it would slash their margins. Taxes on oil doesn`T help the oil company. In fact the exact opposite.\n\n They hate what? Taxes? I never said anything about taxes.\n The tax would stay the same.\n A rise in the price of oil would raise the price of gasoline.\n If the non-tax price for gas goes from $0.65 to $1.00 per gallon, the oil companies love this. \n The tax didn't change at all.\n \n \n \nI`m not going to comment on the effectiveness of the Kyoto protocol or the dangers of carbon ommisions as I know to little about the subject to make a decent argument. I`m more interested in the economic implications for rattifying the whole thing.\n \n\n Ok, I'm no expert on economics, but it doesn't take an expert to see that periodic payouts of 1% of total GDP (NZ's payout will be 1.6%) redistributed to poorer countries, while making mad dashes to totally revamp the infrastructure that has organically grown around fossil fuels over the last 100 years could be economically beneficial. I would think they would be detrimental, driving up energy prices to the point where everything inflates and people are poorer. Not only that, but would this effectively reduce capital so that investments in research and development of new technologies would be hindered, if not threatened?\n \n \nYou mean the envirometnal standards? I don`t really know, but we are often considered to have far stringent standards than the EU minimum. We are also in line with our Kyoto protocol requirements (and have been for a few years).\n\n You have no idea about how your country pollutes or doesn't pollute.\n All you know is that you're in line with Kyoto and EU standards.\n (and of course that's all that matters)\n \n \nIt`s probably correct. My intention was not to accuse the US for being particulary greedy,but rather that it is obvious that noone wants to pay for the pollution they create. This does not make it right however.\n\n What pollution? CO2? That's not pollution anymore than water vapor is.\n But we have to pay for it?\n Pay whom?\n Pay to sequester it? No..\n Pay to reduce emissions? No..\n \n No, pay poor countries that have carbon credits to sell. \n Just doing this solves nothing and makes nothing right.",

   "I was just pointing out that there are already ill economic effects being seen by some countries.\n\n \n But these where not ill effects being seen. It was projected ill effects.\n \n \nYou're right, it's not an accurate comparison because the effect on the US would be immediate and on a much larger scale.\n\n \n Why would it be \"immidiate\"? And naturally, anything in the US is on a larger scale than a country with 5 million inhabitants (wether it is ill effects or positive effects)...\n \n \nWell, I don't know how the forests can deal with omissions of CO2,\n but they love emission of CO2.\n \n But anyway, why did you bring up the forests in the first place?\n\n \n Because, afaik, they (among other factors), are used to calculate carbon credits under the Kyoto treaty regulations.\n \n \n \nNot really true. We spend billions on science research every year.\n Most of it is not immediately profitable and some it will never lead to profit by anyone. \n\n \n Sure. But you claimed that US would spend even more on science research if the Kyoto treaty was rattified. This is probably true due to the fact that science research aimed at finding alternative, non-carbon omitting fuel sources would be considered more profitable as well as more efficient ways to extract energy from oil and gas. If the US government would decide to fund more non-profitable science research after the Kyoto treaty has been rattified, this would be a political consequence and squarely the responsibility of your elected government. Not an automatic economic consequence of rattiffying the kyoto protocol.\n \n \nAs of yet, there is no real viable alternative to burning fossil fuels, at least when it comes to cars. We could get into a debate about hydrogen fuel cells and the so-called \"hydrogen economy\" if you want, but maybe that's material for another thread.\n\n \n How about Ethanol? I rode an ethanolbus on my way to work this morning. At least it diminishes the quantity of oil used in the fuel. But perhaps the production process requires so much energy that you can`t avoid using just as much oil anyway...\n \n \nThe only real alternative for electric power generation is nuclear and that has it's own problems not counting the costs.\n \n\n \n Nuclear is one alternative. Hydro-power can also be used fairly efficiently (depending on the geographic conditions). But in the short run, I think the US is more likely to use more gas and coal instead of gasoline. \"Alternative energy\" is probably more likely to be real alternatives in the future. But I would also like to point out that it is entirely possible to generate electricity on large scale without using gasoline at all. \n \n \nWhat technologies did you have in mind?\n Which of these is profitable or can be made to be and which could be a viable alterative to fossil fuels?\n\n \n It`s about limiting the use of oil. Not abolishing it completly. In the short-run technical progress in thermal heating, bio-mass energy extraction, hydro-power, energy efficient production and transportation, ethanol, etc. are probably the best way to go to reduce the increases in fossil fuel consumption. In the lonf run, nuclear and fusion power and perhaps wind, solar and wave energy could be used to drasticly reduce the dependancy of fossil fuels.\n \n \nYou'll have to elaborate on that one.\n mainly because the first thing the Kyoto treaty would do is send a huge carbon bill to the US and then the US would have to pay other countries for doing nothing but staying poor.\n\n \n See above about my comment on economicly driven research and politicly driven research.\n \n \nWell, I'm no economist so maybe you'll have to explain this a little better.\n How would Kyoto HELP the US and how would it help economic growth?\n If that's truly the case, then people who really know about this stuff would have advised signing the thing.\n\n \n I think you misread my post. I`m not claiming that the US economy would grow because of the Kyoto protocol being rattified, but that it is projected to grow in spite of the Kyoto protocol being rattyfied (I know it hasn`t been rattyfied in the US but I don`t really know how to put it). And a grwoing economy is hardly the tell-signs of an \"crippled\" or \"wrecked\" economy.\n \n \nHow many times is NZ going to have to cough up $1.5 billion?\n What will it be next time? 3 billion?\n And that's basically just ripping money out of the economy.\n\n \n NZ haven`t coughed up anything yet (let alone 1,5 billion dollars (new Zeeland dollars or US dollars?)...). And what next time are you refering to?\n \n \nThe more I look at it, the Kyoto protocol is nothing but a wealth distribution program, something akin to welfare.\n\n \n I guess that would explain the american aversion to the whole thing then.\n \n \nAnd that's precisely the reason the Kyoto bills would be so huge.\n\n \n Yeah, it would be huge compared on a national basis. But those kind of comparisons tend to be quite pointless. What you need to look out for is the cost in relation to population (the cost for the individual) and the cost in relation to the economy (the dangers it could pose to the economic system and how much it will \"hurt\" the individual).\n \n \nOk, so what?\n Now I'm sorry I ever pointed out that Kyoto was causing economic problems for NZ. That's really the only point I was trying to make by bringing it up. People who thought that Kyoto would be good for them were wrong and it turned out to be bad for them.\n\n \n Nothing have \"turned out\" yet. And just like their initial projections where dramatcily revised acording to the article you posted, the newer projection are also very likely to change. In what way, and how much is more unclear. \n \n \n Comparing NZ to the US is really not accurate for any kind of discussion, especially one about economics.\n\n \n I agree. At least not in this way. To be honest, I think the US costs would be more severe. But I`m also positive that the US economy can absorb these kind of costs with ease. As been aluded to before in this thread, the Iraqi war is probably allready far more costly in economic terms than the Kyoto protocol ever could become.\n \n \n \nAnd there are other indications saying that there is no such thing.\n\n \n Sure. But there are still no indications for economic collapse if Kyoto was rattyfied, and many indications that the US economy would perform fine, even if the Kyoto was rattyfied.\n \n \nSo what are we going to have a battle of the computer models?\n \n Economic models vs. Climate models? \n \n Even if man is the cause of global warming, that doesn't mean that the Kyoto treaty is in any way beneficial to anyone economically or the planet climatically.\n\n \n Very true. But both are possible (at least in the long run)\n \n \nThis study was done by the EIA of the DOE not the AEI.\n If the AEI did the study it wouldn't be credible to me.\n But, I can't seem to find what you're talking about, can you link to it?\n \n\n \n Ah, my bad. I had the letters in the wrong order. We are still talking about the same study though.\n \n \nThis whole argument is about estimate.\n Estimates about what the climate will be like in 50 years (we can't even predict the weather a week ahead and we can't even measure or estimate the mean global surface temperature accurately today), estimates about how much CO2 will be put out 20 years from now, estimates about how economies will suffer or not...\n \n It's all speculation about the future. That's the basis for this whole argument.\n \n\n \n Sure. And if someone argues that we can`t trust weather forecast because of their uncertainty, I can assure you that we shouldn`t trust economic forecasts either...\n \n \nI didn't say that it generates welfare.\n I said that defense spending of $200 billion dollars does not take $200 billion dollars out of the US ecomony to put it into other countries.\n This is what Kyoto would do (the first few years anyway).\n\n \n No, it takes 200 million dollars and destroys it (along with the infrastructure in other countries), not to mention the lives lost.... If there are no macro-economic arguments for stimulating the economy, defence budgets are black holes, even during peace time. It`s actually more benefitial to give the resources to other countries.\n \n \nif everything you bought and paid for trippled in price you don't think that would be ominous?\n\n \n Depends on the time frame, but an inflation rate around 200% in one year would certainly be omnious. But what makes you think this would be the result of the Kyoto treaty? Isn`t this just scaremongering?\n \n I`ll get back to the rest later\n \n EDIT: I`ll continue my responses now:\n \n \nThey hate what? Taxes? I never said anything about taxes.\n The tax would stay the same.\n A rise in the price of oil would raise the price of gasoline.\n If the non-tax price for gas goes from $0.65 to $1.00 per gallon, the oil companies love this. The tax didn't change at all.\n\n \n If not for taxes, how do you figure the oil price would increase by rattyfing the kyoto protocol?\n \n \nOk, I'm no expert on economics, but it doesn't take an expert to see that periodic payouts of 1% of total GDP (NZ's payout will be 1.6%) redistributed to poorer countries, while making mad dashes to totally revamp the infrastructure that has organically grown around fossil fuels over the last 100 years could be economically beneficial.\n\n \n how did you come up with the 1,6% figure? Even 1,5 billion for 4 years only amount to less than 0,4% of the GDP per year (the 1,5 billion figure is for the whole four years. Not annual). And this is assuming that the cost for carbon credits would be the same as on the internal european market, which is far from certain. With the more conservative figure of 500 million, the costs are not even 0,15% of the GDP/year...\n \n \n I would think they would be detrimental, driving up energy prices to the point where everything inflates and people are poorer.\n\n \n Energy prices are likely to increase due to taxation. That is actually the only way for the government to affect the consumption of fossil fuels. People are not likely to become poorer though. Nothing indicates that the Kyoto treaty would put a stop to economic growth. In fact, the projected costs for the kyoto protocol are based on the assumption of continous economic growth.\n \n \n. Not only that, but would this effectively reduce capital so that investments in research and development of new technologies would be hindered, if not threatened?\n\n \n That is however far from certain. If the consumer prices increase it will become more profitable to save money. And this will in fact increase the money avaible for capital investments. \n \n Naturally, this will be counteracted by the costs of the Kyoto in terms of lost economic growth, but the end result cannot be determined theoreticly.\n \n Furthermore, greater costs for fossil fuels will make it more profitable to find and use alternatives. And this ought to spur private investments in research and new technologies in this field.\n \n \nYou have no idea about how your country pollutes or doesn't pollute.All you know is that you're in line with Kyoto and EU standards.\n (and of course that's all that matters)\n\n \n You asked for \"the standards\". I didn`t know which standards you where refering to so I answered about those I knew about. Are you asking how \"much\" Sweden pollutes? In metric tonnes or in comparison to other countries? Per capita or in total? If you want me to give you a good answer, please specify the question.\n \n \nWhat pollution? CO2? That's not pollution anymore than water vapor is.\n But we have to pay for it?\n Pay whom?\n Pay to sequester it? No..\n Pay to reduce emissions? No..\n \n No, pay poor countries that have carbon credits to sell. \n Just doing this solves nothing and makes nothing right.\n\n \n Just doing this would also be stupid. However, quotas and credits would give the US government an incentive to tax the consumption of fossil fuels or reduce it`s omissions in other ways. It`s an attempt to get around the free-riding problem of global pollution...",

   "i thought this was interesting. (didn't read the whole thread so apologies if this has already been discussed)\n \n \n\"We know that we who reside in the United States emit about 6.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year,\" said Taro Takahashi, Doherty Senior Research Scientist, associate director of Lamont-Doherty, Columbia's earth sciences campus in Palisades, N.Y., and an author of the report. \"As an air mass travels from west to east, it should receive carbon dioxide and the East Coast concentration of CO2 should be higher than on the West Coast.\n \n \"But observations tell us otherwise. The mean atmospheric CO2 concentration on the East Coast has been observed to be lower than that over the Pacific coast. This means that more CO2 is taken up by land ecosystems over the United States than is released by industrial activities.\"\n \n The results suggest the presence of a carbon sink, which occurs when carbon dioxide absorbed by plants as they grow exceeds carbon dioxide released by dead material as it decays. Although the method does not identify the causes, there are a number of possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the sink. Forest regrowth in areas where generations of pioneers leveled trees to create farmland almost certainly plays an important role. Millions of acres east of the Mississippi have returned to forest.\n \n Forest regrowth, and carbon absorption, in North America may be enhanced by some side effects of industrialization. Nitrogen deposition in soil, a result of combustion processes in automobiles and power plants, can act as a fertilizer, as can the higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the air. Global warming itself can contribute to longer growing seasons, which have been observed in studies of satellite measurements cited by the team.\n",

But I would also like to point out that it is entirely possible to generate electricity on large scale without using gasoline at all. \n \n Right, by nuclear power.\n I can't think of anything that comes close.\n \n \nIt`s about limiting the use of oil. Not abolishing it completly.\n\n OK, we're working on that WITHOUT paying huge bills to other countries.\n \n \nIn the short-run technical progress in thermal heating,\n\n You mean geo-thermal?\n We've got Yosemite and Yellowstone, but we're no Iceland.\n We couldn't power much on what we have, but we're working on that too.\n http://geothermal.inel.gov/\n They even have nice maps, but this is like solar energy.\n It's very dilute and difficult to concentrate. It wouldn't be more than a niche market or a localized source of energy much like hydroelectric is now.\n \n\n bio-mass energy extraction,\n\n Which is energy intensive to produce and in the end emits CO2.\n \n \nenergy efficient production and transportation, ethanol, etc. are probably the best way to go to reduce the increases in fossil fuel consumption. \n \n But the goal of Kyoto is not to reduce fossil fuel consumption, it's goal is to reduce CO2 emissions. Biofuels, ethanol, etc would emit CO2.\n \n \nIn the lonf run, nuclear and fusion power\n\n The long run is what matters, and these are the winners so far.\n \n \nand perhaps wind, solar and wave energy could be used to drasticly reduce the dependancy of fossil fuels.\n\n Wind: too dilute\n Solar: too dilute\n Wave energy: localized and niche\n \n \n \nSee above about my comment on economicly driven research and politicly driven research.\n\n Right, the Kyoto protocol would be a political decision that drives economic needs to drive research politically.\n \n \nI think you misread my post. I`m not claiming that the US economy would grow because of the Kyoto protocol being rattified, but that it is projected to grow in spite of the Kyoto protocol being rattyfied (I know it hasn`t been rattyfied in the US but I don`t really know how to put it). And a grwoing economy is hardly the tell-signs of an \"crippled\" or \"wrecked\" economy.\n\n It would be \"wrecked\" or in quite a pinch for a long time before it readjusted.\n \n Then tell me how the economy would grow under Kyoto, after all the manufacturers have relocated to China or any other non-participating country.\n \n \n \nNZ haven`t coughed up anything yet (let alone 1,5 billion dollars (new Zeeland dollars or US dollars?)...). And what next time are you refering to?\n\n They will in 2007.\n http://www.malaya.com.ph/may10/envi3.htm\n \n And please educate me on exactly how Kyoto works but anytime levels are not below 1990 levels, there will be a carbon bill to be paid.\n \n I'm not sure how often these things are to be distributed, but to be an effective treaty there would have to be taxes collected periodically.\n \n It could never be a one off thing.\n \n \nI guess that would explain the american aversion to the whole thing then.\n\n Why would anyone except the recipients of said welfare be for it?\n It would do nothing to reduce total global CO2 emissions, but definitely would take wealth from rich countries and put into the coffers of the rich and powerful in poor countries. \n \n \n \nYeah, it would be huge compared on a national basis. But those kind of comparisons tend to be quite pointless. What you need to look out for is the cost in relation to population (the cost for the individual) and the cost in relation to the economy (the dangers it could pose to the economic system and how much it will \"hurt\" the individual).\n\n It would hurt the individual in that everything he pays for would cost more, a lot more.\n \n \nNothing have \"turned out\" yet. And just like their initial projections where dramatcily revised acording to the article you posted, the newer projection are also very likely to change. In what way, and how much is more unclear. \n \n The date due on the bill is 2007.\n They will have to pay something between $500 million and $1.5 billion.\n The amount they pay depends on if they can get huge tracts of forest planted and growing in 2 years.\n \n \nI agree. At least not in this way. To be honest, I think the US costs would be more severe. But I`m also positive that the US economy can absorb these kind of costs with ease. As been aluded to before in this thread, the Iraqi war is probably allready far more costly in economic terms than the Kyoto protocol ever could become.\n\n On no, I never alluded to Kyotocosts being more in total to the Iraq war.\n I was comparing the payouts that the US would have to make to other countries (like Russia mainly, who'd have a lot of room for emissions seeing that before 1990 their emissions were pretty high).\n That bill would be on par with the Iraq bill except that it wouldn't be tax money shuffling around in the US economy. It would be hundreds of billions just paid out of the economy.\n All the other stuff (relocation, retrofitting of plants, energy price hikes) would have a mix of shuffling money within the economy and shuffling it out.\n \n The total cost would be multiples of the Iraq war and at least one multiple would be cut straight out of the economy.\n \n \n \nAh, my bad. I had the letters in the wrong order. We are still talking about the same study though.\n\n Oh Ok, because the AEI would definitely have a bias.\n \n \nSure. And if someone argues that we can`t trust weather forecast because of their uncertainty, I can assure you that we shouldn`t trust economic forecasts either...\n\n Then it looks like we shouldn't get too crazy about what these forecasts say.\n As in we shouldn't bind ourselves to treaties based on disputable weather forecasts that may (or may not, depending on your economic forecast) have a huge detrimental economic impact. \n \n \nNo, it takes 200 million dollars and destroys it\n\n No way,\n It takes tax money (that we don't have) and sends it the way of Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, The Carlyle Group, Raytheon, ....\n Here\n \n \n(along with the infrastructure in other countries),\n\n \n Then the reconstruction is carried out almost strictly by \"coalition\" companies using Iraqi oil money and US tax dollars (that we don't have).\n \n That's changing now, and Bush was trying to solicit support from the EU countries to some moderate success.\n \n \nIf there are no macro-economic arguments for stimulating the economy, defence budgets are black holes, even during peace time. It`s actually more benefitial to give the resources to other countries.\n\n I really don't see how. \n Defense spending mostly takes money from americans and gives it to americans (or perhaps the odd foreign company, usually UK, that handles US defense contracts.)\n \n It's NEVER beneficial to just hand out money to other countries.\n \n \nDepends on the time frame, but an inflation rate around 200% in one year would certainly be omnious. But what makes you think this would be the result of the Kyoto treaty? Isn`t this just scaremongering?\n\n Ok, I don't know any exact projections (remember the thing about weather forecasts). All I know is that here gas prices have gone up from about $1.25 to about $2.50 per gallon and because of that the prices of a lot of consumer goods have gone up and will continue to do so, since gas prices are factored into any good that had to travel by truck or train (which is just about everything in the US). \n \n So if a Kyotocosts are included in the price of a gallon of gas, this will drive the price up further, making all goods and services more and more expensive.\n \n \n \n Ok, since you took a break I'll take a break and get to the others in another post. I honestly have to meet someone right now.\n \n :)",

   "EDIT: I`ll continue my responses now:\n \n If not for taxes, how do you figure the oil price would increase by rattyfing the kyoto protocol?\n\n Ok, yeah that was dumb of me. The increase in energy prices would come in the form of Kyototaxes.\n \n So, taxes would go up, and prices would increase.\n The increase in energy prices would make everything else more expensive.\n \n Demand wouldn't really go down that much, if any, because just about everything bought and sold in the US travelled on a truck, train, or ship.\n \n \nhow did you come up with the 1,6% figure? \n\n That's based on NZ. $1.5 billion is 1.6% of their GDP.\n \n \nEven 1,5 billion for 4 years only amount to less than 0,4% of the GDP per year\n \n\n Do you think this is acceptable?\n \n \n(the 1,5 billion figure is for the whole four years. Not annual). And this is assuming that the cost for carbon credits would be the same as on the internal european market, which is far from certain. With the more conservative figure of 500 million, the costs are not even 0,15% of the GDP/year...\n \n\n They are still costs that can be measured as percentages of GDP.\n Those are huge costs.\n \n \nEnergy prices are likely to increase due to taxation.\n\n Just wanted to make sure you are aware that energy prices will go up.\n Not because of S/D economics, but because of taxes that will send money to the governments of other countries.\n \n \nThat is actually the only way for the government to affect the consumption of fossil fuels. \n\n It wouldn't affect consumption that much. \n It's like increasing the price of crack for an addict.\n It would curb demand minimially at best.\n Besides the Kyoto protocol is not about fossil fuel consumption.\n It's about CO2 (and some other gases) emissions.\n \n (How do they measure/calculate that per country anyway?)\n \n \nPeople are not likely to become poorer though. Nothing indicates that the Kyoto treaty would put a stop to economic growth. In fact, the projected costs for the kyoto protocol are based on the assumption of continous economic growth.\n\n The projected costs are based on doing nothing and just paying the Kyotobills.\n \n So yeah, by doing nothing, the economy will grow by burning fuels that release CO2. By doing nothing and signing Kyoto, the US will pay huge bills and nothing will be done to curb CO2 emissions.\n \n Under this scenario the Kyotobills will grow and grow until we can't afford them.\n \n People will eventually be poorer.\n \n \nThat is however far from certain. If the consumer prices increase it will become more profitable to save money. And this will in fact increase the money avaible for capital investments. \n \n\n Ok, like I said I'm no economist, but if consumers are saving money (not spending it) how do corporations have more money to invest?\n \n \nNaturally, this will be counteracted by the costs of the Kyoto in terms of lost economic growth, but the end result cannot be determined theoreticly.\n \n\n Don't know what you're saying here.\n \n \nFurthermore, greater costs for fossil fuels will make it more profitable to find and use alternatives. And this ought to spur private investments in research and new technologies in this field.\n \n\n What alternatives did you have in mind?\n \n Again, the only alternative for electric power generation is nuclear (and maybe one day fusion). \n \n Read page 9 of this: http://www.climatechangecentral.com/resources/presentations/PDH_ScienceWritersConf.pdf\n \n http://www.eclipsenow.org/Solutions/NewPower.html\n \nAnd lastly, there is not enough land to grow biomass fuels for our entire fleet of cars anyway, so forget it \"solving\" peak oil in one hit. This is not a silver bullet. We need a bit of everything to get through Peak Oil. Again, try the ISES paper for a warm up.\n\n \n \n \nYou asked for \"the standards\". I didn`t know which standards you where refering to so I answered about those I knew about. Are you asking how \"much\" Sweden pollutes? In metric tonnes or in comparison to other countries? Per capita or in total? If you want me to give you a good answer, please specify the question.\n\n You were talking like you knew what Swedens emissions standards are (as in auto emissions or industrial emissions). \n \n Then you said \"Well, we're in line with Kyoto and the EU.\"\n \n And I said \"That must be all that matters.\"\n \n \nJust doing this would also be stupid.\n\n Unless every CO2 producing country is on board, that's all Kyoto will do. \n \n \nHowever, quotas and credits would give the US government an incentive to tax the consumption of fossil fuels or reduce it`s omissions in other ways. It`s an attempt to get around the free-riding problem of global pollution...\n\n It won't get around China's free-riding at all.\n It may be an attempt, but it's a lame attempt.\n Maybe in the future a Kyoto-type agreement may work, but Kyoto as it is just doesn't seem likely to do anything for global CO2 levels, but it does seem lilely to be very expensive for high emitting countries that choose to participate.",

   "It's projected about as much as a credit card bill.\n When you get a bill in the mail that says you owe $1000 and it's due in a week, that's only a projected expense.\n \n\n \n No. The price is not set and the quantity purchased is not set. it is as far from a credit card bill you can come.\n \n \nOne way it would be \"immediate\" is this:\n http://www.ct-yankee.com/manfctry/kyoto.html\n Manufacturers would flee the US.\n\n \n That was even worse than the dooms-day scenarios outlined by Greenpeace.

The only reason why western agriculture can compete with the third world is because of our insane overuse of energy in foodstuff production coupled with subsidies, tariffs and quotas. If we scrapped these, perhaps we would be able to import energy-effective ethanol while still being materially better off?\n \n \n \n Which emits...?\n\n \n Less CO2?\n \n \n \n \n \n Right, by nuclear power.\n I can't think of anything that comes close.)\n\n \n I think nuclear power coupled with local and regional energy production based on specific geographic conditions might go a long way.\n \n \n \n OK, we're working on that WITHOUT paying huge bills to other countries.\n \n\n \n You don`t seem to be working very hard.\n \n \n \n You mean geo-thermal?\n \n\n \n No. I can`t find the English word, but it`s not about producing energy, but using warmth from the ground to heat houses and buildings.\n \n \n \n But the goal of Kyoto is not to reduce fossil fuel consumption, it's goal is to reduce CO2 emissions.

Is the US manufacturing base built around energy-intensive production? If not, this would only be one of many costs of operating a manufacturing business in a western country.\n \n \n\n Why would anyone except the recipients of said welfare be for it?\n It would do nothing to reduce total global CO2 emissions, but definitely would take wealth from rich countries and put into the coffers of the rich and powerful in poor countries. \n \n\n \n Why do you assume that it would do nothing to reduce global CO2 emissions? I think it would be far more efficient than the various systems of subsidies, tariffs and quotas we employ at the moment. All in the name of environmental concern...

It might have some crowing-out effects on certain industries to countries that do not choose to comply. I can`t say for sure how large this crowding-out effect will be, but I doubt it would even get as high as 50%\n \n \nIt won't get around China's free-riding at all.\n It may be an attempt, but it's a lame attempt.\n Maybe in the future a Kyoto-type agreement may work, but Kyoto as it is just doesn't seem likely to do anything for global CO2 levels, but it does seem lilely to be very expensive for high emitting countries that choose to participate.\n\n \n China and Russia would probably free-ride.

If reducing greenhouse gases is your mission then you might want to stay away from methane.\n http://www.epa.gov/methane/index.html\n http://www.epa.gov/methane/sources.html\n \n Coal releases a little more CO2 than gasoline per unit power and unless it's cleaned up releases a whole host of toxic gases.\n And then there are the byproducts of coal mining.\n http://www.energyjustice.net/coal/wastecoal/\n \n \n\n I think nuclear power coupled with local and regional energy production based on specific geographic conditions might go a long way.\n\n I agree.\n \n Then what to do with the waste?\n \n\n You don`t seem to be working very hard.\n\n Well, if being the world leader in pretty much ALL research including energy research doesn't count for working too hard maybe you are too difficult to please.\n \n\n No. I can`t find the English word, but it`s not about producing energy, but using warmth from the ground to heat houses and buildings.\n\n I don't know what you call it either if it's not geothermal energy.\n AH, google google google....\n http://www.geoexchange.org/\n Geothermal Heat Pumps.\n \n Honestly I've never heard of these things because I 've always lived in a warm climate. But apparently it can be used for cooling too.\n \n As far as heat pumps go, we in the south generally use air heat pumps, which are basically fancy reversible, more efficient air conditioners.\n \n I dunno, apart from the high installation costs I don't see a problem.\n Same thing with solar panels. The initial cost is very high, but it can save you in the long run (maybe after a couple of decades).\n \n\n Sure, but it emits less CO2\n\n No, these all would really emit more CO2 during production.\n \n \nI don`t see why they would. Is the US manufacturing base built around energy-intensive production? If not, this would only be one of many costs of operating a manufacturing business in a western country.\n\n The Kyototaxes would make energy prices a grave concern for manufacturers.\n I think though that they'd use it as an excuse to relocate to non-Kyoto countires to exploit the cheap labor.\n \n \n \nWhy do you assume that it would do nothing to reduce global CO2 emissions?\n\n Unless every country (meaning China) signs up and fully participates, people would just shuffle their emissions around to avoid the carbon taxes.\n \n The goal of Kyoto though is to reduce the acceleration of emissions.\n It doesn't even attempt to think it can reduce them entirely.\n \n \nI think it would be far more efficient than the various systems of subsidies, tariffs and quotas we employ at the moment. \n\n We have subsidies and tariffs based on CO2 emissions?\n Oh, I guess you mean subsidies on alternative energy sources.\n I think this is mostly in Europe or something. I don't think the US tries to subsidize alternative energy sources too much anymore.\n \n Doh, spoke too soon, I forgot about the new energy bill Congress is trying to pass before recess. It will include $11 billion in alternative energy subsidies. ($6 billion will go to oil, coal, gas, and $6 billion will go to nuclear)\n \n here: http://www.bushgreenwatch.org/mt_archives/000276.php\n \n This article fails to mention the \"dirty side\" to all these \"clean\" energy sources.\n \n Sorry for digressing but I think it's illustrative of the misinformation\n The U.S. hydrogen industry currently produces enough hydrogen to power approximately 20 to 30 cars or five to eight million homes per year.\n I think they mean millions of cars. But, not mentioning that this hydrogen is already being used for other things AND that it's mostly produced from fossil fuels, releasing CO2 in the process, is misleading.\n \n \nOnly this time, it would not be the average taxpayer paying through the nose to prop up inefficient businesses and agriculture.\n\n Our agriculture is TOO efficient.\n The gvt pays farmers to NOT produce.\n Anyway, the ultimate destination for any taxes or bills created by Kyoto will be the average citizen ,just like anything else.\n \n \n \nThe 500 million and 1,5 billion spread is dependant on the price of carbon credits. Planting huge tracts of forest could bag New Zeeland a net-gain instead of a loss...\n\n The New Zealanders have already said there's no way they can plant that many trees and show that they are growing and sustainable before 2007.\n \n\n Do you have the figures to back this statement?\n\n The EIA report projected an initial Kyoto carbon bill between $100-200 billion.\n That's not including the costs to companies and citizens having to \"adjust.\"\n \n \nYou are basically paying someone to dig holes and fill them up again. It`s squandered (destroyed) resources.\n\n ???\n The US would never go into an offensive war if it couldn't turn a profit in the long run.\n \n I think we cleared a few hundred billion from the first gulf war.\n \n\n As long as you use Iraqi oil money, you are golden. Allthough I guess that would qualify as good old fashioned pillaging. When you use your own money, it`s like breaking someones window and then give him money to hire you to repair it. It`s squandered resources. \n\n Hmm, I don't agree that these are squandered resources, but are you implying that paying huge bills to developing countries (their leaders) is analogous?\n \n Are you saying that ripping hundreds of billions of dollars out of the US economy and putting it into some third world country is an example of squandered resources?\n \n I think you just might be saying that.\n \n \n \nYou`re not only giving it to Americans. You are investing it as production capital, employing valuable labour and using up productive land and natural resources to produce something that creates no welfare what-so-ever. If it wasn`t for the whole security aspect (that I`m not really interested to debate), it`s all squandered. You have \"destroyed\" it.\n\n So by paying employees - \"employing valuable labour\" - to do work thereby giving these people something to spend on other goods and services, this is destroying resources? Isn't the welfare of these employees and their families improved? Isn't the welfare of anyone who is paid by these employees improved? If the company turns a profit (which all defense contractors usually do) isn't the welfare of the shareholders improved?\n \n As long as a profit is gained, I don't see how resources are being squandered.\n \n \nActually, there is a theoretic possibility of a nation being economically better off by giving out handouts to another country. It is not very probable though (and has probably never happened in real life), but if you want I could go over my old textbooks and give you an explanation ;).\n\n Well, as tiring as typing these long posts is, please enlighten me.\n How could a country like the US benefit from iving away money to a country like China?\n \n \nBut for all intents and purposes, I agree that it`s never economically benefitial to hand out money to other nations. But I would say the same applies to defence spending.\n\n I agree, it's not beneficial to hand out defense spending to other countries.\n Unless you are saying that it's never beneficial to spend money on defense, but that's just daffy.\n \n \nThe EIA study provides some forecasts on the inflationary pressure that would be caused by the Kyoto protocol if implemented. It projects a paltry 0,1-0,2 percentage point increase in annual inflationary pressure in the period of 2005-2020 caused by the increase in energy prices.\n\n {shrug}projections :)\n \n \nYou lucky sod J\n \n Or am I reading to much into your statement ;)\n \n\n Just lunch. :)\n \n \n\n It all depends on how price-sensitive fossil fuels are (or rather goods and services that produces CO2). I can`t even make a qualified guess myself to be honest.\n\n Allz I know is that just about everything bought and sold in the US took a ride on some sort of fossil fuel burning machine after it took fossil fuels to make it.\n \n \nBut that`s over 4 years. In order to measure it as a percentage of their GDP, you should multiply their GDP with 4 (as GDP is an annual measurement). \n \n I don`t know if it`s worth it. But the cost is not so high that it`s unthinkable.\n\n It's lame enough.\n \n \nThe taxes will affect the price, which will affect the supply and demand.\n\n That's what I said. Instead of S/D alone determining price, the tax will determine the price which will determine S/D and so forth.\n \n \n \n\n Hehe... Beats me.\n\n I do think it's crucial to the whole process.\n Now I'm worried. Who measures or calculates a country's CO2 emissions and how do they do it? Can the books be cooked? I'm sure they can.\n \n \n \nIn your article, yes. But not in the EIA study that tries to measure the costs for the entire US economy for implementing the Kyoto treaty.\n According to the EIA study, the long-term costs for the Kyoto treaty would be negliable.\n\n How long term are we talking?\n We couldn't afford the short term affects.\n We could not afford a $200 billion payout to the third world.\n We'd just have to tack it on to our $7 trillion + national debt I guess.\n It would be a big IOU at best.\n \n \n \nLess money will be used for consumption. But that will also mean less resources being used for production. More money will be used for savings, which will result in an increase in loanable funds. That money will be used for investment.\n\n In laymans terms, the economy will slow (less production) people will make less money (if they still have their jobs) and companies will borrow more capital and go into debt. \n \n \nThat we can`t know before-hand what the end result regarding the quantity of funds being invested in research would be.\n\n Ah! So you're saying that there are no guarantees when it comes to research into new technology. So throwing more money at it likely won't produce better technology faster. Perhaps the pace at which we are currently gliding is just right. Furiously pumping tax dollars into research won't give you better results. \n \n\n It`s not about dispelling our dependency on fossil fuels or CO2 emissions in one fell swoop. It is about encouraging a gradual shift by inflating the costs for CO2 emissions globally.\n\n If there was a viable alternative to fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas) then this would work, but just inflating the costs of using fossil fuels without a viable alternative only - oh what was the word - squanders \"destroys\" resources.\n \n When there is a viable alternative fuel that everyone can afford, people will use it.\n \n \n \n\n No, it will still reduce the collective CO2 emission in the countries that is on board with the treaty. It might have some crowing-out effects on certain industries to countries that do not choose to comply. I can`t say for sure how large this crowding-out effect will be, but I doubt it would even get as high as 50%\n\n As long as China is exempt, Kyoto is worthless.\n China has much bigger environmental problems than CO2 emissions anyway.\n It's almost hopeless.\n \n \nChina and Russia would probably free-ride. But it would provide us with a catch on these countries that could be used to liberalise trade, put regulations on working conditions and human rights.\n \n\n If China is exempt how would this liberalize trade?\n There would be an influx of US manufacturing but they already take that and love every minute of it. \n If China won't submit to Kyoto, what makes you think they'll accept any outside regulation on working conditions and human rights.\n \n I just don't see the connection.\n \n \n Anyway, through attrition I concede.\n I can't keep up these extremely long posts.\n It took me way too long to type this out so I just can't keep this discussion up.\n \n My apologies and compliments.",

I guess the important question is; can we stop it or slow it down, and if we can, how do we do it?\n\n Well, here is what I'd like to know.\n Even if we are undergoing global warming, which is truly unclear despite some people saying \"it's a fact that the past 30 years have been warmer than the past 2000,\" why should we try to stop it?\n \n If it truly does become discovered that global warming is occuring and that humans are to blame, then and only then would I suggest \"doing something about it.\"\n \n If we are not the cause, then I don't there is anything we can do about it, and I also don't think we should.\n \n This is unrelated, but it demonstrates the same principle. \n I'm originally from New Orleans so I know this rather well.\n The southern coast of Louisiana is a vast marshland that was build up by silt and sediment deposited by the Mississippi River (or more accurately the Mississippi-Atchafalaya river system). Naturally, the Mississippi's course would change over time and spread silt evenly over southern Louisiana, building up land in the process. Right now, the Mississippi should not be flowing through New Orleans, but probably farther west, and more water should be flowing down the Atchafalaya river depositing more silt even farther west. But this is not happening. there is an extensive dam and levee system that keeps the Mississippi on its present course and keeps the fraction of water that flows to the Atchafalaya at a maximum level. While this keeps the city of New Orleans in existence, it's just dumping silt into the Gulf of Mexico that should be depositing further west right now. InfoThe result is that Louisiana is losing an acre of land every 30 minutes.\n \n This long story is just a way to say that by trying to control nature for our benefit usually has consequences that are detrimental in other ways.\n \n If we head off global warming (if it is indeed happening) then we might save all the people (there's too many) living in coastal areas, but lord knows what the side effects will be.\n \n \n \n* I have no idea wether the Kyoto protocols will save our environment. But I doubt that it would be enough, even assuming that global warming can be stopped or slowed down. \n\n I sincerely doubt that the Kyoto agreement will do anything whatsoever to \"save our environment\" much less curb CO2 emissions. It's just too difficult to do these kinds of things by mandate. It's just too hard to get every country on the planet controlling it's CO2 emissions just by trading carbon credits. You have to somehow affect the global economy in such a way that humans no longer require large amounts of energy to be productive and wealthy. Or you'd have to have a breakthrough in technology to where all of our present and future energy needs will be met sans CO2. \n \n Another way to stop CO2 emissions is to somehow magically change people's values to where they'll spend 50% more on a house with fancy energy saving gadgets like the geothermal heat pump, solar cells, solar water heaters, etc. These things are expensive because they are still (after decades) in a niche market and are very expensive. This could be due to pressure from Big Oil, who knows, but these things are still niche despite government subsidies to make them a bit cheaper because most people (most americans anyway) would much rather spend a lot of money over a long period of time than have to save money and spend a bit more now. (Honestly, that's the american way...'you can afford it if you can afford the monthly payment'.) I don't think they realize that if they spend an extra $20-50,000 on a house with these things they'd probably cut their energy bills by 90% (and you'd be less dependent on fluctations in energy prices).\n \n But anyway, the point is, carbon swapping between half the countries in the world won't do jack.\n \n \n* However, the Kyoto protocol is not as damaging to the global (or US) economy as certain politicians and proffesional thinkers tries to claim. The effect it would have on the US economy seems to be quite manageable and far from the dooms-day scenarios painted by afor-mentioned individuals. The ideas that the US economy would be wrecked has no scientific support (if one could actually call economics a \"science\"). The most comprehensive study made on the subject I know off (the EIA study) supports that the kyoto protocol could be costly for the US taxpayer and consumer, but that the effects would be negliable in the long run. It would not wreck the US economy by a long-shot.\n\n I think these politicians and proffesional thinkers didn't think the Kyoto protocol was any kind of real solution to these phantom problems. They weren't convinced enough that a) global warming is indeed taking place, b) that humans are the cause, and c) that swapping carbon credits and paying out huge sums of money to other countries in the name of said phantom problems would do anything to solve them even if the problems existed.\n \n \n* The mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol is quite sound (even if one could question the actual quotas and credits). By implementing external costs to the consumption of CO2 one can discourage consumption and encourage the use of alternatives.

If we do assume that CO2 is damaging to the enviroment, we have a classic market failiure on our hands. By implementing external costs on the consumption one can actually rectify this market failiure. But this is all in theory.\n\n The quotas and credits are pretty much the whole problem with Kyoto. It's the only way to enforce any kind of compliance with the treaty, but that's why the US balked, I think. Yes, it would put external costs on emission (not consumption) of CO2, but where would that money go? Basically, the money would go into a black hole unless the people in charge of these things were very crafty at trying to get some kind of return on this \"investment.\" \n \n It is superior to just enacting quotas because these would be largely unenforcable.\n \n And putting Kyoto's quota/credit system on any economy would be the total opposite of allowing market forces to rule the economy. \n \n If we assume that CO2 is damaging to the environment then we've gone daffy since CO2 is a necessary part of the atmosphere. Plants (and hence everything else) depend on it. If, however, there is some sort of runaway greenhouse effect, was CO2 to blame? I don't know if we know that.\n \n I did see a show about the Permian Extinction and the theory on how it happened is interesting. There was a huge volcanic \"eruption\" that took up most of present day Siberia in what's known as a \"flood basalt eruption\" that was thousands of square miles and released huge amounts of CO2 for millions of years. It took this long to heat the atmosphere 5 degrees (global average). This was enough to kill off large numbers of species, but it eventually caused methane hydrate deposits under the ocean floor to spew methane for thousands of years and this was enough to raise the temperature another 5 degrees for a total of 10 degrees. This (raising of the temperature, H2S and methane everywhere) led to the mass extinction. \n \n Anyway, I thought that show was interesting, but it showed that for things to be truly catastrophic a lot had to be going wrong.\n \n So all these dire predictions that politicians and proffesional thinkers have come up with about the effects of raising the temperature a degree celcius in the next hundred years is overblown. Even if the predictions are accurate (which is pretty sketchy) then, how did you put it? The effect it would have on the seems to be quite manageable...",

No.\n If anything it's water vapor, the most potent greenhouse gas there is.\n Why didn't they call it water vapor pollution....\n\n Water vapour isn't the \"most potent greenhouse gas\". Suggesting such demonstrates a woeful lack of understanding of how greenhouse gases work (woeful lack of understanding is of course synonymous with opposition to accepting global warming is occuring, so gnojek's ignorance here is no surprise). I shall explain:\n \n Water vapour (WV) stays in the atmosphere for only a week or so before falling back to earth as rain (ie returning from whence it came). Put more WV in the atmosphere and it rains more: the system quickly stabalises. The CO2 cycle is a much longer one (it is actually measured in millions of years when the full cycle of absorbion into plankton, sinkage to the sea floor, subduction and volcanic activity is taken into account, but for the purposes of current emmisions it can be thought of as being in terms of centuries). The length of time that something hangs around is one measure of how polluting it is. CO2 clearly wins here.\n \n Secondly putting CO2 into the atmosphere increases the tempurature in a linear(ish) fashion. As the CO2 keeps rising, the temperature keeps rising. As the tempurature increases, more WV ends up in the atmosphere too. This in turn further heats the atmosphere (as WV is a greenhouse gas) and a bit more water evaporates. This only heats the atmosphere enough to add a fraction of the extra WV caused by CO2 though and so the positive feedback tapers away to nothing rapidly.\n \n So whether WV or CO2 is put into the atmosphere, the amount of WV in the atmosphere increases and the Earth warms up through a limited positive feedback loop. CO2 though hangs around and so keeps the WV levels elevated unlike WV emmissions from power plants. CO2 is the problem and that is why efforts to curb global warming focus on CO2 not WV.",

His aides further argued that the accord - aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels - was written to make it easier for Europe than for the United States to meet the goals.\n \n Mr. Bush's outright rejection of the treaty two months ago led to an uproar in\n Europe. While unapologetic about their decision to back away from the accord, White House officials concede that they did a poor job of explaining their objections or their approach to the problem of reducing heat-trapping gases.\n \n So today, Mr. Bush stepped into the Rose Garden with several of his cabinet\n members and publicly embraced a recent report from the National Academy of\n Sciences that concluded that temperatures are rising because of human\n activities. At the same time, he insisted that his rejection of the Kyoto\n protocol \"should not be read by our friends and allies as any abdication of\n responsibility.\"\n \n \"We will act, learn and act again, adjusting our approaches as science advances\n and technology evolves,\" he said.\n\n \n \n\n But democracy is hardly an excuse.

It's amazing to hear, I know, but it just doesn't happen. The politicians main job in this country (their real job) is to keep the economy growing by lubricating the wheels of big business. If big business is hampered by a single politician or a small group of politicians, then we get new politicians. To really change things, the culture has to change. People's values have to change, and that takes a lot of time. I don't think many people realize how backward the US is, culturally speaking. \n \n \nYou claimed it was \"virtually impossible to enact quotas and bans\". I said it was not. It was just less effective from an economic viewpoint.\n\n Hmm, did I say that? Well, I guess I did, and it depends on what's being banned. I really don't know how it happened, but the whole CFC/ozone scare came through in relatively short order and whoosh, they were banned, no more freon. There wasn't a huge public debate about it for some reason ( I guess no big company was going to lose out substantially, except maybe DuPont or Dow), but bam, they were banned. But to go putting caps and bans on petroleum, now that's dreaming. It's just virtually impossible, in our political and cutural climate, to cap or ban petroleum-related products. It would be like banning SUV's with 5.7 L engines, it's not going to happen.\n \n \nNot necessarily. It depends on wether the consumption of a certain good (material or chemical) or emission also causes costs for others in the society or globaly. If it does, certain bans or quotas may actually be superior to no bans or quotas. Take nuclear weapons for example. If individuals could produce and own nuclear weapons without having to fear being stopped by various states, it is quite possible that we would have no economy to speak of at all.\n\n Ok, I don't think nukes apply to S/D economics, and thank god for it.\n I'm sure you'll argue that everything does, but nukes are a whole class of \"products\" that were never meant for mass consumption, so..\n Also, oil here is practically a \"basic necessity.\" It's pretty much viewed that way here and it pretty much is like that. People have to use a certain minimum of gasoline each day to get to and from work, at the very least. This country has been built around the automobile. You HAVE to have one here, unless you live somewhere like NY, SF, or Chicago or something. There's just NO public transportation to speak of. Where I live you have a bus system, but nobody on any kind of real schedule can take it since a 15 minute car ride turns into 1.5 hour bus ride. Anyway, no matter what the cost of gasoline, people will still use a certain minimum amount. Other things will be sacrificed for it. People won't go out to eat or go to the movies because they spend so much on gas. Electricity is the same way.\n \n \n \nHigher relative cost of oil=less oil consumed=Higher relative cost of products requiring oil for production=less products requiring oil for production consumed. And that`s about it. To counter this effect, you would also see:\n\n vide infra\n \n\n lower relative cost for alternative fuel sources=more alternative fuel sources consumed\n\n Not for cars.\n \n \n=lower relative cost of products requiring alternative fuel sources for production\n\n Not for cars.\n \n\n =more products alternative fuel sources for production consumed.\n\n There's no viable alternative to internal combustion cars right now.\n Maybe in the future we'll have hydrogen cars, but we need to improve them and figure out where we'll get all this hydrogen from. There are hybrids, but they increase the gas mileage by maybe 50% so far. \n \n What would be really nice are hydrogen cars that fill up at gas stations with huge solar panels constantly splitting water, but think about it a minute and the engineering problems are not trivial. Is there enough power from the solar cells to meet demand? Is there enough power to compress the hydrogen? \n \n The only change we'd see in the near future with alterative energy is on the grid. If more people spend the $25,000+ to put solar panels on their roofs they would make their money back in savings in 18-20 years (I got this from a solar lobbyist on TV). There are some states with tax incentives for these things and you'd get a tax break that would cut the price in half and then, if you're area has reversible meters you can sell the power back to the electric service. You'd have a renewable decentralized power grid. But this takes muchos investments and lots of incentives and subsidies. We have to talk the politicians (owned by big business) to stop subsidizing oil, stop funnelling hundreds of billions of dollars into defense contractors pockets to protect oil and seize more oil, all to subsidize wind and solar, from which billionaires can't foresee a huge cash flow in 20 years (once the wind mills and solar panels are up they stop generating cash flow for big companies). \n \n Anyway, the change is happening, just slowly.\n In my area there is what's called the Green Power Switch.\n There are initiatives in most areas toward \"green\" power.\n But remember that for every wind turbine put on a hilltop in the Smokey Mountains, four acres of forest have to clear cut.\n Mass. is installing a wind farm off Cape Cod, Calif. has a new solar power initiative, XXXX like this is springing up all over. It will just take a few years, maybe even a decase or two to be where we need. But again, it can't be rushed too quickly or the real owners of this great land will be really angry.\n \n \n \n \n\n in summation: Higher price on oil=less products and services consumed.\n\n No. Not here.\n Not in the US.\n People would still be forced to buy a certian minimum of gas and use a certain minimum of electricity. \n People would sacrifice other things first before you would see a reduction in usage beyond the minimum needed.\n \n \n \nThe tax imposed on the oil would be used for transfer payments to pay for emission credits and would function roughly like an external increase of the oil price.\n\n Yeah, see, this is lame.\n It's like some foreign country taxing US citizens.\n I know it happens in tariffs, etc, but this would be more direct.\n \n \n Here, but check this article out.\n \n http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050808/full/050808-13.html\n \n \nClimate argument solved?\n Technical errors blamed for mismatch in temperature readings.\n \n Jenny Hogan\n \n The end may be in sight for a 15-year argument over a discrepancy in the data on global warming.\n \n Three papers published in Science today say that temperature trends in the lower atmosphere are consistent with a warming world, countering earlier claims to the contrary.\n \n One study deals with satellite measurements, the second with data from weather balloons and the third with predictions of climate models. \"Taken together, these three results are a major step forward,\" says Carl Mears of Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, California, an author of one of the papers.\n \n The problems began in 1990, when an analysis of satellite observations showed the troposphere - the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere - was warming too slowly compared to the surface for climate models to be correct1. Global-warming sceptics seized upon the result.\n \n \"It has been the main crutch of the sceptics when it comes to pooh-poohing global warming, with some success,\" says Kevin Trenberth, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Some politicians have also cited the data as evidence of the uncertainties in global warming.\n \n The 1990 study, headed by John Christy from the University of Huntsville, Alabama, was criticized for the way it used satellite data. This prompted multiple rounds of revision, but never really solved the problem. A recent re-analysis in Nature2, which claimed to solve the debate, also fell short of being definitive.\n \n Converging work\n \n So why pin any hopes on the new papers? \"We are converging, we are definitely getting closer,\" says Mears.\n \n He and Frank Wentz, also at Remote Sensing Systems, tackled a problem with how the satellite data are corrected for the time of day. Although the satellites nominally pass over the same point at the same time each day, in practice drag causes their orbits to sink and the time to drift.\n \n Christy's group estimated the temperature at the exact time they wanted, rather than when the satellite actually was overhead, by looking at temperature measurements the satellite took to the east and west of its position. From this they concluded the troposphere was warming by about 0.09 \u00b0C per decade.\n \n Mears and Wentz instead used data generated by a complex model of the atmosphere to adjust the satellite measurements. On doing so, the troposphere suddenly appears to be warming by almost 0.2 \u00b0C per decade, in agreement with climate models3.\n \n The new work is bound to draw its own criticism, however. \"It's going to be very interesting to see how this reverberates through the climate-sceptic blogosphere. I expect by Tuesday there will be plenty of articles calling me a fraud,\" says Mears.\n \n Burst balloon\n \n The second paper points out problems in the temperature record from weather balloons. Steven Sherwood and co-authors argue that changes in instruments have made the records untrustworthy4. The problems arise because different manufacturers' instruments heat up by different amounts during the day. At the moment, they say, the errors on this data are so big that one can't pin down how much the troposphere is warming.\n \n The third piece of research, led by Ben Santer from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, concludes that disagreement between 19 climate models and measurements are more likely to be due to errors in measurements, rather than models5.\n \n \"I don't think this will be the last word,\" says Phil Jones, a researcher from the University of East Anglia, UK, who has looked at the new results for the next assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n \n \"Certain people have too much invested to admit they accept all these reports,\" Jones says. \"But there's quite a bit of agreement in the whole community that these papers are getting closer to the truth.\"\n \n \n References\n \n 1.

Then we have the income effect, the effect of US consumers having to pay more for oil based products limits their ability to purchase (and cosnume) as much in a very natural way.\n \n The fact that the US consumers both has the lowest price on oil in the western world as well as having the, by far, highest consumption of oil sugests that the substitution effect would be rather substantial (even though it`s not evidence of anything). I would be extramly surprised if the average US consumer was anywhere near the minimimum ammount of oil consumtption he needs in order to function properly.\n \n And even if there is no viable alternative to gasoline for combustion engines, there are numerous alternative choices you could make to decrease your gasoline consumption. Perhaps not for everyone, but for many. Besides, driving your car is only one of many ways an advanced economy uses oil.\n \n The \"Higher price on oil=less products and services consumed\" comment refered to products and services in general. Not only products and services based on oil.\n\n \n \n I really don't think people that have never lived in the US will understand.\n The case for the large majority of americans is that you MUST drive.\n \n When I said there was a certain minimum amount you MUST drive, I was taking all of what you said into account. \n \n But, yes, Americans would consume less in total. I think we have a problem with overconsumption in the US, so maybe less consumption would be bad, but when accountants and economists look at overall numbers and see people consuming less and less, they take this to mean that the economy has been wrecked.\n \n The thought of being able to consume less is seen as being poor in the minds of most americans.",

The only difference might be the relative affluence of public transportation and the more sensible city planning in the more urban parts of Sweden (read: in our three larger cities). The capita/square mile figure does not differ very much.\n\n Overall the pop density might be the same, but American cities are much more sprawled than European ones. For instance, the place I currently live, Nashville, Tennessee, is pretty common in the amount of sprawl. I made it a point to move close to work so I wouldn't be in my car 20-30 minutes on the way to work, but I still would have to walk about a mile to get to the nearest supermarket, which is a smaller, low quality \"mom & pop\" store. If I actually want groceries I would want I have to drive about 5 miles. The nearest place to buy anything at all is a gas station about 1/2 mile away, but what do I need there? I don't smoke cigarettes. Anyway, anywhere I need to go, I pretty much have to drive, and I live right in the middle of town. Everyone lives on their own 1/4 acre or 1/2 acre lots and that makes for some serious sprawl. If you go to the outskirts people have even bigger lots. The only place where there is high rise living is downtown and anyone who lives there would really have to drive because there's nothing down there except bars, strip clubs, and adult book stores (oh and Christian book stores, there's one right across the street from a strip club :)).\n \n There is NO public transportation. If I did want to ride the bus, which people do, but only people who are either in no hurry or have the time to spend on the bus, I would have to walk about a mile to the nearest bus stop.\n \n There are cities with public transportation of some sort, but they are in the minority. I was in San Diego recently and they have a nice trolly system and a decent bus service (that runs on methane). I didn't need a car for the few days I was there, but then again I was in the middle of town.\n \n \nAnd no, you can`t claim that something will wreck your economy just because it will have some marginal effect on the public consumption opportunities.

Who projected the economy to keep growing? Are they saying that we can keep sustainable growth and pay hundreds of billions of dollars to other countries for their carbon credits? So what they are saying is that we should just go ahead and pay more for everything because the GDP numbers would look ok? The total GDP doesn't mean squat to the average consumer. All that matters is that he can't buy nearly as much anymore, he is poorer.",

   "No need to Google it, but if you make a claim like that, you should be prepared to back it up, or more specifically, have the info in hand BEFORE making the claim.\n \n Besides, I think you've pretty much proved my point. \n \n Other than a couple of VWs and other rarities, which might have accounted for 0.1% of the vehicles on the road, there's really no comparison when it comes to efficiency.\n\n Would they be rarities if people bought them?\n NO.\n Americans didn't want them because they weren't big enough or fast enough.\n \n Remember the Metro?\n Was it a rarity?\n Why?\n \n It didn't have to be.\n \n \n \n\n There is definitely truth to this, but IMHO, we've done a decent job of improving mpg and emissions while actually increasing power.\n \n The late 90's and early 00's have actually seen a bit of a return to the HP wars of the 60's and 70's, especially in the truck market, and IMHO, that will change with rising fuel costs.\n\n Exactly. As long as fuel was \"cheap\" Americans would buy the more powerful less fuel efficient cars.\n \n In the seventies after the oil emargo thingie we saw an influx of compact cars, but before then what was the big thing? Muscle cars.\n Gas guzzling GTOs and Mustangs were the thing when gas costed a quarter.\n Oh, and huge boats like Mercuries, Buicks, and Lincolns.\n \n Then gas went up and more people bought more fuel efficient cars.\n Then inflation went up but gas didn't (relatively) to where gas was about a buck a gallon for like 20 years. The cars people bought became more powerful.\n \n \n\n \n I could point to the same thing today, the VW TDI, Smart cars, etc..., all are MUCH better and more efficient than the examples you provided, and in reality, almost as rare on our roads. Though I have seen personally a definite increase in their numbers lately.\n\n These are innovative and expensive.\n The cars I'm talking about were cheap.\n \n \nAnyhoo, my point is, to suggest that cars 30 years ago, even specific cars, were more efficient when compared to today's vehicles, is false and misleading.\n\n It's not false and certainly not misleading, but only so if you thought that I meant that the cars people actually bought in bulk were more fuel efficient.\n \n There were more than a few models, of which only a handful come to mind, like the Sprint, the Rabbit, Hell I think even my dad's old 1977 Corolla he had got over 30 mpg. \n \n They weren't really rarities like you say, but they weren't people's favorite car because they were small and low on power, but who needs that much power?\n \n As an example, my mom drives a Chevy Tahoe. This is a huge frikkin SUV. \n http://trucks.about.com/od/2004suvprofiles/p/04_tahoe.htm\n It's gas mileage is 16/19 (1960 trucks anyone?).\n Sometimes she loads it up with gardening stuff and it's handy with groceries, but usually she just drives it 20 miles to work and 20 miles back everyday by herself. She runs errands in it, etc. All that space is just left empty, but she still has to shell out $50 at the pump. It's totally absurd. And now when you notice about 1 in 3 cars is some sort of SUV or truck, neither of which beat the fuel efficiency of small car 30 years ago. \n \n\n I think you'll see some of these innovations coming down the line if they can be proven and there's demand. Like you said, they aren't new ideas, and if they were truly possible and could meet the claims, IMHO, you'd have seen them put into production long ago.\n\n Not if oil companies have a hand in it. ;)\n \n \n \nThere's no magic cure, and there's certainly no group of old guys in suits, sitting around a table in a dimly lit room puffing on cigars and plotting to crush all of these innovations to line their pockets.\n\n Isn't that what oil companies are all about?\n and tobacco companies, and drug companies, and media...\n It's all just a bunch of old families and secret societies plotting how to enslave the world. buhahahaha...",

That point has been made, even if you choose not to acknowledge it.\n \n \nThere were more than a few models, of which only a handful come to mind, like the Sprint, the Rabbit, Hell I think even my dad's old 1977 Corolla he had got over 30 mpg. \n \n \n MOST cars today get 30 mpg, and they're more powerful, and they're better built.\n \n Other than the few, the majority of American built cars were no where near that efficient.\n \n \nThey weren't really rarities like you say, but they weren't people's favorite car because they were small and low on power, but who needs that much power?\n\n \n Ever try driving a Sprint around in a busy city? Ever try merging? How about in the country? How about loading a family into it?\n \n There are reasons they were rarities, and they go way beyond mpg.\n \n \nAs an example, my mom drives a Chevy Tahoe.

Thats 3.6 ten thousands of a percent, and is virtually nothing.\n \n Second, the Earth actually started warming around 1850 (as a result of the Little Ice Age ending), and CO2 emissions became prominent only 50 years later. \n \n Third, the Earths temperature is currently rising at about the same rate as it declined during the Little Ice Age, so you cant really call whats happening unusual. \n \n Third, (while this isnt actually evidence against global warming) there is no real scientific consensus on global warming. 55% of Scientists believe global warming is a result of anthropogenic causes, 14% arent sure, and 29% think it is not a result of anthropogenic causes.\n \n Fourth, things were much hotter in Roman times then they are now, so nothing particularly catostrophic is around the corner.\n\n \n Lets not try to confuse people with emperical facts.... it just makes things hazy...\n \n \n People who totally deny GW are looking for ultimate truth, much like creationists.\n \n Even if the entire world decends out of climate equilibrium, they will still deny it is human activity. \n \n Meanwhile, environmental wackos will try to mitigate the effects.\n \n I find it amusing how conservatives refuse to embrace conservation, and further, refuse to accept the theory of a closed environment.\n \n Closed environment? Let me explain.\n \n Imagine a rude uncle that smokes a cigar in your car. You roll down the window a little, but he suddenly complains he is cold, so you roll the window back up! At what point does the smoke from your rude uncle affect the other people in your car? At what point is it acceptable?\n \n Is it acceptable?\n \n The same applies to this planet.

It's an 80km drive to go and see them on a weekend. Flights are REALLY expensive, so I drive. Usually once a month, or every second month. That's a 1600km round trip, just to go home for the weekend.

I'd love to move back home, but Calgary is the center of the oil business in Canada, so quite simply, if I want to work in my chosen field, or have any opportunity of having a successful career such as the one I'm currently in, there really are no options. Again, it's real simple to just say \"just move closer to home\".\n \n As far as seeing your family every 6 weeks, you find it excessive, I find it woefully lacking. Both my wife and I are from Regina, and both of us have strong ties to not only our immediate family, but much extended family as well. It's a 7 hour drive one way, at current gas prices it's about $80 one way in the car, $160 if we take my truck and load of stuff.\n \n In Calgary for example, due to simple geography (at one time in the 1970's Calgary had the greatest area/capita of any city in the world, not sure if that's still true), it would not be simple to just plan more fuel efficiently. We have an extensive light rail system and public transport, but the city is huge, and there's a lot of traffic volume. \n \n As for SUVs in Texas and California, and even most of them right here in Calgary, they are not justifiable, I agree. They're a luxury, and IMHO, they will slowly disappear as fuel prices rise. Unfortunately, the ones who'll really pay are those for which a truck or SUV is not a luxury.\n \n I plan to see England and Scotland myself sooner than later, so I'll give it a try. :p \n \n Waxy",
