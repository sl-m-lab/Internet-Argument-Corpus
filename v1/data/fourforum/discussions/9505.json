   "For the first few weeks after the election, the main emphasis from both parties seemed to be about \"power\".\n \n The democrats crowed frequently about the gain of their power, including Pelosi flexing some muscle. The republicans cried about their loss of power.\n \n It seems to me that our politicians have the completely wrong viewpoint. Ours is supposed to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. OUr reps and pres and justices should not be flexing power but rather representing the people to whom the power is invested.\n \n We have let politicians pervert our constitution to enable their own agendas. No matter which party they are from. I propose that in the next election we, as a country, organize and elect only independents. The unknown person who does not have that much money.\n \n Both parties claim to be for the little guy. Name one poor or middle class american serving in a federally elected position. You cannot.\n \n Both sides represent large money. Take a look at the paying contributors to the various campaigns. It will astonish you. Big money. \n \n Here are the top five contributors to the DNC for 2006:\n \n Goldman Sachs\n \n $132,700\n \n Pond North LLP\n \n $109,296\n \n Jonathan Rose & Co\n \n $106,800\n \n Hill Wallack\n \n $100,000\n \n Lehman Brothers\n \n $86,650\n \n and here are the top five to the RNC for 2006\n The Villages\n \n $300,000\n \n Goldman Sachs\n \n $245,655\n \n Enterprise Rent-A-Car\n \n $227,220\n \n Federated Investors Inc\n \n $225,234\n \n NVR Homes\n \n $210,200\n \n Here are the top 5 industries contributing to the DNC 2006\n \n Retired\n \n $6,568,175\n \n Lawyers/Law Firms\n \n $2,766,167\n \n Securities & Investment\n \n $2,018,535\n \n Real Estate\n \n $1,245,892\n \n Education\n \n $1,199,298\n \n And for the RNC 2006:\n \n Retired\n \n $14,002,246\n \n Real Estate\n \n $5,679,405\n \n Securities & Investment\n \n $5,214,665\n \n Misc Business\n \n $4,512,587\n \n Misc Finance\n \n $2,909,640\n \n I find it highly interesting information. We keep going after big oil and defense and their contributions are insignificant compared to banking, securities, and real estate. Not to mention the retired lobby which is growing as the baby boomers age.\n \n I look forward to the replys\n \n Huck",

With three, it would make it harder to get/keep in power, so they would have to represents us better.",
