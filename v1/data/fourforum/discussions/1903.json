   "Paul Finkleman, a professor at the Univerisity of Tulsa College of Law, explains why interpreting the second amendment as protecting an individual right is absurd. \n\n \n Despite the fact that every bit of historical evidence, including every piece written by every one of the original frames of the constitution says this is EXACTLY what they mean\n \n \n \n\"Unlike the Pennsylvania constitution, the language of the Second Amendment is absolute: 'shall not be infringed.' \n\n \n Just like the first amendment starts with \"Congress shall make no law\", which is no less absolute. OR the fourth, \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\". Do I need to go on? Every one of the original ten amendments, witht he exception of the 6th and 7th contain strong language that leave no doubts as to the fact that the rights are protected. Yet we DO have laws regarding free speach, the DMCA, etc...\n \n \nIf read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all stand armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. \n \n \n No, beacuse felons forfeit their rights. Criminals are not criminals until they break the law. Pirates (which tot he best of my knowledge we do not have a problem with) are fine, too, unless they commit a felony, in which case they forfeit their rights (just like they forfeit their right to vote).\n \n \nPirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out sea. \n \n \n And for years they did. They still can. Again, there is not a real problem with pirates.\n \n \nHunters could trample through Yellowstone or any other national park, guns in hand. \n \n \n YES, of course, they could not actually hunt, since that would be illegal, possibly a felony, whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights. \n \n \nAnyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House or any other federal building. \n \n \n Most people who have unrestriced access to the white house and congress are also authorised to carry a gun there. IF you are worried about the tour groups, they are not that well screened anyway. THere is not very much right now stopping one of them from carrying a gun into these buildings. there just isn't really a point.\n \n \nAfter all, what better place to exercise your Second Amendment rights than if front of your representatives or even in the courts of justice. Absurd as this would be, such people could not be 'disarmed,' at least until they begin to commit a crime, if the Second Amendment creates an individual right to bear arms. \n \n \n As opposed to the liberal viewpoint, where you trample our rights on the offchance that we MIGHT someday commit a crime. By this logic, men should be castrated at birth in order to ensure that they do not rape somebody later on. \n \n \nTaken to its logical extreme, we might argue that, just as a federal felon, serving time, has some First Amendment rights to the press, petition and religion, or Eighth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel punishment, so too, a prisoner might claim some second amendment right. The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not.\"\n\n \n BUt felons do not have full first amendment rights, there are a lot of rights that convicted felons forfeit, and this guy knows it. \n \n \n \nCome to think of it, people don't have to pass a criminal background check before they can exercise their first amendment rights. So why should you have to submit to a background check when purchasing a gun if the second amendment protects an individual right?\n\n \n EXACTLY. This guy has finnaly said something that makes sense, as opposed to all that drivel above. It never fails to amaze me to what extent some of the liberals out there will go to in order to convince us that the second amendment does not mean exactly what it says. ANy ten yr old can understand it. This one is one of the more interesting ones for two reasons.\n \n 1. The ease at which it can be torn down \n 2. This is the first time I have ever seen anybody argue that we need to interpet the second amendment as a collective right in order to combat piracy (somebody has seen pirates of the carribean too many times)",

Oh please, just shoot me. \n \n BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL \n Friday, February 6, 2004 12:01 a.m. EST \n \n History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses, men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it. There's the hemlocked Socrates, the house-arrested Galileo, the exiled Rousseau. And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles.\n \n Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book \"Arming America.\" An academic bombshell, the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns. This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights. Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise, becoming an instant academic star.\n \n That is, until his peers started looking into that little thing called research. Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records, travel narratives, and other documents. Mr. Bellesiles, when asked to explain, provided ever-more outlandish excuses: that his notes had been lost in a flood, that his Web site had been hacked, that he couldn't remember where he'd found certain documents. The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award, he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book. Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal.\n \n But oh, no. It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse, his nonexistent guns still blazing. Soft Skull Press (which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin) has not only agreed to reissue \"Arming America\" but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles's latest response to his critics. This 59-page pamphlet, \"Weighed in an Even Balance,\" is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world's latest misunderstood genius. As such, it's worth reading for pure entertainment value.\n \n \n \n \n \n Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor's creative excuses and dissembling. He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government (though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize, right?). He does acknowledge a few errors, but only after pointing out that \"even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes.\" As proof, he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman.\n But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth. And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display. The very title of his book is taken from Job: \"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may known mine integrity.\"\n \n And that's just for starters. The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men, all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles's argument that he is fighting the good fight. We hear from Isaiah Berlin: \"Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth.\" One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century, Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle. We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons.\n \n We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement, the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration. And finally, in case readers still aren't getting his drift, Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion: \"There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain, unchanging past. The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect, it is dangerously undemocratic, and as such should be of concern to every modern historian.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n In fact, the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change. If it were, we'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth. Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity. But before they completely cast aside mountains of research, they usually demand some proof. Mr. Bellesiles's problem isn't that he's misunderstood; it's that he still hasn't given them any.\n Or as the old saying goes: \"To be a persecuted genius, you not only have to be persecuted; you also have to be right.\"\n \n \n Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal.",

Read this article-\n \n \n The Bellesiles of the Right?\n Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data.\n By Timothy Noah\n Posted Monday, Feb. 3, 2003, at 4:19 PM PT \n \n \n What is it about statistics and guns? Last year, Michael Bellesiles, a historian at Emory College, came under criticism for his Bancroft Prize-winning book, Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, which argued that gun ownership was far less common during the 18th and 19th century than is generally supposed. His analysis, which was obviously pleasing to proponents of gun control, was drawn from probate records. But Bellesiles was unable to produce all of his data, owing, he said, to a flood in his office. After a committee of three scholars examined Bellesiles' research, they concluded that \"his scholarly integrity is seriously in question.\" Bellesiles resigned from Emory in disgrace.\n \n Now one of Bellesiles' principal critics, a Northwestern law professor named James Lindgren, has turned his skeptical attention to a scholar who is Bellesiles' ideological opposite: John R. Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime. Once again, the issue is the disappearance of supporting data.\n \n Lott's More Guns, Less Crime is the bible of the national movement to persuade state legislatures to pass so-called \"concealed carry\" laws, which permit citizens to carry concealed firearms. The book's thesis is that populations with greater access to firearms are better able to deter crime. Some scholars have quarreled with Lott's interpretation, but this controversy is about underlying data. Lindgren and others want to know where Lott got the evidence to support the following sentence, which appears on Page 3 of Lott's book: \"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.\"\n \n Initially, Lott sourced the 98 percent figure to \"national surveys.\" That's how the first edition of More Guns, Less Crime put it. In an August 1998 op-ed for the Chicago Tribune, Lott appeared to cite three specific surveys:\n \n Polls by the Los Angeles Times, Gallup and Peter Hart Research Associates show that there are at least 760,000, and possibly as many as 3.6 million, defensive uses of guns per year. In 98 percent of the cases, such polls show, people simply brandish the weapon to stop an attack.\n \n But polls by the Los Angeles Times, Gallup, and Peter Hart show no such thing. \n \n Alternatively, Lott would sometimes attribute the 98 percent figure to Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. In a February 2000 op-ed for Colorado's Independence Institute, Lott wrote: \"Kleck's study of defensive gun uses found that ninety-eight percent of the time simply brandishing the weapon is sufficient to stop an attack.\" But Kleck's research shows no such thing.\n \n Eventually, Lott settled on yet another source for the 98 percent figure: \"a national survey that I conducted,\" as Lott put it in a second edition of More Guns, Less Crime. When asked about the survey, Lott now says it was done by telephone in 1997 and that the data was lost a few months later in a computer crash.\n \n Lott's conflicting explanations naturally attracted suspicion, first from Otis Dudley Duncan, a retired sociologist at the University of California, San Diego, who wrote an article on the matter for the Criminologist, and eventually from Lindgren, the Bellesiles gumshoe, who has been posting his findings online. (Chatterbox is indebted to Tim Lambert, a computer scientist and gun-control advocate at the University of New South Wales, for compiling various documents relating to the Lott case.) When Chatterbox asked Lott about the serial attributions to \"national surveys,\" to three specific polls, and to Kleck, Lott conceded, \"A lot of those discussions could have been written more clearly.\" He said that in the computer crash, he lost all his data for the book and had to reconstruct it, but that he couldn't reconstruct the survey. Lott has been able to produce witnesses who remember him talking about this obviously traumatic event soon after it occurred. But none of these people specifically remember him talking about losing data for a survey he'd conducted. Nor has Lott been able to produce the names of the college students he says conducted the phone surveys in Chicago, where Lott was teaching at the time. (Lott is now at Washington's American Enterprise Institute.)\n \n The only compelling evidence that the 1997 survey ever took place is the testimony of David M. Gross, a Minnesotan who contacted Lott after the controversy spread to various Weblogs. (To date, the only mainstream news organization that's covered the data dispute is the Washington Times, whose Robert Stacy McCain had a piece about the Lott affair on Jan. 23. The Feb. 1 Washington Post examined a bizarre side issue, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.) Gross told Chatterbox, \"I have come to the conclusion that I in fact did\" participate in the study, \"based on some of the details of my recollection.\" What Gross recalls is that in January 1999-a year before questions were first raised about Lott's data-he attended a talk Lott gave at the Minneapolis Athletic Club. (Gross can pinpoint the date, he says, because he bought a tape.) After Lott's remarks, Gross walked up to Lott and told him he'd figured out, while listening to Lott discuss the 1997 survey, that he, Gross, had participated in that survey. Both the timing and the content, as described by Lott, match what Gross remembers about the survey, which is the only gun poll he recalls ever participating in.\n \n Gross recited his story to Chatterbox with a precision that seemed to reflect both his natural temperament and his professional training as a lawyer. It didn't sound as though Gross could be getting this wrong. But, as the bloggers Atrios and Mark Kleiman have noted, Gross is a pro-gun activist-indeed, a former national board member of the National Rifle Association. Gross was also the founding director of the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, and as an attorney he now represents that group in a legal challenge stemming from its appropriation of the name, Citizens for a Safer Minnesota, which previously belonged to a gun-control group that carelessly let lapse its registration with the Minnesota secretary of state. It's odd (though not impossible) that such a bare-knuckled advocate would turn up in a randomly generated survey.\n \n Even if the survey did take place, why should we believe the stated finding? Lott says he repeated the 1997 survey last year. He can't reveal the results, he says, because the publisher of his next book won't let him. But he has shown the results to Daniel Polsby, a law professor at George Mason. Polsby reports that while he won't endorse the methodology-\"I have questions about it\"-the results were \"approximately the same.\" (This time the percentage was slightly lower than 98 percent-by how much, Polsby won't say.) \"John is a very intense man, he rubs a lot of people the wrong way,\" Polsby told Chatterbox. But \"faking something like this would not be John's style.\"\n \n One type of faking that apparently is Lott's style is the assumption of a fictional identity on the Internet. (This is the piece of the story that the Washington Post's Richard Morin zeroed in on.) Lott has posted Web comments defending his work using a \"sock puppet\" named Mary Rosh. He was busted by Julian Sanchez, a blogger who works at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. One posting that Lott has admitted to posting read as follows:\n \n I had [Lott] for a PhD level empirical methods class when he taught at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania back in the early 1990s, well before he gained national attention, and I have to say that he was the best professor that I ever had. You wouldn't know that he was a 'right-wing' ideologue from the class. ... There were a group of us students who would try to take any class that he taught. Lott finally had to tell us that it was best for us to try and take classes from other professors more to be exposed to other ways of teaching graduate material.\n \n Mary Rosh also gave More Guns, Less Crime a rave review on Amazon.com:\n \n Lott writes very well. He explains things in an understandable commonsense way. I have loaned out my copy a dozen times and while it may have taken some effort to get people started on the book, once they read it no one was disappointed. If you want an emotional book, this is not the book for you.\n \n Lott says he didn't post the Amazon review; his 16-year-old son did. The \"Mary Rosh\" e-mail address belongs to his four sons, Lott told Chatterbox-it's derived from their first names-and Lott has used it now and then so that, if he fails to answer a response, it won't be interpreted as \"me conceding things.\" Lott now says the deception was \"wrong.\"\n \n We know Lott invented an online persona. Did he invent the 98 percent figure? Did he invent the survey it purportedly came from? We don't know. \"People who are on the gun-control side of the debate,\" says Polsby, \"are hurting on account of Bellesiles. And they want a scalp. John, for one reason or another, is a beautiful scalp to get. For one thing, he's not a terribly good witness on his own behalf.\" Is Lott the Bellesiles of the right? Chatterbox is not yet prepared to say. \n \n [Clarification, Feb. 5: In the Minneapolis lecture that Gross attended, Lott recited the \"98 percent\" statistic, but did not specifically attribute it to a study that he himself had conducted. Gross simply deduced that he, Gross, had participated in whatever study produced the 98 percent figure. Also, although the anti-gun-control group, Citizens for a Safer Minnesota, is part of the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, MGOCRA is not technically a party to the lawsuit about whether CSM can keep its name.]\n http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/\n \n Another article about Lott:\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A8884-2003Jan31&notFound=true",

It was just a sidebar. an observation he found interesting, but it did not bear any consequence whatsoever to the main claims laid forth in his work.\n \n You don't see a difference here?

   "The \"collective rights\" theory first came about following WWI. It became more popular following WWII.\n \n The founding fathers were not big fans of eliteists, which was one of the reasons the bill of rights was included in the constitution. The idea was, whether you are born a billionair kennedy or the son of a janitor, you are absolutly gauranteed these rights, no matter what else may happen. Period.\n \n Following WWI, there came a shift in public opinion. Americans decided that maybe these elitests weren't such bad folks. The \"Collective rights\" theory was originally the \"elitist theory\" in regards to the second amendment. The idea was to keep guns and such away from us common trash.\n \n Following WWII, we saw an uprising of disenters in America. Communists and socialists seemed to be everywhere (Although they really weren't, there were just a limited number of them screeching very loud, like gun control advocates). This was when the \"collective rights\" theory really started to take off. This coincided with an upsurge of fascism in the united states. Instead of seeing the government as a slave of the people, it slowly began transforming itself into the cornerstone of America (instead of the people). People looked the other way during this, because the over-hyped threat of communism seemed so great that extraordinary measures seemed acceptable. As it has been pointed out on several occasions, a fascist regime prefers an unarmed public.\n \n \n IT is interesting that even today, when we are an undisputed superpower and expansionist communism is dead, there is still a fascist streak n America a mile wide.",

   "Paul Finkleman, a professor at the Univerisity of Tulsa College of Law, explains why interpreting the second amendment as protecting an individual right is absurd. \n \"Unlike the Pennsylvania constitution, the language of the Second Amendment is absolute: 'shall not be infringed.' If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all stand armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or any other national park, guns in hand. Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House or any other federal building. After all, what better place to exercise your Second Amendment rights than if front of your representatives or even in the courts of justice. Absurd as this would be, such people could not be 'disarmed,' at least until they begin to commit a crime, if the Second Amendment creates an individual right to bear arms. Taken to its logical extreme, we might argue that, just as a federal felon, serving time, has some First Amendment rights to the press, petition and religion, or Eighth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel punishment, so too, a prisoner might claim some second amendment right. The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not.\"\n \n Come to think of it, people don't have to pass a criminal background check before they can exercise their first amendment rights. So why should you have to submit to a background check when purchasing a gun if the second amendment protects an individual right?\n\n \n The reason why federal felons don't have guns in prison is because they don't have rights. Prisoners sometimes don't even have the right to life and they get executed. They don't even get the right to vote. The don't have the right to privacy, they can be searched at any time for any reason and without any cause. They don't have the right to self-determination. The certainly can not go any where they wish. Even thier right to contract and property is restricted. They can not own and purchase lots of items and services in prison that are normally accessible to people who have not been convicted of crimes. So I don't understand your argument. \n \n Plus this person you quote has a poor reputation on this issue. He clearly is willing to do unethical and immoral things to achive gun control.\n \n If you wish take gun owners rights, then at the very least gun owners should get a trial just like prisoners. Before prisoners get thier rights removed, a judge and jurry say they can not have rights. By restricting my right to gun ownership two more rights are violated. My right to contract and my right to a fair trial.\n \n So in conclusion, with one act, 4 civil rights are violated.",

   "Okay so I'll bite and please be gentle since I'm not overly interested or informed on this issue. What is the meaning of a \"well regulated militia\" and whose regulating? \n\n \n As you have ascribed two different problems, actually three problems, I will answer as such.\n \n First, being as gentle as possible, and certainly meaning not one iota of disrespect, I submit to you, you should be interested. If not to the point of 'overly', which I admit, will certainly not approach my interest, I'm sure, but nevertheless, it should be of major concern to every man, woman, and child in this country.\n \n Secondly, as to 'well regulated' and who does the regulating, we must harken back to what was meant at the time of the writing of the Bill of Rights, and the ratification of such. A 'well regulated' militia was no more than a well trained and appointed one. Usually, once a month, there was a gathering 'on the green' of all men between the ages of , 1st, 16 to 60, and then as settled on, 17 to 45. They were checked to make sure they possessed their OWN firearm, of the type commonly used by the regular forces, so much shot and powder, provisions, and a blanket. They were then trained in tactics and marksmanship. The training was carried out by those usually elected as leaders by the militia.\n \n \n For the record I'm not particularly troubled by gun ownership but clearly we have a problem with the number of shootings in this country and us all packing in public hardly seems a practical solution.\n\n \n Again, you have described two distinct problems, neither which is, inspite of what the LIB GGs would have us believe, is causal of the other. Inspite of what the GGs would have you believe, people, honest, law abiding people, 'packing' in public, are not the problem. Criminals, 'packing' in public, are the problem. The criminals will always do as they wish, even as the GGs pass gun control law upon gun contol law. It's what criminals do.\n \n Short of mandatory swift and sure very extreme punishment for those committing felonious acts with firearms, I would suggest there is little to be done. The same LIB GGs would have us believe it to be more appropiate to infringe upon the rights of honest and law abiding citizens, IN HOPE OF THE PROBLEM BEING CORRECTED,  than it is to have mandatory extreme punishment for those committing crimes with a firearm. This very thing causes a conundrum for me, in that I believe murder by misuse of a firearm, is no more heinous than if a knife was used, or poison, or garroting, but the general public has been spoonfed the idea, criminal misuse of a firearm, especially murder, is somehow more reprehensible. Rape at the point of a knife is as heinous as at the muzzle of a firearm. Assault with a bat is as heinous as with a firearm.\n \n Having said that, I am faced with whether I would agree to very strict, unwavering, and unimpeachable punishment for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, or continue to let the LIB GGs peck away and usurp a Constittutionally Protected Right. I choose the former solution.\n \n I would submit to you, Sinjin, to study the issue, become interested, and join the fray. ( Hopefully, you will become a proponent of the right )",

Are the penalties stiffer than ours? Is a handgun overkill?\n Could it be that both criminals and law-abiding gun enthusiasts in the US have a shared belief in the value of firearms that is absent in other societies?\n\n \n A good question, Sinjin. Basically I can only give you some reasons I may think are appropiate. First, the demographics of most of those countries are far different than in ours. As our nation truly became the melting pot of the world, so did we inherit all the pecadillos of those comprising our melting pot. I would suggest in a country with a smaller population, or even fewer etnic variations, violence, though beginning to rise, has not reached the level it is in this country yet. I would suggest further, those, advocating to the contrary have never been able to tie causally, together, the effect of firearm ownership and violence. They may try, but so far, I am not convinced they have done so.\n \n Again, I can only speak to what works for me, and as such, I again submit you should study the issue thoroughly and arrive at your own conclusion. \n \n I will even go farther and advocate to you, that having a constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms, entails within that right not only the good side of the issue, but the bad, as well. The bad, of course, is we can not look into the hearts of men and determine before hand, how noble they may be, how irresponsible they may be, how stupid they may be or may become, nor whether they are criminals at heart. I further submit, our system of jurisprudence, precludes those evils to which we may fall to. This is true of every other constitutionally protected right we have. The misuse of any can bring the law down upon our heads, but it is always after the act of the commission. In a totalitarian society, one can be punished for that which one may become, or at least that which the STATE may envision one becoming. I believe most of our brethren in this country would agree, yet many wish to punish gun owners for what may be, not what is, or what has been.\n \n One other thought. In those countries with more stringent and draconian gun control laws, there is some evidence, at least from what I gather, to suggest the criminal misuse of firearms is rising. Is it true. You have todecide for yourself.",
