   "Anybody ever notice just how full of hypocrisy the gun control people really are? Take for example the people in Philadelphia over in Pennsylvania. The state has firearms preemption, that means that only the state is allowed to pass gun control laws. Philadelphia doesn't like that, they want home rule, they think that they should be able to pass their own gun control laws that're more strict than what the state will allow. So what do they do? They break state law and enact their own laws, and order the police to arrest anyone violating these illegal laws. Even after being told by Pennsylvania courts that they're not allowed to do that, the people in Philadelphia are basically saying \"F**k you, we're gonna do what we want anyway\" by enforcing these illegal provisions. The story is the same over in Washington state.\n \n We've got people who want guns banned as far as they can possibly get them, and to do so they're willing to commit a criminal action and violate the laws to get them banned. Talk about being hypocrites. \"We're gonna break the laws we don't like to enforce the ones we do like.\" Yeah that'll go over really well. By disregarding the set laws, they're sending a bad example to everybody else. If you don't like a local gun law, should you as a resident be allowed to break it since your legislator broke other laws to enact it?\n \n The anti-gun crowd are sure big on politicians and legislators being able to violate the laws on the books and the Constitution, saying that it's necessary and should be allowed. But when it comes to people like you or me deciding that we don't want to obey laws we don't like, they want us thrown in prison for being criminals.",

So guns occasionally get stolen, so what? Do you know how much cash gets stolen and used to finance drug addictions and buy illegal goods? Maybe we should restrict people carrying around cash on their person for the same reason you believe we should restrict gun ownership; because it can be stolen and used for criminal purposes.\n \n Maybe we should restrict cars too since they can just as easily be stolen and used in crimes.\n \n And another thing. This still isn't proof that we're contributing to criminals having guns. Your \"proof\" points out that all of those guns were reported as stolen, meaning the police have been alerted of the theft. Why would we be tipping off the police that we're arming bad guys if we really were guilty of such?\n \n \nAnd straw purchases:\n \n \"It had long been presumed that most guns used by criminals were stolen.

The article never mentions anything about Mr. Horn being a concealed carry holder, and the two that were killed were criminals! This isn't a case of somebody having a bad day and deciding to blow away his neighbors who're having guests over, this is a homeowner taking a stance against criminal individuals.\n \n Second, as so many have said before, there was a policeman only seconds away who saw the entire thing, and the officer obviously decided that Mr. Horn wasn't worth arresting, so to the officer he did nothing wrong or else he would've had him arrested. The officer didn't even call in for backup to deal with Mr. Horn, so obviously he didn't do anything against the law.\n \n Third, if you knew anything about Texas law then you'd know that even before the Castle Doctrine came into play, they were very big on protecting the right of the people to use deadly force if they believed there was just cause and a reasonable threat to either them, somebody else, or property. \n \n Fourth, a grand jury is made up of at least 12 people, and the last time I checked they had to have a unanimous decision in order to take any action, so obviously 12 people were reasonably convinced that Mr. Horn wasn't in the wrong and shouldn't face charges.\n \n So once again, Mr. Horn isn't guilty of breaking any laws. So if you have a problem with it, change Texas law to make his actions a criminal offense so he can be prosecuted. Until then, kindly shut up and argue in a coherent manner.\n \n Now do you wanna keep dragging this through the mud in an attempt to confuse me, or do you wanna get back to the point of the opening post regarding how you anti-gunners are full of hypocrisy when it comes to the laws?",

   "So buying 70 guns in one go isn't suspicious in your opinion?\n\n \n Well of course it's suspicious. That's how the ATF finds gun traffickers, by tracking them through multiple sales records. But if you limit people to buying only one gun a month then you're shielding criminals from capture. So that basically means anybody in favor of gun rationing is supporting the protection of criminals and shielding them from arrest and imprisonment.\n \n \nThe paper work shows the wepons being delivered to the retailer, no record of the weapon being sold and yet the wepon is no longer in the inventory, How lax is the gun retail security in the US where people can walk out with that sort of firepower?\n\n \n And were they sold illegally, or were they stolen? What exactly happened to the supply that went missing?\n \n \nThe gun problem that plagues the US stems from the legal gun market feeding directly into the illegal market with few if any checks widespead flauting of regulations, lax security, weak enforcement and the involvement of organised crime.\n\n \n There's enough enforcement, security and regulations to keep these problems under control. The real problem is with a weak justice system that seems to follow the mentality of \"criminals are fragile and need to be treated delicately\". If gun traffickers and armed criminals were just put away in federal prisons for years at a time like the laws dictate, there'd be far less people responsible for arming criminals.\n \n \nI was adressing Jo Bennet, not you though you confirm the points that the Gun trade in the US is a weak system riddled with corruption making the measures that criminals go through to obtain guns elsewhere in the world unnecessary. This results in the apalling rate of murders using firearms we see today.\n\n \n More like the laws on the books at the local levels are what's leading to the high death rates. In places like New York and Illinois and California the only ones who don't have guns are the law-abiding, making them particularly vulnerable to death by armed criminal. The systems are so overly restricted that the only ones who can get guns in the socialist and fascist states are the ones who do it illegally, and they're the ones that're most inclined to use them against other people. These local governments have set up a black hole that draws violence to them, so they have nobody to blame but themselves for when they become murder capitals.\n \n Think about it, there's got to be a reason that Washington DC was known as the murder capital of the United States, but all the neighboring states were comparatively safer and had far less crime and death happening when they had far less firearms restrictions.",

(Thats their actual acronym)\n\n \n http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/faq/faq2.htm\n \n (F5) As a licensed dealer, must I advise ATF if I sell more than one handgun to an individual?\n \n If you sell or dispose of more than one handgun to any non-licensee during a period of 5 consecutive business days, the sale must be reported on ATF Form 3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers, not later than the close of the business day on which you sold or disposed of the second handgun. The licensee must forward a copy of the Form 3310.4 to the ATF office specified thereon, and another copy must be forwarded to the State police or local law enforcement agency where the sale occurred. A copy of the Form 3310.4 also must be attached to the firearms transaction record, ATF Form 4473, documenting the sale or disposition of the second handgun.\n \n A business day for purposes of reporting multiple sales of pistols or revolvers is a day that a licensee conducts business pursuant to the license, regardless of whether State offices are open. The application of the term \"business day\" is, therefore, distinguishable from the term \"business day\" as used in the NICS context. Example: A licensee conducts business only on Saturdays and Sundays, days on which State offices are not open. The licensee sells a pistol to an unlicensed person on a Saturday. If that same unlicensed person acquires another handgun the next day (Sunday), the following Saturday or Sunday, or the Saturday after the reporting requirement would be triggered, the subsequent acquisition of a handgun would have to be reported on a Form 3310.4 by the close of the day upon which the second or subsequent handgun was sold.\n \n [18 U.S.C. 923(g)(3), 27 CFR 478.126a]",
