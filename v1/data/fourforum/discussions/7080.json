She missed it and it hit her in the chest. Because of the zero tolerance policy he was suspended for ASSAULT ON A TEACHER. I can go on and on about Kindergarteners aiming chicken wings like guns getting suspended to swiss army knives in pickup trucks in the parking lot. That's how I can say no to zero tolerance.",
