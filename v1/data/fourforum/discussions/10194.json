Sounds too maliscious.\n \n As for the 2nd video, it's untold what the protestors could have done out of HOME VIDEO camera footage LOS to possibly provoke the police. Even tossing bottles or rocks. Masked men...simply deserve to be dispersed. How'd you feel about the KKK in full garb with a masked hood singing Christianish hymns and a throwing a bottle that struck a black cop?\n IMO, singing a pathetic and hypocritical \"Give Peace A Chance\" song of their momma's generation does not make them peacefully demonstrating. All the home video did initially was focus on the small knot of people, not the others on the periphery.\n I loved the '#### the Police' comment too.\n \n Simply matter is, 1st video and 2nd video circumstances and presentations are quite a bit different.\n 1st video, organized and mature crowd of professionals being attacked by thuggish cops.\n 2nd video, illigitimate offspring of a homeless leper rioting and simply being dispersed after provoking police. Call it, 'Self fulfilling prophesy'.",

   "Tens of dead and more than 2000 wounded badly, shady characters in yellow-green shapeless garments beating citizens in the streets half to death. This is result of Yankees interfering into Georgian domestic policy. They made our president that loony puppet Saakashvili. They supplied scoundrels killing honest Georgians with most modern horrible chemical weapons. Don't speak, don't think, don't breath without master's order. Otherwise you'll be punished cruelly like those people on Rustaveli Square. All disagreeable mass media agencies are closed. And majority of agencies are disagreeable. So we're in informational blockade here. That is democracy Americanly. I say in all countries Yankees interested in (like Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Baltic states) will be the same sooner or later. For US don't bring democracy. They kill it and dance on its grave. And our patience is exhausted. We won't tolerate any American henchmen anymore.\n Down with mad dictator Saakashvili!",
