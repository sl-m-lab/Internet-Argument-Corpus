   "Hi everyone. I have been wondering whether or not there are \"guardian angels\" out there for quite sometime. I would like your opinions, more from theists, but atheists welcome. \n \n I ask this because I have been involved in quite a few near misses when driving the car (many of these were honestly not my fault). That said, some were my fault - I almost gave Mum a heart attack or two in a few instances [when I was learning to drive]. In all rights, I should probably be dead right now. I've often thought about what saved me half those times, only to come up with no answer. My skill (reflexes), luck, or something else? I really don't know what to believe. I am just glad that I am alive today. Skill makes me sound a better driver though...\n \n So here's the qestion, guardian angels, are they real or a myth made up to comfort people? Thanking you in advance for any replies at all.\n \n Btw, Montalban, are you aware of anywhere in the Bible where it talks about some form of guardian angels? I am not, but than again, I haven't read the whole Bible.",

   "In the world of Christiandom, there are many and varied fantastic creatures. As for angels, it is commonly believed that they belong to a hierarchical order. Notably, Michael belongs in the archangel category. Gabriel is another of the elite archangels, revered by both Christians and Muslims. Incubi and Succubi are considered by many to be another class of angels, those of ill-repute, sexually preying on both men and women while they sleep. There was a belief that Incubi were attracted to female hair and is the reason for the custom of women wearing hats in church. In between these extremes are a host of other angels--Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers and Principalities--as the belief goes, assisting God in various duties, crying over wayward souls and the like. This is where the guardian angel idea grew from, and as already explained, has no biblical foundation.\n \n I suppose it is quite natural for a person who has accepted the belief in an unseen god to further populate his or her imagination with more unearthly creatures. It seems like a small step to do so. After all, Christians for the most part believe also in a devil, and his minions, the demons, which are said to be quite numerous. In an account in Mark 5, for instance, it is said 2000 of them entered into the bodies of pigs at the command of Jesus and dove off a cliff. This is but one example. There are many accounts in the N.T. of possessed persons, presumably by some unseen evil spirit. Gargoyles were as real as you and me to many a Middle Ages Christian. \n \n It is a common Christian belief, IMO, that forces of good are arrayed against forces of bad, and that these forces represent real extra-terrestrial beings, lined up in epic battle formations and fighting an ongoing 24/7 crusade for human being's souls.\n \n For my part, when I gave up my belief in the Christian God, the other characters melted away also. It was an exhilarating experience, and the sense of freedom and peace of mind stays with me to this day. I would recommend it to all readers.",

   "Thanks JordanF for your response, IMO it hit the jackpot!\n \n To joebrummer:\n The idea of god having a plan for anyone is contradictive to the idea of free will. Either it is all in what he has planned or it is what he gave you the right to choose. And to go slightly off topic but not really, if gaof had a plan for everyone and only what is in the plan is what happens then it must be in his plan that I am gay.\n \n God is not afraid to interfere with people's free will, unlike what the movie \"Bruce Almighty\" suggests. God has demonstrated this many times, take for example when He hardened the heart of Pharoah in Egypt (many times) in order for him to let God's people go after the last deadly plague. Another example of God interfering with people's free will is Sodom and Gomorrah, two towns who gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. If this idea of absolute free will (where God cannot interfere with people's choices) were true, than God would not have destroyed these towns. The fact that they were destroyed by God strongly implies that He is not afraid and can interfere with people's free will and the choices that they make. He has, however, given us the choice to follow Him or not. That is up to us. I believe that everything that happens, happens for a reason according to the will of God in one way or another. The Holy Spirit also changes people's hearts and how much they are willing to listen to the Good News of the Gospels.\n \n God has a plan for everyone's life, it is whether or not we wish to follow that path as to whether or not we will end up doing what He wants us to do. See, I could just not want to get a job and thus I would become a bum - is this God's will for my life? He might have wanted me to become a scientist, or an (God forbid) artist, etc. But because I didn't do the study at school and didn't have the will to do work, I would end up a bum. \n Btw, the above is a hypothetical situation to illustrate how the choices we make can steer us away from the original plans that God has for us; in Jeremiah 29:11 it says:\n \"For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\"\n \n This alone tells us that God has plans for your life. Many times, people turn their back on God and these original plans of God's never actually happen because the person is not doing what God wishes.\n \n Hello billsco:\n I suppose it is quite natural for a person who has accepted the belief in an unseen god to further populate his or her imagination with more unearthly creatures. \n \n But angels (and demons) are mentioned in the Bible. I didn't really know what to believe about guardian angels - whether or not they were real or not - but I never questioned whether or not angels actually existed. IMHO JordanF hit it spot on, God's will. Whether or not He assigns angels to carry out His will, or whether or not He does it Himself is a point open to argument.\n \n As JordanF pointed out, angels have been sent by God to protect various people, e.g. Peter's miraculous escape from prison (Acts 12). Perhaps these angels were just given the name \"guardian angels\" as they were assigned by God to watch out for a particular person for a set task.\n \n There was a belief that Incubi were attracted to female hair and is the reason for the custom of women wearing hats in church.  \n \n Meh? I've never heard of \"Incubi\" or this belief. No one that I know of now a days does such a thing or believes such a thing now a days. Besides, Jesus never mentioned no such thing, neither was it mentioned by Peter, Paul, and those who followed in any of the messages to the Churches of their day.\n \n It is a common Christian belief, IMO, that forces of good are arrayed against forces of bad, and that these forces represent real extra-terrestrial beings, lined up in epic battle formations and fighting an ongoing 24/7 crusade for human being's souls. \n \n I, for one, do not believe such things. They could happen, they most likely don't. People's prays can (and do) change the persons heart (or soul). Jesus had many encounters with demons, but there were no battle formations or fighting in them. He rebuked them in the name of the God and they fled (into pigs one time as you brought up). This example alone is proof enough that there is no epic battle formations, and that fighting an ongoing 24/7 crusade does not happen.\n \n Hi montalban:\n did you choose to be gay, or were you born gay? \n \n There are other outside factors that influence which way you \"swing\" that may be outside the child's control. One such example is whether or not you have two good loving parents (a man and a woman) who a medium amount of time with you, although one parent does usually bring up hetrosexual children (the child may have another father or mother figure in his/her life in this case which could cause the child to turn out straight). Whether or not the child was accepted by other children of his/her own sex in the early years of child development. Of course, these only cover a few things that may cause the child to turn homosexual.",

You are jumping to conclusions that would probably classify as a new world record if there were such an event today. I was just explaining some of the ideas that say certain factors like those listed above (which you criticise) MAY cause a child to be attracted to his/her own sex. I was in no way proclaiming it was true (if you thought I was, you have a more vivid imagination than I gave you credit), although some it may well be.\n \n Futher more I got these two ideas from a book that my family has got at home titled \"Every Young Man's Battle\" by Stephen Arterburn and Fred Stoeker. I only quoted the smallest part that was physically able to be quoted. They start at the beginning when the foundation is laid:\n \"From the time you were born, your development unfolded in relationship to your Mum and Dad. Even if one of them wasn't there, that fact was part of your developmental process. When childhood development occurs in a healthy home, where a young boy feels balanced love flowing from a father and a mother, the foundation is laid for heterosexuality. If your father was there for you and acted as role model while expressing his love for you, then that gave you a sense of security in your manhood and total identity. As far as maleness goes, the, you feel complete.\n \n The area in which you felt imcompleteness would be in femaleness. In a mode of experiencing completeness, you would be attracted to the thing you didn't have, the thing that would complete you - and that would be someone of the opposite sex. This is an oversimplification, of course, but an accurate explanation of male attraction to females. \n \n If you were raised by an emotionally distant father, or a male who was cruel, abusive, or absent, you might have developed a different sense of who you are. You may not have experienced a secure sense of identity and manhood. If no other man in your life was able to provide that, such as an uncle, or a grandfather or a coach, then you were left with a sense of incompleteness that you probably didn't even know was there. The result was for you to be attracted to what would provide that sense of completeness, and that was another male. \n \n The reactions of other boys may have complicated this sense of \"lacking\" for you. For example, if you weren't into competitive sports and perferred art and drama, you may have felt as though you were an outcast. Boys your age may not have connected with you, and in fact they may have rejected you in order to secure their own sense of manhood. Some boys like to play with dolls rather than army men. If that was you, it was a setup for experiencing rejection by other boys and later by men. So it was only natural that you would long for what you didn't have, which is a feeling of maleness and a connection to other men. If someone who was experienced in homosexual behavior came along and seduced you, then you probably felt at least some of the acceptance and connection that you'd been longing for.\n \n Attraction to men can also be intesified by a repulsion to women. If you havd a mother or other female caretaker who was unhealthy and either smothered you out of her own selfishness or was cruel to you out of her own depravity, it would interrupt the development of an attraction to women. The last thing you would want to have would be a relationship with anyone who was anything like the woman you despised. Your comfort level with women would be minimal. That foundation made you an easy target if you were apporached by another man.\"\n \n These are just ideas of how homosexual behaviour can happen in a very simplified situation. There are, of course, probably other reasons. These ideas would most likely ring true for some homosexuals. And by the way, zachvac, where do you propose I get such evidence? I very much doubt that many homosexuals themselves know why they are gay, let alone tell anybody else! As I have said, these are ideas that I read from a book and I can see (you too should be able to see) how they can cause people to turn homosexual.\n \n To joebrummer:\n I am sorry but the atheist in me sees nothing but contradictions and supostituions. God says this but does that and if we do this in this way appeasing him like this it is his will...... \n \n There is no contradictions there, perhaps it was not as clear as I could make it. The whole reply was in reference to your post number 4... God gives us the free will to chose whether or not to follow him, but He is not afraid to interfere with people's free will as demonstrated by Sodom and Gomorrah. They chose freely to give themselves up to sexual immorality and God did not tolerate it and used those two towns as an example of what will happen to others who chose to follow the same path (see Jude).\n \n The part about the Holy Spirit was to say that it is Him who convinces people about God's existence through our words and so on.\n \n In other words, you are living his plan if the church tells you so...... \n \n No not exactly. I try and live my life according to what the Bible says (fail mostly), I don't care what the Church says most of the time. When they talk about evolution being compatible with the Bible, and having homosexual ministers I ignore it all as I know that it goes against the authority of God and what He says in His Word the Bible.",

When childhood development occurs in a healthy home, where a young boy feels balanced love flowing from a father and a mother, the foundation is laid for heterosexuality.\n \n\n And I happen to totally disagree with this totally unsupported statement made by the author. There has been much research to show that having one parent or not has nothing to do with homosexuality. And I totally disagree with the fact that if a young boy feels balanced love flowing from a father and a mother a foundation is laid for heterosexuality. There is no evidence and this should be treated as opinion, which I disagree with.\n \n \n \n \n\n If your father was there for you and acted as role model while expressing his love for you, then that gave you a sense of security in your manhood and total identity.

In a mode of experiencing completeness, you would be attracted to the thing you didn't have, the thing that would complete you - and that would be someone of the opposite sex. This is an oversimplification, of course, but an accurate explanation of male attraction to females. \n \n\n This is a theory I disagree with. You aren't attracted like magnets. North and South. You are attracted because of a drive to reproduce.\n \n \n \n \n\n If you were raised by an emotionally distant father, or a male who was cruel, abusive, or absent, you might have developed a different sense of who you are.

There are 2 boys on the football team who are gay and are very popular and most kids are very tolerant towards them.\n \n \n \n \n\n Attraction to men can also be intesified by a repulsion to women.

If you and your mom were white and she mistreated you would you hate all white women?

As I have said, these are ideas that I read from a book and I can see (you too should be able to see) how they can cause people to turn homosexual.\n \n\n OK I can see how these are theories. I, who have had different experiences than you, disagree where you may agree. Either way I do think we should be tolerant to all people and just because there are \"circumstances\" (even if there are) why should they be denied the right to marriage? Even if it is a choice, shouldn't they have the right to marry? They're going to live together anyway, why not give them the advantages other lovers have?",

   "Hi everyone. I have been wondering whether or not there are \"guardian angels\" out there for quite sometime. I would like your opinions, more from theists, but atheists welcome. \n \n I ask this because I have been involved in quite a few near misses when driving the car (many of these were honestly not my fault). That said, some were my fault - I almost gave Mum a heart attack or two in a few instances [when I was learning to drive]. In all rights, I should probably be dead right now. I've often thought about what saved me half those times, only to come up with no answer. My skill (reflexes), luck, or something else? I really don't know what to believe. I am just glad that I am alive today. Skill makes me sound a better driver though...\n \n So here's the qestion, guardian angels, are they real or a myth made up to comfort people? Thanking you in advance for any replies at all.\n \n Btw, Montalban, are you aware of anywhere in the Bible where it talks about some form of guardian angels? I am not, but than again, I haven't read the whole Bible.\n\n \n I find it curiously amusing that people would chose to believe that god sends magical beings at the moment of crisis to save them. Is it possible that you are alive due to brakes, perhaps your steering wheel, maybe even the other poor sap that you almost smushed on the road? Near misses are just that, near misses. I have had several in my life...actually probably several in the last year. With the majority of the public driving like retards, it's a wonder I have not had a serious accident yet. What you should really be asking yourself, instead of what saved you, is what were you doing at the time of the incident that got you in the situation in the first place. Probably not paying attention.",

   "I have read countless testimonials in many credible books, and watched tv documentaries in the last twenty years , that were given by people that feel they were helped by a GA. These people had nothing to gain by going public with this type of publicity, and if anything, put themselves at great risk of public ridicule or even worse, institutionalization, by making such unbelievable statements. I believe the GA experience falls in to the same category as those , that by praying ferverent and heartfelt prayer, have received a divine blessing.... \n \n Case in point, just three weeks ago a teen girl went to a party one night, not telling anyone where she was going. She never came back home that night, or the next, or the next... The search and rescue teams went on for days , utilizing all the high tech gear and manpower, canine power available to them. They finally gave up, not really knowing the girls route she took in her car when she left that night to the party. ..\n \n The mother of a daughter , that was a good friend to the missing girl, held a prayer vigil at her church often, praying for guidance to help find her daughters friend , that was missing now for 6 days. In a dream that night, the mother seen in herself going down a road, then came upon a bridge, and felt herself being drawn to look down a ravine beside it. All of a sudden the mother awoke from the dream, and returned to sleep. ... \n \n The following morning, the mother felt prompted to get her daughter and get in the car, and go look for her daughters friend. As the mother was driving down a road , the same one S&R teams had went down many times before and searched all ready, but she had not been on, suddenly she came upon a bridge, slowed down when see recognized the bridge as the one in her dream. She pulled over and recalled seeing the bridge's ravine in her dream, so she grabbed her daughter's hand, and they went close to 600 feet down in to the deep brush searching... .\n \n \n \n Then, suddenly she seen underneath the thick foilage, a overturned car, that had her daughters friend in it. She had been trapped in it for 7 days now, yet still barely alive. Now there are those that will say this episode was \"luck\" , good fortune, etc. That is ones perogative for sure. But I choose to believe that when God is called upon, by one, or many, with pure hearts, along with good will and good intentions , HE may choose to send help by visions, dreams , or possibly even a GA, to help out....\n \n \n Anyone that has lived over 40 years , :) , can most likely testify to the fact , that at some time or another, they have \"listened\" to their gut instinct. It may have been \"something\" telling them to slow down on a good road with a blind curve in it , just to find out if they had not, they would have hit the stalled car just around the blind curve. For instance, have you ever spent weeks/months , tormenting yourself trying to make the right decison about a career change, rationalized it out on paper just how great of a job it would be, but your sixth sense \"gut\" feeling , you just could not get it settled in your mind ?? And then later, after not taking the job, you see it would have turned out disastrous for you IF you had taken the job ?? ...\n \n Some call those incidents good fortune , luck, intuition, so on. I choose to think that it is the quiet voice of our creator , taking HIS hand and nudging us humans around down here to guide us, safely, to where He wants us to land on HIS blueprint. Then, after that persons last breathe is taken on this earth , they wont have to go the long road around to get to where they were supposed to be going anyway. Yep, a farfetched way of thinking it is, because this theory doesnt explain all the misfortunes that happen to people, yet then again, whoever said life was fair anyway ? all jmo",

I would be curious to see where you got this story from in the first place, do you have a link to this? I lost my wallet a few years ago...how long do I have to wait for a GA to tell me where that is? Hmmm...if a human life is 7 days...a wallet must be...? It seems to me, life is a 50/50 game. Sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't. Funny how it does not work the other way. Nobody blames god or the GA's for the accident, but they thank them for the ones that they avoid. Following your set of logic, if you do have an accident, your GA must have been sleeping or not paying attention.",

As much as we try, we can't, and that's mainly because He allows us to make our own choices. He also allows the world to turn as it will. He allows storms and earthquakes, tornados and floods. He said, we are in this world but not of this world - if we accept Him.\n \n BUT - when we pray and seek His will we have to place ourselves in postion to know His will, then act on it. So many people not only begin to hate God, but begin to hate those that love Him because somewhere in their life they asked and did not receive. I'm not saying that God is going to stop that 18 wheeler headed for you, or that He will grab your wheel, but that He can. Does he always? No. And that's been what has gotten stuck in the craw of many people. I don't pretend to know all of His ways and why things happen - why babies are killed through various ways each year, why children are raped and tortured and such. But, I don't blame God for all the bad things in the world, either.\n \n I wish had all the answers, but I don't. I just know that God works with us and for us sometimes and we never give Him a second thought.\n \n It would take pages and pages, snakespit, and many scriptures and an explanation of those scriptures to even get to where it made sense about the will of God and how it's applied. And, who, on this board or anywhere can explain scripture enough to satisfy you, or me, or anyone else?\n \n It does help, though, if you take a little here and a little there and then put it to the test. That's the best, if not the only way to begin to understand it without the help of the Holy Spirit.",
