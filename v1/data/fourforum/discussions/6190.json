   "I'd like to list two different opinions of a situation that happened recently regarding the amount of trash that people produce.\n \n After reading the two editorials I'd like for people to address a few questions.\n \n 1) Do we have the right to produce as much trash as we like?\n 2) Should we expect the city goverments to pick up every ounce of trash we produce?\n 3) Even if the government is not involved (as in private trash pickup) should you still be able to make as much trash as you want as long as you are willing to pay for pickup?\n \n Here are the two editorials from local papers (one of which I agree with).\n \n\n What's Wrong With America\n \n We'll take the trash talk of Chace Anderson any day.\n \n As regards the ridiculous public disagreement between him and Billy Lynch, as ably aired in the City Paper, over the so-called \"Nashville Two-Stomp,\" Anderson is clearly on the side of right.\n \n In essence, a bunch of spoiled Nashville consumers-about 8,000 of them-who can't fit a week's worth of trash into their 96-gallon containers (!) are complaining and asking for more of the giant, tan-colored bins. Solid Waste director Anderson responded to this astonishing insight into just how much XXXX people generate, then throw away, by advising that these residents stomp on their trash and-shocking, we know-perhaps even consume less and recycle more.\n \n Seems logical to us.\n \n Public Works director Billy Lynch, however, has said he \"totally disagrees with that secondary step\" and is in the process of appeasing some residents who say they need 192 gallons worth of containers to dispense with their weekly household waste. \"Public Works is holding me hostage to my trash,\" one particularly obnoxious resident complained recently.\n \n Welcome to the land of rampant consumerism.\n \n Frankly, around the Scene's offices here in Melrose (where we print paper on both sides and live with mounds of recycling until someone has the time to load it into a late-model clunker and drop it off somewhere), it's hard for us to muster a whole lot of sympathy for these oppressed Nashvillians, who are apparently running out of room to dispose of the heavy packaging that their Sam's Club goods come in. When folks a tin can's throw from Belle Meade complain in the local press that it's their God-given right to make as much trash as they want and expect the government to clean it up, no questions asked-well, that's a little hard for us to digest.\n \n In fact, it's precisely this culture of waste-and worse, the sense of entitlement to an unthinkingly disposable lifestyle-that is What's Wrong With America. Buy XXXX. Throw it out. Dump it in some landfill in a black neighborhood. And dammit, if I want a second or third 96-gallon trash can, you better have it on my doorstep post-haste, 'cause I got stuff to waste.\n \n It's pretty amazing to watch people act like Solid Waste Director Chace Anderson had insulted their mothers by suggesting that-gasp-they should compact their trash so it takes up less space. Sure, his idea is a little on the hokey side (we would have preferred the \"Music City XXXX-Hop\"), but his heart was in the right place: minimizing solid waste. Old Metro hand Billy Lynch should have backed him up.\n \n Unglamorous though it may be, solid waste is an important issue. And given that we pay by the ton to get rid of our waste ($27), maybe now would be a time for city leaders to tell people to shove it-trash that is-farther in their current can.\n \n -Liz Garrigan and John Spragens\n \n\n \n\n Common sense resolves trash collection woe\n \n Metro Public Works is working itself out of a bad situation and residents of Davidson County are finally the winners.\n \n Trash may seem like a small thing, but when you have too much of it and nowhere to put it, trash becomes a priority.\n \n That's what happened to many residents in Davidson County after Public Works' Solid Waste division instituted its new automated trash pick-up.\n \n Since the new automated trash program began, 8,000 Metro residents have requested a second 96-gallon container. Up until a few days ago, 303 extra containers had been delivered.\n \n Perhaps Metro didn't anticipate the large volume of requests for an extra can.\n \n But instead of saying there aren't enough containers to provide every citizen who wants one with an extra can, Solid Waste came up with the preposterous idea that residents simply weren't managing their trash correctly.\n \n The department actually came up with the idea that residents should do the \"Nashville Two-Stomp\" on their trash bags before putting them in the can, thereby making room for more trash.\n \n Making no provision for the difference between a family of two and a family of six, simply mashing the bags flatter will do the trick.\n \n Let's see if this picture looks pretty: Just stomp to all-get-out on a trash bag full of cantaloupe rinds, chicken bones and coffee grounds.\n \n Solid Waste decided to become the trash police.\n \n \"Residents may find it easier to set a bag of trash on the ground as opposed to stomping down their trash and placing that extra bag in the cart,\" Solid Waste Director Chace Anderson said (we can imagine him wagging his finger at us while doing so). \"If the bags are not in the cart, they will not be picked up.\"\n \n Public Works Director Billy Lynch quickly rectified the situation by taking some of the countless surplus recycling bins and stamping them for trash removal instead. More regular trash containers are on order.\n \n Public relations nightmare averted. It could have been thwarted altogether if Solid Waste had handled the situation correctly.\n\n \n \n I also asked a friend what he thought of this and said that his household pretty much produces 96 gallons (that's 364.8 liters) each week because \"they have a baby.\" Our measely two person household produces 96 gallons of trash per month, along with another 96 gallon container loosely filled with recyclables. This means that his baby is filling up 72 gallons of diapers each and every week. This can't be right. I asked him if he ever considered cloth diapers and he made me laugh when he said he wouldn't use them because it \"wastes\" water to wash them. ( I guess I should start using plastic forks and paper plates to save water, and use disposable clothes too...) Anyway, why do people feel they have the right to produce as much trash as they please?",

   "I've never understood why more people don't use home trash compactors. The convenience factor alone is worth initial price and they're pennies a month to operate. Where I live commercial trash collection is $52/mo for one 96-gallon container and $6 for each additional bag each weekly collection cycle. If you don't call and tell them you have an extra bag, it won't be collected. We compact our trash and once a month or so I take it to a landfill with anything else that can't be burned for $8/P/U load. It's not that I'm environmentally concerned, I'm basically cheap.\n \n If people are too lazy to compact their trash even by hand (foot), I say charge whatever it takes to pay for collection, landfill and profit.",

   "Well, I can't find fault in any of that, at least not without being hypocritical.\n \n I think most of what we throw away is containers for food.\n \n It's really difficult for the consumer to escape excessive food packaging, so it's hard to fault the individual consumer.\n \n I think it's also sad to see our kind of food packaging catching on in places like China and India.\n \n We need to re-think how food is produced and distributed in the US and come up with something a little more environmentally friendly.\n \n This is my take on the whole thing anyway.",

   "I can't argue with your reasoning, but consumer convenience has always been the driving force behind most successful consumable products. Their packaging is often the key to that success. \n \n The only quick solution is to put the burden on manufacturers, quickly bringing cries of government interference from deep-pocketed lobbyists. Smithsonian Magazine ran an article on world problems with disposal of enormous amount of obsolete consumer products containing circuit boards; PCs/cell phones, etc. As legislation against landfill disposal of these items increases (land cost) in developed countries, ready markets for recovery of valuable natural resource components are developing in other nations. Picture Chinese villagers using their bare hands to recover circuit board precious metals via deadly chemical separators as is now a common recovery method.\n \n Natural resource shortages will eventually force manufacturers to seek recycled materials on a large scale and that's the point where trash will become valuable. At this point recycling provides minimal revenue to trash disposal companies because raw natural resources are still available at acceptable prices. If the market for used plastic/glass/paper intended for recycling is low, they go right into the landfill. Society as a whole will reach a point of recycling necessity, when is the only question.",

   "I hope that point won't come too late.\n \n Also, it does seem to suck that we have to rely on a dearth of natural resources before we start conserving.\n \n It's like a teenager with money. \n They don't start saving it until it's almost gone (if that).\n \n Again, I don't think we can fault the individual for this situation ...\n \n BUT, I do think that individuals CAN take measures to limit (was going to say curb, but I hate puns) their waste, but don't.\n \n They have the mentality that they have the right to make as much trash as they please. \n \n I think if they had to bury it in their own backyards, they would start to buy products with less packaging which would force producers to scale back on the packaging, which would save money too. \n \n So maybe we could actually start to conserve before we run low on landfill space, but only if the average consumer cares enough to buy and demand the right kind of product with the right kind of packaging.",

   "http://www.wjxx.com/news/strange/news-article.aspx?storyid=42802\n \n\n Chicago Tour Showcases Garbage\n \n By ANNA JOHNSON\n Associated Press Writer\n \n CHICAGO (AP) -- Smelly sludge sewage fields and landfills aren't the usual stuff of tours in a city that likes to show off its architecture and lakefront parks.\n \n But people are paying $7 to see some of Chicago's less desirable spots on a \"Down in the Dumps\" tour of more than a dozen garbage sites including a waste water treatment plant, recycling center and landfills.\n \n The nearly three-hour bus tour of the far South Side - where landfills rise up like rolling hills - is a chance for residents, environmentalists and visitors to learn more about what happens to garbage once it leaves their trash cans.\n \n \"We see it, we smell and we wanted to know what all this is,\" said Bill Serckie, who took the tour on a recent weekend with his wife, Patty.\n \n The couple has lived for 18 years near the garbage-filled landfills that dot the area along Interstate 94 near the Illinois-Indiana border, but like many of the 30 other tour-goers had never driven down the potholed back roads to see them up close.\n \n \"The tour makes you want to be more involved in the community and know what's going on,\" Serckie said.\n \n The tour, conducted twice this summer, will be offered again in the fall. It's organized by the Southeast Environmental Task Force, a conservation group that wants to preserve open space and make sure more landfills don't sprout up.\n \n The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency says the area already has more than a dozen landfills and hazardous waste sites.\n \n \"It's an area that was once a beautiful wetland and all that was trashed beginning in the 1940s and 1950s when it became a natural dump site,\" said Stan Komperda, an IEPA project manager.\n \n Most of the landfills on the tour no longer accept garbage because of a city moratorium that went into effect in 1984, said the group's president and tour guide Tom Shepherd.\n \n Two of the dormant landfills are among the highlights of the tour. One is a grazing area for 64 goats and the other has been turned into a golf course.\n \n The goats are helping to turn the methane-producing, 170-foot landfill into a wildlife habitat, the IEPA's Komperda told visitors on the tour.\n \n \"We decided to give the goats a shot last year and they have been spectacular,\" he said. \"The goats ignore prairie plants but eat the weeds, which lets the light in and helps the prairie plants.\"\n \n Shepherd joked about how the landfills are often given tranquil monikers, including being named after lakes and prairies.\n \n \"These landfills are given these nice names to give you the image that if you've never seen one before you might think it's a nice place,\" Shepherd said.\n \n Mild weather helped keep the smells to a minimum on the tour, but the odor coming from a water treatment plant drew a collective \"Ehttp://wwwww\" from the tour-goers.\n \n \"You can usually smell it through the whole region but you don't usually get to see it,\" Shepherd said.\n \n The plant, operated by Chicago's Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, treats water for the city and 124 nearby communities.\n \n Because of security measures put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, tour-goers had to be content with a drive around the parking lot because they couldn't go inside the plant.\n \n So far about 130 people have taken the tour, which is advertised on the group's Web site and through other environmental groups in the state. Brian Rich of Chicago brought his 5-year-old son, Elliot, on the tour so he could start learning about environmental issues.\n \n \"We recycle at home and I care about the environment,\" Rich said. \"But unfortunately, I think a lot of people are complacent about environmental issues.\"\n \n Created: 8/22/2005 9:21:29 AM\n Updated: 8/22/2005 9:23:07 AM\n \u00a9 2004-2005 Associated Press.
