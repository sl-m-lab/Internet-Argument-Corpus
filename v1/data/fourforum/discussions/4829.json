   "Judge rules against Calif. gay marriage ban\n Fri Apr 15, 2005 11:39 PM ET \n \n \n By Adam Tanner\n SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Calling marriage a \"fundamental human right\", a San Francisco judge has confirmed a preliminary decision that found California's ban on same-sex wedlock was unconstitutional, officials said on Friday.\n \n \"The state's position that California has granted marriage-like rights to same-sex couples points to the conclusion that there is no rational state interest in denying them the rites of marriage as well,\" San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard Kramer wrote in his final decision.\n \n \"The idea that marriage-like rights without marriage is adequate smacks of a concept long rejected by the courts: separate but equal,\"\n \n The judge then cited the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education civil rights decision against segregation of races.\n \n Kramer's ruling is a victory for backers of gay marriage, but is seen by both sides as just the first stage of a legal battle that could drag on for years. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who opposes gay marriage, expects the dispute to end up in the California Supreme Court.\n \n The ruling applies to six related cases that arose after San Francisco granted more than 4,000 marriage licenses to gay couples over a month-long period last year. The California Supreme Court said San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom did not have the authority to issue such licenses but did not rule on whether the state ban on gay marriage was constitutional.\n \n California voters approved a measure in 2000 defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman.\n \n Kramer issued a preliminary ruling on gay marriage a month ago. His final decision was dated April 13 but was received by parties to the lawsuit on Friday.\n \n News of the decision comes a day after Oregon's Supreme Court invalidated 3,000 marriage licenses that had been issued to same-sex couples a year ago, saying they were unconstitutional.\n \n Kramer's ruling does not immediately open the way to new gay marriages in California as the issue is under appeal. Nearly a year ago, Massachusetts became only U.S. state to allow same-sex marriage.\n \n http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&storyID=709012",

   "jyoshu,\n \n I re-post my original post in the gay Rights forum so you know exactly where I stand.\n \n \"Being Gay? Does anyone here actually think that Gay People just started increasing in numbers recently because the door was opened for them? Does anyone actually believe the percentage of the population that is gay is any different from any other time? Homophobia is a \"normal\" dysfunction (if there is such a thing), and it is understandable to a certain extent. I must say the reasoning of some of those who oppose any form of Gayness period, seems a bit extreme.\n \n Specifically, this Mr. Voice of Reason, he appears to be the loudest, and most vulgar opponet of equal rights for all. His reference to \"Anal Intercourse\" is a example of \"My Morality is SUPERIOR to yours\". I ask this question; if \"some\" people find homosexual sex as disgusting as beastiality, will we have to legislate sodomy laws for Hetrosexual Anal Sex? Perhaps we should outlaw masturbation because it is a form of birth control?\n \n I am not Gay personally . . . I have two nephews who are, and I am honest enough to admit I am still a bit uncomfortable with the affection displayed by 2-men. I am learning to deal with my personality flaw. Since the Amendment Process of changing our Constitution is very challenging, it would appear that no National Amendment would ever have a chance of passing. The door was opened for equal rights for homosexuals long ago, and it is not ever going to close. My suggestion for the people having a difficult time dealing with it, you better get use to it, for it will never go away. Besides, Gay people are People too, perhaps we should remember that. People with good hearts, that are great role models, and can contribute more than someone who sprnds their entire being trying to discriminate against them.\"",

Phylis Schlafley (sp?). Anne Coulter (I can't imagine she doesn't indulge). Clearly, as women, none of these women (can't say \"ladies\") have ever engaged in a gay-male daisy chain of any sort. Nor have they gone to a gay-male bathhouse. Yet all three go on and on, much as VOR did (note the past tense -- I love the ignore feature). \n\n \n I've never read anything by Anita Bryant or Phylis Schlafley, but I do read Ann Coulter's column fairly regularly. I don't recall ever reading anything porographic in it. Speaking of Coulter, she has a good column this month about liberals throwing food (instead of discourse) at Republicans, a la Pat Buchanan and herself. You can read it at http://www.anncoulter.com/\n \n She's also being featured this month in a huge write-up in Time Magazine with her on the frontpage.",

Apparently, they included a photo of \"wild Coulter-hating liberals\" (my words -- haven't seen the caption yet). Turns out they got suckered. The group they included, communistsforkerry.com, is a GOP organization. The Haters and the Haters of Haters seem to be on the same side. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. No one is.",

   "Voice of Reason: Dating an ex-Navy man is hardly revealing the intimate details of my sex life. \n \n My sex life and its intimate details are, unsurprisingly, none of your damn business.\n \n However, who I date and who I fall in love with is a matter of public business.\n \n You may be shocked at the number of gays and lesbians who 'act straight', as they say, and don't conform to the sensational stereotype that the media plays up.\n \n The \"gay lifestyle\" of rampant promiscuity that I keep hearing about from social conservatives is not something that reflects my lifestyle or the lifestyle of most gay people. \n \n Some gays, like some straights, do get into swinging, the bar scene, and so on. \n \n The rest of us though, prefer to have sex within the support and emotional intimacy of a loving relationship.\n \n That's something I don't like about debates on sexuality is that people get hung up on sex acts and ignore the context of those acts.\n \n The actual sex is a minor part of being gay, much like it is only a minor part of being straight. \n \n The important part of all sexualities, the context, is about the relationships that form out of the love between two people.\n \n There are gays who are busy sharing a life with a partner and children in a family unit.\n \n We want those families to be recognized for what they are: families deserving of public recognition by the greater community.\n \n That recognition, in our Western culture, is called \"marriage\".\n \n If you want to destroy marriage, deny that our gay parents can be married.\n \n If you want to preserve the institution of marriage, and promote it, extend it to all parents and partnerships whose love and conviction warrants it.\n \n You do your part and support those gays who agree with and support marriage, and we'll support you in our mutual fight for the family.",

   "No I have never heard that said.........You can sit in front of your computer feel safe, and make stupid comments about the Navy submarine force but you would never make those same comments to a submarine sailor in person........If you did you would be picking up your butt off the ground...\n \n Why do you liberals always attack the U.S. military? so very sad......\n\n \n \n OH, but I have, many times. You were in the Navy right? I mean if you were in the Navy, you know that is a long standing, and often mentioned jab at submariners. Just as Corpsmen are called \"Pecker Checkers\",  Radio Men as \"Sparky\",  Boswain Mates as \"Deck Apes\",  etc, etc, etc. Get off your high horse Mr. Reason, for if you were in the Navy, you would have chuckled and not claimed that I was attacking the Navy's Submariners. I mean, IF  you were in the Navy. Apparently there is some doubt to your claims of service by at least one member of the forum.\n \n My REMF detector is beeping at regular intervals now, are you possibly an REMF. Have I come to the right place? Time will tell.\n \n Finally, I would once again like to ask; when you refuse to address the content of any part of my original post by continuing to shoot off into different directions, this time with a false accusation, is this HOW we are suppose to debate here?",

Then I suggest you do so, because CARING MORE makes you confusing to follow. Some might even say your words were a Freudian Slip. I will once again remind you, that you have yet to address any question or my views as it concerns homosexuality, AND, IF you were in the Navy, you must have heard the submariner joke from your C.C. within the first 3-weeks of Boot. Feigning ignorance and outrage over a common joke is another misdirection. \n \n You may very well have been in the Navy, there has been a large portion of Navy members who have known nothing but the REMF experience, and many of those, led even more sheltered existances----the only Reason (no pun intended) I bring it up, is because I asked you if you were REMF, you didn't answer, so I am asking again.
