   "I would like to make a correction for those of you who are dumb and are obsessed with power. The term superpower defined below means:\n -A powerful , influential nation with a bloc of allies.\n Now, the main meaning of this word is allies. Now, people today braag that we are the only remaining superpower. Not technically. But whatver. People define a superpower with a huge and powerful military. Well, yes. That plays part of the role in the term of superpower. But, that is not all that defines a superpower. It is the number of allies that nation has, and it's influence.\n Many kids today and adults define us as a superpower because we have a dozen states, and we have a huge military. \n I still consider Russia a super power because they have a huge nuclear arsenal, and they are a huge country. Now, they may have lost several of their old soviet republics, but, they should stil bea superpower.\n Write to debate yall\n -John",
