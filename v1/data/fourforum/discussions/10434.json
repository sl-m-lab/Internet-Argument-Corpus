   "http://blacktygrrrr.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/for-liberalism-success-requires-failure/\n \n \n For liberalism, success requires failure\n August 22nd, 2007 at 10:15 am (POLITICS) \n \n \nOne of the many conundrums about liberalism is that it requires failure to be successful.\n \n This goes beyond the War in Iraq, although that can be a starting point. It goes to the core of what liberalism is, that being a philosophy that requires problems and misery to survive.\n \n Starting with the War in Iraq, liberals need the USA to lose in Iraq. I am not going to question the patriotism of American liberals. I am sure many of them truly believe that their solutions are noble. However, their view on Iraq is destructive.\n \n The liberals love to say that this war is President Bush's war. On this point, they are absolutely right. Therefore, if it succeeds, he will get the credit. Therefore, it needs to fail so he gets the blame. The problem with this strategy is that it sacrifices a chance at historical greatness for short term political gain. The democrats won in 2006, but what have they done since?\n \n If the liberals could get beyond their hatred for President Bush, imagine what could happen if the President turns out to be right. A democracy in Iraq...and Afghanistan...the dominoes could fall, and the Middle East in 2020 could be like Eastern Europe in 1989. Is this difficult to imagine? Of course. However, why not dream big dreams? Isn't the point of life to make the world better? The President may turn out to be wrong, but isn't his attempt noble? Shouldn't we try to succeed? Yes, absolutely.\n\n \n =snip=",

A prime example is the idiotic \"Great Society\" enacted by Liberal Democrats in 1964. Back then, the poverty rate was around 12% and declining. Now, 42 years, over $11 trillion, and a swath of destroyed families and communities later, it has proven to be a collosial failure. Oh, and the poverty rate is still 12%.",
