   "this planet and universe is so perfect, so perfectly designed. it is impossible to think that there is no designer.\n\n Well, Mr Jack has already visited \"nature, red in tooth and claw\", so I'll not comment further. But as Mr Jack points out, if you were correct then it wouldn't be necessary to make your assertion. I think that you mistake the appearance of design for design.\n \nsociety which accepts the idea that the origin of the cosmos could be explained in terms of an explosion, reveals more about the society itself than about the universe.\n\n But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?\n \nhumans did not evolve from Blobs, they did not \"evolve\" from fishes, this is not reality, the first humans looked exactly like us today as the human race looked 2000 years ago.\n\n Really?

I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.\n \nour bodies are a wonderous machine, although most of us are not even aware of it!, the functions of our organs in our bodies such as our heart and brain is absolutely astonishing...\n\n I'll bet that biologists, who are probably much more informed about our bodies and organs are even more amazed than you. What is your point?\n \nthe atmosphere and how it protects life on earth from harmful radiation... the flight of birds... the pigments in plants that help create photosynthesis... gravity... etc..., these are just a few samples that if studied deeply make evolution sound rather, well.. unrealistic and explains our society today.\n\n Why don't you explain it to us since you have studied all of this. How do pigments in plants help create photosynthesis? Tell us about gravity. What about bird flight? Rather than just making claims, enlighten us with your great wisdom and knowledge. Please don't come back and tell me that you haven't studied any of this \"deeply.\" That would make you sound foolish.\n \nHow can a big explosion create all this?,\n\n What explosion? I already explained that to call the big bang an explosion is not correct - just easy.\n \nhow can a big cosmic explosion create the human eye for example, with millions of photoreceptors cells inside the eye which send millions of messages to the brain every second which then the brain processes and translates these messages as beautiful colors for us to enjoy.\n\n What does any of that have to do with the big bang?\n \nThe though of evolution from monkies or green blobs from the sea and that they teach evolution in schools as fact is beyond belief.\n\n Perhaps you should have paid closer attention in school. There is no claim that humans evolved from monkies or green blobs. Besides, even if such a claim were made, your inability to believe it is not evidence against it.\n \ncreation is hard for some to admit, but the truth is each of us is carefully designed, our bodies do work that we dont even know!!\n\n Why is work that our bodies do of which we are unaware evidence of design? None of it is natural?\n \nfor example our pupil protects us from to much light entering our eye!\n\n Again, this could not have been an adaptation that came about naturallly?\n \nour bodies are working overtime even while we sleep. this is beyond our comprehension and we must be humble enought to accept it and appreciate this wonderfull gift of life everyday. and this should also give us hope that there is someone out there who created each of us as we are today.

   "Does the \"world wide web\" have order and laws?\n \n and was the \"world wide web\" created?...\nTrying to compare human created systems with life to discredit evolution is a really really bad idea.\n \n Back in August 2003, New Scientist printed an article on this topic. Many creationists claim that \"intelligent design\" rather than evolution is the more believable theory of life. As \"intelligent design\" is proposed as a proper scientific theory, it should be testable be scientific methods. For some reason, creation \"scientists\" have been reluctant to propose and test any hypotheses, claiming that god is untestable or some other gibberish. \n \n So one evolutionist, Niles Eldredge, decided to give them a hand. Intelligent design argues that live looks like it was designed, so must have been. So his hypothesis was that as mad-made objects are known to be made by \"intelligent design\", cladistical analysis of the evolution of a man made object should yield a similar shaped cladogram to that of a group of organisms. \n \n Being a cornet fanatic, he assembled a representative sample of 36 cornets and chose 16 of their innovations and ran phylogenetic analysis of the differences. He then did the same for a variety of trilobite species. \n \n Much to no evolutionist's surprise, the cornet patterns looked nothing like the ones produced with trilobites, nor indeed like any other evolutionary tree that traces the development of living creatures. \n \n The article explains: \n \n 'Here's why. In the living world, there are essentially only two ways a multicelled creature can obtain a characteristic: by evolving it in the current generation or by inheriting from a previous one. But the evolution of cornets - and presumably other cultural artefacts - turns out to be quite different. With cultural evolution comes the capacity to co-opt innovations at a whim. Time after time, when the cornets on one part of an evolutionary tree acquired a useful innovation from their makers, the designers working on instruments from other branches simply copied the idea. Even instruments that were relatively primitive often ended up with the hot new invention. \"Anything that's invented later can be applied retroactively to earlier things,\" says Eldredge. \"It's chaos, basically.\" \n \n For instance, the first cornets bore St\u00f6lzel valves, designed by Berlin instrument-maker Heinrich St\u00f6lzel, which allowed air to pass directly through the valve body on its way around the horn's loops and curves. The St\u00f6lzels worked well enough, but their walls had to be thin and they tended to leak. Also, an interfering side branch of piping meant that the valves were slightly out of line. And for no particular reason, the bell of these horns was on the right. Then in the early 1840s, a sturdier valve appeared called the P\u00e9rinet after its inventor - Parisian instrument-maker Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rinet. P\u00e9rinet valves work differently from St\u00f6lzels. Air passes through horizontal passages in the valve, which connect different parts of the tubing depending on whether the valve is depressed or released. Because of this, designers could experiment with new arrangements. They managed to shift that pesky side-branch and put the valves neatly in line, and for good measure they threw the bell over to the left, which made the instruments easier to hold. \n \n Although these changes made the new P\u00e9rinet instruments desirable, the St\u00f6lzels did not become extinct. St\u00f6lzels were less expensive to make than P\u00e9rinets, and big manufacturers continued to churn them out for their cheaper instruments. But - and here's the key - the St\u00f6lzel cornets now co-opted the P\u00e9rinet arrangements; newly inspired, St\u00f6lzel-makers figured out how to arrange their instruments with bell on the left, valves in a line. With the change in valves, these two sets of cornets should have diverged irrevocably, like two different species of trilobites. But the new arrangement worked so well that it was quickly applied to all models - regardless of their provenance. \n \n That means that cornet evolutionary trees are thoroughly confused. Instead of a neat set of V-shaped branches, with each new species emerging from its predecessor, you tend to get flat lines from which many branches spring (see Diagram). In biological evolution \"you very rarely get a whole bunch of lines all coming from a single source\", says Eldredge. But in the trees that you generate with cornets, lots of different designs seem to sprout from a single node. \"They are loaded with innovations that have been deliberately taken from one branch and applied to another,\" says Eldredge. And this makes it impossible to rank them in any sensible order of ancestors and descendants.' \n \n Diagram: http://archive.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2405/24055801.jpg \n \n And so a bit of creationist \"science\" is finally tested and completely unsurprisingly (due to being a huge pile of drivel) was found wanting. \n \n So what has this to do with the WWW? Well it too is a system that is an evolution of human designs. It too would suffer the same problem of designs being borrowed from one branch into another (eg Microsoft adopting Javascript wholescale rather than it emerging through convergency).\n \n G.",

   "I used the internet just to make the point that behind all design and creation there is intellegence or The faculty of thought and reason.\n \n On evolving, well, under normal circumstances, creatures give birth to the same kind of creatures. One does not expect a lizard to hatch from a chicken egg. Chickens have baby chickens. It is established scientific fact that like begets like. \n \n also, It can be noted that natural selection as a driving mechanism for evolution is totally inadequate. Natural selection (along with mutation) is said to have caused organisms to evolve from one basic kind (animals which can reproduce with one another) into another basic kind. This is prohibited genetically since all of the information for the development of an organism has already been encoded in the DNA of its parent. Variation to organisms must remain within its basic kind. For example, genetically, a wide variety of dogs can come to exist, but a dog can never become anything other than a dog. It remains in its kind. It does not have the genetic ability to become anything more. Admitting this, evolutionists have tried to explain that natural selection happened in conjunction with mutations to the genetic code. This could not produce evolution, however, since mutations do not create new genetic potential, they just alter what is already there. Furthermore, mutations are small, random, and harmful alterations to the genetic code. This also makes evolution from mutations impossible. For example, a working wristwatch does not improve but is harmed when its inside parts are randomly altered. Natural selection also contradicts the second law of thermodynamics which states that, left to themselves, all things tend to deteriorate rather than develop, while evolution wants to go in the opposite direction. \"Survival of the fittest\" demonstrates only how an organism has survived, not how it has evolved.\n \n In light of all of these scientific objections to natural selection, perhaps Darwin would have abandoned his own theory since he asserted, \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organism existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\"\n \n \n believing in a creator is not a thing of the past or for \"unintellectual people\" as some think, there are thousands of scientists today that believe in god or an intellegent being or force. Even most great thinkers in history believed in creation. Ghandi,Johann Sebastian Bach, Sir Isaac Newton was committed Christian and an almost obsessed Biblical scholar. He also rejected the doctrine of the Trinity because the trinity is in fact false, jesus in not god but the son of god, but thats beside the point. Even leonardo da vinci believed in a creator during the last periods of his life. Im sure there are many more, these are just a few.\n \n Here is a quote from Albert Einstein\n \"I'm not much with people, and I'm not a family man. I want my peace. I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomena in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details.\" \n (Clarck, 1971, 18-19)\n \n The point is that Science is against the theory of evolution.\n \n \n Also, the Earth could not be billions of years old. Some of the processes that have been studied that give young ages for the Earth are: \n \n Continental erosion \n Sea floor sediments \n Salinity of the oceans \n Helium in the atmosphere \n Carbon 14 in the atmosphere \n Decay of the Earth's magnetic field \n \n The old ages for the Earth come primarily from the ages of rocks, which are dated by the presumed ages of the fossils in them. Radioactive measurements of rocks are based on assumptions that were chosen to make the radioactive measurements agree with the presumed ages of the fossils. \n \n The eruption of Mount St. Helens produced many feet of stratified rocks which look millions of years old, but were produced in days or hours. Radioactive measurements of these rocks show them to be millions of years old, too. But we know they were formed in 1980 because scientists saw them formed. \n \n The notion that the Earth is billions of years old is not consistent with a considerable amount of scientific observation.",

I don't know of anyone claiming that chickens can have baby lizards.\n \n \nFurthermore, mutations are small, random, and harmful alterations to the genetic code.\n\n \n That is not the definition of \"mutation\".\n \n \nAlso, the Earth could not be billions of years old. Some of the processes that have been studied that give young ages for the Earth are: \n\n \n Okay, let's take them one by one, assuming I have properly understood what you are basing this on-\n \n \nContinental erosion\n\n Claim:\n Continents are eroding at a rate which would bring them to sea level in less than 14 million years. Inasmuch as the continents are anything but flat, the earth cannot be billions of years old. (27.5 x 109 tons sediment/year are lost to the oceans by erosion; the present mass of the continents above sea level is 383 x 1015 tons.)\n \n This argument, advanced by creationist Stuart E. Nevins [Pseudonym for Steve Austin -- editor] in the ICR Impact series (No.8) in 1973, simply ignores the impact of modern geology! Nevins overlooks the fact that the continents are dynamic and have grown appreciably over time, both by accretion of material at the margins and by addition of material from the mantle below (Dalrymple, 1984, p.114 ). Volcanic activity, the emplacement of gigantic masses of rising, molten rock, and the stupendous compressional forces of the earth's colliding plates have been building mountains off and on for billions of years. Mountain building is going on even now in many parts of the world.\n \n I could also mention that the current rates of erosion are particularly high and that isostatic rebound would greatly increase the time for a continent to erode flat, but that's just icing on the cake. Any argument which pretends that continents are inert lumps of rock subject only to erosion is out of touch with reality. We need not consider it further.\n \n Davis A. Young (1988, pp.128-131 ) treats Nevins' argument in more detail. \n \n \nSea floor sediments \n \n \n \nAnother point made by Nevins is that sediment is piling up on the ocean floor faster than it's being removed. Even if that's true, there is no reason to view it as being anything more than a temporary imbalance.\n \n ...it is generally regarded by geologists that the rates of erosion at present are relatively high because of the topography of the continents. The continental land masses are believed to be much more rugged and mountainous than is usually the case, and mountainous topography speeds up rates of erosion. Thus at the present time we ought fully to expect that more sediment is being added to the oceans than is being removed. Paleogeography indicates that very often in the past the opposite was the case. (Young, 1988, p.131)\n\n \n \n \nSalinity of the oceans\n\n \n Claim:\n Given the rate of salt influx to the oceans, they should be much saltier than they are if the earth were billions of years old.\n(...) assuming that salt cannot be removed from the oceans. The more sophisticated creationists, such as Melvin Cook, know better than to make that assumption. Here's what Cook had to say:\n \n The validity of the application of total salt in the ocean in the determination of age turned out to have a very simple answer in the fact shown by Goldschmidt (1954) that it is in steady state and therefore useless as a means of determining the age of the oceans. Cook, 1966, p.73 \n \n (Dalrymple , 1984, pp.115-116)\n \n Thus, salt is being removed from the oceans as quickly as it is being added by the world's rivers. Consequently, no age can be calculated, save a minimum age based upon an assumption of initial salt content.\n\n \n \nHelium in the atmosphere\n \n Claim: The amount of helium in the atmosphere divided by its formation rate on Earth gives only 175,000 years.\n * BTW, a much higher number than 4000-7000\n \n \nHelium-4 is the product of radioactive alpha decay whereas Helium-3 is primordial. The rates of their \"production\" are simply the rates of their escape from within the earth to the atmosphere.\n \n A fair amount of helium is lost from the earth's atmosphere by simply being heated up in the elevated temperature of the exosphere (Dalrymple, 1984, p.112). The exosphere is the outermost layer of our atmosphere, beginning after the ionosphere at about 300 miles above the earth. When a lightweight helium atom is heated up, especially Helium-3, which is even lighter than Helium-4, it can easily pick up enough speed to escape Earth's gravity altogether and head off into outer space. Heating gas is a little like swatting rubber balls with a paddle; the lighter balls travel a lot faster after being swatted. In this manner about half of the Helium-3 produced is lost to outer space. The amount of the heavier Helium-4 lost by this method appears to be far short of the amount produced. Hence, the point of Morris' argument which is based on calculations by Cook. However, there are other mechanisms of helium escape which Morris and Cook have overlooked. Creationist Larry Vardiman (ICR Impact series, No.143, May 1985) at least recognizes some of these other factors. However, he has not fully addressed the matter, let alone proven that the earth is young.\n \n The most probable mechanism for helium loss is photoionization of helium by the polar wind and its escape along open lines of the Earth's magnetic field. Banks and Holzer [1969] have shown that the polar wind can account for an escape of 2 to 4 x 106 ions/cm2 sec of Helium-4, which is nearly identical to the estimated production flux of (2.5 \u00b1 1.5) x 106 atoms/cm2 sec. Calculations for Helium-3 lead to similar results, i.e., a rate virtually identical to the production flux. Another possible escape mechanism is direct interaction of the solar wind with the upper atmosphere during the short periods of lower magnetic-field intensity while the field is reversing. Sheldon and Kern [1972] estimated that 20 geomagnetic-field reversals over the past 3.5 million years would have assured a balance between helium production and loss.\n \n (Dalrymple, 1984, p.112)\n \n Dr. Dalrymple goes on to explain that even though our understanding of the helium balance in the atmosphere is incomplete, the situation being very complicated because of various hard-to-calculate factors, we do know one thing. \"...it is clear that helium can and does escape from the atmosphere in amounts sufficient to balance production.\" (1984, p.113)\n \n Thus, the helium balance calculations provided by creationist Melvin Cook (which are used by Henry Morris) cannot provide a reliable minimum estimate of the earth's age. Their argument is a fatal oversimplification of a complex problem.\n\n \n \nCarbon 14 in the atmosphere \n\n \n Claim- Dr. Hovind (R1): The atmospheric C-14 is presently only 1/3 of the way to an equilibrium value which will be reached in 30,000 years. This nullifies the carbon-14 method as well as demonstrating that the earth is less than 10,000 years old.\n \n \nThe argument may be compared to filling a barrel which has numerous small holes in its sides. We stick the garden hose in and turn it on full blast. (...)\n \n Henry Morris argued that if we started filling up our empty barrel it would take 30,000 years to reach the equilibrium point. Thus, he concluded, if our Earth were older than 30,000 years the incoming water should just equal the water leaking out. That is, the equilibrium point should have long since been reached given the present rate of carbon-14 production and the old age of the earth. The next step in Henry Morris' argument was to show that the water level in our barrel analogy was not in equilibrium, that considerably more water was coming in than leaking out. To that end, he quoted some authorities, including Richard Lingenfelter. Having accomplished that, Morris concluded that the barrel was still in the process of being filled up and that, given the present rate of water coming in and leaking out, the filling process began only 10,000 years ago.\n \n It's a great argument except for one, little thing. The water is not coming out of the hose at a steady rate as our model assumed! Sometimes it slows down to a trickle so that much more water is leaking out the barrel than is coming in; sometimes it goes full blast so that a lot more water is coming into the barrel than is leaking out. Thus, the mere fact that the present rate of water coming in exceeds that of the water leaking out cannot be extrapolated back to a starting time. And, that destroys the entire argument. (See Figure 1).\n \n Lingenfelter's paper was written in 1963, before the cycles of C-14 variation we described had been fully documented. The point is that fluctuations in the rate of C-14 production mean that at times the production rate will exceed the decay rate, while at other times the decay rate will be the larger. (Strahler, 1987, p.158)\n\n \n \nDecay of the Earth's magnetic field \n\n \n Claim: Since the earth's magnetic field is decaying at an exponential rate, its strength would have been unrealistically high 25,000 years ago. Thus, Earth is less than 25,000 years old.\n \n [quote]There are several fatal errors in Thomas G. Barnes's work:\n \n 1. Barnes employs an obsolete model of the earth's interior. (...)\n \n 2. In using McDonald and Gunst's data, Barnes selects only the \"dipole component\" of the total magnetic field for analysis (Brush, 1983, p.73). The dipole field is not an accurate measurement of the overall strength of the earth's magnetic field. The dipole field can decay even as the overall strength of the magnetic field remains the same! (...)\n \n 3. Based on his preconceptions of the earth's magnetic field, Barnes fits an exponential decay curve to the data. Barnes is doing some circular reasoning here. The use of an exponential decay curve is tantamount to assuming that the earth is young; one must show that the decay curve arises from the data -- not assume it! Otherwise, one is guilty of assuming that which must be proven, of arguing in circles. \n \n If you actually plot the data, as Brush has done (1983, p.74), it becomes quite clear that the data does not justify an exponential decay curve. To be sure, the data doesn't actually rule out an exponential decay curve, but that's not particularly helpful since the data can be made to fit any number of radically different equations. (...)\n \n 4. Barnes simply ignores the fact that the earth's magnetic polarity has reversed itself on numerous occasions. That fact, alone, is absolutely fatal to every fibre of Barnes's argument. (...)\n \n (quotes from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood.html)",

   "It can be noted that natural selection as a driving mechanism for evolution is totally inadequate. Natural selection (along with mutation) is said to have caused organisms to evolve from one basic kind (animals which can reproduce with one another) into another basic kind. This is prohibited genetically since all of the information for the development of an organism has already been encoded in the DNA of its parent. Variation to organisms must remain within its basic kind. For example, genetically, a wide variety of dogs can come to exist, but a dog can never become anything other than a dog. It remains in its kind. It does not have the genetic ability to become anything more. \n\n \n Almost all creationist admit to speciation. They say that &#8216;cat kinds&#8217; become lions, tigers, leopards, house cats, etc. And all &#8216;horse kinds&#8217; become horses, donkeys, zebras ,etc. And all &#8216;dog kinds&#8217; become dogs, wolves, foxes, hyenas (not for sure where they say they fall). These are just some examples. What creationist have failed to demonstrate is what prevents them from continuing to change until a different &#8216;kind&#8217; develops.\n \n \nbelieving in a creator is not a thing of the past or for \"unintellectual people\" as some think, there are thousands of scientists today that believe in god or an intellegent being or force.

He also rejected the doctrine of the Trinity because the trinity is in fact false, jesus in not god but the son of god, but thats beside the point.

The similarity between a lion and a tiger is obvious; they can mate and occasionally produce an offspring called a tigon. But the tigon is not fully viable - like a mule it cannot reproduce itself. a lion and tiger are distinct species but fall in the same family kind.\n \n so,\n \n Kind; genus, each with x amount of different species\n \n \n species are communities of individuals that can \"interbreed successfully\". Two creatures that cannot interbreed, even if they resemble each other, must belong to different species. \n \n Variety; A group that is distinguished from other groups by a specific characteristic or set of characteristics. domestic dogs for example are all the same specie but with wide viraitey. A dog can mate with a wolve but the mixture is not fully viable the offspring will eventually be of wolve or dog depends only if it is selectively bred by humans.\n \n \n So a tiger is:\n \n Kingdom: Animalia\n Phylum: Chordata\n Class: Mammalia\n Order: Carnivora\n Genus or Kind: Felidae - Cats\n Species: cats; tigers; wildcats; lions; leopards; cheetahs; saber-toothed tigers\n New \"varieties\" can be established within each speices\n \n \n A dog:\n \n Kingdom: Animalia\n Phylum: Chordata\n Class: Mammalia\n Order: Carnivora\n Genus or Kind: Canidae\n Species: Dog, Wolves, coyote, fox, etc..\n New \"varieties\" can be established within each speices\n \n \n Again, Kind or Genus consists of very similar groups, but members of different groups usually cannot breed with one another. Both the coyote and the timber wolf are in the genus Canis.

Evolutionists assume that chance mutations in the genetic code of organisms caused by environmental forces such as radiation are eventually capable of expanding the genetic information and capability of species so that macro- biological changes and variations can occur which natural selection can then act upon. HOWEVER, the scientific evience and data show that whatever mutations can actually accomplish will be very limited. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that environmental forces in nature have the capability to upgrade the genetic and sequential information in the DNA of simpler species so that more complex species can evolve via natural selection. In fact, random genetic mutations caused by radiation and other environmental forces will do just the opposite - they will cause death and eventual destruction, even, extinction of a species!\n \n \n generation after generation a cat will still be a cat.Contrary to popular public belief about how evolution is supposed to occur, it doesn't matter what the environment is like. If the genetic information for a certain trait or characteristic is not already in the DNA (or genetic code) of a species then there is nothing in the environment that is capable of putting that information there so that the species would develop that particular trait or characteristic. In other words, it doesn't matter how much a lizard may need to fly in order to be able to survive. If the genetic information for feathers and wings are not in the DNA of a lizard then that lizard will never develop feathers and wings. THIS IS FACT.\n \n Genesis 1:20 \n \"And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" (verse 21) So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their KINDS, and every winged bird according to its KIND. And God saw that it was good. (Verse 22) God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" \n \n Again God creates all life in the sky and in the water, each with the ability to reproduce but only within the confines of their genetic code.\n \n \n Again, a lizard cannot become anything but a lizard. modern science agrees with the bible more than it does with evolution.",

There are some problems with it. For a start, Felidae sits in taxonomical classifications as a Familiy, not a genus. There are actually 17 genra of cats. So does that mean there are 17 cat \"kinds\"? Of course we could redefine \"kind\" to be equivelent to family, but then humans and the other apes are all suddenly the same \"kind\" (Hominidae). Secondly, if we ignore that and assume there were just two cat-kind animals on the ark, then incredible rampant macro-evolution took place afterward to turn two individuals into 23 species, but macro-evolution is supposed to be impossible.\n \n The bible was written by primative bronze age people. For them, \"things that look similar\" was a perfectly sensible way of grouping stuff, so \"kinds\" of animals made sense.

That is how evolution works, constructing nested hierachies are we go, note that all cordates are still cordates, all apes are still apes, all primates are still primates, etc. etc. What does change however is what 'cat'; once there was only one cat species, that original species diverged into several species (possibly the original species became extinct, maybe it didn't, it certainly is now, probably we wouldn't immediately identify it as a cat at all) thus we'd now class 'cat' as a Genus, containing these species, as more and more speciation occured that Genus would grow until we classed it as a family (the situation now) containing many Genus, some of which are now extinct (sabre-tooth tigers for example).\n \n \nContrary to popular public belief about how evolution is supposed to occur, it doesn't matter what the environment is like.If the genetic information for a certain trait or characteristic is not already in the DNA (or genetic code) of a species then there is nothing in the environment that is capable of putting that information there so that the species would develop that particular trait or characteristic.\n\n \n Quite true. The environment does not modify genes (that would be Lamarkism), what it does do is select for them. It is mutation and sexual re-combination that modifies genes.

   "The cat KIND or genus is divided into different species\n \n I think when you say genus you are meaning family. Felidae and Canidae are families not genuses. \n \n Humans, gorillas, chimps, bonobos, orangutans and many other species of primate are all in the family Hominidae, which by your definition means humans and chimps and gorillas are the same kind and therefore using this definition of kinds even you must accept we share a common ancestor with chimps. \n \n In fact if you believe the lion and the domestic cat microevolved from an original cat kind, then you cannot claim chimps and humans didn't do the same thing. In fact chimps and humans are more genetically similar than lions and domestic cats. \n \n Which leads to...\n Humans are separated from the animal kingdom for many reasons 1) individualised ego: self- consciousness, 2) reason, etc...\n \n That isn't very scientific unless you can determine:\n 1) that other primates have no self-consciousness or reason\n and\n 2) our self-consciousness and reason isn't simply a product of our larger brain\n \n What you are doing is inserting religious philosophies into this now of humans being superior to other animals. \n Perhaps I could claim that lions are seperated from the animal kingdom because they have a mane.\n \n And lets look at it from the point of view of genetics. Humans and chimps share 99% of their genetic material. Why would such a small genetic change be unaccomplishable by micro-evolution? \n \n Evolutionists assume that chance mutations in the genetic code of organisms caused by environmental forces such as radiation are eventually capable of expanding the genetic information and capability of species so that macro- biological changes and variations can occur which natural selection can then act upon.  \n \n No all changes would be micro-biological but these would eventually add up. If you believe lions and cats diverged  from an original kind then why won't that diverging continue? \n \n HOWEVER, the scientific evience and data show that whatever mutations can actually accomplish will be very limited\n The evidence and data shows that mutations over many generations can accomplish a lot\n \n There is absolutely no scientific evidence that environmental forces in nature have the capability to upgrade the genetic and sequential information in the DNA of simpler species so that more complex species can evolve via natural selection\n There is no such thing as a \"more complex\" creature or a \"simpler\" creature. Is an owl more or less complex than a dog? and why? No both are as evolved as each other. Evolution is not a ladder system\n \n In fact, random genetic mutations caused by radiation and other environmental forces will do just the opposite - they will cause death and eventual destruction, even, extinction of a species!\n \n No that is completely wrong. First of all hereditary genetic mutations are copy errors and are not always attributed to radiation. Secondly beneficial mutations have been observed which add new functionality. Thirdly a mutation will never cause the extinction of an entire species, just the death of an individual.\n \n generation after generation a cat will still be a cat.Contrary to popular public belief about how evolution is supposed to occur, it doesn't matter what the environment is like.\n \n You assert this like you know but you cannot possibly know what cats will look like in 5,000,000 years time. Nor have you observed what they looked like 5,000,000 years ago. The fact is that evolution on a large scale takes a long time, we don't expect to see a cat changing into some weird creature in a few generations. Why do you keep using this as an argument?\n \n Heres a thinker for you - what about whales which have been found with hindlimbs? If you remember evolution says whales were once river dwelling mammals that went back into the water and eventually the ocean, ie they once had legs. They still possess the DNA coding for hind legs but it has been \"switched\" off over time as it wasn't needed. Occasionally a whale will get a mutation which reactivates these legs.\n Clearly whales did evolve from land animals, how else can you explain hindlimbs containing bone, blubber and skin?\n Whales born with hindlimbs \n \n In other words, it doesn't matter how much a lizard may need to fly in order to be able to survive. If the genetic information for feathers and wings are not in the DNA of a lizard then that lizard will never develop feathers and wings. THIS IS FACT.\n \n No it isn't, it is an assertion, you don't present any backing for this above statement other than claiming \"it is a fact\". In fact the fossil Archaeopteryx shows a reptile-avian transitional. It possesses mostly reptile features and would be classified as such if it wasn't for the fact it also has a pair of primitive wings and feathers.\n \n Again, a lizard cannot become anything but a lizard. modern science agrees with the bible more than it does with evolution.\n \n Modern science disagrees  that a lizard cannot become anything but a lizard.

I refer to the following exchange.\n \nIn other words, it doesn't matter how much a lizard may need to fly in order to be able to survive. If the genetic information for feathers and wings are not in the DNA of a lizard then that lizard will never develop feathers and wings. THIS IS FACT.\n\n No it isn't, it is an assertion, you don't present any backing for this above statement other than claiming \"it is a fact\". In fact the fossil Archaeopteryx shows a reptile-avian transitional. It possesses mostly reptile features and would be classified as such if it wasn't for the fact it also has a pair of primitive wings and feathers.\n\n It is, in fact, true that no matter how much an organism may need to fly, it will not be able to fly unless it has wings. Such concepts were rejected in the latter half of the 19th century. Clearly, 3visible fails to grasp the basics of natural selection.\n \n Let me see if I can explain the basics of the theory of natural selection as Darwin and Walace perceived them.\n \n In any environment there exists a limited number of resources. However, all organisms produce more offspring than those resources can support. Without constraint, populations will grow exponentially. But it is observed that adult populations remain relatively constant. This must mean that there is a constand competition by every organism to acquire the limited resources in order to survive.\n \n At the same time there exists in any population great variability such that no two individuals are exactly the same. Some of these characteristics give their bearers an advantage in acquiring the limited resources. These individuals will be more likely to survive to reproduce. If the characteristics are heritable, then the advantageous characteristics will tend to be passed on to the next generation. Thus, populations will become better adapted to their environment.\n \n To directly address 3visible's remarks, it has nothing to do with need. Need does not determine the variability that is available. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with advantageous heritable characteristics. And it is, of course, the environment that determines what is or is not beneficial.",

There are numerous pedigree breeds ranging from miniature breeds to Great Danes. The incredible variety of dogs is extended by virtue of the fact that all dogs can breed with each other. However, once again this variety represents the genes that already exist. There is no evidence for dogs ever producing anything but different (or similar) types of dogs. Selective breeding may give rise to new breeds of dogs, but not to anything but dogs. The gene pool of dog DNA has been preserved, not added to.\n \n \n anyway,\n \n The above example of genetic variability, the limited ability to adapt and the selection of the fittest within a pre-existing gene pool can be applied to all living organisms.

While there are variations in the gene count, their ability to mate and produce the mule indicates that the horse and donkey belong to the same kind. the dog variety includes the dog, fox and hyena, each with a different variation of genes. However, as these animals mate to produce all the different possibilities of dogs, foxes, wolves, jackals etc..., the conclusion is that all of these animals belong to the same kind.\n \n Mr. jack;\n \n I take the bible word for word. The bible states on Genesis 1:26;And God went on to say;\"Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness\"\n \n I doubt god then went on and created us as baboons. According to this verse god created the first man with a likeness and the capabilities that separated humans from animals.\n \n The bible may have been written by \"bronze-age herders\" but it is all inspired by god, it is gods word. 2 Timothy 3:16\n \n Also, your right i only know the basics of quantum mechanics. The problen is the further you study the more theories become vague and fuzzy. I dont know if anyone really knows exactly the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules since there is no pictures to confirm of what an atom really looks like or what light really is and how it travels some say particles some say waves. Human knowledge is limited in this area. Human knowledge is still actually limited in many areas. this universe is very complex and fascinating.",

   "VARIABILITY WITHIN A SPECIES (DOGS) - According to a recent article New Scientist (30th November 2002), all dogs descended from five or fewer female grey wolves. Does such a finding support evolution or belief in creation or intelligent design?\n\n \n It sounds to me like an excellent example of evolution. Look at the different breeds of dogs. There is no way that five wolves will contain all the genetic variety that the current breeds show. In fact, my guess is that if and when you do a proper genetic analysis, you will see that there are plenty of alleles that simply do not exist in any wild wolf population.\n \n What you see is exactly what evolution says will happen: mutations came about that produced genetic variability, and some of the characteristics produced were selected for, resulting in a radiation of different breeds.\n \n Why does this not support evolution? It is a concrete example of variation and almost-but-not-quite speciation coming about. Extrapolate this procedure over thousands of more years, and you may see new species come about. Extrapolate further, and see new genera, new families, even.\n \n Why do you believe that this process cannot go further to produce further change? Why can't you extrapolate and see a pattern in the current species and see how they, too, might have come about due to the process of evolution?\n \n \n \nYah, i know about those skulls and those fossils... but there are no intermediary forms / fossils, \"false evidence\" and \"theory.\" those fossils could be from extincted species from the grate ape, there are not intermediary forms of human.\n \n\n \n Look at the picture again:\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2.jpg\n \n Why are these not intermediary forms?

   "Of course, the fact that all dogs are descended from 5 female wolves is an example of evolution. The topic came up in a discussion on another board. It seems that even though we classify all dogs as a single species, in reality they are not. While many different breeds are able to interbreed, and many are also able to interbreed with wolves, there are some breeds of dog that cannot interbreed.\n \n One example is the Chihuahua and the Great Dane. You all must admit that the impossibility of copulation is pretty apparent. But the inability to interbreed doesn't stop there. To artificially impregnate a female Chihuahua by a male Great Dane would be fatal to the Chihuahua. So what about the other way around, male Chihuahua and female Great Dane? It seems that the offspring aren't viable. It seems that 1/2 of the genome giving instructions to grow very large and the other halv to stay very small produces a bit of malformation that results in the death of the foetus.",

   "Looking over my last post, I realise this is a rather poor answer.\n \n Dogs have been bred from wolves. What do you notice about dogs? They're not wolves! We have bred a non-wolf from a wolf!\n \n Want a better example? Compare a modern cow to an Auroch. How about Chickens and wild fowl? Guinea pigs are so different from any wild ancestor that nobody knows what that ancestor was.\n\n \n Dogs are wolves. Genetically the difference is so negligible that they are the same species as Canis familiaris. In the old days before genetics where used to classify animals the scientist used bone shapes, and structure to classify species. Domesticated dogs were put into their own species. BTW the \"first dogs\" were catlike tree climbers, but back then I guess cats could be described as doglike.\n \n Classifying things by broad similarities (like bone shape) is primitive, and borders on fallacy, for some people used to think that hyenas are dogs, spiders are insects, and whales are fish. Science has moved on to a genetic system for the most part; except for long extinct animals like dinosaurs that leave no tissue to genetically classify. \n \n Red wolves are going \"extinct\" by inbreeding with coyotes and domestic dogs. The gene pool is diluting them to \"extinction\" oddly this is much the same way speciation is proposed with a slight twist. Instead of going extinct by being \"unfit\" (wolves have less diseases and are hardier than domesticated dogs), the \"wolf\" genes are being rewritten like obsolete lines of code in software.\n \n I have a question. I remember evolution books from a few bio classes. Usually the examples in the book are dramatic like stuff from a \"walking with\" (fill in the blank) episode. Where the parent species gets eaten, or starves to death, but this slow mutation that evolution uses seems to never allow this unless it is a major flaw, or if monsterism is true. I never thought of evolution as a process of perpetually passing the torch. So how can you define intermediate species? \n \n Is the concept of species only useful for guys cataloging bones in museums? In the \"real world\" it almost seems to be an description of heredity as a process with an ends (making a new specise). Even though people understand evolution has no ends. Maybe I am naive or cynical, but evolution seems to be a theory created by creationist trying to use a model for speciation that eliminated the need for divine intervention, and technically it was. Then a few generations later scientist decide that evolution is an accurate model of the natural world. While I agree that the mechanics of evolution are proven. The things that people imply evolution \"proves\" or \"disproves\" are mostly conjecture and more philosophical than scientific.",

It was put together by the Chinese peasant who discovered it. The pieces were assembled to make the fossil more marketable to collectors, not to researchers. This peasant may or may not have known that the tail came from a separate fossil. [Simmons, 2000] \n \n Archaeoraptor was published in the popular press, not in peer-reviewed journals. The main author of the article about it was National Geographic's art editor, not a scientist. Nature and Science both rejected papers describing it [Simmons, 2000]. Normal scientific procedures worked to uphold high standards.\n Talk Origins\n Also, how do you explain the fact that the tail of the supposed Archaeoraptor was found to be a significant discovery on it's own, that of Microraptor?\n \n From your link-\n \n\"(Microraptor) shows a number of modifications to the hips, tail and teeth which are in some ways intermediate between those of advanced meat-eating dinosaurs and birds. There also appears to have been feathers, adding more evidence to the view that feathers and feather-like structures predated the origin of birds,\" Dr. Paul Barrett, a professor at Oxford University said.\n\n \n \nYou did ignore Haeckel's drawings.\n\n \n Glossing over some slight differences in a drawing is not the same thing as out and out fabrication.

Where is your evidence that this was a deliberate forgery on Dubois' part?\n \n The skull cap, btw, came from a very large \"ape-like\" creature indeed. Probably one like Turkana Boy.

They had a moderatly adducted hallux, and the phalanges were shorter and less curved than those of chimps, but slightly more curved and longer than humans. Humans who don't wear shoes and climb trees a lot also have a moderately adducted hallux, so it's inferred that A. afarensis also lacked shoes and still climbed trees, even though it was bipedal.

   "You did ignore Haeckel's drawings. These were constructed in a specific way so as to be misleading. They were fakes, and they were continually taught long after they were known to be inaccurate.\n\n \n I was fortunate enough to acquire a copy of the 3rd edition of Haeckel's Evolution of Man this weekend; that being the original source of the infamous drawings. Of particular interest is Haeckel's forward defending the first and second edition against received criticism. One of the complaints levelled against his work was that the drawings were inaccurate and omited detail. Haeckel's responded that his drawings were indeed simplified diagrams, but that all diagrams are simplified so that they can demonstrate their point. He also stated that all the features highlighted in his diagram are indeed present in the specimens (this is true) but he considered that photographically accurate pictures would obscure the salient details to an untrained eye (which may or may not be true).\n \n I consider there are three salient points here, two for the evos, one for the creos.\n \n What is clear is that it was not Haeckel's intent to deceive, but to inform. One may argue that he was overzealous in his simplification of the diagrams, but he never intended them to be taken as precise and accurate drawings. It is not true that 'these were constructed in a specific way so as to be misleading'.\n \n If you do look at real photos next to Haeckel's drawings you will see the features highlighted on Haeckel's drawings are indeed there; if less obvious than in Haeckel's drawings - it is not true that 'they were fakes'.\n \n The perhaps dubious nature of Haeckel's drawings was noted at the time of publication; this means that ALL textbooks that contain Haeckel's drawings should have known of their nature.\n \n I'll make one final point about Haeckel: he was wrong. His big claim was what he called 'The Fundemental Law of Biogensis', better known as the tagline 'Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny' - the claim that embryonic forms act out the evolutionary history of the species. I find this a shame, because the text that accompanies his drawings accurately states the significance of embryonic similarities (namely that more closely related species have more closely related embryonic development) was accurate.",

   "To answer the original point. Evoulution says way, way back that something, lets say a bactria (i don't know the first microb) split. The bactria was fine and it split agian, and agian, and agian until on of its copies mutated. This slittly changed copy of the bactria decieded to eat his fellow copes. The copes trying to be eaten coped themselves agian, and those copies were eaten. Then one copy was made that could defend agiasnt the bactria trying to eat it. All other copies were eaten and couldn't copy themselves agian, but the one copy that had a defence was able to reproduce. Then the entire world of bactria arized that could defend agiasnt the predetary bactria (which would have to be the ansecter of the amoeba), until said predetary bactria copied itself until it could defeat the defending bactria. This cycle continued until on microb was copied that bonded with its fellow microbs, and this super-microb was to large to be hunted, and started eating everything it say on the microb scale. The only defense agiasnt this was that the defending microbs got bigger too. \n \n Eventually over time small animals formed. These animals had no urge to live, no need to collect food, so they died. Until on was formed that wanted to reproduce, and it was able to. But the small animal could only make one offspring before it died of hunger because it had no evolved a digestive tract. So after years, one mutation evolved a digestive tract, and was able to have several offspring. \n \n This system worked pretty good, until slightly larger animals were made, which tried to eat the smaller versions. The smaller versions would mutate and if the mutation stopped the attacking animals, the now-defended animal would reproduce while all its brethern died cause they were eaten. \n \n So after a couple billion years of microb evoultion, and a couple hundred million of animal, apes came into the story. These apes, because they had the will to live (they had the will to live because anything with the will to live would have more kids then something that didn't care if it lived or died) evolved slowly into us. THE END\n \n Their are only two problems with the theory (and no creationism does not explain them), first being were did that original bactria come from. Second, evolution would have some pretty radical over kill, like if monkeys need better eyes, a mutation with fake wings, a spiky tail and cobra venom coming out its butt would work so long as it had better eyes to see predators.

   "Replicators so thats how GOD did it maybe he scored a few when Packard went back intime to the primodial soup (J/K).\n\n \n Don't knock it to much, more than a few folks have suggested that evolution is God's way of working. John Polkinghorne even suggested that evolution was the only way God could work free-will into his grand creation.\n \n \nI don't know Jack, but I don't think evolution works on your replicators. They need dna. These replacators need to have some way to store reproductive data. If they are functional, but don't have reproductive data they can't evolve.\n\n \n Yes. But it doesn't need to be DNA, hell it doesn't even need to be as advanced as RNA. A replicator needs to make copies of itself and be capable of producing slightly altered copies of itself (mutations), otherwise it won't work.",
