Thanks for getting my blood pressure up a bit. I needed some excitement today.\n \n Labor unions SUCK! They have fulfilled their basic worthwhile cause of defeating child labor practices and raising the pay scales of the working masses, but their methods now seem to damage the economy and individual businesses rather than help the overall labor situation.\n \n Today's unions are no better than the Evangelical Preacher Programs wherein people contribute to the high-on-the-hog living standards of the fundraisers. Union fat cats ride around in Cadillacs, wearing $1000 Armani suits, telling the working masses that they are benefitting from union activities and that they are getting their money's worth from the union dues they pay to be a member of the chosen ones. In truth, unions have cost this country more than most people can imagine. Work stoppages for stupid reasons cost industries billions of dollars. Strikes (during which the union members get some of their own money back) cost billions of dollars. Stupid union practices akin to railroad featherbedding cost billions of dollars.\n \n The idiotic baseball strike some time back and the idiotic hockey strike (lockout) recently are just two examples of union's abilities to hurt all people connected to certain businesses. How many hotdog vendors, tee-shirt salesmen, ticket scalpers, concession workers, parking attendants, stadium works, hotel workers, taxi drivers, policemen, etc were financially hurt by these two idiotic strikes? Here we have baseball players making millions of dollars a year striking for more benefits, overpayed hockey players striking for more benefits.\n \n And all the while, the union fat cats are fighting for power so they have the Cadillacs and the suits at the worker's expense.\n \n \n \n \n\n As for the split, in my opinion it is a huge error in judgement to have left the fold.

Any split in the union machine is welcomed by me. The disappearance of the unions would be welcomed by me. Not only do we pay higher prices because of unions, we suffer complete shutdowns of some parts of local economies when the unions become even greedier.\n \n Unions have outlived their usefulness and should disappear from the earth. The government has established minimum wages and has laws to punish child labor users. This is all we need in the way of labor protection.\n \n A fair day's pay for a fair day's work is not that hard to get...even without the help of some highly paid representative and his unnecessary staff.",

   "I don`t know much about the US labour unions or movement so I`m probably not in position to comment on the specific situation. However, I find the US attitude towards labour unions very interesting and I think it just might be one of the more important explanations of the economic and political differences between continental europe (inlcuding Scandinavia) and the anglo-saxon countries (most specificly the US). Heck, the difference in attitude and the power position of labour unions might even explain crucial differences between the US and the UK ,the most immediate difference that comes to mind would be the lack of a (strong) social democratic party in the US.\n \n Personally, I regard (strong) labour unions as vital economic and political institions, responsible for migating and counteracting the worst aspects of capitalism (wealth concentration). To me, it is apparant that the massive wealth- and income disparity, unprecedented in any other western economy, is predominantly caused by anti-union legislation/lack of pro-union legislation that has resulted in a virtually powerless union movement. The attempts to curb this through a steeply progressive taxation and minimum wages seem to me like political illusions crafted in order to placate the US working class. Roughly like the myth of the \"american dream\".",

   "I find all this bile against unions bizarre. Unions may be a bit different in the US but I find that difficult to believe. The low level of the minimum wage in the US and the number of people working for or marginally above it speaks to me of the need for strong trade unions. Raising wages for the low paid is more beneficial to the economy that almost anything else, because the money goes back into the economy almost instantly, it also removes some of the need for state benefits, as wages are actually livable on. If wages are not livable on then the government is forced to effectively subsidise those companies who refuse to pay a living wage, or people end up in debt or working themselves to death to try and pay the bills.\n \n I'm not so keen on amalgamated trade unions, I think smaller unions are much more responsive to the needs of their members. I think the US needs legislation like we have in the UK forcing companies to recognise trade unions where their employees want it, and forbidding firing people for undertaking lawful trade union activity.",

Beginning in ww2, when wages were frozen and couldn't be used to attract workers, benefits were utilized to sidestep the wage issue. Post ww2 the practice was continued as management viewed non-taxable benefits and job security as concessions preferable to company tax exposure on wages. Especially when senior bonuses and incentives have traditionally been based on operating margin and ROI to placate equity markets. The accumulation of benefits including job security combined with high wage scales was and is a major influence in offshore relocation of US industry. US vehicle manufacturers are now caught in that very trap. Due to dependence on trading markets determining equity values, standing up to labor demands based on profitability, as should be the circumstances, no longer affords management resistance. \n \n US civil service is the next financial dilemma associated with labor demands not being effectively managed.

In any case, no matter how low US steel companies push wages and conditions, they won't be albe to compete with chinese and other imports. Labour costs are a red herring, western manufacturing companies have to work smart, be constantly innovating and doing things that can't be done cheaply overseas. If the problem was caused by trade unions don't you think UK steel production would have survived, given what Thatcher did to British trade unions in the 80s?\n \n The other key issue the US has is the lack of public healthcare.

There is usually a lot more to these stories than meets the eye, the media usually only deals in headlines.\n\n \n I don't know about the UK, but in the US public worker unionization has developed a new method of collective bargaining. Prior to large scale unionization, public pay and benefit scales were calculated on comparable positions in private industry within the immediate economic area. The union bargaining standard for wage and benefit scale now uses comparable city populations with no other considerations, encluding private industry compensation and municipal financial health. \n \n This has presented a financial dilemma to many municipalities in that city/county X, the bargaining example, is normally in one of the US areas with high domestic construction growth and subsequent service industry stimulation resulting in adequate tax revenue, at this time, to meet union demands. The union target city/county Y is inevitably in an area where declining manufacturing and other conditions have reduced tax revenue. The options are facing a strike or raising local tax rates to meet labor demands, not a good circumstance.\n \n This has led to the creation of two public work forces in many areas (political refusal to face reality and negotiate union demands based on available tax revenue). Work force A consists of unionized workers with work force B being non-union. Job descriptions are updated to eliminate the overheads of union workers by cutting those positions from a budget and/or using private contractors to perform the work (at much lower costs with greater efficiency). \n \n Locally, we've had three recall elections to remove elected officials who conceded to what the local population considers excessive pay for unionized public workers. When the local newspaper points out that most public positions are paying far more actual salary and offering a guaranteed retirement at a upper-middle class level that greatly exceeds a comparable job in private industry, local taxpayers do take heed. This will not happen in larger cities or states due to voter apathy until excessive taxation gets their attention. At the federal level, there seems to be no cap on union demands regardless of fiscal circumstances. \n \n You used public safety as an example in your post. Fire fighter unions, due to their rise to heroic status from 9/11, are actually putting themselves out of a job in our county with what are considered excessive wage and benefit demands. Private industry is taking over the county fire department functions station by station, using former county standards for training, equipment and procedures. Costs are at 70% of public worker salary and benefits with response time actually improving by as much as 50% in most areas. Local agricultural cooperatives and homeowners have actually received insurance rate reductions with improved reaction times. \n \n While I'm in agreement that unionization is a necessary ingredient of any successful capitalistic society, we in the US have a situation where political leaders have been using the same poor judgment exhibited by our industry captains in not forecasting costs in terms of future value exposure of expenses to projected revenue streams. After ten-years of progressively higher costs far beyond normal economic expansion (or reduction), those compounded operating and legacy costs are now showing up in current budgets and shocking the public. Municipalities and states face serious operating deficiencies in the coming years with little hope of reconciliation as unions seldom agree to reduction of salary and benefits to meet existing economic conditions.",

   "In the UK there have been a number of instances where unionised employees, when faced with a company in financial difficulty, have agreed to pay cuts. I suspect, bizarre as it may seem, the more direct nature of US democracy and federalism is to blame. Here, while a local council does levy taxes to fund local services, most of their money coems from central government and there is a massive redistribution from richer to poorer areas. It's imperfectly calculated, but it does mean that you get broadly equal pay for equal work across the country in the public sector. The fire services, though employed separately by local authorities, negotiate pay nationally. The problems of local economies collapsing are much less keenly felt here than in the US.\n \n It does sound like the unions in the US are being pretty stupid in some cases, but it also sounds like the system itself is rotten, and it is middle class workers who are unionised, not those at the bottom who most need it. It seems to me to be another symptom of the inequality inherent in the US economic system, those at the very bottom get screwed. We have some of the same issues here, but at least our minimum wage, with strong union support and against CBI crying wolf, is pushing past \u00a35/hour.",

IMO the problem with both lies in short attention span of leadership, public and private, where normal motivation is self-preservation and enrichment. I'm certainly not a champion of the little people, but without costs, including legacy costs (the most volatile factor) tied to profitability (or tax revenue) even semi-efficient public service will eventually face insolvency and/or taxpayer rebellion. \n \n Minimum wage levels are another subject. Most studies have proven that increases in US minimum wage levels have harmed the recipients through increases in their cost of living. If the wage increases $.25 USD, the consumable products and services derived from their production rise that much plus the margin requirement, leaving them at a net loss.",

In any case, no matter how low US steel companies push wages and conditions, they won't be albe to compete with chinese and other imports. Labour costs are a red herring, western manufacturing companies have to work smart, be constantly innovating and doing things that can't be done cheaply overseas. If the problem was caused by trade unions don't you think UK steel production would have survived, given what Thatcher did to British trade unions in the 80s?\n \n The other key issue the US has is the lack of public healthcare.

   "The UK experience of the minimum wage has been that unemployment has fallen dramatically since its intorduction, not least because it means there is more of a gap between benefits and working. Also, the vast majority of low paid jobs are service sector, and not vulnerable to being exported, as you can't sell groceries from offshore, or care for the elderly, and this is where the lowest paid jobs are. Collective bargaining, while preferable, is usually not possible because low paid workers are the least likely to be unionised, and the ones who can least afford to lose their job, even if their dismissal might later be overturned in court.\n \n Public healthcare is the most efficient means of provision, this is why up until a few years ago the UK spent 6.5% of GDP to the US 13.5%.

Would our wages be substantially higher, but the cost of living more higher yet? Would new jobs be rare because old jobs were protected at all costs?\n\n \n I would say that since larger unions represent a larger part of the workforce, they also need to consider what effects their wage demands have on the whole economy. A small union can always strive to maximize the benefits for its own members without being concerned with how their demands might affect unemployment, and consequently governmental finances and taxes. Larger unions need to take this into consideration however, and are more likely to make demands that will benefit the economy in the long run. Up to a certain point, larger and stronger unions with more centralised power would therefor result in higher inflation and unemployment as these unions, not yet large enough to consider the entire economic situation or being able to control what other wage-earners demand, would have better ability to force the employers into submission. However, once the unions get large enough to consider the entire economic situation, and the negotiations are central enough to empower the unions with a reasonable ability to control the wage setting process, unemployment and inflation drops.\n \n The relationship between centralisation/size of unions and unemployment/inflation is therefor shaped like a hump.\n \n While this might seem theoretic and a bit idealistic, there are empirical evidence to support this conclusion. In crosscountry comparrisons between nations with different forms of negotiation this type of relationship has been found (allthogh certain studies come to the conclusion that the relationship is straightforward rather than \"hump shaped\"). Also observations of countries that has reformed their negotiation systems support the vie that more centralisation leads to lower unemployment/inflation.\n \n As for protections against firing would lead to less jobs, there is indeed a relationship between job creation and job security. However the net-effect on unemployment is theoreticly ambigous since there is also a relationship between job termination and job security.",

   "@ Waxy\n \n I`m not Alan Ryan, but I think this issue is an interesting one, so I hope you don`t object to me giving my thoughts regarding your question.\n \n \n Perhaps the inballance resides in the fact that the employee and employer had an inexplicit mutual arangement, or agreement if you will, of responsibility and trust. These kind of arangements are fairly common between employers and employees, ecpecially in small bussineses. Not everything can be regulated formaly in a written contract, nor is it desireable as this would result in a very unflexible working situation. Furthermore, lifetime contracts (slave contracts) are illegal, as are contracts forbidding owners to sell their bussineses. Therefor it`s unreasonable to expect that the employee in this case could have protected himself from this ugly and unexpected turn of event. Had the employee in question been organised in a labour union, this whole thing might have been avoided.",

I suppose I was taken off guard by what seemed a vehement reaction from you and your suggestion that compensation is thoroughly undeserved in the event of getting unexpectedly fired etc. (I don't want to flatter, but your posts always strike me as reasoned and good-humoured, so this one seemed a bit \"out of character\")\n \n However, that's enough about my sensibilities and back to the essence of this topic. Before returning to my \"anecdote\" I should explain that there is now legislation in the UK which covers contracts of employment and which obliges employers to pay a lump sum of \"redundancy money\" to people who are fired through no fault of their own. This sum is calculated on the number of years of service and does not apply if the employee leaves of his own accord or is dismissed for misconduct.\n \n From an American (and Canadian ?) point of view, perhaps this entitlement to compensation is abhorrent ? Obviously, it isn't a freebie and has to be factored into business costs: consumers eventually pick up the tab through the higher prices caused by an extra corporate overhead. Maybe we should, but most people don't mind the burden being redistributed in this way: if the redundancy payment keeps recently fired people afloat until they can find another job, surely this is far better than having them dumped on a feather bed provided by the welfare state ?\n \n I should emphasise that this legislation was not an idea that came from the associations of employers: it resulted from union pressure on a sympathetic (Labour) government. Had it been in effect when my father got the sack, it would have provided a useful sum of petty cash during the couple of weeks it took him to find another job. That's the real point of my disputed reference to \"compensation\" - which now applies to everyone, with some exceptions, whether unionised or not.\n \n There's no need to spell out the other benefits of union membership, though I can't resist mentioning that a collective group of employees working for an impersonal organisation, can resist attempts by the employer to pick off the lone individual.\n \n I think this interesting thread has revealed some cultural differences in outlook between Europe and North America. It has given notice to me at least that, contrary to reports, American individualism is not dead. The larger questions of why European business models tend to respect social obligations in employment contracts more than is the case with the American business model, must be left to another time.",

That's the real point of my disputed reference to \"compensation\" - which now applies to everyone, with some exceptions, whether unionised or not.\n \n \n\n This sounds a lot like Unemployment Compensation, a safety net we have in place in the US for people losing their jobs from layoffs or the like. It's funded through an employer tax. \n \n Unions administer their own version for striking or laid-off members, funded by a portion of union dues. \n \n But would the UK's version compensate union members as well as non- who suffer job losses? Is it fair to ask the government to pay this sum when the burden should be shouldered by the union, at least to my way of thinking?",

   "But would the UK's version compensate union members as well as non- who suffer job losses? Is it fair to ask the government to pay this sum when the burden should be shouldered by the union, at least to my way of thinking?\n\n \n If your question refers to wether it is fair that the state fund unemployment benefits, I would say yes. It`s a practical thing to do. If union-members only paid for their own members unemployment benefits, there would be less incentive for moderation in wage demands that could result in lay-offs. When the state pays, all workers pay for unemployment, not only those belonging to the same union. There are other aspects to it as well, like enabling workers to seek new and better jobs without having to fear starvation. Unemployment benefits also act as an automatic stabiliser during a recession, quickly increasing government expenditures during times of high unemployment to keep up the demand for goods and services. Basicly, unemployment benefits are so important for the economy that it can`t be trusted in the hands of private interests (that would have to be bailed out during an economic crisis by the government anyway) and it works more efficiently if the costs are shouldered by everyone to provide an incentive for avoiding widespread unemployment.",
