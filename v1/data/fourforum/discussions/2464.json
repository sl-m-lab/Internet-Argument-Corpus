Why can't men feel comfortable in a skirt and high heels? I mean come on, who is being harmed by this. Let these men have their fun.",

Both had curlers in their hair. It wasn't that bad of a pic and he still has a laugh or two about it. I didn't think too much of that. But, I could not (I don't think) sit around deer camp with a man wearing one.\n JMHO, though. :)",
