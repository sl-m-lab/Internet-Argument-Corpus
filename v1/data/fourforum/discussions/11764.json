   "The term \"person\" has been used in a wide variety of debates on this abortion forum. However, it is rarely addressed outside of general proclamations or dictionary definitions. In this thread, I would ask people to write down specific criteria that they personally view as defining a person and explaining why you chose that criteria and why you might reject other criteria that might have come up in discussions. \n \n Importantly, since this is a thread to explore your specific personal view on what defines a person, I would strongly urge against making blanket proclamations - either through official dictionary definitions or through statements that ones religion dictates that view. These paths have led time and again to debating quagmires, so it is best to approach it from another angle.\n \n My main goal is that we can explore the details of what makes a person and, importantly, why specifically those details are chosen. \n \n ----------------\n \n My own view of what makes a person is that the being in question should:\n 1) Be human\n 2) Have at least some rudimentary mind - i.e. some mental existence\n \n Though I have sympathy for animals, where most can suffer, many can feel emotions, etc. - I don't think that they should be treated as people. First of all, we humans would never survive as a species if we treated all animals as people, so there is an aspect of competition for survival (which we have clearly won since we first improved our hunting techniques but which we could lose if we start treating all animals as people). Second, animals cannot make a moral consensus. Nevertheless, I advocate against un-necessary mistreatment of animals and advocate for wildlife conservation.\n \n As for the second criteria of people posessing rudimentary minds, this comes from an analysis of what we are at our core. If you chop off your arm, then you will still exist as a person. You don't create two people when you chop off an arm - the arm itself is not a person, it is just part of a body. The same can be true for any part of our body. The core aspect of ourselves that we cannnot do without is our minds. At the end of life, once our minds go (ex. through massive damage to the cerebral cortex), then we as people no longer exist. Even if our bodies continue to be kept alive, they are just that - bodies with \"nobody home\". The same thing is true at the beginning of life. We don't exist as people until we exist mentally. Up to that point, the only thing that exists is a developing body that, in the future, will become a person, but not yet.",

Try again.\n\n First of all, I will answer your questions if you answer my questions. Otherwise, it would be a debate with only one side making any effort, which I will not be willing to remain in. I will answer this time.\n \n I view the beginning of personhood as the point where a human mind starts existing. The reason for this is that it is what I view as the core of ourselves -similar to the philosophical lines of \"I think, therefore I am\". Our minds are the very core of us. Take away any parts of our body and, as long as we would still be kept alive, we would exist. The only thing that we cannot exist without is our minds. After that, what is left is just a body - not a person. That is why, at the end of life, once the brain deteriorates to the point where there is \"nobody home\", people generally grudgingly accept the fact that the body should just be disconnected from life support. The same happens at the beginning of life. Prior to the third trimester, there is only a body with \"nobody home\". It is only in the third trimester when sufficient neural connections exist to allow for the possibility of a mind. Do we know for sure that there is a mind? No. But neither do we know for sure that there is a mind left near the end of life in a coma, when there are still some level of brain waves left in the cerebral cortex. In the end of life, I think that most of us would like to be given the benefit of the doubt. So, I would give the late term fetus the benefit of the doubt to say that, if it CAN have a mind, then grant it the status of personhood.\n \n As for the majority of pro-choice proponents preferring restrictions on late term abortions. The polls I have seen did not address whether or not they thought fetuses were people. However, why else do you think that so many would support late term abortion restrictions? Even Roe vs Wade speaks of the issue of personhood and how that influences the decision. In their case (written in the 70s prior to large advances in neurology), they concluded that one cannot determine that. Instead, they decided based on some third trimester restrictions based on fetal viability. \n \n Either way, even most pro-choice advocates disagree with you about 100% free access to third trimester abortions.\n \n And, once again, to remind you of the question I posed which you have still not answered:\n \n \"Please, outside of legal considerations (since this thread is not about legal stances but about fundamentals), give a REASON for why you think only born humans can be considered people - specifically in relation to the almost-born fetuses.\"\n \n I will only continue this debate if you do your part as well - it is only fair.",

   "I'm afraid that you really don't get the point.\n \n To begin, Constitutional rights are those things which are by definition beyond the reach of mere majorities. Even if the majority of people voted to make the religion of Islam illegal in this country, it could not be done. Muslims have a Constitutional right to practice their faith.\n \n Second, as a man, I do not feel that I have a right to an opinion on the abortion question simply because I am not nor have I ever been a woman.\n \n By the same token, I do not feel I have a right to an opinion as to how to perform cardiac surgery because I am not now nor have I ever been a cardiologist.\n \n There are simply certain things that are beyond our knowledge and/or experience. It's clear that no single person can claim to have all wisdom. I leave cardiac surgery to the cardiologist, and I leave the decision to whether to continue a pregnancy to the pregnant woman.\n \n I do not have the knowledge, experience, nor the expertise to intervene in either case.\n\n If there was only one sentient being involved, then I would agree with you.

It being the case that you do, why your word should be law in the universe.\n\n I think that EVERYONE has a right to an opinion on the subject. The only thing that a man would not be able to do would be to claim to know better than the pregnant woman what she was going through. \n \n If there is a murder in a family, should we just say that it is none of our business since we cannot know the details of what happened? We are a democracy after all. Every society needs laws to govern human behavior - otherwise, there would be a free-for-all of people doing only what they wanted, often at the cost of other's rights. In a Democracy, these laws are determined by a majority vote of representatives. We may not know all the details of a situation but, the great majority of the time, acts fall under certain patterns. When they don't, we rely on judges to determine the unusual cases. Similarly, where abortion in concerned, we could as a society, balanced by the justice system and its understanding of the Constitution, determine which exceptions to third trimester abortions would be allowed and which wouldn't. \n \n As for your view of my sense of power: I myself have no political power whatsoever. Whenever I state an opinion, it is just that - an opinion. My main goal in stating an opinion is to use reasoned debate to try to convince readers of the worthiness of my arguement and, hopefully, change some minds - to create larger numbers of people voting in the same direction. I don't know why you assume that stating an opinion automatically translates to playing God. When you state your opinion, does that mean that you think that - how did you put it - \"your word should be law in the universe\"?\n \n One other point I forgot to mention in the previous post - about the Constitution. Some time ago, I also believed, as you do, that the Constitution is immovable. However, based on a debate on this forum, this idea was challenged and, when I checked for myself, I found out that, indeed, if a majority is large enough, it can call for a new Constitutional Convention and reword the entire Constitution. For changing an ammendment, the majority is even smaller (ex. prohibition was an ammendment that was then rescinded).",

Your mistake was to jump to a conclusion that you thought you saw in the post instead of what was really there.\n\n My point two said nothing about a higher level of mind.

Pro-choice typically encompasses a much wider range than pro-life but, surprisingly, pro-life has a wider distribution than one would expect.\n \n Often, especially lately, the debaters in the abortion forum seem to fall into two categories - (1) pro-choice proponents (such as yourself) that view a woman's right over her body as tantamount, surpassing all other considerations - including any fetal rights, and (2) pro-life proponents that view that all abortions should be outlawed except for a few exceptions (typically, risk to mothers life, and rape and incest).\n \n What is not evident from this distribution is that the distribution of views in the US in general is more varied. A poll that I often quote on this forum shows that 84% of Americans would keep third trimester abortions generally illegal (minus the usual exceptions), 68% would keep second trimester abortions generally illegal, and 66% would allow first trimester abortions to be generally legal (from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm, CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3. ). Earlier polls by Gallup showed very similar trends. There are two significant points that I take out of this. First is that, with 84% of Americans supporting third trimester restrictions, this would include the majority of pro-choice advocates (this is where I place myself as well). The other significant point which is more surprising is that, with 66% allowing first trimester abortions, this would include a minority of self-proclaimed pro-life proponents. As a side note, these trends appear to be similar in other developed countries as well - in most of Europe, second and third trimester abortions are largely restricted but first trimester abortions are allowed on demand.\n \n Anyway, that means that I do consider myself pro-choice but, not being fully pro-choice but allowing third trimester restrictions, I do often find myself arguing both sides.\n \n As for actual pro-life proponents that are reasonable debaters, I have had many good debates with Steeeeve, as well as occasional good debates with Jyoshu. I am sure that there are others that I am forgetting at the moment. However, the better pro-life debaters haven't been too active lately so I can understand why you get this impression.\n \n As for gansao and other like him, I have encountered enough of that sort of attitude that it doesn't leave me in lingering frustration. I generally have my say against their attitude and, if they continue it, then I generally give up on them. I do try to give flamers a chance, though, since I have encountered various situations where someone who starts off as a flamer can become a reasonable debater if they find that you are not flaming back (so they cool down enough to actually debate). Nevertheless, this obviously does not work with everyone.\n \nOne other thing, my mother is currently dying from late stage Alzheimer's. While she is clearly not the same person that she once was, she is still a person. She just has reduced capacity. \n\n I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I always imagined how tragic it would be if a loved one developed Alzheimer's - especially at a late stage when they no longer remember you or your history together. I suppose that, at that stage, one approaches it as making a sacrifice to care for or at least occasionally emotionally support the loved one for who they once were, not as much for who they are at the moment. They may not be the same person, but they still have emotions - can hurt or be happy, etc. The friend of the family's that had late stage Alzheimer's still lived with his wife, who had a lot of trouble caring for him and, understandibly, had lost a lot of the love she once had for him and, therefore, would rarely show him affection. When we showed him some affectionate friendliness, he very much lit up. Though he couldn't talk or communicate in other ways and though his reasoning skills were either minimal or nil, it was so clear that he still had a mind - limited as it was to a more rudimentary level of emotion and reaction to physical environment.\n \nThank you for this thread. Hopefully boths sides will be able to learn something new from it ;)\n\n Thanks, that was my goal. I think it is important to try to approach the question of abortion rights from fresh new perspectives.",

It is the very ability for people to be able to interact with the world that helps to keep them alive.\n\n How about the example of coma? When we are in coma, we do not interact with the world. Also, fetuses at their late stage can interact with the world that they experience - the very limited world within their womb. Experiments have been performed on fetuses to stimulii - showing various reactions, not necessarily just reflex reactions. \n \nAlso your definition of Pro-Choice I believe is incorrect. Pro-Choice has actually very little to do with abortion and more to do with what this country was founded on, which is freedom of choice. Ask any Pro-Choicer and they will tell you that their decision regarding the ability to be able to decide for themselves spans in every aspect of their life, not just with pregnant women.\n\n From that poll, only about 10% of those surveyed thought that abortion should be always legal in the third trimester (i.e. presumably then this is the percentage that share your view that abortion should be always legal). Under your definition, that would mean that only 10% of Americans are pro-choice - as compared to the <~50% that currently claim to fall under that category.\n \nSorry, that poll is too old for me :)\n\n It is only 2003. That's only 5 years old. Since earlier polls gave pretty much the same numbers, it suggests that now, in 2008, the numers should also be similar. Either way, there are very few polls that address abortion rights based on trimester or, otherwise, on the fetus's state of development.

It also applies to medical advances.\n That would be tragic for the person in a coma if they were actually aware of their surroundings (as opposed to being in a deep sleep state). Imagine yourself in that situation. Either way, I would be surprised if most comas allow people to have a sense of their surroundings. My understanding is that they don't experience REM patterns (no inner story going on), and generally don't remember any input afterwards. Perhaps, as with sleep, there are phases of coma that are closer to awareness and phases that are deeper.\n \nNot true.

In a fetus, nerve connections need to first become established between two parts of its brain: the cortex and the thalamus. This only starts to happen around 26 weeks from conception.\n\n I have read the summary of the report of the Royal College of Obstetricians and this conclusion is only relevant for early term fetuses - i.e. prior to the third trimester when sufficient cortical connections have been made to enable the experience of pain, as well as enabling other mental processes. You yourself mention that 26 weeks is significant as a starting point for these processes. Remember, I am not arguing for abortion restrictions in all trimesters. I am only arguing for abortion restrictions in the third trimester directly because of this possibility of a mental existence - possibility of thoughts, emotions, sensation of pain, etc.\n \nAgain, even though I am all for Pro-Choice and I would love to use this poll, I cannot because it is simply too old. I wouldn't trust a poll on this topic if it was more than two years old. Things change in this country far too fast.\n\n There are things in this country that do change quickly - technology, influence of large political events, etc. However, poll after poll shows that social attitudes take much longer to change. Look at any of the abortion polls ranging from the 90s to today. Pollingreport.com/abortion has a wide range. There has been very little shift in the number of people who view themselves as pro-life vs pro-choice. So, your claim that the poll is too old is based on a false assumption that social attitudes change quickly. They don't.\n \nYes, I find mankind to be rather arrogant about things from time to time.

We, as humans, have come an enormous way for sure, and we are certainly great in certain situations, but ultimately something as small as a nerve cell can wipe out everything that we once were.\n\n Yes, we are vulnerable. However, the great majority of time (at least prior to old age, and in peaceful developed countries in reasonably good neighborhoods), we can count on the fact that these things that make us vulnerable won't happen. So, I don't think we need to go around in fear about such events. We just need to prepare as well as possible - through research, etc. - to address the events if they do happen.\n \nYes they have made some progress in this area. Mustard helps to prevent this plaque from forming which is why they feel the country of India has such a low rate of Alzheimer's as compared to the rest of the world.\n\n That's good to know.
