   "I believe that many others who are not happy with gays \"flaunting\" our sexuality in their faces have never stopped to watch, see, or listen to how many times heterosexuality is flaunted in the faces of gay people.\n \n I did some TV watching between 7pm and 8pm last night and this is what I saw.\n \n Wheel of fortune 7pm to 730pm\n \n All three contestants were asked about their families and they answered with both wife and kids or in the case of the woman her husband and kids. Pat mentioned his wife, and there was one sub commercial with him and his wife having subs. Then there was the back drop they had a camera over looking the park and there were numerous hetero couples holding hands while walking.\n \n The commercials\n Chase bank had a 2 part commercial. 1st part showing a pregnant women getting up to stand arm and arm with her husband while they watched the remodel of their house. The 2nd part was a restaurant filled with male, female couples I would say 20 to 30 hetero couples. This commercial was shown twice.\n A v8 commercial with a hetero family around a table.\n \n An IHOP commercial showing a hetero couple at a table before some big pancake fell on the table.\n \n \n \n Jeopardy from 730pm to 8pm\n \n I was very impressed with the neutrality of the show and the commercials for the majority of the program. None of the 3 contestants were asked about family. The only clue to deal with heterosexual lifestyle was a question about The Dick and Jane books.\n \n The commercials\n I was impressed by the commercials they were all product specific and either showed or were where you could not tell the sexual orientation of the people involved. Even the cereal commercial showing a son and his father. The father could have been part of a male male couple.\n I was impressed with the commercials up until the last 5 min of the program, then it was full blown heterosexuality.\n \n Altell and the wizard family\n IHOP commercial again 2 times\n Activon and this one Was though out the program but it wasn't until the last part of the show that I noticed that it featured, in the bottom right hand corner, a man and a woman sitting on a hill.\n A local commercial for a mattress retailer that was ok until at the end they showed a hetero couple in bed together.\n GNC had this older hetero couple with him looking over her shoulder while she showed the product.\n The worst offender was the very last commercial It was a state travel commercial for Illinois It showed several hetero couples with children in their arms in various parks playing. At the end of the commercial was a woman that took a mans hand as they walked down a street.\n \n All of this was in just one hour. No where did I see anything gay, or anything that could be considered gay. So before anyone thinks that gays are in your face stop to look at your own glass house.",

   "If you were a corporation and wanted to sell to 90% of the population, who are you going to market your product to? Do you see many Asians, Amazonia tribesman, or even Native Americans in commercials? The fact of the matter is corporations target the majority demographic, and the majority is hetero. \n \n If you want to argue \"flaunting\", consider public displays of affections. Hetero's kissing and groping each other in public (ie. bus stops, malls, restaurants, parks, etc). Even as a hetero, I don't want to see dry humping in public. emoticon_xdonno \n \n Good luck to you.",

They are quite fine with the depiction of hetero families, hetero kissing, or hetero pdas shown on televison. Let one non pdaing gay couple be shown, say buing furniture, then that gay couple is flaunting. The anti gay do not undersand that heterosexuality is flaunted in the faces of gay people everyday, this is why I sat and closely watched, and made notes, on these two programs.\n \n Companies can show what they are selling and marketing without the use of sexual orientation. Art Van, was a great example. The commercial showed the spokesman and the furniture that they were selling.",
