   "I was up late last night just sitting on the couch thinking about a lot of stuff and I thought about my great-grandmother who just recently passed away this last September. She had live to be almost 94 years old, being born in 1911. Since I've taken like 4 credits of history in High school already I'm amazed at how rapid technology has grown. We have gone from cart and buggy to drafting plans for hotels in space, Hilton/Ritz Carlton, a lunar base in works and deep space satellites. A new wave of technology is about to come out, nanotechnology, according to a friend of mine who is study in California right now and so much more. We can hold a Playstation in our hands which would have seemed ridiculous to anyone 20 years ago. I wonder how are lives will be in another 20 years, since the past 18 years of mine have been so dynamic. So this is just a ramble about the past and future I guess, what do you think we'll live to see? Such as the past decades saw us walk on the moon and so forth....",

   "I agree with all of you. Things never really change. I do believe currency is going to disappear, which to me that is a big worry. You know how easy it will be to manipulate the general populace. You'll have nothing to barter for, no coins or cash. Sure it seems more economical and more efficient, but what happens when there comes a time if the people ever need to revolt? Once the government has clutched their claws around every business and person will it ever be possible to shake free?....I don't know...I had a long weekend....It does worry me though.",

If the government wanted, they could easily just change the value and/or the apperance of the bills and coins if they wanted to get rid of your savings. Your dollars don`t have an objective value. If you want to prepare for revolution/tyranny, save your money in gold or something else that could still be used for bartering with foreign nations/individuals/organisations.",
