   "Here ya go EZ.. here's a bit of \"TRUTH\" for you. Can't tell me Religion is not dangerous. I realize that not All religious people are like this, but this will show anyone who is interested why religion should be wiped off the face of this planet. And don't even try to quote scripture to avoid the subject, there is no justification for this. \n \n Religious exemption from state child abuse and neglect laws is due in large part to federal regulations adopted subsequent to enactment of the \"Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974.\" The Act established federal standards and financial support for implementing state child abuse prevention, reporting, and treatment programs. The Act provided federal financial assistance to states for operating child abuse programs, provided that the states complied with federal standards.Unfortunately, as a result of lobbying by the Christian Science Church, the regulation that implemented the law required the states, as a condition of receiving federal assistance, to grant an exception...which provides that a parent or guardian who does not provide medical treatment to a child because of the parent's religious beliefs is not considered, for that reason alone, to be a negligent parent or guardian. \n \n Seth Ian Glaser, 17 months, died March 28, 1984, in Culver City, California of h-flu meningitis (bacterial meningitis). The parents used only a Christian Science \"practitioner\" and obtained no medical care for Seth.\n \n Natalie Rippberger, eight months, died December 9, 1984 in Santa Rosa, California, of h-flu meningitis. The parents, Mark and Susan Rippberger, had retained a Christian Science practitioner for spiritual \"treatment\" but would not get essential medical care for their daughter.\n \n Shauntay Walker, age four, died March 8, 1984, in Sacramento, California, of h-flu meningitis. Shauntay was home sick from her pre-school for 17 days. She received no medical care, only Christian Science \"care.\" \n \n Amy Hermanson, age seven, died September 30, 1986, in Sarasota, Florida, of untreated juvenile onset diabetes. Her parents refused to provide her with necessary medical care.\n \n Ian Lundman, age 11, died May 9, 1989, in Minneapolis, Minnesota of medically untreated juvenile onset diabetes. His mother and stepfather, as Christian Scientists, had the boy treated by a church practitioner instead of a medical doctor. Ian died in a diabetic coma.\n \n Ian Burdick, age 15, died November 10, 1987, in Sherman Oaks, California, of diabetes without medical care. At his death Ian was 5'8\" tall and weighed 87 pounds. A Christian Science nurse and practitioner had been retained to treat Ian's disease.\n \n Kimberly Sartore, age one, died in 1969 in Alaska of medically untreated meningitis. Kimberly's father was charged with and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. However, the conviction was overturned when the Alaskan legislature passed a religious exemption law, and the conviction was expunged from Mr. Sartore's record.\n \n Matthew Swan, 16 months, died in 1977 in Detroit, Michigan, of h-flu meningitis. The parents had retained Christian Science practitioners to treat Matthew.\n \n Lisa Sheridan, age five, died in 1967 in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, after a three week battle with pneumonia without medical care. Lisa received Christian Science prayer treatment over the entire course of her illness. Lisa's mother was tried and convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n \n Michael Schram, age 12, from Mercer Island, Washington, died in 1979 from a ruptured appendix after several days of prayer and \"spiritual healing.\" Michael received no medical attention because his mother is a Christian Scientist.\n \n \n Ronald Rowan, age 11, from Tallmadge, Ohio, died in 1979 as a result of extreme dehydration and ultimately aspiration asphyxiation. The medical examiner concluded that Ronald had to have been seriously ill for at least a week; he must have been running a fever and vomiting several days before his death. He was too weak to expel vomitus from his mouth and was asphyxiated. Ronald did not receive medical care because his parents are members of the Christian Science Church.\n \n Andrew Pinkham, age three, from Orinda, California, died from pneumonia after his parents refused to take him to a doctor because of their religious beliefs. Andrew's symptoms were described as six days of fever, loss of appetite, and in the last day, labored and rapid breathing. During these six days, Andrew's parents and a Christian Science practitioner prayed at his bedside.\n \n Five children of the Winterbourne family of suburban Philadelphia died of pneumonia between 1971 and 1980 without receiving medical attention. Roger Winterbourne, the father, stated: \"When you believe in something, you have to believe it all the way. If you only believe in it part way, it's not a true belief.\"\n \n Michael David Boehmer, four days old, died March 15, 1990, in Lake City, Florida, of a pulmonary hemorrhage. The parents did not obtain medical attention for their son, stating that they believed doctors should be avoided. They relied on prayer to heal their baby.\n \n \n Jason Lockhart, age nine, of Enid Oklahoma, died of a ruptured appendix due to parental religious beliefs. Parents, Dean and Patsy Lockhart, in December 1982, were acquitted of first degree manslaughter because of Oklahoma's religious exemption law.\n \n Jordan Northrup, age four months, died January 1991 in Redding, California, of meningitis and pneumonia.

On September 19, 1991, they were charged with involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment.\n \n Juliana Keys, six months, of Columbia City, Indiana, died of an untreated abdominal infection caused by a twisted bowel.

The parents, David and Joy Winkelman, stated their belief: \"that the best physician is Jesus.\"\n \n Read the full stories and more here ...\n \n Massachusetts Citizens for Children - Exemption Laws Lead to Cruel Deaths, Mislead Parents",

And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said, \"If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.\" ... Mark 5:24-29 \n \n Here's a few scriptures that you whacko Christian believers choose to interpret and use to Justify allowing an innocent child to die waiting for a prayer.",

   "That's seriously sickening. Any parent who doesn't give their children proper medical care needs to be neutered and have their kids taken away (as well as be tried for crimes). That guy who let 5 of his kids die of pneumonia is just unbelievably terrible.\n \n This isn't a matter of if they 'interpreted the scripture correctly.' Even you, EZ, have stated that you believed in the faith healing of that fraud Benny Hinn, and I know someone in my family who died of cancer had Christians come over and 'lay hands on her' toward the end when there was nothing more doctors could do to help her. As long as there is religion, people will believe in garbage like faith healing and other pseudo scientific alternative medicines that do nothing but bad things. And EZ, if you believe that there are faith healers that work through God and can cure cancer, why would you ever want or need to go to a doctor for treatments like chemo? \n \n I'm usually for keeping the government out of things, but there needs to be a law to protect the kids who are born to nutjobs like this.",

From what I have been able to find since I found this article currently 43 states out of the 50 have all passed what they call \"Religious exemption\" Laws. Some people who had previously been convicted have even been set free and cleared after these laws were past. If our Government is ignorant enough to pass such a law what chance do any of us really have....",
