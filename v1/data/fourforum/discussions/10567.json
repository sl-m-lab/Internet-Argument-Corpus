   "Gay Enclaves Face Prospect of Being Pass\u00e9\n \n The story starts off by reporting that this year's Halloween street celebration in San Francisco's Castro district has been cancelled, mostly owing to security concerns, but it goes on to discuss the future of urban gay enclaves as the gentrification pioneers get replaced by wealthy straight couples. More and more gays are moving elsewhere, to other districts and centers, and it's no longer the case that only a tiny handful of large cities have gay communities.\n \n While there has to be nostalgia for the passing of such gay cultural crucibles, especially for us older gays to whom they were crucially important, it's not necessarily a bad thing in the larger perspective. Perhaps it's more akin to growing up, and putting aside one's childhood before moving on. It should be symbolic of greater acceptance, at least outside the fanatical religious communities.\n \n However, along with the nostalgia there is a sense of community loss:\n \n \nWhich is why the cancellation of the Halloween party by the city has provoked such a sense of loss. Many residents say that their night has been taken away. \"It's proof that whatever sense of safety we have is incredibly tenuous, \" Mr. Newsome said.\n \n The city is shutting down public transportation to the Castro on Halloween and has begun a Web site, homeforhalloween.com, that lists \"fun\" alternatives, including a Halloween blood drive and a \"Monster Bash\" - in San Mateo.\n\n \n There is, of course, another way of looking at it:\n \n \nOn a recent Saturday, Sister Roma, a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an activist coterie of drag queens, sashayed down Castro Street in heavy eye shadow and a gold lam\u00e9 top. Though she looked well prepared for Halloween, she said she planned to be in hiding that night.\n \n She wasn't feeling too deprived, however.\n \n \"Sweetie,\" she said, \"every day is Halloween in the Castro.\"\n",

   "For the last 10 years, the only gay enclave I've spent time in is Provincetown, MA, but it too, is undergoing change, and much of the change is connected to the cost of real estate in the area. It is so expensive, that most gay people can no longer afford a piece of the pie. I feel fortunate to at least own two weeks of timeshare there, even if it is off season timeshare.",

   "There is always an ebb and tide in gay neighborhoods. I've seen too often when gays move in and clean up a mess, then come the baby carriages and pilates studios. It happened in the Castro; In NYC the West Village and now Chelsea. In LA, it happened in the Silverlake area, then many gays moved to Echo Park and the same thing is happening. \n \n Personally, I've never liked living in a gayborhood myself. I certainly enjoy visiting though! There's always another area. Where life is certainly better for homosexuals in the US, it is by far a consistently friendly place outside of gay suburbia. It's just the next gay enclave hasn't been discovered yet.",

Currently, I'm out in the boondocks of Scotland well away from the gayborhoods of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the lack of amenities oriented towards gays is depressing. Only two gayish pubs in the whole of Dundee, and not even a bookstore with more than a token shelf devoted to gay lit.\n \n There's a lot to be said for the critical commercial mass afforded by a gayborhood, so I anticipate that while they might spread and become more diffuse and diverse, as long as there is a call for a discrete gay identity and culture, they aren't going to go away entirely because of the amenities their concentration can offer that simply aren't available in the burbs.\n \n I can't see the call for such an identity going away soon, if the sort of anti-gay dreck we see regularly posted on these boards is anything to go by.",

   "Nice Op Ed. http://www.tomahjournal.com/articles/2007/11/01/opinion/03rundiocolumn.txt\n \n \nNot long ago on a Sunday morning talk show, conservative columnist George Will described his daughter's reaction to homosexuality. It was no big deal to her -- sort of like being lefthanded.\n \n Welcome to the new mainstream view of sexual orientation.\n \n In the battle over gay rights, the rout is on, and acceptance of gays and lesbians is winning. It was the losing side gathered at the Oct. 18 Tomah School Board meeting to protest diversity workshops over worries that a student might accidentally hear someone say something nice about a homosexual. What confronted the Tomah School Board wasn't a groundswell of majority support, it was a dwindling minority howling in pain. They sense a growing majority of Americans have no problem whatsoever with gays and lesbians among us, and it's confirmed by the polls.\n \n Without burying readers in polling data, I'll offer just this one: In June 1982, Gallup asked, \"Do you feel that homosexuality should be considered an acceptable alternative lifestyle or not?\" Back then, 34 percent said yes, 51 percent said no. Gallup asked the same question in May 2005, and the results were 54 percent yes, 41 percent no.\n \n Not only is anti-gay sentiment receding from the American mainstream, it's receding from the conservative mainstream. Remember when the mere mention of homosexuals fired up the conservative base? Not anymore. Go ahead and read websites like the National Review and Redstate.com. The biggest conservative blogs, where national security is the big issue, will go for days or weeks without mentioning homosexuality. Maybe \"Islamofascism\" is why.\n \n Putting the Iraq war fiasco aside, conservative bloggers are hardly wrong when they react to fundamentalist Islam with alarm and disgust. One of its toxic features is a medieval view of homosexuality. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a card-carrying Axis of Evil member, came to the United States and bragged that there are no homosexuals in his country (strict laws against it over there). Conservatives certainly know it's awkward to condemn radical Islam while embracing radical Islam's view of gay rights.\n \n What remains of the anti-gay movement faces another obstacle -- straights who come to know gays as friends and acquaintances. Sentiment in favor of gay rights (anti-discrimination laws, civil unions, etc.) is highest among those who have a gay friend or family member. They don't see the stereotypical drag queen in a gay rights parade; they witness gays who seamlessly blend into their communities and seek caring, stable, long-term relationships. It has finally dawned on public opinion that there's something bizarre about religious activists who express more fear and loathing over monogamous gays than promiscuous straights.\n \n Even the last vestiges of discrimination -- bans on gay marriage and service in the military -- appear doomed. Republican-leaning (and staunchly libertarian) Arizona was the first state in the country to reject a gay marriage ban last fall, and the Wisconsin gay marriage ban that passed the same day was still opposed by a solid majority of voters under 30 (these same voters may someday lead the amendment's repeal). As for gays in the military, a growing number of military personnel believe it's insane to fire badly needed Arabic translators simply because they're gay.\n \n Ultimately, the debate over gays isn't about diversity, it's about logic. If it's wrong to insult, ostracize or assault a person because he or she is black, it's wrong to insult, ostracize or assault a person because he or she is gay, and the distinction between immutability and behavior doesn't make a bit of difference. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a monogamous homosexual involved a loving, lifetime relationship. Twenty-five years ago, that was a radical statement. Today, it's what most of us believe.\n",
