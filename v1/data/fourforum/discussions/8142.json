McCARTHY \n News Political Reporter\n 5/18/2006 \n \n \n \n \nDespite being a freshman congressman, Rep. Brian Higgins has not been shy about rocking the boat.\n \n For more than half a century, politicians around Buffalo moaned, groaned and griped about tolls on the Niagara Thruway. \n But when Rep. Brian Higgins last month threatened to withhold federal money from the state Thruway Authority, the debate suddenly became serious. Two gubernatorial candidates even promised to wipe out the Black Rock and Ogden Street toll barriers if elected next year. \n \n That wasn't all. The freshman Democrat from South Buffalo raised a furor when the New York Power Authority offered Buffalo a minuscule relicensing settlement. He then helped bring home a $279 million deal - three times the original offer. \n \n And while waterfront development advocates complained for years about the Skyway, it was Higgins' voice that finally prompted state transportation officials at least to listen. \n \n There's no question that the rookie congressman with blue-collar roots and a Harvard education gets results. \n \n So why does Higgins feud with his Western New York colleagues in Congress? \n \n Why do some mock him as \"the best state legislator\" in Washington? \n \n And why would an audience of local liberals boo him on a national radio program? \n \n It's a result of what he calls his impatience with the status quo. \n \n \"That wasn't the plan,\" Higgins said, \"but it's the consequence of taking on the tough issues.\" \n \n \n \n \n <snip<\n \n \n Now, I'm normally not fond of Democrats, but this guy seems alot like my favorite mayor, James D. Griffin. Brash, bold and an \"I don't care what the 'establishment' says.\" personality that send chills up the establishment's spine.emoticon_xgood",
