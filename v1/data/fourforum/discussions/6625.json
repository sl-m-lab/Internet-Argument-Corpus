   "I honestly never got into chess. I think I tried to once and who ever was telling me about it just got me loss. How you can accurately move your pawn (not to mention the correct pawn) on the board from one square to a completely different one and everything was just awkward in my head. Now checkers, I can understand. You can only move to an adjacent square. All pieces of one color are equal unless one is kinged. It seemed to me at one time that chess and checkers were the same game in a way but that one was sort of a poor-man's version of the other.
