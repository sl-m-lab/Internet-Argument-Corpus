   "http://cobbtown.comThe latest governmental overreach concerns college football. That's right; our political representatives in Washington DC want to get seriously involved in a game played by college kids. The United States Congress wants to interject politics into the National Collegiate Athletic Association's process for deciding which teams get the chance to compete in post-season \"bowl games\". Texas Republican House Representative Joe Barton, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said of the Bowl Championship Series, \"The current system of determining who's No. 1 appears deeply flawed\", and added \"College football is not just an exhilarating sport, but a billion-dollar business that Congress cannot ignore.\"\n \n It wasn't enough that Congress decided they should meet Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Jose Canseco to air out the dirty laundry of Major League Baseball. It is apparent that this committee has no bigger fish to fry in these trying economic times. When the rest of us are concerned about how much of our money is being sent back to Tijuana and Mexico City, how many American jobs are being lost to illegal aliens named Pedro and Jose, and how many industries have decided to outsource the remaining jobs to Guatemala, Joe-Bob from Texas wants to tie up an American Congressional committee to discuss the subversive reasons that Po-Dunk State could not get a bowl invitation to Orlando, Florida.\n \n Excuse me, Joseph, but exactly where in the Constitution did James Madison or one of his peers hide the power of Congress to schedule football games for state universities? And just one more thing, Barton ole chap, does Cynthia from El Paso, working two low-paying jobs to feed her family while unable to sleep at night because violent crime is ever increasing, think that you are wasting her over-taxed checks on insignificant matters? My guess is that Cynthia from El Paso and James Madison would both think that Mr. Joe-Bob Barton is an idiot for completely different reasons. I would agree with either of them.",
