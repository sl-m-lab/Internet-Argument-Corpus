   "Why do you believe that? Did you order televangelist doomsday prophets Jack and Rexella Van Impe's video?\n \n Jack and Rexella Van Impe\n \n \n FLASH! \n Ig Nobel Winners for Astrophysics \n for 2001\n For Astrophysics: Dr. Jack and Rexella Van Impe, Jack Van Impe Ministries, Rochester Hills, Michigan. For their discovery that black holes fulfill all the technical requirements to be the location of Hell.\n \n \n \n \n These two come very close to the top of the mushroom pile with a severe case of diarrhea of the mouth, it is really amazing how two people could talk for a half hour and not say anything. The doomsday prophets, as I like to call them, use the scare tactics to frighten the living bejesus (do not excuse the pun) out of people, my favorite was the grocery scanner, they claimed that it was definitely the sign of the end times because the scanner will be used to scan the mark of the beast, 666, found on either our forehead or hand. Maybe Jack and Rexella should think about getting a brain scan, although the doctors may have to charge a finders fee. The bottom line for all these types of people is getting money out of the gullible and easily frighten, looking at a recent copy of a magazine put out by Jack and his cronies called PERHAPS TODAY, May/June 1998 issue, I totaled up all the request for \"gifts, a.k.a money\" to purchase products to help you get your soul into heaven, here is the list below: \n \n \n PRODUCT COST/GIFT CAN $ COST/GIFT US $ \n Video, Armageddon $29.95 $24.95 \n Video, 1999? Global March to Israel $29.95 $24.95 \n Video, Left Behind: The Final Warning $29.95 $24.95 \n Video, The Complete Guide to the Future. $29.95 $24.95 \n Video, America in Prophecy $24.95 $19.95 \n Book, 50th Anniversary book $35.00 $30.00 \n Video, The Rapture $29.95 $24.95 \n Video, Apocalypse Code by Hal Lindsey. See The Bible code, Fact or Fiction? $29.95 $24.95 \n Video set, Revelation revealed $84.95 $69.95 \n Video, Angels: Mysterious Strangers among Us. $34.95 $29.95 \n Book, Secrets of a fulfilled Woman. (More like a fulfilled bank account.) $20.00 $15.00 \n Video, The Evolution Conspiracy $24.95 $19.95 \n Video, Peter and Paul $59.95 $49.95 \n Video, The Bible $180.00 $150.00 \n GRAND TOTAL $644.45 $534.45 \n \n So there you have it folks, for a small gift of $644.45 Canadian, Jack and Rexella can help to get your soul into heaven, english translation \" mansions, Rolls Royce, servants and facelifts are very expensive, please send us money.\" Remember, this is just for one issue every two months, so over a year it could cost you upwards of $3866.70 Canadian to keep your soul out of hell. \n You would think that after the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker, Oral Roberts (send me 10 million or the lord will take me home) and Jimmy Swaggart fiasco, these people would be off the air, but until we as a society learn to critically analyze claims, we will continue to be fooled by people like Jack and Rexella, and that is MY OPINION. \n \n It is now the middle of the year 2000, and after listening to these two people preaching about the end of times and how the Y2K and the solar storms were surely the sign of the end times, and it was just a matter of time before we are swept up into the murderous arm of a deity called god. Well Jack, I had the pleasure of watching you squirm, and in my opinion lie about what you said. Before Y2K came and went without a hitch, you were harping on how this was a sign of the end times, almost every JVI show in the year 1999 mentioned Y2K. You then had the audacity in your very first show after Y2K, when you realise that the world is still here and that you were wrong, to say that I never said that the second coming was nigh and down played your reliance on Y2K as a sign of the end times. Well what can you expect from a person who makes his living convincing other people that he can help save them from an imaginary hell where an imaginary loving god will send them if they do not follow his rules and send money. Hey Jack, what do you eat with crow?\n http://www.valleyskeptic.com/mushro%7e1.htm#impe",
