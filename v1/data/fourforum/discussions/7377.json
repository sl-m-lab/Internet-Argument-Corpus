Now, in East Amherst, NY; the town board voted to table a proposal that would have a new SuperCenter on Millersport Highway (just off of Interstate 990) by New Road.

   "A look at Wal Mart is a glance at Americas future and people do not like it. The majority of items that Wal Mart sells are made in China. Their import policy has been so severe that a conservative estimate by the Economic Polic Institute puts the number of US jobs lost to China as a direct result of those policies at \"over 1 million\".\n \n Wal mart strong arms their US suppliers as well. Every one of their US suppliers has cut benifits and wages in order to remain competitive with the imports. \n \n This upsets people. Unfortunatly, Wal Mart deals in reality. That is how they got to be #1. The value of a specific good is predicated by the lowest possible acquisition price. American consumers are so busy trying to pretend they are still affluent that they have no problem buying lower quality goods if they can save a few bucks. The quality of competitve imports, such as electronics, has risen to the point that only an utter fool would spend the extra money for an American made unit. \n \n When US television makers took the Chinese to the WTO with charges of dumping televisions on the US market, Wal Mart waded in on the side of the Chinese. They eventually lost, but they managed to muddy the water and delay long engouh that only 2 US television manufacturers managed to stay in business. \n \n In the end, it is not Wal Marts fault. They put items on the shelf. It is the American consumer that made them #1.",

They are just not jumping to the rediculous levels that American and European workers are accustomed to. the golden years are over as far as worker wages are concerned. Technology has mitigated the need for a highly educated workforce. Now a nation only needs a relatively small pool of intelligencia to support a large number of production workers. US companies figured this out years ago and started building factories in the third world. Very little production line work qualifies as skilled labor. Even automotive line work no longer qualifies. I can give you a local example of this. \n \n Modine manufacturing employed roughly 350 local workers at their factory here, not including management. Of those 350 workers, only about 25 workend in truly skilled positions, and their jobs were primarily tech jobs...keeping the production apparatus up and running. It does not take any real amount of intelligence or education to feed copper tubing into a coiling machine or set compressor impellers on a shaft. The average wage for a produciton employee there was $18.50 per hour plus benifits, taxes, workmans comp, etc... In total they were looking at an average hourly cost for these guys of about $32\n \n They doubled the pay of their skilled workers as an incentive to move to Mexico. Then they hired mexican locals to do the unskilled labor. At their new plant in mexico, their average wage is $6 per hour, and with taxes, workmans comp, etc.. their average hourly cost is still only $10.\n \n I know that we are all supposed to believe that technological advances in production actually creats jobs, but if that was true, the cost of ownership for technologically advanced production machinery would be cost prohibitive, beutralizing the benifit. Where they fudge that little calcualtion is by considering the people who built the machinery as \"jobs created\". That is a 1 time expense, though. For the purposes of the ob creation formula, the minute the machine is done, they become unemployed. \n \n \nIts because Walmart is being the very beacon of capitilism rather than considering the welfare of its workers, and China is trying to improve itself finincially (which I suppose it does need to before it can focus on permanant improvements in quality of life) that this is a problem.\n\n \n OOOHHHH, the true capitalist formula. While in theory capitalism provides the highest quality good at the lowest possible price, and the highest posible wages for a given position, in the real world what capitalism provides is the lowest permissible quality good at the highest permissible price, and on the labor side provides the lowest acceptable wage.",

The official Xinhua news agency reported last year that Wu's liver had been damaged.\n \n The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said Wu underwent a liver transplant two years ago.\n \n A newspaper colleague on Tuesday confirmed Wu's death but declined to provide details.\n \n \"The death of our colleague after he was brutally assaulted for his work is a cruel reminder of the new dangers faced by Chinese journalists,\" Committee to Protect Journalists executive director Ann Cooper said in a statement.\n \n \"The government must ensure the safety of the working press. This begins by bringing to justice the attackers of Wu Xianghu.\"\n \n Senior traffic police officer Li Xiaoguo was sacked for his role in the incident, Xinhua reported at the time.\n \n Li had demanded an apology which led to an argument with Wu at the newspaper office. He then summoned colleagues to the scene.\n \n The Taizhou city government spokesman said no charges had been brought against anyone involved in the attack.",
