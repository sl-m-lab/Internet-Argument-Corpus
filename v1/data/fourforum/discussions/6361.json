   "I find nothing that Jesus said about \"the triune God\". I did hear him when he said:Mk:12:29: The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: What is your position on the triune God? For my edification, please site the words of Jesus that support your position.\n\n \n The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people (and possibly for Howard Beale), the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Numbers 13:23, it speaks of a \"cluster\" of grapes. The word \"cluster\" is again the Hebrew word echad. Obviously, this singular cluster of grapes consisted of more than one grape.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid.  It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union.",

   "Jesus Must Be God  \n \n John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). \n \n In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, \"Who is the Rock except our God\"? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. \n \n Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that \"all things were created by Him and for him\". Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. \n \n In Jeremiah 10:10 it says \"the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God\". I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the \"true God\". Jesus must be the true God.\n \n Isaiah 43:10,11 says that \"I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior.\n \n Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows \"all things.\" (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be \"snatched\" out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's voice is \"like the roar of rushing waters\" (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus' \"voice was like the sound of rushing waters\" (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus' nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n Jehovah is the only God we are to \"serve\"(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a).\n \n Jehovah's glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovah's glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n God's name is Jehovah (or Yahweh-YHWH - Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovah's name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"mighty God\" (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the \"mighty God\" \n (Isaiah 9:6) who is \"Almighty\" (Revelation 1:7-8).\n \n Jehovah is \"the first and the last\" (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the \"first and the last\" (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's title is \"the Holy One\" (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is \"the Holy One\" (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One.\n \n Jehovah is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n \n Jehovah is the great \"shepherd\" who leads his people to \"the spring of the water of life\" (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the \"shepherd\" of His people, leads them \"to springs of the water of life\" (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD --John 10:16.\n \n Jehovah is \"Lord of Lords\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is \"Lord of Lords.\" (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is \"Lord of all.\" (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) .\n \n Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n http://witforjesus.org/jehovahs_witness/online/tj_jcam.php#footnote2b, etc.",

(Compliments Compton's Interactive Bible)\n \n Jesus, Lord God of the Sabbath - Mark Chapter 2 \n It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. The Pharisees said to him, \"Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?\" He said to them, \"Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him? How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?\" He said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\" Judaism teaches that there was only one Lord of the Sabbath - God Himself.

   "The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation, there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n Considering the aforementioned evidence, we can only conclude that Holy Spirit is a living person (diety), who possesses the same intellectual and creative attributes as Almighty God.",

You are completely wrong about Judaism's teachings on the Sabbath. There is no \"Lord of the Sabbath\". The Torah is not a Tolkien Trilogy. Jesus clearly says that the Sabbath was made for man and that the son of man is lord of the Sabbath. In the original Greek the term \"son of man\" is not capitalized.

Deut.6:13) Jesus has authority over Satan.\n Direct quotes of Jesus concerning His Deity:\n John 8:58; 17:5, and v.24; Mt.28:18, Lk 22:37, Jn 14:1- 28.\n Read the passages surrounding these verses. This method of study is called hermeneutics. Who is the author, what is the aothur saying, what is the environment/culture of the time. I think you'll get a much better perspective of who God is when you use this method of study.

If you do wish to discuss Mr. Strobel's work, I will insist that we go chapter by chapter. For instance, his first chapter (actually spanning 2 chapters) is called \"Eye Witness Evidence\". I will insist on you showing me where his eye witnesses are. He doesn't have any except his unsupported claim that the writers of the Gospels are eye witnesses - and their credentials as \"eye witnesses\" are, to be kind, very shaky.

There is no way that you can read one word that Jesus said in the Gospels that would support the harming of another human being. In fact, he teaches the exact opposite. He even says that if someone attacks you, don't defend yourself, don't hit him back, but rather turn the other cheek. He leaves the Apostles with one command: Love one another. Doesn't it bother you that people claiming to be Christian distort Jesus teachings in this way and many others? Can you imagine what the world would be like if that teaching became one that all of us lived by?",

   " As far as Isaih 7:14, the Hebrew word 'almah translated in Isaiah 7:14 as \"virgin\" means young woman. It does not designate maid or married. It actually comes from the Hebrew 'elem which means young man. So, Isaiah did NOT indicate a virgin birth, but rather the normal course of birth: birth by a young woman. \n\n \n Not so!\n \n Rabbinic tradition and casual Christianity has gone to great lengths to try to disprove the tenet of a virgin birth. The rabbis teach, for example, that bethulah is the only word for virgin and that, on the contrary, almah can apply to any young woman.\n \n Yet, Rabbi Radak, in his comment on Isaiah 7:14, believes that the word almah can indeed mean virgin: \n \n \"Elem means young boy, the male, and almah means young girl [naarah]. Could be a virgin...\"  \n \n The question arises that if only the word bethulah means virgin, why would Radak believe that almah could mean virgin also? \n \n The custom of the times dictated that young girls live at home with their families and that they be chaperoned. Elem and its feminine form, almah, mean someone hidden from sight, concealed, private. \n \n Although the rabbis teach that bethulah is the only word for virgin, Rashi used another word to describe the almah in Isaiah 7:14 - naarah, which means child or young girl, by implication a virgin. \n \n For example, the Bible, in Genesis 24:16, uses both words, naarah and bethulah to describe Rebekah. And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her...\n \n Targum Onkeles translates the words naarah and bethulah in Genesis 24:16 as ulemta and b'tultah [Aramaic for young girl and virgin]. \n \n http://www.thechristianrabbi.org/themiraculousbirth.htm\n \n Now the Hebrew word \"almah\" is used in the Old Testament a number of times, and it is evident that when this word is used, in context it always refers to a virgin. For instance, in Genesis 24:16, when Abraham's servant went to Haran in search of a bride for Isaac, the verse says, \"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her..\" The word \"damsel\" is the Hebrew word \"naarah,\" meaning \"young woman.\" But that she was a virgin was also clearly stated, for in Genesis 24:43 it reads, \"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes forth to draw water....\" Here, the Hebrew word for virgin is our word, \"almah.\" This same lady Rebekah, who was a young woman, had never intimately \"known\" any man. Therefore, she was also referred to as a virgin (\"almah\"). \"Almah,\" therefore, must refer to a young woman who is also a virgin.\n \n Even the Jewish Rabbi Rashi acknowledges that some Jewish translators interpret the passage to signify a highly unusual birth of some sort.\n \n What Hebrew word, then, signifies an absolute virgin, \"betulah?\"\n \n Seems to me King Xerxes slept with the betulah's in Esther chapter 2, and they were still called \"betulah's\" even after shacking up with the king.\n \n In addition, out of the fifty or so times the word betulah occurs in the Tanakh, the NJPSV traslates it as maiden 31 times, so you have the same situation with betulah that you have with almah. Moreso, a betulah can be fifty or sixty years old, so you can't use that word in describing a young virgin maiden and not have it be ambiguous.\n \n Almah is the only Hebrew word that identifies a YOUNG virgin / maiden. Remember, in that culture, a young Hebrew girl was always considered a virgin anyway unless there was compelling evidence against it.\n \n \n This simply supports my contention that Jesus did not say anything with regard to his mother's virginity or his virgin birth.\n\n \n Strawman argument. In the Gospels, Jesus was silent on a lot of things, like having sex with animals, etc. He was relatively silent on his own birth too, but that doesn't mean he somehow appeared as an angel or something, or that he wasn't \"born.\"",

   "\n An issue that is extremely bothersome to me is people claiming to be Christian and then justifying wars and killings as Christian. There is no way that you can read one word that Jesus said in the Gospels that would support the harming of another human being. In fact, he teaches the exact opposite. He even says that if someone attacks you, don't defend yourself, don't hit him back, but rather turn the other cheek. He leaves the Apostles with one command: Love one another. Doesn't it bother you that people claiming to be Christian distort Jesus teachings in this way and many others? Can you imagine what the world would be like if that teaching became one that all of us lived by?\n\n That issue bothers me so much that it makes me sick. When anyone commits violent acts in the name of Christ, it hurts His witness. Recently, a man named James Kopp was sent to prison for the sniper shooting death of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Being Pro-life I can understand Kopp's frustration. However I cannot, nor will not condone his criminal act! Now on the issue of \"turning the other cheek,\" That does not mean that we are to be \"doormats.\" What it does mean is that we are not to seek personal vengeance for wrongs commited against us. Does that mean we cannot defend ourselves, nor come to the defense of others. Let me elaborate, if my wife were being attacked in my presence, I will do whatever I have to do to defend her. Even if it means using deadly force, as a last resort. I never was a fighter. But I will do so to protect my family. It is my God-given duty as a husband and father. :)",

   "Bassman and EZ:\n \n Thanks for the dialogue. Just so you know, I do read the entire Bible. I think that after Jesus, Moses is one of the great spiritual teachers. The problem with Moses is that he tried to be both a spiritual teacher and a political leader. Jesus was a spiritual teacher, a teacher of divine truth and only divine truth (no matter what silly theories about him being a political revolutionary are concocted). Because of this singularity of focus there is a purity of message that is unmatched.\n \n Many who choose to distort or use his message for their own purposes are forced to go to others writings to justify their personal agendas. That is why, in the 4th Century they put together the book we now call the Bible. It is not a bad book, but it is so contradictory that it can be used justify not following the teachings of Jesus. People who use the other books of the Bible to justify not following the teachings of Jesus are not Christians, they are Biblicans. \n \n I use a simple test. As Jesus admonished the rich young man in Lk 18:22 \"... sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\"\n \n The path he asks us to follow does not seem possible. I try not to let anyone fool me. Not only is it possible, it is wondrous.\n \n If you see someone claiming to be a Christian in a thousand dollar suit standing at a five thousand dollar pulpit in a million dollar building, watch him closely. If you see someone claiming to be a Christian promoting a book on TV and putting the money from that book into his pocket, look into his eyes. \n \n Thank you again for the dialogue. It has strengthened me in many ways.

Also:\n \n Lk22:43: And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\n \n Jesus needed strengthening. This may be key to understand the struggle between the human and the divine that Jesus was experiencing. He was in a state of being that required prayer and divine strengthening.

   "The quote from Mt:10:34 noted above and the verses you site are very difficult verses to reconcile with Jesus major teachings.

Also, do you sell your garment and buy a symbolic sword? In context, then, a real sword is indicated.\n \n \nIs he advocating violence - in any form?

Peter's was used offensively, not defensively. That, along with it being the will of God for Jesus to be arrested, makes a difference. It can also be the will of God to defend one's self and family from murderers with a sword.\n \n Which thread do you want to go to?",

   "Hey EZ:\n \n I wasn't avoiding your questions. I had misread your earlier post where you were talking about contradictions in the New Testament. I thought you had said contradictions between the Old and New Testaments. \n \n As far as differences between the New Testament writers, it is a much more subtle and elusive contradiction and more one of language and emphasis. I'll give you my more general take rather than get caught up in the minutia of words, translations and interpretations. I spent 4 years with that and saw that the experts were confounded. I also saw how the time and energy spent wrestling with a word or phrase blinded them to the larger picture of the teachings of Jesus.\n \n The way I see it, to understand the mission and mission of Jesus we have to start at the point where the name of God is told to Moses in Exodus 3:14. It is strikingly odd that Jesus, a Jew, never once (according to the Greek renditions that we have been given) refers to the name of God. It is impossible that he could expect a Jewish person to understand that he was talking about the God of Moses and the God of Abraham without once mentioning the name of God given Moses in Exodus.\n \n We need to understand the name of God given to Moses before we can even attempt to understand the teachings of Jesus. I could outline contradiction and/or concurrence between this passage and that, but unless there is an understanding of who Jesus was referring to as Father or God or what he meant by the Father's Kingdom or the Kingdom of Heaven we would just be talking at cross purposes.\n \n It is generally agreed that the Father Jesus referred to is the God of Abraham and the God of Moses.\n \n Ex3:13: And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 14: And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 15: And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n \n To the Hebrew mind the 'name' stands for 'nature'. In other words, Moses wasn't asking for a name in the sense of how to address God, but was inquiring about the nature of God. He was not asking \"who are you\" so much as he was asking \"what are you\".\n \n The answer Moses got was \"hayah hayah\". Even Strong's fudges this one. It has been argued that \"hayah\" means future: \"will be\"; present: \"am\"; and past: \"was\". However as you study the Torah and Biblical Hebrew, you can see that what it means is: \"I am was and will be what is was and shall be\". It is a fundamental spiritual understanding of the nature of what we today call \"God\", and the mutilation of that name of God by the Hebrew Scribes after Exodus 3 has to be scrutinized closely. \n \n If Jesus was in the tradition of Abraham and Moses, then the nature of the God Jesus spoke of was the same as the nature of the God of Abraham and Moses. If you read the Gospels with that understanding then the teachings of Jesus become clearer and clearer. Jesus spoke in opposition to the rabbis of his day because they had so distorted the God of Abraham and the God of Moses for their own personal gain that he was compelled to set right what they had distorted rectify what the wrong that they had done to something he knew to be sacred: The nature of God.\n \n That is where any real Bible study must begin. Bassman is correct when he says that the Old Testament and the New Testament complement themselves. It is through the teachings of Moses and the teachings of Jesus that this happens. If we understand the Creation and the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Moses about the nature of God (hayah, hayah) and see the teachings of Jesus through an understanding of the name of God as spelled out by Moses, we get a very different picture than the one that is offered today by many so-called Christian ministries. Many of these ministries have become like the rabbis of Jesus time, the money changers Jesus threw out of the Temple. They have put together teachings for their own worldly purposes, some of which are money and power and prestige, and some of which are much more insidious.\n \n Anyway, to me it is the single most important spiritual issue we confront. If the true teaching of Jesus can be trumpeted so that it can be heard over the lies and distortions, then his promise of a life more abundant can flourish: Love thine enemies: an astounding exhortation. Love one another. Sell all you worldly belongings, give the money to the poor and come follow me. On and on and on he illuminated the path for us and over and over and over there have been those who seek to obscure that path. God gave us a brain and a free will and goodness in our hearts. Like Jesus exhorted the people of his time, we do not have to simply accept the distortion of these modern day Scribes and Pharisees of our time.",

   "Howard -\n \n It is my contention and the contention of many Biblical scholars that the God of the burning bush episode - \"THE\" Angel of the Lord - is none other than the divine Lord Jesus Christ. \n \n In Hebrew, the word for \"angel\" is malakh. A malakh is a messenger, either human or angelic. Yet there is one (divine) malakh who stands out from all the rest. The Bible calls him simply, \"THE angel of the Lord.\" Whenever you see this \"angel\" / messenger in the Old Testament, he is acting, talking, or doing \"Divine\" things. Case in point:\n \n Zech. 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.\n 2 And the Lord said to Satan, \"The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\"\n 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel.\n 4 Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, \"Take away the filthy garments from him.\" And to him He said, \"See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes\" (note Isaiah 61:10. Also note only God can remove sin / iniquity).\n \n Many more examples in the links below. Jesus is the Great \"I AM\" God of the burning bush! He gave the law to Moses and then gave the Sermon on the Mount too.\n \n http://www.ourchurch.com/view/?pageID=74742\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/7131/AngLord.html\n \n Praise the Great God and Savior Jesus Christ.",
