   "DOES GOD GIVE AN \"OK\" TO KILL NEEDLESSLY KILL ANIMALS?\n \n First a little intro: My neighbor is a born again christian who literally slaughters squirrels, raccoons and armadillos emoticon_xkill . He kills them because they eat the bird seed he puts out as well as the pecans on his pecan tree. Yesterday, he was \"smashing the s### of some squirrels he had cornered. (They also clean off every pecan on my tree TOO!.. but I refuse to kill them when all they are trying to do is survive! emoticon_xlove )\n \n I suggested to him that just maybe \"his\" God would not approve of his actions. He told me that God says it is ok to kill \"THESE\" animals.\n \n Now the QUESTION: Did god, according to the bible, give any thought of protecting his creatures from the likes of my neighbor? Is there a verse or two in the bible that addresses this type of action? emoticon_xangel \n \n I am an atheist :( , but I suggested that he is not doing \"god's\" work and just maybe the devil has got hold of him? :xbanghead ...He really enjoys the killing.
