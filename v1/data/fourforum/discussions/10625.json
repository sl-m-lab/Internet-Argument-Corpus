   "The Russell's Teapot analogy is an invalid analogy because it can be used against any theory of the beginning of mankind. By this analogy anyone who believes anything about the beginning of the Universe is an idiot who believes in a teapot rotating around the sun. \n \n So this is an invalid analogy, given that it makes fools out of anyone who believes in anything that can't happen right there. So anyone is a fool who believes in the Big Bang or Evolution to Intelligent Design because as far as I can tell they haven't actually bred some creatures into a another creature that is entirely different from the previous one.

While it is possible that there might be such an object in existence, one may look at what a teapot is, how they are made, how many were taken into outer space, how likely it would be that any known process we know of would spontaneously create one THERE (the odds that one would appear on a planet are completely different). The odds are too low, even for Las Vegas, and the implications of them go against everything we know so far.\n \n So, the impossibility of elimination the possibility could not possibly lead to a proof of existence.\n \n \nIf, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. \n\n Well, it's a bit exaggerated, since atheists and agnostics are not really considered eccentric or subject to psychiatric treatement these days, but that's a rhetoric figure. The point that things written in ancient books are given quite an unusual amount of credence, especially given the lack of it for new sources, does go against the basics of logical thinking.\n \n So, accountign for rhetorics in the statement, the core idea of this thing seems quite valid.\n \n Who was this Russel, anyway?\n \n \n P.S.

   "Betrand Russell's orbiting teapot analogy concerns the provenance of belief. He wanted to make a point which is rather less than obvious to most religious believers, namely that those who make extraordinary claims that are impossible to verify bear the burden of proof before they need be taken too seriously. \n \n He chose to illustrate this by means of a simple analogy that is immediately capable of being grasped, and isn't loaded with centuries of connotations and other traditional baggage, namely an imaginary teapot too small to be telescopically observed that is allegedly in orbit between earth and Mars. Anyone who insists on the necessary existence of this teapot is therefore reasonably required to provide some evidence that it is there.\n \n Similarly with arguments about the existence of any specific deity. Someone who claims a particular deity exists can be reasonably asked to provide evidence for it, because otherwise, why should anyone believe in it? They wouldn't believe in an ordinary, orbiting teapot on the same lack of evidence, so why believe in something even more extraordinary and complex as a specific deity?\n \n The analogy is appropriate because it compares the rationale for belief, and acceptance of that belief by others. It doesn't matter that Russell picked a prosaic teapot to illustrate the provenance of belief. What matters is the grounds on which claims are made and defended, and that is what the analogy is intended to illustrate. Despite the fact that like all analogies it is limited in scope, and not everyone will understand it or learn from it, it serves its didactic purpose well.",

   "re: Jim's Trucking:\n \nmust be based upon some relevant similarities between God and a china teapot\n\n \n I'm afraid that this is not the case at all. Jim seems to have missed the object of the analogy.\n \n It's not that god and a teapot are similar. Those are both side issues. The core itself is the methodology of determining existence and pointing out the double standard in the issue.\n \n The only similarity between god and the unusually placed teapot are that both are impossible to prove for certain and that our knowledge marks both an unlikely thing to exist.\n \n re: nate895\n \nThe idea that God must be proven beyond all reasonable doubt, like a trial, is virtually impossible short of him coming showing up one day and actually talking to us. \n\n \n The issue is more complex than that.\n \n First: allowing one to believe whatever one wishes is one thing. As long as noone else is affected, this is OK. However, the believers often then make demands on others, and here, we get into deeper waters. The question of what to teach in school, what acts to declare criminal, the standards of morality, all these go beyond the simple belief of one man. These things can not be subject to an unargued belief.\n \n Second:the above has another problematic component. We can clearly see that what one believes is almost completely determined by his upbringing and teaching. A religion is implanted into a child and then nurtured carefully. This makes for a problem, as attempts to spread these implantation techniques to others are common, skewering the principle of the first consideration.",

   "The teapot analogy is pertinent:\n \n I think what Jim is doing here is attacking Russell's analogy for being what it is not: a comparison of the essence of a teapot to the essence of a deity. That seems to me to be a deliberate misconstruing of the analogy, a straw man that Russell manifestly did not have in mind, and it's constructed with the intention of dismissing the analogy without having to consider its implications.\n \n Russell was comparing the relevant similarities between methods of justifying a belief in an unlikely physical object that cannot be observed, with justifying a belief in a real deity that cannot be seen. Jim goes out of his way to believe that Russell intended the comparison to be about essences, instead, despite the clear wording of Russell's argument.\n \n For the life of me, I cannot see how a reading of Russell's essay could result in such a misconstruction by accident. It's a red herring.\n \n Let's look at the relevant paragraphs concerning the teapot in Russell's essay, Is There a God?, this time quoted in full so the context is evident:\n \n \nMany orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it. I do not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied history. Practically all the beliefs of savages are absurd. In early civilizations there may be as much as one percent for which there is something to be said. In our own day.... But at this point I must be careful. We all know that there are absurd beliefs in Soviet Russia. If we are Protestants, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Catholics. If we are Catholics, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Protestants. If we are Conservatives, we are amazed by the superstitions to be found in the Labour Party. If we are Socialists, we are aghast at the credulity of Conservatives. I do not know, dear reader, what your beliefs may be, but whatever they may be, you must concede that nine-tenths of the beliefs of nine-tenths of mankind are totally irrational. The beliefs in question are, of course, those which you do not hold. I cannot, therefore, think it presumptuous to doubt something which has long been held to be true, especially when this opinion has only prevailed in certain geographical regions, as is the case with all theological opinions.\n \n My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity. \n\n \n In no part of this is it possible to conclude legitimately that Russell is comparing essences: he's examining the source and justification of belief. The first sentence sets out the problem he wants to address here: \n\"Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them.\"\n Here, Russell is pointing out a fact of belief that he wishes to show is unreasonable. He wants to show that the burden of proof for an extraordinary claim lies with the claimant, rather than the burden of disproof lying with the skeptic. He wants to show this, because many people believe the reverse, that it is logical to believe in a deity (or some other unverifiable object or entity) if someone else cannot disprove its existence. Consequently, he wracks his brains for a simple analogy, one that can be understood by skeptics and believers alike, to a claim that is in some sense plausible yet highly unlikely, and extraordinarily difficult, maybe impossible, to confirm.\n \n The reason he resorts to such a mundane analogy is made clear in this sentence: \n\"If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it.\"\n It is not the essence of the teapot he is concerned with; it's the provenance of a hypothetical, traditional belief in it that is precisely analogous to the provenance of a belief in a deity. Russell argues against the fact that traditional belief is frequently accepted as truth, simply because it is traditional.\n \n It is in the subsequent part of his argument that he explains why he thinks it is invalid to use tradition, custom and habit as provenance for belief in unverifiable claims, by offering a number of examples, including some that modern believers in Christianity would themselves find absurd because they are not part of their own tradition. For example: \n\"Practically all the beliefs of savages are absurd. In early civilizations there may be as much as one percent for which there is something to be said. In our own day.... But at this point I must be careful. We all know that there are absurd beliefs in Soviet Russia. If we are Protestants, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Catholics. If we are Catholics, we know that there are absurd beliefs among Protestants.\"\n Clearly, with this and further examples -- \"The ['absurd'] beliefs in question are, of course, those which you do not hold.\" -- he is pointing out that any intrinsic absurdity of belief (as opposed to the validity of the provenance of said belief) is in the eye of the beholder, and that the only way of settling such a question is by providing evidence to justify such a belief. It is not a claim that any particular belief is objectively absurd; it's an argument that unverifiable beliefs cannot be legitimately defended as if they were beyond all doubt.\n \n The analogy holds, and I believe Jim has misconstrued its purpose, for his own rhetorical purposes. Russell was not making a trivial and inappropriate comparison: he was making an argument that extraordinary beliefs need commensurate justification. Now, religious believers may not like his point of view, but it is not a valid argument to simply dismiss the analogy as irrelevant by pretending it means something it didn't.",

This of course is an odd argument to make considering all the historical facts we get from books written at the time...even with no other physical evidence.

We do not today believe in flying, firebreathing dragons, though they often appear in both Western and Eastern mythology. We do not believe in Homer's Odyssey as if it were literally true, though it is more ancient than the New Testament.\n \n \nThe final flaw in the argument is that it assumes the religion is not provable.

That the universe exists? The universe is: therefore \"God\"; therefore Jesus Christ? That isn't arguing from evidence; that's leaping to conclusions. Let's grant that the universe has objective existence and is not a figment of someone's imagination -- it's hard to do otherwise and still make sense. So we presume that either it always existed in some shape or form, or it was brought into being by some event. I can't think of other possibilities.\n \n But even the logical sequence: the universe became, therefore \"God\", does not actually follow, unless one is willing to define \"God\" extremely broadly as \"that which brings universes into being\". Even if one felt compelled to grant Aquinas's Aristotelean argument that because all physical things have causes, and the universe is a physical thing, there had to be a Prime Mover of the universe, an Initiator or Originator, a Designer, an Uncaused First Cause -- which is a problematic leap in itself, because if the First Cause could be Uncaused, why not the universe itself? -- why would that lead one to suppose the god has all the attributes assumed by any particular religion, such as the Trinity of Christianity? That logical connection is far from obvious or self-evident. \n \n One could maybe grant that \"a universe; therefore a universe-maker\" might not be completely irrational (if not compelling, because it leaves dangling the question of who made the universe-maker), but \"the universe; therefore eternal life and the redemption of sins through Jesus\" is really stretching it.\n \n The evidentiary chain from the existence of the universe to Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary is not exactly compelling... unless... unless one has been taught this story from childhood, and raised to think it is unquestionable. Like an orbiting teapot, who would think it probable, unless one had been raised with the expectation that it is unreasonable to think it false?",

I think this is a mistake and a weak argument because we, in fact, do look to ancient texts for historical records.\n \n \nAgain, personal anecdote does not count as evidence in science.

If someone claims that last Friday, his god turned 5 loaves and 7 fishes into a feast for thousands, but can't reproduce the miracle in the same conditions the next Friday, what should we believe? Why should we believe it's a miracle rather than a tall tale?\nWell we are talking about historical events that aren't subject to science because no historical event really is (in that you don't reproduce the civil war...for example...to claim it really happened). When I think of evidence of previous events I think of historical records. We so easily believe that what was written about the Lost Colony (aspects of it that is) in North Carolina, for example, is real but all we have for that is written evidence. \n \n I think that evidence beyond written evidence exists as well but it is important to note that 1) written documents can be sources of previous event evidence and 2) It could be hard to determine what evidence provided (not written) could be attributable to. So the Russell Teapot argument fails in that it really says nothing useful about belief but rather draws a comparison of belief using a 'what if' type situation.\n \n \nThe problem with circular evidence, question begging, is that it doesn't actually resolve any questions, because it assumes the desired answer, then uses it as proof of itself.

We cannot necessarily formally prove all the axioms we assume within the system, but they need to be consistent with reality.\nThe point is that once you assume those axioms then of course they will be consistent with reality. As you pointed out the circular evidence of X will be persuasive in proving the belief in X.\n \n This only relates to the Russell Teapot argument in that it is not crazy to have belief in something that is not 100% provable because we all do it. As I stated, the argument has three fatal flaws 1) assumption that you would be called crazy if you believed in the Teapot argument 2) assumption that you can't believe in old books and 3) That there is no evidence supporting the belief of a God.

These are all eminently reasonable points, as Russell makes plain using his analogy.\n \n Now, Russell may have been wrong about his disbelief in god; he may have been mistaken about his assessment of the evidence; but I do not think his basic arguments in his essay were flawed at all. Believing simply because there is no formal disproof of an extraordinary belief is insufficient grounds in itself to justify the belief.

   "God is like a floating teapot, in that they both may exist, but it is reasonable to doubt they exist.\n\n if this were true, then the analogy might be valid. here is the fundamental difference between the two: the belief in god came about from making conclusions based on observable phenomena. the belief in a teapot does not. the belief in god answers questions about the physical world we live in. the belief in the teapot does not. the belief in god can be traced back to reasoning and thought. the belief in the teapot does not\n \n before you challenge my statements, bear with me and read on. something doesnt have to be true or even logical for it to be reasonable. reasonable is a subjective term, and is proportionate to the knowledge and experience of the one making the inference. for example, you may believe that a monster lives in your closet because your hear things go bump in the night. even though this belief is based on flawed reasoning, it is reasoning nontheless, and since the bump sound is real observable event, the belief about what caused the belief is based in reality, and therefore reasonable. if however, i believed that there was a monster in my closet, while my closet is open, lighted and evidently empty, and no other observable phenomena (bumps, clothes shaking, shadows moving, etc) are present to base my belief on, then this would be a belief devoid of reason\n \n now, this doesnt mean that your quoted statement is wrong. it is reasonable to doubt the existence of god, as it is to doubt the existence of the teapot, based on what we know about the universally accepted definitions of god and teapots. but not everyone shares the same level of knowledge and experience, and if we extrapolate backwards in time, the knowledge/experience gaps are far bigger. however, it is wrong to compare the basis of the belief in god to the basis of the belief in the teapot, simply because one is based in reason and the other is devoid of it",

   "I am saying if the point was \"to show that there wasn't enough objective evidence there to believe in a deity\" then it failed at this. \n\n \n Well, one would have to go beyond the analogy to examine the nature of the actual evidence, to come to any conclusions about that. Every analogy is limited -- it's just a didactic tool to illustrate a mode of thinking and arguing that has very limited validity, if any. It's not making any positive claims about dieties. Still, both the hypothetical teapot and specific religious claims are based not on empirical evidence but on revelation. I believe there is even a canonical book in the Christian bible of that name, and it makes a number of claims of no more trustworthy provenance than the teapot.\n \n \nI'm saying if it were taught as the Bible is currently then it would be credible. The idea only sounds ridiculous to us because it isn't a believed religion. On the other hand, if Russell was to start the religion and he feels we would dismiss it as nonsense then why wasn't the Christian faith dismissed as nonsense when formulated?\n\n \n Well, human cognition isn't tidy or perfect. And if you examine the history, the claims of Christianity weren't unprecedented. There were several Pagan mystery cults kicking around the Mediterranean at the time that made claims very similar to those of Christianity (born of a virgin, death and resurrection, etc.). E.g. the religions of Mithras or Osiris. So maybe the claims weren't as surprising to the people around at the time.\n \n Think too about reactions to modern religions, such as Mormonism or Scientology. Lots of people (including many Christians) think, with good reason, they are bunk, but maybe enough people believe in them already to step across that threshold from evanescent cult to full-fledged religion. Most other cults never make it. I'm not sure what needs to be in place before a cult makes this transition successfully, but Mormonism is a case study. There are many beliefs in Mormonism that are outlandish to Christians and other non-Christians alike, but apparently they seem reasonable to Mormons. Why? They bought the teapot, is why.\n \n \nI mean for historical evidence. All claims are just as extraordinary as the others in history.\n\n \n I don't really see this is true. Some claims are miraculous, i.e. they involve the nullification of natural laws. Others are highly improbable. And some are pretty common and unsurprising. We know kings and dictators exist today, so it isn't an extraordinary claim to say that there was one called Caesar Augustus in Roman history. But if someone claimed that Caesar Augustus was a god incarnate, walked on water and raised men from the dead, we could be forgiven for feeling a tad skeptical. We know that temples were built to him, but there isn't any evidence he managed to work any miracles for those who prayed to him.\n \n Now, it is true that not all claims made about history are true. History is usually a work in progress, with new information changing old ideas about what happened. It is true that not all historical writings can be trusted. But then, why would this not also be true of the bible? If I can read a history of, say, the colonisation of the Americas with a bit of skepticism, bearing in mind it is written by the conquerors, why not a history of the Hebrews with equal skepticism?",

   "The reason he resorts to such a mundane analogy is made clear in this sentence: \n \n\"If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it.\" \n\n It is not the essence of the teapot he is concerned with; it's the provenance of a hypothetical, traditional belief in it that is precisely analogous to the provenance of a belief in a deity. Russell argues against the fact that traditional belief is frequently accepted as truth, simply because it is traditional.\n\n apparently, this is a pivotal point to the analogy argument. i disagree. the belief in the existence of god doesnt persist because it is a traditional, widespread or old belief. centuries ago, before the belief could be called a tradition, the belief was there. at some point, somewhere along the line of early history, somebody figured that the observable world supported the idea that god exists. this idea may have sprung up independently from varied unrelated parts of the world, or it may have been passed on and snowballed into the package it is today. but somewhere along this line, whenever the concept of the existence of god was communicated, others agreed that the conclusion was reasonable, and believed as well. i'm not saying that there were never doubters or atheists, but the point is that without the belief in god being widespread, universally accepted, or traditional, such a belief would still come about. how does russel's argument stand up to the fact that way way back in time, before the conept of god was written i books or viewed as traditional, people believed that god existed?\n \n i would daresay that even in today's world, if there was never any bible, traditional religion or history of mythology, someone somewhere would be the first to come up with the idea, based on observable reality, that god exists",

Though I might be briefly entertained by the notion of interplanetary tableware, its existence wouldn't really answer any of the questions my cause-and-effect extrapolating brain likes to pose itself in its spare time, like what happens when that 'death' thing I've seen going on finally happens to me.

It isn't reasonable to believe creation revolves around us. But it is terribly, terribly appealing, hence the disproportionate proliferation of creation myths in which our good selves feature prominently compared to the far greater potential variety of equally reasonable creation hypotheses in which we are irrelevant extras.

Or if he was, he'd be wrong, but I don't think he was. He doesn't strike me as simpleminded enough to think, \"no teapot, therefore no god\". \n \n The analogy was intended to illustrate a specific point, namely that one should be rightly skeptical of unusual and unsubstantiated claims. It's a point about logic and evidence. It's not a disproof of god, nor will it impress anyone such as Jim who feels an emotional need to believe in one, or an Aristotelean who needs an uncaused cause.\n \n So if one argues that the analogy is supposed to provide a strong reason to disbelieve in god, then you could say it failed, but it doesn't seem to me to be intended to be all that sweeping. In any case, Russell did not limit his argument against belief to this one analogy. If people want to fault Russell for not providing the killer analogy that vanquished religious belief at a stroke, I think they've got the wrong target. His claims there were much more modest, namely that one is not logically compelled to believe in God X without considerable proof.",

   "If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. \n\n russel compares the belief in his teapot to the belief in god in that coming up with a belief in something that cannot be proven or disproven is not a good reason to believe in it. he compares god and the teapot as two things that cannot be disproven. on this he concludes that, as he \"rightly be thought to be talking nonsense\" for believing in the teapot, so should those that believe in god be thought of in the same way. i have shown why this is not an apt comparison\n \n further, russel implies that the belief in god is enforced due to its mention in ancient books, its widespread acceptance and its traditional heritage. he proposes that the belief in the existence of his teapot would be just as enforced if it had the same status. i also showed, briefly, why this doesnt apply\n \n in all, the analogy doesnt strike me as a well thought out one, and he may have come up with as a jesting retort in the midst of a religious argument. and while it may have stumped the theists at the moment, its not that difficult to break apart. i think he had a point in that god is indeed an entity which people believe in despite the fact that physical evidence for god's existence can never be shown. but it doesnt make the analogy valid",

However, analogies aren't meant to be perfect representations of what they are intended to illuminate. They necessarily have limitations -- if they didn't, they would be the thing itself, and not an analogy to it. The differences are as informative as the similarities. As a didactic tool, the analogy works well. It can't answer all questions about the origins, persistence and validity of religious beliefs, but then as an analogy, it shouldn't be expected to.\n \n One shouldn't criticise an analogy for its imperfections. It needs to be appreciated for what it accomplishes in the way of illumination. As such, it neatly illustrates its point about the burden of proof, and the importance of verifiable evidence to belief, which are not trivial issues, and are not always appreciated by true believers.
