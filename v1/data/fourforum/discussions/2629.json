   "How to Identify Neocons (i.e., bogus conservatives)\n \n What do neoconservatives believe?\n \n \"Neocons\" believe that the United States should not be ashamed to use its unrivaled power - forcefully if necessary - to promote its interests around the world. Some even speak of the need to cultivate a US empire. Neoconservatives believe modern threats facing the US can no longer be reliably contained and therefore must be prevented, sometimes through preemptive military action.\n \n Most neocons believe that the US has allowed dangers to gather by not spending enough on defense and not confronting threats aggressively enough. One such threat, they contend, was Saddam Hussein and his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Since the 1991 Gulf War, neocons relentlessly advocated Mr. Hussein's ouster.\n \n Most neocons share unwavering support for Israel, which they see as crucial to US military sufficiency in a volatile region. They also see Israel as a key outpost of democracy in a region ruled by despots. Believing that authoritarianism and theocracy have allowed anti-Americanism to flourish in the Middle East, neocons advocate the democratic transformation of the region, starting with Iraq. They also believe the US is unnecessarily hampered by multilateral institutions, which they do not trust to effectively neutralize threats to global security.\n \n What are the roots of neoconservative beliefs?\n \n The original neocons were a small group of mostly Jewish liberal intellectuals who, in the 1960s and 70s, grew disenchanted with what they saw as the American left's social excesses and reluctance to spend adequately on defense. Many of these neocons worked in the 1970s for Democratic Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, a staunch anti-communist. By the 1980s, most neocons had become Republicans, finding in President Ronald Reagan an avenue for their aggressive approach of confronting the Soviet Union with bold rhetoric and steep hikes in military spending. After the Soviet Union's fall, the neocons decried what they saw as American complacency. In the 1990s, they warned of the dangers of reducing both America's defense spending and its role in the world.\n \n Unlike their predecessors, most younger neocons never experienced being left of center. They've always been \"Reagan\" Republicans.\n \n What is the difference between a neoconservative and a conservative?\n \n Liberals first applied the \"neo\" prefix to their comrades who broke ranks to become more conservative in the 1960s and 70s. The defectors remained more liberal on some domestic policy issues. But foreign policy stands have always defined neoconservatism. Where other conservatives favored d\u00e9tente and containment of the Soviet Union, neocons pushed direct confrontation, which became their raison d'etre during the 1970s and 80s.\n \n Today, both conservatives and neocons favor a robust US military. But most conservatives express greater reservations about military intervention and so-called nation building. Neocons share no such reluctance. The post 9/11-campaigns against regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate that the neocons are not afraid to force regime change and reshape hostile states in the American image. Neocons believe the US must do to whatever it takes to end state-supported terrorism. For most, this means an aggressive push for democracy in the Middle East. Even after 9/11, many other conservatives, particularly in the isolationist wing, view this as an overzealous dream with nightmarish consequences.\n \n How have neoconservatives influenced US foreign policy?\n \n Finding a kindred spirit in President Reagan, neocons greatly influenced US foreign policy in the 1980s.\n \n But in the 1990s, neocon cries failed to spur much action. Outside of Reaganite think tanks and Israel's right-wing Likud Party, their calls for regime change in Iraq were deemed provocative and extremist by the political mainstream. With a few notable exceptions, such as President Bill Clinton's decision to launch isolated strikes at suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, their talk of preemptive military action was largely dismissed as overkill.\n \n Despite being muted by a president who called for restraint and humility in foreign affairs, neocons used the 1990s to hone their message and craft their blueprint for American power. Their forward thinking and long-time ties to Republican circles helped many neocons win key posts in the Bush administration.\n \n The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 moved much of the Bush administration closer than ever to neoconservative foreign policy. Only days after 9/11, one of the top neoconservative think tanks in Washington, the Project for a New American Century, wrote an open letter to President Bush calling for \"regime change\" in Iraq. Before long, Bush, who campaigned in 2000 against nation building and excessive military intervention overseas, also began calling for regime change in Iraq. In a highly significant nod to neocon influence, Bush chose the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) as the venue for a key February 2003 speech in which he declared that a US victory in Iraq \"could begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace.\" AEI - the de facto headquarters for neconservative policy - had been calling for democratization of the Arab world for more than a decade.\n \n What does a neoconservative dream world look like?\n \n Neocons envision a world in which the United States is the unchallenged superpower, immune to threats. They believe that the US has a responsibility to act as a \"benevolent global hegemon.\" In this capacity, the US would maintain an empire of sorts by helping to create democratic, economically liberal governments in place of \"failed states\" or oppressive regimes they deem threatening to the US or its interests. In the neocon dream world the entire Middle East would be democratized in the belief that this would eliminate a prime breeding ground for terrorists. This approach, they claim, is not only best for the US; it is best for the world. In their view, the world can only achieve peace through strong US leadership backed with credible force, not weak treaties to be disrespected by tyrants.\n \n Any regime that is outwardly hostile to the US and could pose a threat would be confronted aggressively, not \"appeased\" or merely contained. The US military would be reconfigured around the world to allow for greater flexibility and quicker deployment to hot spots in the Middle East, as well as Central and Southeast Asia. The US would spend more on defense, particularly for high-tech, precision weaponry that could be used in preemptive strikes. It would work through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when possible, but must never be constrained from acting in its best interests whenever necessary.\n \n Source:\n \n http://www.csmonitor.com/specials/neocon/neocon101.html",

   "How to Be a Neo-Con\n \n By Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas\n \n Here is a brief summary of the general understanding of what neocons believe:\n \n 1. They agree with Trotsky on permanent revolution, violent as well as intellectual.\n \n 2. They are for redrawing the map of the Middle East and are willing to use force to do so.\n \n 3. They believe in preemptive war to achieve desired ends.\n \n 4. They accept the notion that the ends justify the means - that hard-ball politics is a moral necessity.\n \n 5. They express no opposition to the welfare state.\n \n 6. They are not bashful about an American empire; instead they strongly endorse it.\n \n 7. They believe lying is necessary for the state to survive.\n \n 8. They believe a powerful federal government is a benefit.\n \n 9. They believe pertinent facts about how a society should be run should be held by the elite and withheld from those who do not have the courage to deal with it.\n \n 10. They believe neutrality in foreign affairs is ill-advised.\n \n 11. They hold Leo Strauss in high esteem.\n \n 12. They believe in imperialism, if progressive in nature, is appropriate.\n \n 13. They believe in using American might to force American ideals on others is acceptable. Force should not be limited to the defense of our country.\n \n 14. 9/11 resulted from the lack of foreign entanglements, not from too many.\n \n 15. They dislike and despise libertarians and traditional conservatives (therefore, the same applies to all strict constitutionalists.)\n \n 16. They endorse attacks on civil liberties, such as those found in the Patriot Act, as being necessary.\n \n 17. They unconditionally support Israel and have a close alliance with the Likud Party.\n \n Source:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general39/neocon.htm",

When was the last time the democrats managed to pass a trillion dollar plus social program? The bush administration pulled it off (prescription drug plan). Originally, it did look like perhaps Bush was going to be the conservative he claimed to be. The tax cuts looked good, until we found that there would be no spending cuts to go with the tax cuts, but instead our government would spend MORE and simply make up the differnce with OTHER taxes (besides income) and massive deficit spending. \n \n There is an interesting artcle about Bushs socialistic tendancies at Cato: \n \n http://www.cato.org/research/articles/dehaven-030718.html",

We all know a war will will bring out most Southern Democrats, traditionally conservative democrats who value patriotism over reason, and to lock them in you spend tax money on domestic social engineering as they are truly the 'little man' (unions, civil service, fraternal orders, VFW clubs, etc.) that emotionally respond to defending our country and taking care of people rhetoric. \n \n The danger he now faces is a backlash from true fiscally conservative Republicans who violently disagree with his fiscal and foreign policies (we're losing investment money potential). To offset that factor, which will become an important sector in the swing vote, Bush's campaign is actively courting traditionally democratic Black and Hispanic voters.

I LOVE the fact that economic analysts, usually attached to a large braokerage firm, gets on TV and announces that the economy is in great shape (which means they are churning comissions), I also love it when those in power get up there and toss out polished GDP numbers while downplaying the negative influence our trade deficit and deficit spending have on the economy.

   "[Neocons have launched vicious attacks against Anne Coulter for defending Senator Joe McCarthy. Doesn't it seem strange that supposed \"conservatives\" would be attacking an anti-communist like McCarthy? Not so strange when you understand that in his efforts to expose communist agents in the government, McCarthy inadvertently uncovered many Jews, and he is still hated for that.]\n \n The Neocons Launch a Coulterkampf\n \n Thus, the Wall Street Journal op-ed page last month unleashed the sarcastic reflections of neocon Dorothy Rabinowitz on Miss Coulter and her book. The burden of the attack was that Miss Coulter praises the late Joe McCarthy as someone who was willing to call the spade of liberal treason by its proper name. Then there was a review by Anne Applebaum in the Washington Post Book Review, followed a week later by yet another broadside from neo-con Arnold Beichman in the Washington Times.\"\n \n Continued:\n \n \n http://www.vdare.com/francis/coulterkampf.htm",

   "As to tax increases, I look at the increases in my state and muni tax bills and can see the increases from the fed pushing costs for federally implemented programs down to lower levels to conserve cash flow from tax revenue reductions amounting to vote buying and interest rates increasing to satisfy foreign investors demanding better returns with the sinking dollar.\n \n \n Ok, increased taxes leads to a reduction in disposable household incomes. When disposable household incomes drop, so to does private consumption in the economy. When private consumption drops, the effect is a decrease in the overall level of aggregate demand, and thus and economic slowdown. If the economy slows down to levels seen as dangerous, a reserve bank will in most cases lower interest rates to encourage more spending. I can't see the logic where tax increases account for increasing interest rates. \n \n Economic Growth: This occurs when a nation increases the volume (real value) of goods and services produced over a period of time. \n \n \nThat is nice. If I were you, I would put the effort into learning enough about the economy to examine things for yourself. You simply cannot have economic growth when you are loosing a trillion plus dollars per year.\n \n \n Yes you can. Economic growth is different from Net Foregin Debt. A country may have, over a period of time, increased the value of goods and services it produces. It has therefore covered the criteria to have achieved \"economic growth.\" If that same country imports more than it exports, it's NFD will rise. The general measurement of economic growth is the GDP. When the GDP is calculated, imports are not included in the figure simply because GDP measures Gross Domestic Product, and nothing more. \n \n I'm just pointing out a case where an economy can be seen to be 'losing' money, and where economic growth can still occur. I'm not American, but how the hell can you be losing $1 Trillion per year?\n \n One last point on American Economic Policy, drop the subsidies and tariffs. If an industry needs to be protected, it is inefficient.",

I think a lot of them (at least the ones I see running around here) are traditional republicans, and are having one hell of a time adjusting to the fact that Bush is most definatly NOT. When was the last time the democrats managed to pass a trillion dollar plus social program? The bush administration pulled it off (prescription drug plan). Originally, it did look like perhaps Bush was going to be the conservative he claimed to be. The tax cuts looked good, until we found that there would be no spending cuts to go with the tax cuts, but instead our government would spend MORE and simply make up the differnce with OTHER taxes (besides income) and massive deficit spending. \n \n There is an interesting artcle about Bushs socialistic tendancies at Cato: \n \n http://www.cato.org/research/articles/dehaven-030718.html\n\n \n Well, we can actually agree about something. The Bush prescription drug plan was a bad idea. Like all of these social spending programs (at least here in the U.S.) one can multiply by a factor of 10 to get the actual costs. All politics. Was trying to buy votes. \n \n This is where I depart from typical Republican doctrine.
