I think that's a good thing, don't you? Democracy is coming to Iraq. I think that's a good thing, don't you? Iraqis will be living in a safer, freer nation once we're done. I think that's a good thing, don't you?\n \n You bring up the fact that we could have gone to other ME countries...but think here. There was only one nation in the ME that was ruled by a dictator that had that bad of a human rights record, ruled by a regime that brutal, had used WMDs several times, invaded his neighbors several times, and shot at American and British aircraft. Then you throw in the support of suicide bombers in Palestine/Israel, and oh yeah, that little thing that happened there...what's it called? Oh yeah...genocide! That nation was Iraq. Thanks to the fact that Bush has morals and the juevos to back them up, and thanks to the coalition militaries, that kind of stuff doesn't go on there any more.

I, like most people, thought that they were going to find something. I still didn't support the war, at least not in the way it was carried out. My criticism is still the same as it always was. There was no honesty by the Bush administration about what the war/occupation was going to be like. Do you think that the Bush administration gave the indication of what we were getting ourselves into? There was definetly reasons for going in, but there was also a lot of reasons not to. These negatives were never prestented to the American people by the Bush administration. I don't remember them telling the American people that we are going to be there probably for the next 10 years, at least, with 100,000+ troops. They didn't talk about the billions of dollars that it is going to cost. They didn't talk about the difficulty of maintaining an artificial country made up of Sunni, Shia, and Kurds. The list goes on and on, and I think that any administration has the responsibility to be honest with the American people when undertaking something as large as the long term occupation of Iraq. You don't think so? WIth many people, I think, the argument is not that there wasn't reasons to go into Iraq, it is that there were a lot of reasons not to that should have been discussed.",
