It's interesting to see the environmentalists do the song and dance when the money is moving around, isn't it?\n \n 40 years ago for example, most of our interstate highway system was in place. There have been several extensions built since then, and plenty of beltways. But the percentages of new roads built in the last 40 years is far less than the percentages of increases in salt use. There was far less traffic back then, (heavy TRAFFIC is one of the best ways to melt snow & ice) as well as no radial tires, and no front drive. Yet our society survived back then. Can't we cut back to 60's amounts of salt use, for the environment?",

   "do you want to be the first on the rode after a lull? how about your famley?\n \n i did not see anything about the leval of salt used in the '60's in the story. \n\n \n Hey there emclean, good questions, thanks for letting me rant more! :) I wouldn't mind being first, I've always enjoyed the challenge. That's wierd I know, but it's not that hard. If I can do it, anyone can. (I'm sure many here would agree with that :p ) People could learn to drive in it better, or stay home. It's worked in the past. I'm not sure it would be possible to find a truthfull source for how much salt was used in the 60's. I don't really need one anyway, I was an observant young lad in the 60's. We had some harsh winters in the 62 - 63 - 64 winters. School buses did NOT get wrapped around trees. School was called off sometimes then, but not like it is now. Todays legal system has school around here being called off for the slightest dusting of snow. Kids today are sure learning the importance of being somewhere, aren't they? \n \n \n \n \n \n so are you implying that Glen Brand of the Cincinnati chapter of the Sierra Club is geting a kick back, or what? \n\n \n I don't think the Sierra club is that big YET. His national superior probably did - Brand got his orders.\n \n \n it is cost that decides the issue. it costs about $500,000,000 (500 million) to salt the road, the cheapet alterntive would cost $3,600,000,000 (3.6 Billion), and the most expensive listed would be $12,000,000,000 (12 Billion).\n \n any questions?\n\n \n I'm sure the alternatives would pollute as much or more than salt. The best alternative is to PLOW, and use less of the chemicals. Icy conditions, hills, of course they need it. But level areas of no ice, just powder snow, don't need near what they are getting today. Around here, if we have a mild winter and then get a dusting in March, look out - the salt trucks are out dumping it everywhere even before it starts snowing. Gotta get rid of the stockpiles before summer ya know, there's more money for more mountains of salt next fall. \n \n It looks like a clear double standard to me. The article said we should use no more salt than necessary, but didn't say a word about anyone actually making any attempt to cut back at all. \n \n I didn't hear any warnings about how harmfull it was for older people to use salt on their food in the 60's and 70's, but I sure hear it today. How much more have we learned about salt in the last few decades? If you're lost at sea and you drink salt water, you die. If you put fresh water fish in salt water, they die. We've known that for a long time. Can we document as many deaths from ozone depletion (or ozone build up - whatever it is this week) as we can from salt?",

In 1998, new EPA regulations required that all tanks be compatable with new testing methods, and his tanks weren't required to be installed with that in mind in 1983. So, in 1998, he can no longer use the tanks, even though they have five years left on their warranty, and do not leak.

   "do you think the sheepal will ever get there heads out of the sand, and there mind off what TV tells them to worry about?\n\n \n I wonder the same. The BEST thing for people to do is have some old fashioned decency. When we see someone else losing their freedoms, even though it's not a freedom that we choose to enjoy, we need to take notice and stand up for them, not jealously chuckle at their misfortune. If we don't stand up for others, they're not going to stand up for us later. Today it's anti smoking, tomorrow it's anti coffee. Today it's seat belt laws, tomorrow it's home-smoke detector laws. \n \n We have auto emission testing in my area. The buildings were newly built for it - cars and light trucks. Why were they built with 14' clearance???? Either they were planning on hiring some very tall workers, or they have trucks in mind for the future. Many people who are angry about having to take the tests would welcome that. \"Why don't those bad old trucks have to be tested - look at all that smoke they belch!\" That's the \"it's not fair\" mentality that those who would take our freedoms love. Some people don't stop to think that any hardship placed on trucks directly affects the prices of EVERYTHING they buy. Can you think of any posession you have that doesn't ride on a diesel truck at one time or another??\n \n Whenever the government passionately tells us it wants to help us, at the expence of our money and/or freedom, we need to ask, what's in it for them? If it's not money, could it be their puffed up ego? But the most important question is, WHAT'S NEXT? \n \n end of rant. :)",

   "I take it that upgrading the liner or installing some sort of cathodic protection (to prevent the tank from rusting) was out of the question for your friend? \n\n \n The way it was explained to me, no upgrade was permitted, complete replacement was the only option. Out of the question for him. Many other stations closed around here at that time also. My friend did stay in business as a mechanic.\n \n \n \n \n You do know that steel tanks do degrade over time, right? \n\n \n Yes, but it seems that the EPA makes one blanket rule for many different circumstances. A private property tax payer should have some say in how HIS tanks are taken out of service. If they leak, he is the one losing gasoline - if water is leaking into his gasoline supply, he's going to have unhappy customers. I realize that, considering their cost, he's going to put off replacing them as long as possible. But if his place is located in the boondocks, and only one of three or four tanks arel leaking, why should he be closed down because he can't afford to replace them all? In EPA links that lament leaking gasoline tanks, one of the many scary things they talk about is the possiblity of explosion. Most of them are under several inches of concrete. An explosion???? Yet when it comes to road salt, they casually say that it goes no further than 15 feet from the pavement. Does gasoline go further than 15 feet from the storage tanks? How does the percentage of leaking gasoline all across the country in 1997 compare with 15 million tons of salt per year? Salt mixes with water, gasoline does not. \n \n It just looks like a double standard to me. I'm sure there's an environmentalist out there somewhere who could explain to me why petroleum products are so much more dangerous than water soluable products like salt & soap, and it may be legitimate. But I'd like more proof than \"because environmentalists know\". \n \n \nAnd, of course, the primary reason (and certainly not the only reason) that MTBE end up in groundwater is because those steel tanks (equipped with all the upgrades even) still leak.\n\n \n I think that's more the fault of those who required that MTBE be used than it is the owners of tanks.",
