   "Yes!\n \n Three Cheers for the Bill-O!\n \nOpposite world? Liberals cheer Bill O'Reilly gesture\n By Ron Brynaert\n Wednesday, March 31st, 2010 -- 4:02 pm\n Can anyone check to see if Hell is still hot?\n \n Newsmax reports, \"No. 1 cable news host Bill O'Reilly said Tuesday that he will personally write a check to cover $16,500 in legal costs for the father of a fallen U.S. Marine who sued the members of a church who picketed his son's funeral.\"\n \n \n\"On Friday, Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ordered Snyder to pay $16,510 to Fred Phelps, leader of the Westboro Baptist Church, despite the fact that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case as to whether the protesters are entitled to free speech at the funeral,\" the Associated Press reported. \"Phelps conducted protests at Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder's funeral in 2006.\"\n\n\n Opposite world? Liberals cheer Bill O'Reilly gesture | Raw Story\n \n Those Phelps creeps are the most despicable creatures on Earth!",
