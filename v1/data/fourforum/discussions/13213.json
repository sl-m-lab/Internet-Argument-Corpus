   "Massachusetts Trial Court Holds Gun Storage Law Unconstitutional:\n After a police officer's 12-year-old son got access to the officer's handgun, the officer was prosecuted for violating Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 140, \u00a7 131L:\n \n It shall be unlawful to store or keep any firearm, rifle or shotgun ... in any place unless such weapon is secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device, properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner or other lawfully authorized user. For purposes of this section, such weapon shall not be deemed stored or kept if carried by or under the control of the owner or other lawfully authorized user.\n \n Last month, the court held the statute was unconstitutional (Commonwealth v. Bolduc), and dismissed the prosecution. I only just now managed to get a copy of the opinion, and here's the relevant discussion:\n \n The locking mechanisms [required by the statute] are the functional equivalent of those enumerated in the D.C. statute struck down in Heller.\n \n In Heller, the Court held that the Second Amendment not only protects an individual's right to possess firearms but that the right requires that the firearms be available for \"the purpose of immediate self-defense.\" The Massachusetts statute mandating lock boxes or similar devices would frustrate an owner's ability to immediately access an operable weapon.\n \n Although the statute exempts firearms that are \"carried\" or \"under the control of the owner\" from the requirement that they be locked, the statute applies to the lawful owner of a firearm even when he is at home. People can be subject to prosecution whether they are home or not. The term \"under the control of the owner\" is a question of fact and subject to interpretation. Any ambiguity in the statute as applied to a person lawfully keeping a firearm in the home must be resolved in favor of the holder of the right. Legislation requiring an owner to store firearms in a place inaccessible to children or unauthorized persons would satisfy the Supreme Court's holding in Heller and protect the safety of others.\n \n In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that, based on the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, G.L.c. 140, sec. 131L is unconstitutional.\n \n According to a Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly article notes that Massachusetts courts seem split on this. It also reports that the prosecutor \"agreed with [Judge] Lynch's analysis and decided not to appeal. 'I've read the Heller case,' he says. 'Judge Lynch read the Heller case, and the Heller case seems to say very clearly that these kinds of blanket restrictions are unconstitutional.'\"\n \n Interestingly, the court seemed to assume that the Second Amendment applies to state laws -- what lawyers call the \"incorporation\" issue -- which is something Heller pointedly declined to resolve.\n \n The Volokh Conspiracy - Massachusetts Trial Court Holds Gun Storage Law Unconstitutional:",

   "DA appeals court rulings in weapons case\n By Chloe Gotsis\n Thu Mar 05, 2009, 06:26 AM EST\n Billerica, Mass. - Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone is seeking to preserve gun safety laws by fighting two court rulings that could loosen gun storage regulations. \n \n Leone's office filed an appeal in the state appeals court, disputing a Lowell District Court decision to dismiss gun charges against a Billerica man for improperly storing a firearm and possessing a firearm without a valid firearm identification card.\n \n Richard Runyan's lawyers argued the charges against him were unconstitutional based on a Supreme Court case, Washington, D.C. versus Heller, ruling individuals have a right to posses weapons for self-defense and requiring that handguns be inoperable while stored restricts that right.\n \n But Leone said requiring gun owners to keep their firearms disassembled or locked keeps people safe.\n \n \"In this case, we argue that current Massachusetts law works to assure that firearms are secured so that only the registered owner can use it and that it does so without infringing on a person's Second Amendment rights,\" Leone said in a statement. \"We believe that this is a fundamental issue of firearm and child safety, and we will continue to present our arguments to the court.\"\n \n Leone said the Bay State has gun storage laws in place to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands and preventing accidental shootings, particularly by children, as in the Runyan case.\n \n On April 1, 2008, Billerica police were called to the Fernwood Road home of Runyan, for a report of a BB gun shot through a window. Police found Runyan's 18-year-old son, Alexander, shooting a BB gun out the window at his neighbor, William Durant. Officers seized the BB gun from Alexander, who has Down syndrome.\n \n Alexander, who was home alone during the day, showed police his father's bedroom where they found two other guns stored under the bed in soft g carrying cases. Officers found a 12-gauge shotgun bound by a trigger lock and an unsecured semi-automatic hunting rifle, according to police reports.\n \n Police later discovered Runyan's firearm identification card expired in September 2005.\n \n On Aug. 14, Runyan filed an instant motion to dismiss the gun charges against him.\n \n Middlesex Assistant District Attorneys Sean Griffith and Kerryanne Kilcoyne argued that current Massachusetts law does not restrict an individual's right to carry a firearm, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment. Kilcoyne and Griffith also argued that in Supreme Court ruling of Washington D.C. v. Heller, the Court was clear that its decision did not undermine any laws regulating the storage of firearms to prevent accidents, as Leone said the state's law does.\n \n \"[Massachusetts law] does not ban the possession of functional firearms, only the improper storage,\" said reads the district attorney's appeal. Massachusetts law rules firearms must be stored so they can only be operated by the owner and requires they be equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device.\n \n \"Since a threat to the public peace and order is great when a weapon is involved, surely, a state must be able to regulate the use and storage or firearms so as to protect and maintain the safety of its citizens,\" said prosecutors in their filing.\n \n Prosecutors cited this as pertinent to the Runyan case, where the defendant's son, who police believed to be \"severely handicapped,\" not only had knowledge on where his father kept additional guns but had easy access to and the potential use of unsecured firearms.",

It generates money to grow government at the 'subjects' expense. I said before: \"they don't call it the CRIMINAL justice system for nothing.\n \n When times get slow and departments need money or an election is coming soon, you can expect these people to be used time and again in one way or another.\n \n Until juries start doing their job, get educated and judge both the fact and the law as the Constitution demands, this situation will continue. Judges who have their oath before them and elected officials should come under strict scrutiny and harsh punishment handed down by violators IN the system.\n \n Probably in most jurisdictions, a head of cabbage could get indicted and probably convicted as things stand now. It is refreshing to see the protests over mandated health care and I hope it expands to every area of government. Those folks who preach for unConstitutional laws should be punished by those same laws emoticon_angry",
