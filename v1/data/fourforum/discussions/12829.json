   "UPDATE: Lynch signs NH marriage bill\n \n y Jennifer Vanasco, editor in chief, 365gay.com\n 06.03.2009 4:28pm EDT\n \n Gov. John Lynch has signed the New Hampshire equal marriage bill, making New Hampshire the sixth state to have gay marriage. The law will take effect January 1, 2010.\n Send / Share\n Add Comment\n The Senate passed the equal marriage compromise bill this morning; this afternoon, the House passed the bill 198-176. \n \n \"With Gov. Lynch signing legislation passed by the state Senate and House, New Hampshire has become the latest state to recognize that loving, committed couples, and their families, should receive equal dignity and respect under the law,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. \"No religious institution will have to recognize any marriage under this law, as the language proposed by Gov. Lynch and agreed to by the legislature made abundantly clear.\"\n \n Only Rhode Island is the outlier in New England - the very Catholic state will be a much longer fight, even though a May poll showed that most Rhode Islanders actually favor a gay marriage bill.\n Five states-California, New Jersey, Oregon, Nevada (effective October 1, 2009), and Washington (as of July 26, 2009, pending possible repeal effort)-plus Washington, D.C. provide same-sex couples with access to the state level benefits and responsibilities of marriage, through either civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n Hawaii provides same-sex couples with limited rights and benefits. New York recognizes marriages by same-sex couples validly entered into outside of New York. The New York legislature is considering marriage legislation that would permit same-sex couples to marry in those states, and the D.C. Council has passed legislation that would recognize marriages by same-sex couples legally entered into in other jurisdictions (that legislation is going through a Congressional review period).\n Same-sex couples do not receive federal rights and benefits in any state. HRC has an great interactive map of marriage equality state-by-state.",

   "From what I read, the \"reversal\" of the previous vote was due to two factors:\n 1) Not all Democrat gay marriage supporters were present,\n 2) A few congress people reversed their decision for what I suspect was a mis-placed distrust of the additional conditions.\n If the additions just covered churches not having to hold weddings in the religious (not business) church building and clergy from having to perform the wedding, that's superfluous and covered by the existing 1st amendment and existing precedent.\n \n Glad to see NH got their act together!",
