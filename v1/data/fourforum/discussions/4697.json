People can and will claim all sorts of beliefs in order to avoid any work at all.\n \n\n Again, from the law:\n \n\n A health care provider may assert his or her conscientious objection under any of the following conditions: \n (a) Upon being offered employment. \n (b) At the time the health care provider adopts [an] ethical, moral, or religious belief system that conflicts with participation in a health care service. \n (c) Within 24 hours after he or she is asked or has received notice that he or she is scheduled to participate in a health care service to which he or she conscientiously objects. \n Sec. 7. (1) An employer shall retain a health care provider's written objection filed under section 5 for the duration of the health care provider's employment. The written objection is valid for the duration of the health care provider's employment or until rescinded by the health care provider in writing.\n (2) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (3), after \n receiving a written objection pursuant to section 5, an employer \n shall not require the objecting health care provider to provide or participate in the objectionable health care service.\n (3) If a health care provider asserts an objection under section 5 less than 24 hours prior to the scheduled health care service, the employer shall make a reasonable effort to exclude the health care provider from participating in the health careservice or find a replacement for the health care provider. If a replacement is unavailable and the health care provider cannot be excluded, the employer may require the health care provider to provide or participate in that health care service.  \n \n and further down:\n Subject to a collective bargaining agreement, if a health care provider asserts an objection to a health care service that at the time the objection is asserted constitutes a regular or substantial portion of the health care provider's current and defined position, the employer may give the health care provider not less than 60 days' notice of the termination of his or her employment. As used in this section, \"regular or substantial portion\" means that 10% or more of the health care provider'sdaily or weekly hours of duty consist of providing or participating in that health care service. \n \n \n There are plenty of cavaets in this law. The employer also has the right to terminate an employee if their refusal involves regularly performed practices constituting <10% of their workload. \n \n \n\n Third, mandating that businesses make accomodations for the various religious beliefs of their employees when those employees are perfectly capable of completing the tasks requested of them is an imposition of government into business when it does not belong there.\n\n \n This coming from a man who is hellbent on forcing businesses to pay for same-sex partner healthcare via governmental intervention and a redefining of the term marriage.

Neither I nor any other gay rights activist is arguing in favor of forcing businesses to pay for same-sex partner health care. What one of us might argue for is a rule that if an employer does choose to grant partner benefits, it cannot deny those benefits to certain employees based on the sexual orientation of those employees. It cannot treat employees in an unequal fashion based on sexual orientation. Because this is the law that I am arguing for, I am nothing but absolutely consistant. In both cases, I am stating that employees should not get special benefits because of their religious belief or lifestyle. I would be inconsistant only if my stance on this bill were anything other than it is.\n\n \n Well, let's see. If it was up to you and a company didn't offer same-sex couples benefits, you'd use the full power of Uncle Sam to either make sure that they did or ruin it for everyone. Does that about sum up your non-governmental intervention philosophy? :)\n \n\n As for redefining the word marriage; that really isn't relevant to this bill at all. Altering the definition of a word is neither a legal issue nor does it have anything to do with this bill.\n Understand my argument, and you should see why I take the stance I do on this issue.\n\n I see you arguing against government intervention into business except in cases in which gays would be denied equal benefits as hetero couples, then you're gungho on intervention. You can wordsmith your position however you chose but the bottom line is what I stated above. Sorry.",

   "No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You're right, it did not mention those groups, it only mentioned groups who have a history of or are likely to be discriminated against, but should not be. Yet it strangely did not mention the group most likely to be discriminated against.\n \n \nThat's a maximum, not an average. You're looking at worst case scenarios for the improbable. I hope that you're not a gambler. :) \n\n \n True, it may be a maximum, but the law is still wrong based on principle. It is a law based on skirting work without punishment, and even if it is only 1% of their work, that is still more than is reasonable to allow.\n \n \nWell, let's see. If it was up to you and a company didn't offer same-sex couples benefits, you'd use the full power of Uncle Sam to either make sure that they did or ruin it for everyone. Does that about sum up your non-governmental intervention philosophy? :)\n\n \n That is correct. If a company offered benefits to white people, I would bring down the full power of the government to make sure those benefits are granted to everyone or ruin them for everyone. No company should be allowed to give special treatment based on race or gender, just as no company should be allowed to give special treatment based on sexual orientation. Yeah, it's government imposition, but we cannot allow people unequal access to employment and compensation in a society founded on capitalism.\n \n \nI see you arguing against government intervention into business except in cases in which gays would be denied equal benefits as hetero couples, then you're gungho on intervention. You can wordsmith your position however you chose but the bottom line is what I stated above. Sorry.\n\n \n I am arguing that businesses should not be allowed to grant special or preferential treatment based on religion or a set of beliefs. This bill not only allows businesses to engage in that preferential treatment, it forces them to do so. I support government intervention when it is necessary to protect the equal employment opportunity of all individuals; I do not support government intervention where it grants special bonuses and privledges based on religion or morality. The point should be clear here that I would support government interfention to preserve equality, not to destroy it, and that was not conveyed in your portrayal of my argument.\n \n That being said, I'm still a bit conflicted over whether businesses should be allowed to choose who to grant benefits to. I mean, they are private businesses. But I do believe that I would support what I have said above: that businesses should not be allowed to grant bonuses based on an arbitrary factor. To do so could certainly result in atmospheres similar to those that immigrants faced in the earlier 1900's, where they were not really able to find employment or equal compensation anywhere because of their ethnicity. We should grant people equal access to employment benefits.",

   "I'm actually surprised no one has raise this issue in this forum as of yet. The bill: \n http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2003-2004/billengrossed/house/htm/2003-HEBH-5006.htm \n \n Would allow healthcare providers to refuse treatment to patients based on the providers' personal ethical, moral or religious beliefs. The potential of negative impact on GLBT community healthcare would be phenomenal in scope. This bill would allow physicians/healthcare providers to opt out of procedures and services while being protected from legal responsibility. \n \n A 365Gay.com article mentions: \"Opponents of the bills said they're worried they would allow providers to refuse service for any reason. For example, they said an emergency medical technicians could refuse to answer a call from the residence of gay couple because they don't approve of homosexuality. \" \n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon04/04/042204MichMed.htm\n \n This unconscionable violation of the Hippocratic Oath would create an overwhelming caseload burden to physicians who would still agree to treat gays and lesbians.\n\n \n \n Do your read things before you post them? it refers to giving a type of service.
