   "There is a difference between treating someone with respect and actually respecting them. The British government seems to be supporting a policy of respect in that they would like people to treat each other with respect. I would support them in such a policy. They certainly cannot dictate that people actually feel respect for others, in the sense of admiring or even agreeing with them, and I don't think that they are trying to do that.\n \n The whole political correctness movement was aimed at promoting such respectful treatment, or at least discouraging disrespect. One can certainly argue that the PC movement has gone way too far in discouraging any discussion of differences between groups of people whatsoever, but you would have to admit that the world is a better place since it has become socially unacceptable to use words such as nigger, spic, kike, etc. I am fully supportive of efforts on the British government side of discouraging any such generalized disrespectful treatment.",
