   "\"Darwin Day\" (Darwin's birthday) is February 12. On February 8 of this year, there will be a Darwin Day lecture featuring Richard Dawkins speaking on the topic, \"Is Evolution Predictable?\". For those of us who can't make it to University of Central Lancashire for that event, there will apparently be a webcast. \n \n For more info: http://www.uclan.ac.uk/psychology/bully/darwin/",
