Kerry: \"i'm the man for the job\"; bush: \"we will stay the course\". clueless and repelitive, the only effective ways politicians can get through to the public\n \n its utterly disheartening that none of these leaders would actually have anything to say that implied they actually got the message of bin laden's speech. bin laden made some strong observations in his message\n - he attacked america because he felt america injustly attacked muslims\n - bush's mentality is not much different from that of tyrants and monarchs in ME\n - bush literally let him get away with murder\n - bush is doing the same things that ****** bin laden off in the first place, i.e. destroying sovereign land in ME\n \n mind you this is not an endorsement for kerry, who is even more guilty of being clueless than bush. the choice really comes down to deliberately decietful vs clueless. which is worse?",

We arenotatwar with the middle eastern civilians. We are at war with the terrorists in the middle east. I can't understand we you are having so much trouble with this one. The \"Bad Guys\" are in the middle east. Hence we go to the middle east and go after them. Not every one, only the ones that want to kill us. \n \n During world war two we went to Franceto fight Nazi's. Some french civilians died during the event. We went to war against the nazi's not the French. Itjust happened to be in France. Same scenario here. The bad guys are in the middle east. We go there kill the bad guys in the middle east, not every one in the middle east, the bad guys that want to kill us that are in the middle east. Those are the ones we are after. What is so hard to understand?\n \n As far as your black analogy, If a black guy commits a crime. We send the cop to where the black guy might be hangin out. Probably where he feels safe, if that is Africa then sobeit. We don't go after everyone in Africa, just the guy that committed the crime (or act of war in this case.)",

Again all or nothing on your part.\n \n \n for the rich... this has been beaten to death\n I am not rich and yet I recieved a tax cut.\n \n \n there is absolutely nothing admirable about going against the wishes of the people you serve. this point shows that bush has no interest in the public, but seeks his own agenda, regardless of how much the people protest. go democracy!\n \n What about the other half of the population that think we should be there? They don't count? In fact it was more than half of the nation when we decided to go. Even Kerry and Edwards were on our side.\n \n \n \n thanks, i was really starting to wonder what good came out of this administration. you really cleared that up for me\n\n \n Your welcome.

Reduction of risk is the name of the game here.\n\n opportunistic? you think bin laden depended on luck for the wtc atacks? the operation was carefully and deliberately detailed. bin laden is an accomplished psychopath, and the most dangerous weapon he possess is his sick imagination and undying radicalism. by spending billions of dollars in colonizing iraq we are showing bin laden that we learned nothing about this type of warfare. we are trying to win an unconventional war by taking away his access to conventional weapons? if bin laden depended on conventional weapons, then yeah, maybe what we're doing might remotely seem like a good idea. obviously, by withholding wmds from bin laden he is just as dangerous as he has always been. yet we are convinced that we are safer\n \n \nAs I said earlier, Bin Laden is an elusive and potentially impossible target to catch- the cells that carry out his wishes do not enjoy that safety.\n\n occams, let me paint a picture of how america operates when we're trying to take out a target. when we we're planning to kill saddam for \"not complying with sanctions/inspections\", the first thing we did was level his palace with arial attacks. then, during the next week or so, we level every building we had even the slightest suspicion saddam was in, with aerial attacks. we totally destroyed restaurants, hotels, resorts, offices, just in case he was in there (along with the other innocent occupants, of course). after we put 140,000 troops on the ground to comb out the area, we found him in what, under 3 months?\n \n in afghanistan, we struck campsites and terrorist ranches, mainly in the deserted country areas far from the cities. then we put down about 12,000 troops on the ground to flush out the rest of the taliban, of course, this was 2 months after 9/11 and al qaeda had already packed up shop and cleared out. yes, we had bin laden and the taliban on the run, but thats nothing to celebrate, because they're still at large, so mission failed.\n \n right now we are fighting a war that has been going on in afghanistan maybe over 15 years. the rebels in the north are fighting our troops, which replaced the taliban. the guys we are shooting at are probably mostly enemies of al qaeda, yet we chalk them up as \"terrorists\" and figure we're doing a great job by killing all these afghan resistance fighters. \n \n so what are our guys dying for? and why havent we eliminated al qaeda yet?",

   "would you then say that our loss of nearly 1200 troops in iraq means we are fighting an even more determined opponent there? afghanistan is only 1 part of the multi-national network that makes up al qaeda. i doubt 1/5th of al qaeda was stationed there. not to mention the wider islamic jihad, an even bigger network of which al qaeda was only part. much of al qaeda is still in saudi arabia, jordan, egypt, yemen and lebanon. afghanistan was considered the based at the time, but it was far from the biggest segment. even if we've taken out 3/4ths of al qaeda operatives in afghanistan alone, its nothing to cheer about if your goal is to wipe out all of al qaeda \"wherever they may be\" (bush's own words)\n\n \n I would say the US is committed on a much greater scale in Iraq than in Afghanistan. The main combat environment is very challenging- urbanised areas where there is armed insurgency. I think the casualties (lets not forget the 8000 plus WIA's either and those of other coalition countries) are a consequence of those circumstances.\n \n I think you are being overly harsh with regard to what is achieved in Afghanistan- it was the principle location where operatives could be trained out of the eye of governments. The denial of such resources to Al-Qaeda forces them to find new locations if they wish to maintain even levels of activity.\n \n \nopportunistic? you think bin laden depended on luck for the wtc atacks? the operation was carefully and deliberately detailed. bin laden is an accomplished psychopath, and the most dangerous weapon he possess is his sick imagination and undying radicalism. by spending billions of dollars in colonizing iraq we are showing bin laden that we learned nothing about this type of warfare. we are trying to win an unconventional war by taking away his access to conventional weapons? if bin laden depended on conventional weapons, then yeah, maybe what we're doing might remotely seem like a good idea. obviously, by withholding wmds from bin laden he is just as dangerous as he has always been. yet we are convinced that we are safer\n\n \n To use the more modern term, I would not consider Osama Bin Laden as a sociopath. Such categorisations along the lines of mental illness are distinctly unhelpful here as all they serve to do is distract people from the real nature of the opponent in hand, and underestimate the threat that exists. Given the highly emotive nature of this subject I appreciate this is not always easy.\n \n To elaborate on my description of Al-Qaeda as \"opportunistic\" bear in mind the nature of the organisation. Its structure is often described as being analogous to a bunch of grapes hanging from a tree. The core of the organisation is the tree (i.e Bin Laden and his immediate retinue) and the grapes are the various operations that the tree supports. There is little \"middle management\" and operations are evaluated and funded via direct contact between the tree and the grape. This is the main reason why it is so difficult to oppose- a new \"grape\" can form locally without any backing from the the organisation. If the \"tree\" learns of this it can investigate the grape and supply resources to it directly with a minimum amount fuss. It then leaves the newly nourished grape to grow on its own and exceute an attack. Bearing this in mind, Al-Qaeda is opportunistic when compared to other terrorist groups such as the IRA and ETA who have highly hierarchical organistations and hardly ever use personnel from outside their groups. \n \n \noccams, let me paint a picture of how america operates when we're trying to take out a target. when we we're planning to kill saddam for \"not complying with sanctions/inspections\", the first thing we did was level his palace with arial attacks. then, during the next week or so, we level every building we had even the slightest suspicion saddam was in, with aerial attacks. we totally destroyed restaurants, hotels, resorts, offices, just in case he was in there (along with the other innocent occupants, of course). after we put 140,000 troops on the ground to comb out the area, we found him in what, under 3 months?\n\n \n Yes, I think thats a fair appraisal- remember the ice cream vans that were bombed in the first Gulf War because there was a tip off the Saddam might be moving around in them?\n \n However, you are looking at this with too narrow a view- all that activity did not bag Saddam but it certainly destroyed sections of the government apparatus that allowed him to function as the leader of Iraq. It was largely academic when the US did capture him, particularly following the deaths of his sons as he was not a threat without the governement to carry out his wishes.\n \n \nin afghanistan, we struck campsites and terrorist ranches, mainly in the deserted country areas far from the cities. then we put down about 12,000 troops on the ground to flush out the rest of the taliban, of course, this was 2 months after 9/11 and al qaeda had already packed up shop and cleared out. yes, we had bin laden and the taliban on the run, but thats nothing to celebrate, because they're still at large, so mission failed.\n\n \n I respond to this as I did in my initial two paragraphs.\n \n \nright now we are fighting a war that has been going on in afghanistan maybe over 15 years. the rebels in the north are fighting our troops, which replaced the taliban. the guys we are shooting at are probably mostly enemies of al qaeda, yet we chalk them up as \"terrorists\" and figure we're doing a great job by killing all these afghan resistance fighters.\n \n so what are our guys dying for? and why havent we eliminated al qaeda yet?\n\n \n Calling an enemy a terrorist in this context is meaningless I agree. Sadly, US/UK troops in Afghanistan now have to come to grips with the fact it is a divided country and their presence is not welcome in certain areas.\n \n As to Al-Qaeda it is certainly still functional, but its activities have been curtailed. Do you think inaction over Afghanistan would have been a sound strategy? As much as I despise the misery this conflict has brought to people on both sides I do not see apathy as an adequate response.\n \n This is a sad truth for us in the West- this is not a war of set-piece battles and decisive campaigns but one of slow low level struggle against an opponent who is very different to those our armies are structured to fight: we need to adjust our expectations and strategy/tactics accordingly.",

   "here's my idea of what might be a sound strategy for eliminating al qaeda\n \n first of all, strike afghanistan hard and fast. while debris of the twin towers were still smoldering we would hit all the camps and ranches, drop in special forces and soldiers in afghanistan and immediately arrest all the taliban leaders and anybody else involved in supporting al qaeda\n \n next step, run through both pakistan and iran simultaneously, lead by intelligence and installed informers (which we already have, or should have, in every foriegn country anyway). in similar fashion to an fbi drug raid, our guys would rush any known or suspected location that al qaeda members would be housed in\n \n while maintaining an eye on afghanistan, the next step would be to send a military presence into jordan, yemen, syria, saudi arabia and egypt, as well as a diplomatic presence, to work on the immediate dismantling of all and any terrorist organizations there. we would work with their personnel, but this would be our project, overseen by our officers. for these countries we would work with the government officials and their law enforcement. \n \n at this time we would also have diplomats in iran and pakistan explaining the urgency of our actions there. we shouldnt have to ask permission to hunt our criminals, especially in the light of such a tragedy as what occured on 9/11. \n \n in about a year or so, with the pledges and assurances of these states to remain terrorist-free, we could pull out of these countries. i have no doubt that the UN and international community would have a problem with such a demand.\n \n by providing these states with resources and training to help them keep their states terrorist free (meticulously checked by our embassy there before apprval) we would be able to give them an incentive to help us find bin laden and his aides. once bin laden and any other figure suitable to be his successor was caught and killed...\n \n \n \n ...then....\n \n \n \n \n \n we could invade iraq, depose saddam and rape the oil fields!\n \n \n to me, thats putting your priorities in perspective",

   "Well, I'd suggest that would not work well. The combat environment there is extremely testing and the tempo of operations requires troops of the highest physical and mental capacity. That means elite infantry with specific expertise (ie. Royal Marines who are trained to fight in arctic warfare conditions) and special forces such as the SAS and Delta Force. If the SAS has lost nearly 10% of its current strength in dead that speaks volumes as to how difficult the fighting is.\n \n Put troops in there who cannot cope with the altiude and temperatures and all you get is lots of non-combat related casualties and a low efficency in the operations that are conducted.\n \n Simply throwing lots of troops at the mountain holdouts and tunnel systems in Afghanistan is not the answer- specialists are needed and they are few in number.\n\n \n What a crock. You can become aclimated to any altitude in 10 days, and the Us army issues cold weather gear to our soldiers. The purpose of arctic training (been there, done that) has nothign to do with getting used to the cold, it is to teach you to fight with no cover, in an environment where it is almost impossible to judge deistance and your body heat looks like a bowtorck on IR.\n \n the majoprity of the troops we have in Afghanistan right now are from the 25th Infantry Division from Hawaii. they seem to be surviving the cold just fine.\n \n I don't know why you keep mentining delta force, since they are not operating in Afghanistan. Delta force specialises in urban combat, covert ops, and hostage recovery. We are not doing any of that in the mountains of Afghanistan.\n \n The special ops troops we currently have in afghanistan are limited to the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Special Forces Group and the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. We have plenty of Rangers (which are roughly equivelent to the SAS). They are certinaly not rare or few in number.\n \n The reason the SAS is taking 10% casualties is that there is so much cover in the mountains that the enemy can engage from cover, then retreat under cover, never giving our guys a decent shot at any of them. This is why in such terrain it is essential to have plenty of troops on the ground, so you have manpower available to flank the enemy whenever you manage to fix their position (usually when they are shooting at you). \n \n The way we are fighting it now, most likely outnumbered, fighting an enemy with superior familiarity with the terrain and apparently the support of the indigenous population, is just stupid. Nobody who has beed through any combat training would condone fighting in that terrain, under these circumstances, in the manner we have chosen to do battle. It is simply not how it is done. The enemy has ALL the advantages, and the terrain cancels out the advantages that US and british troops usually enjoy (air superiority, advanced vehicles and long range weapons). \n \n This is entirely contrary to \"the book\". Currently, we are fighting a poorly equipped enemy with little or no resupply in a region with plenty of cover (which works both ways) and no real supply problems of our own. It should be liek taking candy from a baby. BUT, you need the manpower to do the job. Without the proper level of staffing, we WILL NOT win there. It simply cannot be done.",

People no longer know how to fend for themselves as they've been taken care of for so long by overwhelming prosperity that the idea of self-preservation will mean you'd need your own private army to protect what those currently receiving government checks would suddenly demand. \n \n I voted for Bush the first time around, but am still in awe of his fiscal irresponsibility. He just keeps spending it without regard as to where its supposed to come from and claims he's keeping us safe. If that's not playing into AQ hands with their stated goal of harming us in a financial manner, especially the keeping us safe blather, perhaps I'm not reading the correct financial analysis of our debt, trade imbalance, government spending and fading currency values.\n\n I am not argueing the fact that we are in financial trouble, we most certainly are. I am argueing that we have money flowwing out of every orifice. The war being only one of those orifice. I am argue that we can stop sending 19 Billion dollars to fight Aids in Africa. You tell me what is more of a threat to the USA, AIDS in Africa or Terrorism. I arguing that we are slanthering money all over a school system that that absolutly sucks at educating kids, while countries all over this planet are teaching their kids more for less money.\n Iam argueing that we are incouraging Mexicans to come across the border and go to our emergency room because we allow it to happen.\n \n You want fiscal responsiblity. Start at your house. Buy your own drugs, food,doctor visits, and then help run the citizens of other coutryies out of here so they stop sucking the tit.\n \n I am argueing that fiscal irresponsibility goes beyond the war on terror and you should be the first to realize that Mr. Finance. If you are so concerned about spending why on earht did you vote for some one that wanted to ad more government funded programs? \n \n AGAIN, yes the war on Iraq is expensive. NO DOUBT! That is all you type into your computer day after day on this site. Fiscal irresponsibility goes way beyond the war on terror so open your eyes and look around. Our troubles will not magically disappear if we bring the troops home tomorrow.",

Weird.\n Is the money being spent to find a cure or vaccine, or is it being spent in attempts to change behavior and culture? If it's either, and progress is being made that may one day wipe out AIDS, then spend it.\n \n And spending $6 billion on our crappy school system isn't going to make it less crappy, but if the schools became awesome and in doing so needed more than 6 billion to work, I say spend it. \n \n I think what you may be arguing for is more sensible usage of the money spent on social things (like schools and medical research) in an order to be more frugal with taxpayer money.\n \n If that's the case, then the largest area of spending that we can start to attack is the Pentagon Budget. That's the place where (at least at one time) toilet seats cost $ 1000 a piece and a hammer costs $1500 and stuff like that. Did they cut out that sort of thing or did it become so commonplace in the half trillion dollar yearly defense budgets that we just don't hear about it anymore?

That is all you type into your computer day after day on this site. Fiscal irresponsibility goes way beyond the war on terror so open your eyes and look around. Our troubles will not magically disappear if we bring the troops home tomorrow.\n\n \n I'm not a follower of this site, but they do have some handy numbers taken from the US Treasury website without going through the boilerplate hurrahs required to find actual numbers in a federal website. Take a look at the chart and tell me where the largest outlay of tax money goes:\n \n http://www.warresisters.org/piechart.htm\n \n If you have the time and inclination, you can plow through actual budget line items and it quickly becomes apparent that there's another huge chunk of military expenditures booked to other agencies.\n \n I'm not saying bring the troops home from Iraq, we're far past that point. I'm saying our deficit ridden economy is now dominated by military\n spending through debt, a multiple of the combined spending of the next 25 nations, and consumer spending, also by debt, is 20% above the norm for a developed nation. Do you honestly believe those levels are sustainable with a shrinking tax base? Our defense spending is accelerated by retaliation to our support of Israel's expansionist policies and I have no acceptable solution to that problem, but somebody needs to take the bull by the horns and solve it, Jewish lobby or no Jewish lobby. Until that's resolved, plan on 'more of the same' from a growing and ever-stronger AQ, with a siege mentality of consumer spending by consumers from government 'duck, but we're protecting you' mentality. \n \n If you honestly believe that a reduction of domestic social programs will help solve our financial problems, then you haven't taken a close look at how we actually spend our tax money. Expansion of federal government and military spending is forcing former shared tax revenue expenses down to state and municipal levels, a major reason that I recently chose a residence state with a constitution that requires a popular majority vote to increase taxation or government services. As to the $19-billion of public money for AIDS related problems on the African Continent, please provide a reference. Our total public annual foreign non-military aid is under $30-billion. \n \n Like others, given our failing economy, I'm all for domestic social spending to keep the have-nots contained in or near inner-cites where those funds/living supplements are dispersed and avoid large personal investments in contemporary security devices and ammunition/kill bonuses/living quarters for personal guards. I could care less about the standard of living in Iraq or anywhere else, but I do care about preserving what I've earned. If a Mexican is the person who provides me with an honest days labor at a wage suitable for that labor, I don't care if he/she's here illegally when the alternative is an 'American' who feels I should subsidize his/her standard of living because that's the American Dream. To me, it's a supply and demand issue. Being a fiscally conservative individual to maintain the wealth of our country has absolutely never had anything to do with moral obligations or the little man, something the Republican Party has tossed in the ditch for purposes of popularity and heading our country towards fiscal ruin.",

   "That has led us into the position we are in today. I was not advocating punishment for our own people in order to fund war. I was suggesting that we get back to a society that stands on its own two feet. I was suggesting that we stop paying people for sitting on their XXX or having babies and encourage them to go to work. I was suggesting that we privatize the failing social programs, not take them away. \n \n I know, I know, its a wild and crazy idea. Having people actually pay for the goods and services they recieve is outlandish, but if you are as concerned about our finacial situation as you present yourself to be, then purhaps you should look at the money we give away. Rather than skimp on the safety of America we should be less generous to some of the dead beats within our country and those outside of it that are truely responsible for \"bleeding us dry\"\n\n well if this isnt the epitomy of irony...\n \n while you are speaking against our public's dependence of handouts, at the same time you are supporting the government giving away a hundred times that amount in handouts to the iraqis. bush's plan includes the biggest foreign giveaway in history. i'd say, in agreement with your sentiments, that those iraqi people get up on their feet and learn to earn and support themselves, dont you?",
