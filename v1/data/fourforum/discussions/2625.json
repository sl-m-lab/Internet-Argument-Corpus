   "First of all, I am tired of hearing African Americans complain about how they need reparations for the pain and suffering of their relatives. If my math is right, the youngest slave, if he was living today, would be 139 years old (assuming he was born on the day slavery ended, technically not even making him a slave). To my knowledge, nobody in the world is that old. Therefore, unless you are the son/daughter of a slave, keep your mouth shut. You are entitled to nothing for what people you don't even know went through (to my knowledge whites were slaves in Rome. Do we now ask for reparations 2000 years later? NO). My great-great grandfather, who was Irish and immigrated here in the late 1800s, was discriminated against just like blacks were. He was harassed just as much, if not more, than blacks. I do not think I am entitled to any form of reparation because of what he went through, and neither should you. For those of you who may not know, segregation ended in 1961. That was 43 years ago. Most of the people who Affirmative Action is targeted to are younger (college students and first time job seekers). They were not around to witness what it was like prior to 1961, so I don't see what they are complaining about. They enjoy the EXACT same freedoms and rights as all other Americans do. \n \n You would think that after nearly 50 years since being given these freedoms, that blacks would have taken advantage of them and bettered themselves just like every other American has done. My family, through hard work and dedication and no handouts from the government, prospered and found a way to make a good living. It just seems like nowadays blacks are just asking for handouts. Why should we give you these freebies when your population is committing the most crimes, has the worst pregnancy rates, and has the worst education statistics?\n \n My first issue deals with the blacks having the worst crime rates. In the US, according to the 2000 census, there were roughly 280,000,000 citizens. Of this, 69% are whites and 12% are black. This means that there were approximately 6 times as many whites in the US as there were blacks. So you would think most of the crimes committed were done by whites, since they have 6 times as many people. Wrong. In 2002, just as many whites were murdered as blacks, even though whites make up nearly 70% of the population. Blacks commit almost 35% of crimes a year, although whites have 7 times as many people.\n \n One of the most alarming facts I have seen is the teen pregnancy rate among blacks. Each year, 20% of black women aged 15-19 become pregnant, compared to just 8% of white women. This is one of the main reasons why there are ghettos, because young black females have children at such a young age. They can't provide for the kid, and thus have to resort to living in bad neighborhoods where crime runs rampant; this is their choice, so they should have to pay for their consequences, not other people. Not only is it teen pregnancy, but pregnancy overall. The sons of teen mothers are 13 percent more likely to end up in prison while teen daughters are 22 percent more likely to become teen mothers themselves. This goes back to the crime issue. I also find it funny that most black women disapprove of abortion (nearly 60%). However, 40% of abortions each year are performed on black women (which only make up 15% of the women of childbearing age in the US). Make up your mind. If you're against abortion, then don't get pregnant and then ask the government to pay for your abortion or your kid. Black women also have more children out of wedlock than do whites. 25 percent of all births in 1994 were out of wedlock. However, 66% of the births to black women were out of wedlock, almost 4 times as high as whites. If you want to better your life, stop having kids at a young age. It's actually pretty cheap to do...you can buy condoms for about $20 a month or you can get an abortion each 6 months for $500. I would take the easy $20 way out. But that's just my opinion.\n \n My last issue is education. Affirmative Action is mainly targeted towards the universities. The following facts just blow my mind. In 2001, the US Department of Instruction found that the overall graduation rate for high school students was 90%. Whites graduated at a rate of 95%, while blacks at only 60%. Not only is this true for high school, but also elementary school and middle school. Dropout rates for white students were 1%, while it was over 4% for blacks. Of the 772 four-year schools with student bodies that are at least 5 percent black, nearly 40 percent graduated fewer than 30 percent of their black students. Sixty-eight schools, or nearly 10 percent, graduated fewer than 10 percent. If it comes down to the decision of choosing a black or a white student of equal ability and credentials, why would any sane and logical person with these facts be obligated or willing to choose a black? I mean unless they want to lower their graduation rates or have them possibly commit a crime. \n \n If blacks want something, then work for it. Killing people and dropping out of school isn't going to help it. There are many great blacks in the world now. Look at Colin Powell (or Condoleeza Rica, Jesse Jackson, the new CEO of AOL Time Warner, Al Sharpton, and Bill Cosby). Powell grew up in a poor neighborhood in New York, but somehow managed to become a leader in the military and also Secretary of State, without Affirmative Action. So please don't let me ever hear that because you are poor, you have no way to make something of your life. I am tired of blacks saying that. Get up off your *** and do something for yourself. And for blacks that claim that Affirmative Action isn't based on race, get a clue. Poor whites don't get the same treatment as poor blacks. How many black bums do you see? They are mostly old white men, and why is this so? Because the government, under Affirmative Action, is giving all the help to poor minorities. Vietnam Veterans are a testament to this. They put their life on the line for this country, and most of them are poor and out on the street (over 65% of veterans are whites). You have done nothing for this country expect bitch and moan about how you can't take care of 5 kids from 4 fathers. Just a hypothetical question to all the ignorant blacks out there who think race isn't the premise of Affirmative Action. Assume that whites were the minority and blacks were the majority. Say you had worked hard in school and graduated from a good university. You are now applying for a job. Someone else, a white person, is also applying. You are both just as qualified for the job as the other. However, you don't get the job because they gave it to the white person. How would you feel? It would eventually lead to you probably hating whites because they got all the jobs that you were just as qualified for. Well that is how about 190,000,000 white Americans feel when you get jobs and we don't. It leads to racism, which I think is partly justified in this case. If the shoe was on the other foot, blacks would probably feel just the same as whites do today, ****** off because we work just as hard and get turned down because they need to meet a quota. If blacks don't like it here, feel free to move to another country. I suggest somewhere in Africa. Then you will have a taste of what poverty is really like. Some African countries have a life expectancy of 30 years and AIDS is prevalent in more than 30% of the population. This is where African Americans originally came from, so if you want to be a majority and with your own culture, go back there. Then you will truly cherish what it is to be in America. My suggestion...if you don't like it here, get the hell out of the country. Then we will have less to deal with.\n \n All this being said, I think that when people are filling out an application, there should be no space for race. This would help reduce whatever discrimination may occur. However, it is impossible to guarantee that nobody will be discriminated against. White people get discriminated upon by blacks, but you don't hear about it as much because most blacks will take any opportunity they can to criticize what whites are doing. This way, the hiring process or admissions process will be done blindly, not knowing what the candidate looks like or what his race may be.",

   "How did you come to the conclusion that I was making self-righteous generalizations? I just call it like I see it. These facts are from the US government, therefore they are pretty reliable. So, I used them to argue my case why I don't like Affirmative Action. If you can't handle what the facts say, then please don't look at them. \"And point an accusing finger at all blacks\". That might be the stupidest comment I have ever heard. Please let me know when I pointed a finger at \"ALL\" blacks. I could have used Hispanics, but you don't hear them complaining all the time about why they didn't get into a school. \n \n \n \n There is not a thing on that list that white people aren't also guilty of. Where is your bigoted accusing finger for them? When white people are guilty of teen pregnancy, poverty, whining, crime, abortion - there is some other reason, right. Only when your black does it have something to do race.\n \n \n Did I ever say white people don't commit crimes, have children out of wedlock, or drop out of school? I believe I didn't. I also included stats for whites AND blacks, so I don't quite understand why you are whining that I pointed a bigoted finger. My so-called bigoted finger was actually typing REAL facts, just so you know that. Notice how I gave the stats for whites and blacks so you can compare the issues I was talking about. You must be a XXXXX if you didn't see that. Read it again so you can see or get your eyes checked. I used the stats to prove my point why there should be no Affirmative Action. Why do we owe minorities something, and why should they expect something, when they are costing the country the most money? Those are facts, which I think speak for themselves. I didn't sugarcoat them. I gave them to you exactly like I saw them. If you can't accept the fact that blacks commit the most crimes, have the highest rate of teen pregnancy, and highest drop out rate, then you are an ignorant human being and need to seek help. \n \n \n \n \n I can only hope and pray that people don't read your post and think that all whites think like you, but just in case I would like to point out that some white people think the attitude described above is garbage.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n That all whites think like me? How do you know what I think? I gave you facts, which to my knowledge aren't my opinions, they are true FACTS. You could probably ask almost any white person how they would feel if they were passed up on a job because of Affirmative Action, and they would say that they were ****** off. That is human nature. Get over it. Some people may think my post is garbage. I think yours is horsesh*t. Give me some facts that say that whites commit the most crimes and have the highest teen pregnancy rate and I will retract my statements. Until then, I hate to admit it to you, but I am correct in my use of statistics. Those facts support my opinion why Affirmative Action is a bad plan. Give me some facts why it is a good plan and I may think different. We live in an equal world today (so everyone needs to stop complaining. I am tired of hearing minorities complain about that). Everyone is treated equal (by the government, schools, etc). Some people may be racists, but that is a given. There are also blacks out there who hate whites. Does this make whites entitled to some freebies? no it doesn't. If we give stuff away to people because of their race, this makes us UNEQUAL. Is that what you want? I hope it's not because it will make a large amount of this country very upset and you might not like the results. Just a quick question. How come blacks can call whites crackers and it's ok, but if a white person calls a black person a nigger (which some black people often call each other), they get shot or beaten up? Is it ok that it's like thaT because they are a minority and are entitled to it? NO IT ISN'T. So get over your whining and bitching.",

   "Hey, I dare you to show your posts to your black friends ranting about how you hate black people. I wonder how long you would keep those friends.\n \n And before calling a ******* idiot, college boy, why don't you go and find out how affirmative action actually works. Nobody gets a handed a job just because of race. They do actually have to be qualified for it.\n \n Let's say you have six people, all are equally qualified for it, four are white, two are minorities. Having something like AA in place simply ensures that not all said qualified candidates are white. You see, believe it or not, there is still a lot of people who harbor negative stereotypes and misinformation about people of color, and a lot of these peope with these misconceptions are actually in positions of power. AA makes sure that the good ole white boys network does not just continue to hire good ole white boys.\n \n I have been turned down for many jobs in my life, and AA may very well have been one of the reasons. As that information is not generally diclosed I will never know. I just sought another job, rather than snivel and wonder who got it instead. I am quite gainfully employed, thank you.\n \n Oh and I take it back. Maybe you are not a bigot. I think you just hate everybody who does look, think, or agree with you.

   "Everyone did not help create this country. Canadians, Puerto Ricans, and Asians for example came after this country was founded. In Colonial America, it was mainly white Protestants. They started our country, government, and ideals. So I am not being racist, but not everyone helped create he United States.\n\n As everyone else is doing a fantastic job of countering your other incorrect/racist views, I'm going to be brief.\n \n \"Canadians\"- \"Canada\", as a Confederated settler-state, was largely populated by First Peoples, East Asians, Africans, Brits, and French people, the same people who were in the \"US\" at the time of the \"founding\", and the two \"countries\" as we know them did not yet exist. Therefore to say that \"Canadians\" are somehow a seperate people who \"came after this country was founded\" is completely false.\n \n Puerto-Ricans- Puerto-Rico is largely populated by a mixture of First Peoples, Africans, and Spanish Europeans. They thus have as much \"right\" to be anywhere in the Americas as white Europeans (if not more so). As well, the United States aggressive wars of expansionism into Puerto Rico (and Mexico), makes these peoples de facto citizens of the US, whether or not this is legally recognized. Lesson: if you don't want people coming into your neighborhood, don't drive them out of theirs.\n \n East Asians- Actually pre-date white Europeans in the West of the continent. There were East Asian fishing villages across the West coast from what is now Southern California to British Columbia. These East Asian fishing folk were well established for centuries before any pale faces were seen that far west- which makes sense, given proximity and the ease/speed of boating from Asia vs wagon riding from across the continent. Only after the (mostly East Asian built) cross continental railroad was finished did the Euro-Americans start coming East, massacring First Peoples to take their land. When white settlers came to the West Coast, they overtook the villages and the entire economy created by the East Asians, and drove them out with a violent race war- hanging people, burning villages, and boycotting anyone who hired their East Asian predecessors. \n \n So your entire \"story\" of a country of white Protestants is historically inaccurate.",

Last time I checked, some does not mean all. And I did not insert the word \"I\", so once again you are wrong. What if I said most whites don't hate minorities? Hate and minorities were in the same sentence. Does that imply something negative because those 2 magical words were in the same sentence? I think it's like how they do with the President and the word kill. They spy on our phone calls and emails, and if they hear \"hate\" and \"minority\" in the same sentence, they take you in for questioning. Hahahahahaha!!!! (I am actually laughing at your how bad you explained that)\n \n \"These places are to have a percentage of their folks be minorities. They do not have always give it to the minority, and they don't. I work for one the largest corporations in the world, one that adheres to AA and other diversity initiatives, and we are still predominantly white.\"\n That is pretty much the exact same thing I said. If a company has to have a certain percentage being minorities, then they have to pass up some whites that are just as qualified because they need to meet their percentage. For example (according to your interpretation), a white and black person are applying for a job or school and have the same credentials. However, Company/School XYZ has very few minorities and needs to hire more to meet the government's standards. The white gets turned down, not because he was any less intelligent than the minority, but because they had to meet their percentage. By definition that is discrimination. Waa Waa Waa Waa Waa! Maybe you work for one of the largest corporations in the world. I actually work for the most profitable company and the biggest and best bank in the world (CitiGroup). We are also predominantly white. Do you know why that is? Because the US is almost 70% white. Looking at it that way, approximately 70% of our employees and yours should be white (which makes us predominantly white). So you're argument there is totally irrelevant and makes no sense for your argument.\n \n \"Then how do you deal with the man in the mirror every day?\"\n I actually feel really good because I play baseball at a top 25 Division 1 school (full scholarship), I have a 4.0 in one of the top 25 business programs in the country (had a 4.75 in high school), and will graduate a year early and go to get my MBA/JD at The University of Virginia (top 10 in the country).

   "The member was correct in his views on the Irish being discriminated against. The difference between the Irish and most people of African descent is that people of Irish descent blend with the \"white\" population. It's the same with Jews. People looked down on others who had a darker skin complexion, especially after the Civil War. I am a person of mix African descent and I agree with some forms of Affirmative Action because, race was created in the world for economic exploitation for slavery. Before this, everyone was Irish, British, French, Nigerain, Ethiopian, Chinese, Persian,etc... I don't agree with giving anyone college points, but I believe in job diversity, and I am less than 12 percent of the population. We would never have needed affirmative action if people spoke up on behalf of blacks who were being discriminated against. These people did not care because their family were giving bank loans and treated like first class citizens. SOME of The Irish and the Jews did not want to be on the same level with the Blacks. Therefore, some of them joined in with the \"old families\" and started to discriminate, in order to make themselves feel privilege.

I can count on my hand how many CEO's are black, women, or hispanic. Racism and other isms exists. If we end Affirmative Action, will a person with an elite education by denied an opportunity by an employer simply because his or her skin color was too dark? What's the solution for Affirmative Action? Or do you believe that the racial #'s should not matter. I'm interested in you response.\n\n \n \n Where should I begin? \"Blacks did not have the same chance as whites\". Notice the term DID. They did not have the same chance back in the 60s, but NOW everyone has the same chance to make something of their life. I hate it when I hear people complain that today blacks are still not even close to where they should be in regards to this issue. That is plain ignorance. They have had the same rights as whites for almost 50 years, so don't complain to me that we need to let them catch up. \n \n \"Should we have a company that's 98 percent white. Should Harvard, Berkley, or Columbia be over 90 percent white?\"\n Maybe the minorities who apply aren't good enough to get in, or maybe they are discouraged to apply due to the academic reputation of the school. It isn't 90% whites just because the schools don't like minorities. It is because only a small number of minorities apply and may not have the skills that they are looking for. \n \n \"I can count on my hand how many CEO's are black, women, or hispanic.\"\n You must have a pretty big hand then. The CEO of Smith Barney is a 37 year old female who makes just as much as CEO (male) of CitiGroup. The new CEO of AOL Time Warner is black. That is just to name a few of the very prominent ones. \n \n \"Affirmative Action served as a form of reparation for the discrimination that has damaged people in America. No, I don't believe in slavery reparations, but the U.S. government institutionalized discrimination after slavery ended. Blacks were denied into the suburbs because of the color of their skin. How come people did not come to their defense! If someone had the same color skin as myself(but of different ethnic group) and If my ethnic group exploited them for centuries, mentally, physically, and economically, that group should be giving a form of reparation. \"\n Please stop living in the past. All of that happened 50 years ago and it's over. We don't owe people anything for stuff that didn't happen to them (AA is mainly for younger-middle aged).\n \n \"When was the last time you ever saw a black senator?\" \n That is a stupid comment. You could have said when was the last time you saw a black president? There probably won't be one for a while either. The people vote for the Senators. So it is not the whites fault there is no black senator; we vote for who we want, and if it isn't him, oh well. We vote for who we think will get the job done, not a black person just because we haven't had a black senator before.\n \n \"If we end Affirmative Action, will a person with an elite education by denied an opportunity by an employer simply because his or her skin color was too dark?

The reason they don't exist is because we stole all their land and massacred them. So I think they deserve their own month, like blacks (who did not nearly as much for the country as Indians did).\n \n \n \n \n Ok then if people aren't forced to celebrate a history month, we need a White History Month. You don't have to celebrate it if you don't want to, but I sure as hell will. Gay Pride Month is a terrible example. There's also a Gardeners and Horticulturist Month. That has nothing to do with race/gender/ethnicity. So throw that weak example out the door emoticon_xagree\n\n \n \n I respect you views on AA, but you need to create effective solutions on what can be substituted for it so ALL people will not suffer from discrimination.\n \n Bush and Cheney is a no no.

   "First of all, I am tired of hearing African Americans complain about how they need reparations for the pain and suffering of their relatives. If my math is right, the youngest slave, if he was living today, would be 139 years old (assuming he was born on the day slavery ended, technically not even making him a slave). To my knowledge, nobody in the world is that old. Therefore, unless you are the son/daughter of a slave, keep your mouth shut. You are entitled to nothing for what people you don't even know went through (to my knowledge whites were slaves in Rome. Do we now ask for reparations 2000 years later? NO). My great-great grandfather, who was Irish and immigrated here in the late 1800s, was discriminated against just like blacks were. He was harassed just as much, if not more, than blacks. I do not think I am entitled to any form of reparation because of what he went through, and neither should you. For those of you who may not know, segregation ended in 1961. That was 43 years ago. Most of the people who Affirmative Action is targeted to are younger (college students and first time job seekers). They were not around to witness what it was like prior to 1961, so I don't see what they are complaining about. They enjoy the EXACT same freedoms and rights as all other Americans do. \n \n You would think that after nearly 50 years since being given these freedoms, that blacks would have taken advantage of them and bettered themselves just like every other American has done. My family, through hard work and dedication and no handouts from the government, prospered and found a way to make a good living. It just seems like nowadays blacks are just asking for handouts. Why should we give you these freebies when your population is committing the most crimes, has the worst pregnancy rates, and has the worst education statistics?\n \n My first issue deals with the blacks having the worst crime rates. In the US, according to the 2000 census, there were roughly 280,000,000 citizens. Of this, 69% are whites and 12% are black. This means that there were approximately 6 times as many whites in the US as there were blacks. So you would think most of the crimes committed were done by whites, since they have 6 times as many people. Wrong. In 2002, just as many whites were murdered as blacks, even though whites make up nearly 70% of the population. Blacks commit almost 35% of crimes a year, although whites have 7 times as many people.\n \n One of the most alarming facts I have seen is the teen pregnancy rate among blacks. Each year, 20% of black women aged 15-19 become pregnant, compared to just 8% of white women. This is one of the main reasons why there are ghettos, because young black females have children at such a young age. They can't provide for the kid, and thus have to resort to living in bad neighborhoods where crime runs rampant; this is their choice, so they should have to pay for their consequences, not other people. Not only is it teen pregnancy, but pregnancy overall. The sons of teen mothers are 13 percent more likely to end up in prison while teen daughters are 22 percent more likely to become teen mothers themselves. This goes back to the crime issue. I also find it funny that most black women disapprove of abortion (nearly 60%). However, 40% of abortions each year are performed on black women (which only make up 15% of the women of childbearing age in the US). Make up your mind. If you're against abortion, then don't get pregnant and then ask the government to pay for your abortion or your kid. Black women also have more children out of wedlock than do whites. 25 percent of all births in 1994 were out of wedlock. However, 66% of the births to black women were out of wedlock, almost 4 times as high as whites. If you want to better your life, stop having kids at a young age. It's actually pretty cheap to do...you can buy condoms for about $20 a month or you can get an abortion each 6 months for $500. I would take the easy $20 way out. But that's just my opinion.\n \n My last issue is education. Affirmative Action is mainly targeted towards the universities. The following facts just blow my mind. In 2001, the US Department of Instruction found that the overall graduation rate for high school students was 90%. Whites graduated at a rate of 95%, while blacks at only 60%. Not only is this true for high school, but also elementary school and middle school. Dropout rates for white students were 1%, while it was over 4% for blacks. Of the 772 four-year schools with student bodies that are at least 5 percent black, nearly 40 percent graduated fewer than 30 percent of their black students. Sixty-eight schools, or nearly 10 percent, graduated fewer than 10 percent. If it comes down to the decision of choosing a black or a white student of equal ability and credentials, why would any sane and logical person with these facts be obligated or willing to choose a black? I mean unless they want to lower their graduation rates or have them possibly commit a crime. \n \n If blacks want something, then work for it. Killing people and dropping out of school isn't going to help it. There are many great blacks in the world now. Look at Colin Powell (or Condoleeza Rica, Jesse Jackson, the new CEO of AOL Time Warner, Al Sharpton, and Bill Cosby). Powell grew up in a poor neighborhood in New York, but somehow managed to become a leader in the military and also Secretary of State, without Affirmative Action. So please don't let me ever hear that because you are poor, you have no way to make something of your life. I am tired of blacks saying that. Get up off your *** and do something for yourself. And for blacks that claim that Affirmative Action isn't based on race, get a clue. Poor whites don't get the same treatment as poor blacks. How many black bums do you see? They are mostly old white men, and why is this so? Because the government, under Affirmative Action, is giving all the help to poor minorities. Vietnam Veterans are a testament to this. They put their life on the line for this country, and most of them are poor and out on the street (over 65% of veterans are whites). You have done nothing for this country expect bitch and moan about how you can't take care of 5 kids from 4 fathers. Just a hypothetical question to all the ignorant blacks out there who think race isn't the premise of Affirmative Action. Assume that whites were the minority and blacks were the majority. Say you had worked hard in school and graduated from a good university. You are now applying for a job. Someone else, a white person, is also applying. You are both just as qualified for the job as the other. However, you don't get the job because they gave it to the white person. How would you feel? It would eventually lead to you probably hating whites because they got all the jobs that you were just as qualified for. Well that is how about 190,000,000 white Americans feel when you get jobs and we don't. It leads to racism, which I think is partly justified in this case. If the shoe was on the other foot, blacks would probably feel just the same as whites do today, ****** off because we work just as hard and get turned down because they need to meet a quota. If blacks don't like it here, feel free to move to another country. I suggest somewhere in Africa. Then you will have a taste of what poverty is really like. Some African countries have a life expectancy of 30 years and AIDS is prevalent in more than 30% of the population. This is where African Americans originally came from, so if you want to be a majority and with your own culture, go back there. Then you will truly cherish what it is to be in America. My suggestion...if you don't like it here, get the hell out of the country. Then we will have less to deal with.\n \n All this being said, I think that when people are filling out an application, there should be no space for race. This would help reduce whatever discrimination may occur. However, it is impossible to guarantee that nobody will be discriminated against. White people get discriminated upon by blacks, but you don't hear about it as much because most blacks will take any opportunity they can to criticize what whites are doing. This way, the hiring process or admissions process will be done blindly, not knowing what the candidate looks like or what his race may be.\n\n \n \n Get ready! Those who suggest that tolerance and diversity (as in college admissions) make things better, obviously are intolerant of your post! (IRONY!)\n \n I am white, most of my friends are black. We talk about this stuff all the time. I have learned (and un-learned) a great deal through polite, open discourse. Your statements should not make anyone upset AT YOU, it should make people eager to correct the problem you mention. As you said, facts are not opinion. It is a fact that most mass murderers are white males. (so what) However, I take people one at a time and make my distinctions baised on merrit.",

   "One statistic that has been brought up frequently has been misused largely. I do believe it was Terral03 that said \"black people commit more crimes on other blacks than anyone else\". This may be true, but you are trying to push that fact that black's are violent because they are black. This is not true. Black people become violent for the same reasons white people become violent, and for the same reason people of all other races become violent. At one point (actually, at a rather large point) in history, whites were the most violent on earth. This does not mean all whites are violent because they are white.\n \n Also, many debaters here argue that blacks have commited more crimes than anyone else. Again, this is not because they are black. This is because of the conditions they live in. Poverty spurs violence. This is a fact. Im not justifying violence by any means. The poverty that the blacks now face is due to the poor conditions they faced years ago.\n \n Ok, about AA now. I myself am Southeast Asian (Indian to be exact). I do not get AA benefits. Not in the workplace, not at the college level. So when i discuss AA, understand that i am trying to be as objective as possible.\n \n AA is trying to give the Black Americans the extra support they need to bring their \"race\" to equality. As long as blacks live in poor conditions, their children will not have the expenses to go to college, and will live relatively poor as well. And if they are not hired, they will not be making money to pay for their children's college and etc. It is a catch-22 scenario. AA attempts to fix that problem by giving blacks and other generally poor minorities the extra support that they need.\n \n However, the problem comes when majorities and others (chinese and indian people) get jacked because of the program.\n \n Therefore, i propose that we base AA as a scholarship/welfare program offered to those who are unable to pay for higher education (not to the families, but the the actual kids). This will enable the same kids who try hard during school to go to a college.\n \n Many people argue that simply offering money does not compensate for the poor education the minorities recieve. Understand that reform is a slow process. Just because your lack of education does not allow you to go to Harvard does not mean there is no change taking place. By qualifying at a even a community school, your education will give u a better job. One day, u can move to a better school district and your kids can have a better education, earn more money, and send their children to better schools. W.E.B. DuBois (a keynote black speaker) first said that for minorities to gain equality, they must be equal finacially. We should strive to make that possible.\n \n As for discrimination in the workplace, i can understand how AA helps. By setting quotas for companies, it helps weed out companies that hire whites only. However, this also discriminates against equally qualified whites. To battle discrimination, i believe it would be better to have open anti-discrimination hotlines that are ready to battle discrimination in the workplace. Resources must be available so that any minority that feels he has been wrongly paid or placed can come out without fear. Also, there can be \"workplace inspections\", much like the health inspections, that regularly check the stored resumes and other documents of all those who apply for any irregularities.\n \n These solution probably are more dreams than reality. However, the AA system needs reform if it can ever claim to be an \"equalizer\".\n \n At the same time, i believe that AA should not be removed until a better system can replace it.",

   "Black people become violent for the same reasons white people become violent, and for the same reason people of all other races become violent. At one point (actually, at a rather large point) in history, whites were the most violent on earth. This does not mean all whites are violent because they are white.\n\n \n No doubt that whites have committed perhaps the most barbaric and heinous atrocities in history...however, the cruelty and violence we exhibited centuries ago, except for a few madmen like Hitler, etc. indicates that whites have progressed beyond that point. It is an unfortunate fact that the Black culture condones, and in fact seems to celebrate, violence as a way of life\n \n \nAlso, many debaters here argue that blacks have commited more crimes than anyone else. Again, this is not because they are black. This is because of the conditions they live in. Poverty spurs violence. This is a fact. Im not justifying violence by any means. The poverty that the blacks now face is due to the poor conditions they faced years ago.\n\n \n I will use the best example known to man to refute this...the Great Depression...more poverty and unemployment than the Blacks suffer today, and yet the level of violence was nothing then compared to what it is today in the Black community. Unfortunately for Blacks, just like with children who have bad parents, we have a society that makes excuses for them, which simply encourages them to continue their destructive tendencies. If society as a whole stood up together and said enough is enough and that behavior will not be accepted for ANY reason, I believe it will slowly disappear\n \n \nHowever, the problem comes when majorities and others (chinese and indian people) get jacked because of the program.\n\n \n I've heard, sadly, that the children of hard working immigrants (minorities) that have historically quietly worked their way up the ladder, are now seeing that whining and crying has helped Blacks and are increasingly doing the same...all for the freebies\n \n \nTherefore, i propose that we base AA as a scholarship/welfare program offered to those who are unable to pay for higher education (not to the families, but the the actual kids). This will enable the same kids who try hard during school to go to a college.\n\n \n I believe in illustrating the absurd by being absurd (in the words of Limbaugh)...Let's take sports, and say my family doesn't stress sports, but yet I want to be a pro basketball player. Even though I try, I'm still not all that great. And let's say that I assume a starting role over a player that has worked hard his entire life to become genuinely good, he sits on the bench and I play..FAIR?",

It is an unfortunate fact that the Black culture condones, and in fact seems to celebrate, violence as a way of life\n \n\n I agree. I'm not saying all blacks are like this, but a lot of the time I'll see a black parent with a little toddler and when the toddler crys the parent will hit the toddler and curse at them. Great environment to be brought up in. (note I'm not even saying most black parents are like this, just it seems more black parents are like this than white parents)\n \n \n\n I will use the best example known to man to refute this...the Great Depression...more poverty and unemployment than the Blacks suffer today, and yet the level of violence was nothing then compared to what it is today in the Black community.

If society as a whole stood up together and said enough is enough and that behavior will not be accepted for ANY reason, I believe it will slowly disappear\n \n\n And don't forget how Asians were when first coming to this country, Asians pass whites in most stats such as graduation rate and test scores.\n \n \n\n I've heard, sadly, that the children of hard working immigrants (minorities) that have historically quietly worked their way up the ladder, are now seeing that whining and crying has helped Blacks and are increasingly doing the same...all for the freebies\n \n\n Yep. The point is in college or a job there's a reason they want the best. If the government wants to pay to educate some (I'd recomend based on income not race) then that's fine, but to give them free \"points\" only hurts them in the long run and the company/college they go to.\n \n \n\n I believe in illustrating the absurd by being absurd (in the words of Limbaugh)...Let's take sports, and say my family doesn't stress sports, but yet I want to be a pro basketball player.

Since diversity is so important, and our football team is mostly black, I think whites should get extra points. You know an extra second less for the hundred yard dash, things like that. What's the difference between that and AA? People say blacks were raised in an environment that didn't value education. Most value sports yet they won't let us white people with parents who force us to focus on education first to get extra points in sports. (note: I don't advocate this just as I don't advocate AA)",
