Considering that it's against the New Testament and Church tradition. \n\n \n\n Catholic Church.\n http://www.forministry.com/USPALCCI...GayMarriage.dsp\n \n\n Thanks for that. I made for interesting reading. Can I just point out that they are not 'the' Catholic Church? For clarity of debate, when we generally refer to the Catholic Church, we mean the Roman Catholic Church, and those churches in communion with it (viz the Uniat Churches). My own church, the Orthodox Church has claim to be called 'Catholic', in that we are universal. We even pray every Sunday for the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.... our own.\n They are not \"Catholic\" in that sense. They say this quite plainly...\n \"We are Catholic Churches but not Roman Catholic Churches.\"\n http://www.forministry.com/USPALCCINSCCSC/AboutUS.dsp\n They are an 'agenda' church in that they are pushing for inclusion of homosexuality into the mainstream of Christianity, which is not a tradition. One of the greatest Orthodox saints was homosexual, but he was non-practicing. That is, he fought against the desires he, and we, consider sinful.\n As to the examples, it appears frequently on the net, being repeated for instance at\n http://www.angelfire.com/oh2/bibhom/mythsin.html\n and again at\n http://www.rense.com/general50/cath.htm\n It is interesting to note that these icons are from Kiev, originally from the monastery of St. Catherine on Sinai, both of which are Orthodox, not Catholic domains. So your evidence for a start would at first suggest that gay marriages were approved of, in the Orthodox Church, not the Catholic. Given that we two churches were once one church, it's understandable that they'd mix us up.\n It is interesting to note here that putting \"St. Serge St. Bacchus\" in the search engine (www.ithaki.net) almost all the results lead to pro-gay-wedding sites. These icons of Christianity are now icons of social engineers.\n A very good look at this was given by another Orthodox poster at\n http://www.christianforums.biz/t682773\n The more 'convincing' icon, is in fact a very very modern one, used in conjunction with a very modern translation of a text...\n \"The various words used for \"bond\" and \"union\" in the account are striking. For example, is not only the strongest of the possible words for \"union,\" or \"uniting,\" but combines a fascinating range of associations, all certainly familiar to the author of the Greek life of Serge and Bacchus. The most direct of these would be New Testament phrases, many quoted or echoed in the text, especially Col. 3:14 (\"love, which is the bond of perfection\" ) and Eph. 4:3 (\"to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace\"). Less clear but even more startling is the use of the same word in [LXX] I Kings 14:24, where it has been taken since the time of Jerome to refer to homosexuality (\"And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations . . .\"). This is likely a misprision of the Hebrew, but could hardly have been unknown to or missed by the author of the life, if it seemed obvious to Jerome. Its homosexual implication was, moreover, strengthened under Christian influence by the New Testament phrase \"bonds of iniquity,\" which employed the same Greek word for \"bond.\" Following classical usage, late antique and patristic writers used to describe particularly intimate unions of many sorts, ranging from the union of the Trinity to the marriage of husband and wife.\"\n John Boswell writing in 1904\n (text given at site above)\n However, an older version (also given at same site)\n \"The Passion of St. Sergius and Bacchus (BHL 7599)\n \"...They were one in the love of Christ, and were never separated from each other in their earthly military service, joined not by their natural temperament but by the chain of faith, always singing and saying, \"How good and pleasant it is for brothers to live together\" [Psalm 133:1]. They were, therefore, intelligent and happy soldiers of God, perfectly resolved by the divinely inspired scriptures upon the destruction of the devil's error, and they exercised themselves fully in battle for the destruction of barbarians. ...\"\n 6. He said to them as they entered, \"I see it this way, that trusting in my great clemency and humanity, with which protection the gods have provided you, you are willing on top of this to scorn the imperial edict as law-breakers and enemies of the gods. But I will not uphold the complaints which have made about you unless they are proven. Approaching, so, the altar of great Jove, offer sacrifice and taste the mystical offerings, just as the rest do.\" However Sergius and Bacchus, the martyrs and most brave soldiers of Christ, said in response, \"We must discharge to you, O emperor, the earthly military service of our bodies; but we have a true king, Jesus Christ eternal in heaven, the Son of God, to whom we devote our souls, he who is our hope and saving refuge. We offer to him everyday a holy and living sacrifice, and reasoned worship; for we do not sacrifice to, or adore, stones and wood. Your gods have ears but they do not hear the prayer of men. They have noses likewise, but they do not smell the sacrifice which is offered to them. They have mouths but they do not talk, hands but they do not touch, and feet but they do not walk. May they and all who trust in them become like those things which they make\" [Psalm 134:18].\n 7. Thus the emperor was infuriated, his whole face changed, and he ordered that their military belts be immediately removed, that they be stripped of their cloaks and any other military garments, and, at the same time, that their golden collars be removed from about their necks. He dressed them in women's clothing, and he ordered that they be dragged in this way, with the heaviest chains about their necks, right through the middle of the city as far as the palace. When the holy men were being dragged through the middle of the forum they chanted together, saying, \"Although we walk in the shadow of death, we shall fear no evils, since you are with us,\" [Psalm 24:5] and the words of the Apostle, \"Denying to this extent all wickedness and earthly desire, [Titus 2:12] and having removed the clothing of the old-man, [Colossians 3:9] let us rejoice naked in our faith in you, O Lord, because you have clothed us in the garment of salvation, and you have wrapped us in the tunic of joy. You have adorned us in women's clothes, like a spouse, unite us to you through our con- fession [Isaiah 61:10]. You, O Lord, have put your trust in us, saying, \"You will be led before kings and governors on my account, and when they hand you over [to trial] do not worry how you will sound or what you will say. You will be given what to say at that hour. For they will not be your words which you are speaking, but words from the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you\" [Matthew 10: 19-20].\"\n \n However, the most telling proofs come from http://www.geocities.com/catholicprayerpage/srgbchs.html. Remember these men were soldiers. Yet they were also Christians. Note a...\"Prayer sung by Saints Sergius and Bacchus when they were stripped of their military garb and dressed in brides dresses and chains to be publicly humiliated. \n \"Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and putting off the form of the old man, naked in faith we rejoice in you, Lord, because you have clothed us with the garment of salvation, and have covered us with the robe of righteousness; as brides you have decked us with women's gowns and joined us together for you [or: \"joined us to you\"] through our confession. You, Lord, commanded us, saying, 'Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake.... But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.' Rise, Lord, help us and rescue us for your name's sake; strengthen our souls that we may not be separated from you and the impious may not say, 'Where is their God?' \"\n That is, they appear in the iconography as 'married' because they were placed that way by the Romans to humiliate them - to actually call them 'sissy' (or the Latin \n equivalent)\n In short, you've presented 'an issue' Church that's not Catholic, which itself has assumed Orthodox iconography in order to promote it's issue. They show truly two great saints who were made to suffer a humiliation of being 'married' to each other, but rather than be humiliated, the icon celebrates this mockery, in much the same way as gays call themselves '*****' with a sense of pride. But, as I stated, they are an 'issue' Church, and they need to distort such things in order to push their agenda. This includes their gross distortion of the icon seen at the bottom of their page... where they've even made the Roman toga pink.\n http://www.forministry.com/USPALCCINSCCSC/GayMarriage.dsp\n They even deceived you by their 'Catholic' name.\n \n \"These ceremonies had all the contemporary symbols of a marriage: a community gathered in a church, a blessing of the couple before the altar, their right hands joined as at heterosexual marriages, the participation of a priest, the taking of the Eucharist, a wedding banquet afterwards.

   "They are an 'agenda' church in that they are pushing for inclusion of homosexuality into the mainstream of Christianity, which is not a tradition.\n\n \n It doesn't change the fact that the church actively presided over gay marriages until the 13th century.\n\n As to the 'Catholic' Church presiding over this, all you've presented is a quote on a site by this church that calls itself Catholic, but itself mixes up Orthodox and Catholic. And, who's main source on this is a man who re-writes texts to suit this agenda. Further, one that misrepresents iconography, not only by ignoring it's true history - that of two martyrs, but by inventing new iconography that is more 'gay',... liberal use of pink for example. You might want to read up on semiotics to see their manipulative use of symbols.\n \nboth of which are Orthodox, not Catholic domains. \n\n \nStill doesn't change the fact that it did happen.\n\n Yes it does. If you state \"The Catholic Church presided over gay marriages\" and then present evidence from a church that is not 'the Catholic church' that in turn provides claims of actual examples from the Orthodox Church (which is also not 'the Catholic Church in the sense we are speaking of), then your statement is incorrect. It can't have happened in the way you describe because at best you're describing things that happened in another church.\n It's akin to me saying Orthodox did 'x' and then present evidence from what the Lutheran church did. Regardless of this amazing leap of logic Yet you continue with a mantra.\n \n They even deceived you by their 'Catholic' name.\n\n \nit STILL doesn't change the fact that it did happen.\n\n I believe your mantra has been stated enough.\n \nThat there were homosexual unions in any nation that is/was 'Christian' is not proof that Christians approve of it - as there are also murders, arsons and other sins going on there too, also not necessarily approved of. \n\n \n Under that logic, we can say everything that doesn't make logical sense, or could even appear questionable in the bible was not necessarily approved of. However, that STILL doesn't change the fact that it happened. \n\n Huh? You might make that argument. The Orthodox Church doesn't reject the Bible. Anyway, the argument presented by your site was that homosexual 'unions' occurred in medieval Wales (as one of the examples) as proofs that the Church approved of them. There is no connection between this 'fact' of an occurrence, and approval by the church. You just make the connection, because you hope it to be so. The only places where it actually states the church presiding, such as Serbia, and with the Emperor Leo, these aren't even in Catholic nations, but Orthodox ones, so the very premise that \"the Catholic Church presided of homosexual unions\" is not made... unless I missed an example from the west where the church there was presiding over such unions. Your site instead makes generalist statements about Ireland and Wales where homosexuality occurred. \n To go with your argument then every single thing that happened in a Christian country is approved of by the church, by reason that it happened in a Christian country. It is totally illogical.\n Further to this, one of the (many) areas that I studied was to do with the 'Reformation' of the western church. (the Roman Catholic one). There were a great many priestly abuses. Priests did many things outside the realm of Christianity. It is a logical fallacy to assume that every thing a priest did is Christian. This is what your argument will fall back upon, and itself is flawed. (It will fall back upon once we get over this silly notion of applying Orthodox examples as proofs of something in the Catholic Church). Again, if you find a priest who committed simony, and there were many examples, you'd be able to argue that this was 'official' policy, simply by virtue a priest did it. Thus opening the gates to all manner of accusations against the church. It is as logical as saying one US police officer beats a guy in jail, therefore the US government approves of the beating of prisoners in jail... because the US government 'presides' over the United States.\n It won't even matter if the act actually did happen in a manner by your own terminology that 'doesn't make sense'.\n \nThe homosexual act is forbidden in the New Testament. Nothing about that has changed. \n\n \n It STILL doesn't change the fact that it did happen.\n\n Oh, dear, that mantra again.\n \nI'm saying that the stuff about the 'Catholic' church and gay marriages is a lot of fluff.\n\n \nIt STILL doesn't change the fact that it did happen. \n Alright, fine, so it wasn't YOUR catholic church, but some Christian sect, regardless of that, gay marriages were STILL held by the Church until the 13th century.\n\n No, I said I am in fact Orthodox. SO, your statement about 'the Catholic Church' presiding over gay marriages is unsupported. Instead your examples ARE in fact about my church. Though these aren't referenced so it's impossible for me to check them; excepting to look at how that site uses evidences that I can check, and they've been found wanting for the reasons stated earlier; re-working of translations, misrepresenting icons, inventing icons etc.\n You're presenting at least, the wrong evidence for the accusations you make. I think you've debated Terral03 too long.",

   "And, who's main source on this is a man who re-writes texts to suit this agenda.\n\n \nAnd your church does not do this as well?\n\n Our church would argue that we're normative Christians - as we were the church founded by Christ, and empowered by Him via the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in 33 AD. That someone comes along 1,900 years later, forms a new church with the purpose of promoting one particular thing that's not been supported by 'the Church' for those centuries - there's little comparison. It's akin to me forming a \"United States of America - Montalban Inc\" using thus a portion of a name already in currency, and then promoting something as way-out and 'un-American' as sex with teapots.\n \n There are numerous historical instances of Churches allowing gay marriages, and paganism has been doing so for longer then Christianity has existed. \n\n You've changed the goal posts already! Before it was 'the Catholic church'. Now it's 'numerous' churches. Of course you don't provide any evidence to back up this new position. Why should you? A jingo does just nicely. You debate very much like Terral03 - although you can string sentences together.\n \nFurther, one that misrepresents iconography, not only by ignoring it's true history \n\n \nAs you are doing. \n\n No, you just say this. I actually put forward an argument. You don't even understand iconography in the context of the church.\n \nthat of two martyrs, but by inventing new iconography that is more 'gay' \n\n \nThen you explain what happened in all of these references.\n\n All 'what' references. You've presented one that re-works the words, I showed you an earlier translation. The iconography depicts two martyrs in a 'marriage' situation because the Roman army couldn't stand the idea of two Christian 'wusses' in their midst. For them, the idea was 'sissy', and so they humiliated the two Christian soldiers. Actually I don't know why I'm repeating this, as I've already stated this. For you, you just reply 'no it isn't'\n \nIt can't have happened in the way you describe because at best you're describing things that happened in another church.\n\n \n Alright. Fine, it was a different church, it still doesn't change the fact that it happened, and the meaning and definition of marriage has changes significantly over the years.\n\n You were wrong - your sources were wrong to suggest that 'the Church' (by this, both of you just assume the Catholic Church as normative) encouraged gay marriages.\n Your sources about it happening in the Orthodox Church are not subject to testing. The source simply says 'it happened in the past'. What evidences are they relying on? Where are the commentaries from the past that tell of this? Is it found in an engraving, or a law? Who knows?\n \nThere is no connection between this 'fact' of an occurrence, and approval by the church.\n\n [quote=Duo Maxwell]Then why did the Church not specifically denounce each and everyone of these instances? These marriages occurred for several hundred years. If it wasn't approved by the church, why didn't they stop it? \n Perhaps I stated this badly. Just because a gay marriage happens, doesn't mean it has the approval of 'the Church'. And, perhaps the very fact that the Church condemns it, would suggest to anyone with logic, as being a sign that the Church doesn't approve of it - which goes against your fallacy.\n \nunless I missed an example from the west where the church there was presiding over such unions.\n\n \nThe point that marriage's meaning and definition has changed over time is still true, regardless of whether or not you wish to accept it.\n\n You're trying to suggest that an odd-ball exception devastates the rule.\n \nTo go with your argument then every single thing that happened in a Christian country is approved of by the church, by reason that it happened in a Christian country. It is totally illogical.\n\n \n It STILL doesn't change the fact that homosexual marriages by some form of Christian Church occurred for several hundreds years happened until the 13th century.\n\n You still don't get it. Your source, your only source on this presents two sets of cases\n a) Gay unions that took place anywhere within a Christian nation\n b) Gay union presided over by the Orthodox Church.\n As to the first, an example of a gay union does not equate to approval of the Church in the matter\n as to the second, it would, if the source could be believed but\n i) it's not testable - the only proof is itself\n ii) it is presented by someone in whom I've shown has an 'agenda' that he would re-work a translation to make a 'fit' with his wishes.\n \nMy point is that marriage's definition and meaning HAS changed. You apparently don't think so. You're arguing against a single point that hold relatively little relevance simply because the reference could be made to your church. That in fact is a superficial argument. Get back to the argument that marriage has changed over the years.\n\n Sure, you show me where the Orthodox Church has changed its stance on marriages, to the point of accepting gay unions... which, let's face it, is the heart of your posts... proving long-term support for such unions.\n There are many thinkers for you to go through on the issue of marriage (in the Orthodox Church)\n Gregory of Nyssa (331-95)\n \n John Chrysotomon (347-407)\n \n various Desert Fathers (4th-5th centuries)\n \n Isaiah the Solitary (5th century)\n \n Diadochos of Photike (5th century)\n \n Dorotheos of Gaza (6th century)\n \n Gregory the Great (540-604)\n \n Theodor the Ascetic (7th century)\n \n Maximos the Confessor (580-662)\n \n Thaslassios the Libyan (7th century)\n \n Dionysios the Areopagite (c.500)\n \n John Klimakos (579-649)\n \n Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022)\n \n Nicholas Kavasilas (1322-96)\n \n Symeon of Thessalonika (d.1429)\n \n Dimitri of Rostov (1651-1709)\n \n Macarius of Optino (1788-1860)\n \n Ignatius Brianchaninov (1807-67)\n \n John of Kronstad (1829-1908)\n \n Silouan of Athos (1866-1938)\n \n Alexander Elchaninov (1881-1934)\n \n Kallistos of Diokleia (b.1934)\n \n (as a guide I took a list taken from \"Love, Sexuality, and the Sacrament of Marriage\" by John Chryssavgis)\n \n \nI think you missed the point though. The argument was that your logic could easily be applied to everything the Church (and bible) said and did that could be deemed sketchy. And you just gave me a bunch of examples of specifics that could easily fall under that logic. Often those of the religious often reinterpret what they believe not to make sense, could be taken in poor light, or what simply is downright dumb. \n\n \nAll you have given is simply scriptures and other meaningless unproven \"facts.\"\n\n Totally bizarre rebuttal. To prove the thinking of the Church, I would naturally quote scripture. You can't grasp that simple fact.\n [quote=Duo Maxwell]I have given historical evidence.\n Yes, you've present a case of the Emperor marrying a gay lover. It's given no source, so I can't test it.\n \n Even still, it doesn't change the fact that it happened SOMEWHERE in SOME church for a extended period of time, giving backing to my assertion that marriage has changed over years from Pagan Marriage to our Liberalist, secular form of Marriage.\n\n What happened with the pagans is again irrelevant to the Church. You have this really strange sense that if it happened anywhere in any circumstances, it proves your point about the church. The fact that pagans did something doesn't mean the definition within the Church changed. Your ability to connect these distant facts is unfathomable.",

Especially as you don't bother to argue according to what I believe, but rather just assume I believe something, and argue against that.\n \n What's even funnier is that you have no problem going round and round with Duo over dates and names...etc, but you post passages of scripture, blatantly misinterpreted just so it can further your weak argument. The word \"homosexual\" was NEVER in any of the original texts of \"Holy Scripture.\" It couldn't have been. The word \"homosexual\" was first coined in 1869 by a writer named: Karl Maria Kertbeny, in Germany. \n\n So what? I also believe in 'The Trinity' and the word is never found in the Bible, not even now. But the concept is! You seem to believe that the Orthodox Church uses the Bible as Protestants do, and we don't. I stated that we believe in it in the context of Holy Tradition. So debating me about the verse, by merely looking at the verse alone is a nonsense for a church such as ours, that is not a sola scriptura church (nor are the Catholics nor the Copts). Sadly for you you failed to look at the long list; I pointed out a long list of Holy Fathers and other writers who have written on marriages as sacraments.\n That the 'Trinity' is not mentioned specifically, or that the Church has given a modern word for an old concept is no problem for us. It is part of being a living church.\n A. Mohler: stated \"I believe it explicitly relates to homosexuality. It has been understood that way in the Christian Church from the earliest era.\" \n That is for instance the Church has the words of the Bible: they can either believed to be literal, and the 'whole' of Christian teaching, which is what you assume that I believe, or, it can be a 'guide' written by the church to contain the outline of Christian belief. Our church compiled the Bible based on what accorded with Holy Tradition - not the other way round.\n \n So it is quite impossible that the word \"homosexual\" was ever used in the Bible. Furthermore, if you bothered to read my post of which I indexed for you, you would also see that the word which was in the original texts of the Bible, malako'i which literally means soft [to the touch]. \n A rabbit fur is malako'i.\n\n T. Crater: \"It [malakoi] can have a meaning that's not carnal. But the way it's used -- it's embedded in the same context with adultery -- it's pretty clear what the meaning is...A hallmark of Evangelicals is that we take a literal, normal, face-value interpretation of the Bible. Some people attempt to keep some form of Christianity and hold on to homosexuality, too. It leads to strange interpretations of the Bible.\"\n So, it is a non-sense for you to insert a meaning of 'rabbit-fur softness' in the context of the list of evils St. Paul relates.\n \nIt's quite possible that the true meaning of the word used in original texts dealt more with prostitution that anything else.\n\n That is, if you just took a look at the Bible and nothing else. That is both it's power and its weakness, which is why our church does not rely on the Bible alone... your angrily worded response is one based on dealing with a particular and relatively recent Christian outlook - sola scriptura (brought about 1,500 years after Christ by Martin Luther et al.\n Both non-referenced quotes above were from (ironically)\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc1.htm\n Thus...\n \"The Orthodox Christian teaching on marriage and sexuality, firmly grounded in Holy Scripture, 2000 years of church tradition, and canon law, holds that marriage consists in the conjugal union of a man and a woman, and that authentic marriage is blessed by God as a sacrament of the Church. Neither Scripture nor Holy Tradition blesses or sanctions such a union between persons of the same sex.\"\n http://www.cmpage.org/news/2K3-Nov-Ltr.htm\n You simply ignore most of this, look at Scripture, say that out of the context of Holy Tradition the single word by itself might mean something else, therefore you have a case. Why do you think we have courts? They interpret the words of the law; hopefully the courts come close to the intent of the law - and they are trained to do so, and have tradition to guide them. You would look at a line of the law, take it out of the context of the laws and history surrounding it, take it from those trained in those traditions and learning, interpret it for yourself, present it back as a possible, and then rule that because your interpretation is 'possible' that the law isn't how any one else means it.\n It's a complete fallacy, your argument - and its arrogant to take someone else's beliefs, take only part of it into consideration, re-work it, and throw it back and tell them that they're wrong for 2,000 years based on your own assumptions on how they should believe what they believe. If you're going to try deconstructing religion you might actually learn about how the believers believe before trying your re-construction.\n \n Further...\n \"Malakoi, and its alternative form \"malakos,\" means literally \"soft\" or \"soft ones.\" The word appears many times in ancient literature, so we can be fairly certain of its meaning in Paul's day. When used as a term of moral condemnation, it took its meaning of \"soft\" as being feminine. Women were seen as passive, weak, vulnerable, lazy, -- and what's worse, penetrable. A man to whom this word was applied was often lazy or a coward. Sometimes it meant living a life of decadence. It sometimes meant a man who was penetrated by another man. But it was also often linked with heterosexual sex, and was even used as an insult against men who, being too sensitive, loved women too much!11\"\n http://www.love1another.net/eloise_may.htm\n I don't agree with their conclusions, which in fact, and oddly goes against the evidence that they present. They say that from this evidence they can't see how it is translated as homosexual. You might find it odd to dispute one of my own sources. But even they recognise the original meaning - a man penetrated by another man.\n \n Here is an interesting site from a gay Orthodox...It shows that there's a lot of confusion out there...\n \"If one wants to cite I Cor. 6:9 and I Tim. 6:10 which condemns \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\", I would advise the reader to note that \"malakos\" is an adjective meaning soft, and is used to refer to a number of morally neutral things; to use \"soft\" in a negative sense is hardly a condemnation of homosexuality; as for \"arsenokoitai\", it is strange that this feminine plural is used to condemn gay males; some even have taken it upon themselves to consider \"malakoi\" as feminine homosexuals and \"arsenokoitai\" as masculine homosexuals; they obviously don't know their Greek. St. John the Faster notes that \"some men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives\" (P.G. 88:1893) so one can hardly consider it as something uniquely homosexual.\"\n http://www.axios.net/onbeinggay/onbeinggay.html\n What he fails to understand is that what St. John the Faster is talking about is 'buggery'. So malakoi is receiving, and arsenokoiai is giving buggery. That is why malakoi is feminine, because in the 'normal' sexual relations it is the woman who is penetrated and the man doing the penetration.\n That is; sodomy. The Sodomy of the Old Testament is also confused because some people say that they weren't 'homosexuals' the confusion comes from the fact that they probably weren't. Not all male rapists are homosexual, most probably aren't. And that's what sodomy here is again, buggery, a male penetrating the arse.",

They were given it, and they became bogged down in it, and Jesus came and freed them from it.\n\n \n It's not an argument, it's an example. I was pointing out that the laws of THIS nation are NOT based on any ONE particular religious dogma. To do so negates our First Amendment which states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n \n This means that our government cannot create laws which promote any specific religion over any other. Where as our government cannot create a law insisting that women wear a burkah as that would promote Islam over ALL OTHER reglions, nor can they create a law forcing men to wear a yarmulka as that would promote Judeaism over ALL OTHER religions. \n My example was that if the Mosaic law, which was addressed by epaphrase faith not by me, was the basis for Civil Law in America the examples I used would still be utilized today. Since they are not, epaphrase's reference is made mute.\n \n \nHowever prohibitions existed prior to Mosaic law, and since. God condemns Cain for murdering Abel.

Once again, for someone who obviously has confused this thread with others, this is about CIVIL RIGHTS NOT RELIGION.\n But since you brought it up; Yes, God did create Adam and Eve, He also created Steve, Martha, Hubert, Janet, You and ME!

They too, even though incarcerated are still granted limited civil rights. Rights, which are NOT afforded to one specific group of FREE Americans. Citizens who have committed no crime! \n \n \n \n I suppose this is an argument to move away from metric, back to cubits.\n\n \n What's really funny here is that as an Aussie, you really don't get it do you? \n Americans don't use the metric system.

Have been in it for over 15 years. The gay and lesbian issues may be a little less well defined for me than others. I admit that. However, I am aware. Diversity training is hardly the issue here. It is not simply a matter of knowing ones sexual identity, and for some it is a huge issue. However, to turn the tables, what scares me is that you are not aware that security, significance, and strength, are the base or core issues involved in self esteem. One who knows they are secure, safe, loved, will find their self esteem growing rapidly, especially when they are also taught that they are significant and have a role to play in this world that is important. Lastly, the first two are nearly irrelevant if they are not given the strength to carry through the difficult times and to carry out their place. \n \n Being a part of something larger is a part of human nature. That desire is built in. If all we are about is ourselves, we will fail everytime. Since you have been in mental health work for a while, you have undoubtedly seen many individuals who never break out of the pain, the gunk, the ****, if you will. They go back to it over and over again, in spite of intensive intervention. Why? Is it because the person is not trying? I find that unlikely but instead think that the mental health system (overall and generally speaking) focuses entirely too much on the individual's physical existence and the problems they face are primarily spiritual.

They were given it, and they became bogged down in it, and Jesus came and freed them from it.\n\n \nIt?s not an argument, it?s an example. I was pointing out that the laws of THIS nation are NOT based on any ONE particular religious dogma. To do so negates our First Amendment which states: ?Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.?\n\n No you brought it out as an argument as to ask why Christians follow one Mosaic law, and not others... hence you actually gave examples of other Mosaic laws which we don't follow. It is simply a stock-standard argument.\n \n This means that our government cannot create laws which promote any specific religion over any other. Where as our government cannot create a law insisting that women wear a burkah as that would promote Islam over ALL OTHER regions, nor can they create a law forcing men to wear a yarmulka as that would promote Judaism over ALL OTHER religions. \n\n So, if your nation out-lawed gays, how would that promote one religion?\n \nMy example was that if the Mosaic law, which was addressed by E-Faith faith not by me, was the basis for Civil Law in America the examples I used would still be utilized today. Since they are not, E-faith's reference is made mute.\n\n If he harks back to a particular Mosaic law your argument still falls flat for the same reasons I posted in my previous post. Why should he have to obey all those laws when Christians believe that the law was ended by Christ? That some are maintained simply shows a persistent thread - which is the very thing you have been trying to disprove - with regards homosexuality. We have this thread that pre-dates Mosaic law, was elaborated in Mosaic law, and was continued after. Just as I pointed out in my previous post - with the example of murder. My nation is quite young. Our laws however pre-date the nation - because our laws were derived from British laws. Does this mean we obey all British laws? No! But if I want to show the 'pedigree' of a law prohibiting murder then I might evoke an ancient law. This is what E-faith did. You made the assumption that because he evokes one Mosaic law, he must take them all. He is operating on a lateral line of reasoning. You are not. Hence your confusion.\n [quote=Montalban]However prohibitions existed prior to Mosaic law, and since. God condemns Cain for murdering Abel. Murder was wrong before during and after the application of Mosaic law. Simply that Mosaic law was done away with you would assume that every one of God's laws were thrown away. This is another of your misapplications of Christian beliefs. You simply have a half notion, and you argue against that. \n \n REMINDER: This thread is about CIVIL RIGHTS NOT RELIGION\n\n Yes, but it was you who tried to make the argument that E-faith must be bound by all Mosaic laws. Secondly, where do you think your civil rights come from? From the belief that all 'men' (using the terminology of the time) were CREATED equal.\n \nSeeing as you have most definitely gotten your threads confused.\n\n Not at all. Just because I argue with someone who has no sense of history, believing some how 'civil rights' like Minerva sprung fully formed from someone's head, doesn't phase me at all.\n \n To use the old slogan, God created Adam and Eve - a man and a woman. The Sodomites were condemned. Mosaic law mentioned prohibitions on homosexuality. St. Paul does too. Holy Tradition teaches us this as well.\n\n \n Oh please. Just get off it. Once again, for someone who obviously has confused this thread with others, this is about CIVIL RIGHTS NOT RELIGION. \n\n We want to look at law, then we must ask why do we keep some, and not others. Murder has generally been regarded as a sin. It sort of has a 'pedigree' going back to the mists of time. So do laws against homosexuality. (That E-faith went back only as far as Moses with regards to law seemed for you an opportunity to introduce your stock-standard argument). It's only recently, following the lessening of the prestige of religion that we find homosexuality legalised. Tell me, if you can, who voted for the change in the law?\n \nBut since you brought it up; Yes, God did create Adam and Eve, He also created Steve, Martha, Hubert, Janet, You and ME! What?s your point now? \n\n Yet you go against His wishes.\n \nTo put it another way. North America was once governed in places by French Law. This was superseded by British law, and then by American. I would hazard to guess that each one condemned murder. Simply because the French law doesn't apply anymore doesn't mean that there is no prohibition to murder. Your line of logic would be that one should swear allegiance to the ruler of France, because French law was once adhered to. You overthrew all French law, but several principles still remain common. You seem to have a problem with this, when applied to Christians - believe some how that we should be tied to the laws of a particular period.\n\n \nI never even mentioned murder,\n\n It's called an 'analogy'.\n \nbut since you brought it up, murderers are not banned from marriage. They too, even though incarcerated are still granted limited civil rights. Rights, which are NOT afforded to one specific group of FREE Americans. Citizens who have committed no crime! \n\n That's a very convoluted argument. Because homosexuals have been decriminalised, of course then homosexuals don't commit crime. Such a strange statement of fact as if it means something. Further, a murderer who is allowed to marry - the law assumes that they're not in the state of continuing murdering. Whereas a homosexual would continue their homosexual behaviour into marriage. If I killed someone 10 years ago, I would be classed as a murderer, by your definition. That one heinous act, you would now punish me forever? If not, then what's your point? As to a homosexual, are you claiming that if someone commits one homosexual act, and then marries, they are going to be celibate? There's the difference, and why your analogy fails, you're comparing someone who sinned with someone who is sinning.\n \nI suppose this is an argument to move away from metric, back to cubits. \n\n \n What?s really funny here is that as an Aussie, you really don?t get it do you?\n\n Ouch. That hurts. But, let's see who knows more...\n \nAmericans don?t use the metric system. President Carter attempted to ready Americans for what was thought to be an obvious change. But it failed miserably. We still use The American Standard for Weights and Measures. \n\n Actually you do use the metric system. You use both. When you sell products to the rest of the world you place metric notations on it, you package things by what we order - in metric. We use both too, when we talk about things in shipping, we still refer to nautical miles. One system has not completely over-taken the other - the very \n fact we still use 12/24 hours instead of 10 hours shows another non-metricised measuring system we use.\n \" This agency administers the International System of Units, the official version of the metric system. American scientists and engineers have always been among the leaders in improving, extending, and revising the metric system. The general public, however, has lagged far behind.\"\n http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html\n 1991 \n President George H. W. Bush signed Executive Order 12770, Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs directing all executive departments and federal agencies implement the use of the metric system. The Executive Order is also available as an appendix to: Interpretation of the SI for the United States and Federal Government Metric Conversion Policy \n 1994 \n The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) was amended by the Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) to require the use of dual units (inch-pound AND metric) on all consumer products. \n 1996 \n All four Canadian Stock Exchanges began decimal trading on April 15, the first exchanges in North American to abandon the old \"pieces-of-eight\" trading system and welcome the new decimal system. The old tradition of trading stocks in increments of one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents, dates back to when the Spanish mille dollar was divided into \"pieces of eight\". \n 1996 \n As of July 1996 all surface temperature observations in National Weather Service METAR/TAF reports are now transmitted in degrees Celsius. \n 2000 September 30 \n This deadline that all agreements, contracts, and plans processed by individual states for federally-funded highway construction be in metric units was canceled by Congressional action, leaving metric conversion as voluntary but still recommended to comply with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Several State Departments of Transportation continue to use the metric system despite the deadline being rescinded. See Did You Know That for more details on this topic. \n 2001 April 09 \n U.S. Stock Exchanges finalized the change to decimal trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered that all stocks must be quoted in dollars and cents rather than fractions by this date. The switch to decimal trading brought the U.S. in line with the rest of the world's major exchanges. This follows the change of the Canadian Stock Exchanges to decimal trading in 1996.\n http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/dates.htm\n That you don't know what goes on in your own nation is laughable.\n \n Your arguing for another debate here, certainly not one I've made, as I've stated much earlier that I welcome civil rights for gays. I guess emotive argument is what you wish for because you constantly stray from facts.\n\n \n\n Ah, nope, hate to correct you, but indeed I am arguing correctly. I am attempting to keep this thread on topic. ?Why are Gay Rights no Civil Rights?? I was turning my argument back to the CIVIL LAW idea. I suggest it is you who has forgotten what thread you were posting in. Not unexpected for someone who has posted 3,095 times~! (at least that was the count at the time of this post)\n\n Another attempt at a cheap shot? Weird. First that I'm Australian, now that I've posted a particular number - which is significant to you somehow.\n \n Are you talking about Civil Law or Civil Rights? You don't seem to know.\n Civil Law is based on Canon Law - which is the law that the Church used (and still uses) Your attempt to separate 'the law' from 'religion' from which your law mainly derives, fails again.\n As stated, gays, murderer, etc, all deserve Civil Rights under law.",

When an American drives their car, they do not follow kpms they follow mphs. When they look at their instrument panel, even though both metric and American Standards are marked, they usually only look at the American Standard markings.\n\n Good for you. What relevance does this have on the fact that I gave you evidence that Americans DO use the system, therefore you are wrong. Unless you present evidence that my sources are wrong, you are wrong to simply re-state your own misinformed belief.\n \nWhen an American homemaker (Male or female) is cooking a recipe he/she does not measure out liters or dcl's, he/she measures out Cups, teaspoons and Tablespoons. \n\n So? We use teaspoons and tablespoons here, doesn't mean we don't use the metric system! In fact, depending upon the size of the teaspoon or tablespoon, you might be using the metric system\n \"The most frequent measurements made in the home are those used for cooking and baking. Metric \"cup and spoon\" measures are only slightly larger than, and can often be used interchangeably with, the customary \"cup and spoon\". There are only a few ingredients that are now measured by weight (pounds and ounces) that will be expressed differently in metric recipes.\"\n http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/misc/usmetric/metric-equiv.htm\n It is often that I find someone will debate me over a relatively small point like this, because they had hoped to point-score. Recall, it was your rebuttal that started this. That you're shown to be wrong with several sources references doesn't seem to stop though, as you've got a personal point to make - something about being upset about me being Australian, and/or having posted a particular amount of times.\n Another concept that went right over your head, yet you accuse me of not knowing what I'm talking about?

Civil rights are not gay rights.\n\n \n Actually Gay rights are civil rights. Here let me show you:\n \n \ncivil rights\n pl.n. \n The rights belonging to an individual by virtue of citizenship, especially the fundamental freedoms and privileges guaranteed by the 13th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and by subsequent acts of Congress, including civil liberties, due process, equal protection of the laws, and freedom from discrimination.\n (www.dictionary.com\n \n \n\n civil \n definition - relating to the state or citizenry.\n\n (www.legal-definitions.com)\n \n \n\n CITIZENSHIP, AMERICAN - Status acquired by birth within the United States or through judicial proceedings known as 'naturalization.' One is also a citizen, even though born outside the United States, if both of his parents were citizens and one of them had a residence in the United States prior to the birth.\n \n A citizen is one who, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, has a right to vote for representatives in congress and other public officers, and who is qualified to fill offices in the gift of the people. In a more extended sense, under the word citizen are included all persons born in the United States and naturalized persons born out of the same who have not lost their right as such. This includes men, women and children.\n \n Citizens are either native born or naturalized. Native citizens may fill any office; naturalized citizens may be elected or appointed to any office under the Constitution of the United States, except the office of president and vice-president. The Constitution provides, that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.' Art. 4, s. 2.\n \n(www.lectlaw.com)\n \n Therefore all citizens rights are indeed civil rights. Civil = Citizen in the eyes of the law.",

This myth of the Gay agenda is still my favorite, there is no agenda. Gays who have had long term healthy relationships are looking for federal protection for their relationships so they are not hit with strange taxes on their own belongings, so they have the right to their relationships. It is not about recognition it is about protection under the law. Unfortunately the right wing Christian agenda is covered by a bible, which does not stand up in court. Not everyone believes in the bible and should not be forced into having it rule their life, hence the separation of church and state.\n\n You've never really had separation of religion from state - hence the state has continually interfered in the Mormon Church on the issue of polygamy specifically (of which I am NOT a member). But, there have been other examples, one of the more famous, being Alvin York, a member of a small church who wanted exemption from service in WWI based on his pacific beliefs. He was refused and later ironically became a war hero - subject of a film with Gary Cooper, called Sergeant York.\n \nThe right wing tends to defy science and logic and expect we make laws based on their BS.\n\n I take it by this you mean 'evolution'.

That is why is it a civil rights issue!\n\n I am more than happy for the state to recognise some kind of property agreements made between gays - for the purposes of Wills, insurance, etc. I get the feeling though you'd not be in favour of the majority if they went against you... on a whole range of issues, such as the introduction of creationism into science teaching etc. You couch your arguments in issues of 'civil rights' etc, because it suits you. I don't recall hearing of any votes on laws regarding homosexuality, abortion etc, being put to the American people. I asked one previous poster if there were any such - there well might be. It seems though, in the absence of any such proof that there's an example here of a small number of people social engineering the society as a whole.\n As to the 'gay agenda' being non-existence I think you are wrong. Just because gay people don't all having meetings etc, doesn't mean that there's no common interests. The very fact you are a section of society means you'd have sectional interests - that of things relating to being gay - such as what you mentioned above re: relationships and their legal status, taxes on them etc. You simply portray this as a civil rights issue, but you are in fact doing your section a disservice, as there are legal forces on the gay community different then, say on the black American community.\n Further, your 'not everyone believes the Bible' statement is rather odd, as if it's only Christians that have objections to homosexual unions.

Homosexuality as far as Islam is concerned is a profound mistake ( as are all sins if they are not intending to do wrong). Humans are not homosexuals by nature. People become homosexuals because of their environments. Particularly critical is the environment during puberty. Suggestions, ideas & strange dreams are symptoms of confused attempts to understand new and blunt sexual desires and are rashly interpreted as defining someone as being one sexuality or another. If these conclusions are accompanied by actual homosexual acts they are even more strongly reinforced.\n http://www.islamic.org.uk/homosex.html\n As to Hinduism... there's an interesting range of discussions at\n http://www.hindulogy.biz/_wsn/page2.html\n Many feel that what little there is in Hinduism, on the matter, is against homosexuality.\n \n From your own site above:\n \"Measuring public views on a constitutional amendment is sensitive to how the subject is framed, including whether an alternative is offered. This poll asked, \"Would you support amending the U.S. Constitution to make it illegal for homosexual couples to get married anywhere in the U.S., or should each state make its own laws on homosexual marriage?\"\n Most Americans are very nervous about any changes to the Constitution.

It doesn't say only Christians are against homosexuality. Further, there are many gay-churches which your rant against Christians doesn't explain.

But a minority who can not control themselves wish their own compulsive behaviour to somehow be legitimated by a majority that don't have these same urges... or at least can control them better.\n \nI do not believe in sin or god, BUT I am a tax paying United States citizen.\n\n So, it's just about 'civil rights for gays to marry in the United States then', for a moment there I thought you were about general principles of civil rights, then its narrowed down to civil rights to marry.\n \nSince I don't believe in your religion and we have freedom of religion, keep your god out of my relationship. I would also ask you to keep him our of OUR government, but we do have freedom of speech.\n\n It would be against my religion not to try to help a sinner.\n \n What do you think about the civil rights/gay rights issues in Australia?

They make claims about 'civil rights', when they just mean their own rights to behave as they wish.

I'd oppose The Children of God aka \"The Family.\" I follow the tenets of God as taught through His church.\n \nIf so, I guess you must be in favour of bestiality.

Jake has done a very good job at defining for you what \"civil rights are\" by his definition, you are just refusing to accept the definition because you don't agree. I agree with Jake.\n\n \n The fact that a dog cannot agree has nothing to do with law. Hence you can eat an animal, without its consent, but it's not 'murder'.

But my support isn't resting on a sinuous application of 'civil rights for some' as yours, but what is sinful, and what is not. Thus when you campaign for the 'rights of everyone' to have sex with whomever they wish (on the proviso it's not 'harming anyone'; remember again an animal is a 'thing') but in reality you're only about 'gay rights' (my rights are already protected; so that's another false claim about helping others).\n \n I only picked bestiality as an example as it was sure to evoke the response of revulsion amongst more people than other exceptions you or some of the gay lobby might make; such as incest (between consenting adults), polygamy, polyandry, or polygyny etc.\n \n As to Jake's definition, it rests on a falsehood in that it's only going to be applied where he is not personally appalled. You seem to make the same argument. It's one of the weakness of a relativist moral stance. That is why I'm against the pretence of a 'civil rights' debate. You would actually find me fighting for 'civil rights' but not in a generalised sense as the gay lobby pretends; I personally have been kicked and stomped on by police on demonstrations against Australia's generally draconian refugee's policy.\n \n *here we say bonking",
