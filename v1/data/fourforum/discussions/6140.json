   "There are lots and lots of stories about the Buddha and his life. He lived to be 80, if we are to believe what was said about him so obviously a lot of things can happen in such a long time. Now, you should really hear this story as told by my wife. She's from Sri Lanka, born into buddhism and born into that culture, she can make it come alive. I'll give it my best though. I'll embellish it here and there to make it flwo better.  \n \n The Buddha went with his monks (this was before they allowed nuns, which is also a funny story but pretty long and we'll take it another time) begging for food everyday. Now and then he'd walk by his father's palace, begging from the nearby houses. He usually didn't beg from rich people, didn't give as much. And he didn't get along too well with his dad so he didn't want to push it, although walking right outside of the palace where he was supposed to have been the prince and later king was of course a provocation he did on purpose. \n \n As she was sitting at the window his ex-wife, the beautiful Yasodara, saw him down there and called on their son and said to him in a sarcastic tone \"Look down there my boy, that's your father that goes around begging\". One could easily imagine that she was quite bitter, it hadn't turned out the way she had expected. She added \"Run down and ask your father what he has to give to you, his only son\". The boy ran down.\n \n - Daddy! Daddy! Mom wants to know what you have to give to me!\n \n Now, the Buddha was no fool. He knew when someone was teasing him back. He smiled at his son.\n \n - My boy, just let me and my friends finish the begging round and then you can come with us to the woods, I'll show you something alright.\n - What will you show me?\n - A free life in the forest.\n - But grandpa says I'm gonna be a king\n - Oh... he does, does he?\n \n The Buddha got a little angry when he heard this. He felt that sting of anger he still had for his father. Damn, that it was so hard to get over that feeling. But, that's not the fault of the boy he though to himself and smiled again.\n \n - Well, grandpa probably says you have a big responsibility to shoulder, right?\n - Yes, that's what he says.\n - Listen to me my son... (he took a deep beath here to stay calm) that's all ********! Come with me and my friends and live the good life, away from all this false safety that luxury and power gives. \n \n The boy was happy and as soon as the begging round was finished he came along with his father out in the woods. He had a great afternoon under the trees. Some of the monks weren't that old themselves and they played with him, which was great for him cause he didn't really have that many friends in the palace. \n \n The Buddha's father came home later in the day and found his poor daughter in law in tears brought on by her anger. When she had told him what had happened he nearly went insane with fury. Not his grandson too! Was there no end to what this son of his would do to hurt him? He set off to the nearby woods and pretty soon he found them, his son, his grandson and all the so called monks. What a bunch of losers! Lazy drop-out all of them! He walked up to his son, angry as hell.\n \n - You have no right to take my grandson away from me!\n - Well, he happens to be my son. But you can take him back, he can come to me when he wants to.\n - From now on you have to promise never to take a child without asking the permission of its parents!\n - OK, I'll promise that, and you can have him back, I already told you. But once again, he is my son as well. \n \n And that's how it happened that the rule was made that a child cannot enter the buddhist order without the consent of the parents. The rule still exists today in most buddhist countries, if not all.",
