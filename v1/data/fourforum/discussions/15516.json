   "  Sen. Moran & 44 Senators Tell Obama Administration &#8211; Second Amendment Rights Not Negotiable \nU.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) today led 44 senators in expressing grave concern about the dangers posed to Second Amendment rights by the United Nations&#8217; Arms Trade Treaty.\n \n The 44 senators notified President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton of their intent to oppose ratification of an Arms Trade Treaty that in any way restricts the rights of law-abiding American gun owners.\n \n In the letter, the senators wrote: &#8220;As the treaty process continues, we strongly encourage your Administration to uphold our country&#8217;s constitutional protections of civilian firearms ownership. These freedoms are not negotiable, and we will oppose ratification of an Arms Trade Treaty presented to the Senate that in any way restricts the rights of law-abiding U.S. citizens to manufacture, assemble, possess, transfer or purchase firearms, ammunition and related items.&#8221;\n",

These anti-freedom control freaks won't rest until they disarm the average american and make us as malleable as putty in their hands. \n \n Every legal gun owner should apply for their conceal carry permit as their state allows it and exercise their full gun owners rights. That's what I did after Yobama got elected. I now carry a Ruger 380 LCP everywhere the law allows one to carry. It's pocket size small, yet potent self defense protection.\n \n http://www.gunblast.com/images/CrimsonTrace-LCP/DSC05201.jpg\n \n This photo is the exact real life size of the LCP 380.",
