The planet earth is incredibly complex.\n \n Now, THAT is were the second law is disobeyed. Matter cannot go from incredible disorder to incredible complexity.\n\n \n 1) Whether \"evolutionists\" believe in it or not, the big bang is not evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles from one generation to the next, and thus applies only to reproducing organisms, not explosions in space.\n \n 2) The second law of thermodynamics applies in and only in a closed system. What does this mean? It is entirely possible for any given *part* of a closed system to become more \"ordered\", so long as another part becomes less ordered, such that the total \"order\" is less. For example, a tree becomes more ordered as it grows, but to do this it uses energy from outside the tree, most notably sunlight.\n \n 3) Order does not mean things neatly arranged in planets and galaxies for your viewing pleasure. All the matter and energy in the universe crammed into a single location is vastly more ordered than the universe we have today.\n \n \nI think that most people totally misunderstand this argument.\n\n \n The argument is a joke, and it's extremely frustrating to have to repeatedly explain the meanings of scientific terms to people who use them innaccurately to try and make a religious point.\n \n Most importantly - evolution is not reliant on the \"big bang\" to be true.

   "I believe the second law of thermodynamics actually supports evolution.\n \n The second law is a general, large scale principle. For the purposes of this debate, it means that order is lost at the expense of chaos due to loss of energy. For life, this means \"everything is in a constant state of decay\".\n \n However, this is the very whip which drives life. In a world where everything is in a constant state of decay, only patterns capable of sustaining themselves in some way achieve a longer existence. The very principles of life are caught herein: multiply and heal.\n \n This is possible. The rates of decay, or energy potentials differ from one pattern to another, and it is thus possible to create more localized order at the expense of increasing chaos. This is exactly what life does - steal energy from anything that energy can be stolen from. While energy is indeed lost in each transaction, it may suffice for the time being. \n \n A nice analogy is swimming upriver. All water moves downstream, but it is possible to swim upstream by forcing, some water to flow downstream even more quickly. The sad truth is that the river is stronger in the end and unless we figure out something quite creative, we'll eventually tire and join the slow flow.\n \n For evolution this is the prime motivating force. As time progresses, all patterns fade. Yet, as there is a positive net sum of energy available, change occurs, patterns emerge and then fade. Except for one type of pattern - a pattern that perpetuates itself. Life is a rebel - a rebel against the second law.\n \n And once we have a spark of life, we have evolution.",

In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe.

This material is all covered in the 1st few weeks of a sophomore introductory course on thermo.

Generally in a specialized application of thermodynamics called statistical thermodynamics, disorder is a consideration. Unfortunately, creationists well confuse this with discussions of how messy their rooms are. Disordered means neither messy, chaotic, not disorganized.\n \n By the way, for a long time there have been observations of microscopic particles that did not conform to the laws of thermodynamics. In order to reconcile the behaviour of these particles with thermo, \"fluctuation theorem\" was developed. Back in 2002 predictions of \"fluctuation theorem\" were successfully tested. Random and spontaneous decreases in entropy were observed. But the time periods involved were short, no more that 2 seconds, and the decrease was paid back with a corresponding increase.

A few emphases from previous pages in the present Web site and from www.secondlaw.com that bear on this unfortunate situation are developed below. At the end of this page are superior links to presentations of the second law of thermodynamics and its irrelevance to creationists' arguments against evolution.....\n \n \n \n Links\n A superior list of links to scientific views of evolution as well as to the whole spectrum of creationist sites is in http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/other-links.html\n A scientific analysis of the problems creationists face in asserting that the second law is somehow an obstacle to evolution is http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/probability.html\n A brief, but very substantive, response to creationists' attributing false implications to thermodynamics is http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/creationism.html\n A well-reasoned summary, \"The Second Law of Thermodynamics in the Context of the Christian Faith\" by a chemical physicist, who is also a devout Christian is in his Web page http://members.aol.com/steamdoc/writings.htm\n For info from NASA on substances in space: http://web99.arc.nasa.gov:80/%7Eastrochm/",

   "There was a tremendously interesting show (as most of the Nova series are) last night about the formation of planets. Planets came about as a result of gravity.\n \n Space dust particles collided and began sticking together. The larger the glob became, the more it attracted other globs. As the whole glob grew, it went from dust size, to a grain of sand, to a pebble, to a rock, to a boulder, to a planetoid, to a planet until most of the space debris was in one planet or another.\n \n The larger planets took a lot of hits from meteorites, each collision with a larger meteorite causing great heat energy transfer. The earth 4.5 billion years ago was a molten ball of the original space dust which developed a drying crust about 4.3billion years ago, sustained millions of meteorite hits from huge ice/dust asteroids, spewed magma and steam, gradually became 3/4 covered with water and gave birth to all life as we know it today. The iron sank to the center and it's continuous motion caused a magnetic field, the absence of which would mean our certain death from exposure to the solar wind.\n \n Our moon was formed after a nearly centered collision with a huge planetoid which occured after the sinking of most of the iron (this is why the moon has almost the same composition as the earth except for a noticable scarcity of iron.) The collision that ended up making the moon also caused the earth to wobble and slow in its rotation. The moon was 200,000 miles closer to earth than it is today.

And thermodynamics doesn't \"deal with\" entropy. Entropy is a property of a thermodynamic system.\n \nHere's a definition:\n elements in a closed system tend to seek their most probable distribution; in a closed system entropy always increases.\n\n And here's another:\n \nIt is impossible for any system to operate in such a way that the sole result would be an energy transfer by heat from a cooler to a hotter body.\n\n And another:\n \nIt is impossible for any system to operate in a thermodynamic cycle and deliver a net amount of work to its surroundings while receiving energy by heat transfer from a single thermal reservoir.\n\n Please explain to me why thermodynamics isn't about heat transfer, since both of those definitions define the 2nd Law in those terms. Also notice that neither even mentions entropy. As I said, the 2nd Law isn't defined in terms of entropy since it is a property of a system. The first definition is the Clausius statement of the 2nd Law, the second is the Kelvin-Planck statement. From chapter 5 of the Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics. By the way, entropy is defined in chapter 6.\n \nSomething is said to be a property of a system if, and only if, its change in value between two states is independent of the process of that change. The Clausius inequality states that the integral of the heat transfer at a part of a system boundary during a given cycle divided by the absolute temperature at that part of the boundary, when the integral is performed over all parts of the boundary and over the entire cycle, is less than or equal to 0. Now, it can be demonstrated (this is a fact, by the way) that for any internally reversible process between two states of a system that the value of the integral depends on the end states only. It can be concluded, therefore, that the integral defines the change in some property of a system (an extensive property, by the way). That property is called entropy.\n\n \nSo if you're dealing with heat, it says that heat won't go from cold to hot by itself.\nRight. The 2nd Law.\n \nIf you're thinking about order and probability, it says that the air molecules in the room you're in will stay randomly distributed, and not all form a sphere in the corner.\nActually, the 2nd Law says that the molecules will tend to stay randomly distributed - there is a very small, but real, probability that all the molecules will rush to one corner of the room.\n \nIn the end it's all about the entropy.\nIn the end, it's all about heat.",

   "Creationists need to pay attention to the red letters.\n \n \n \n http://www.bluffton.edu/~bergerd/NSC_111/thermo6.html\n \n VI. The Second Law of Thermodynamics\n To summarize the previous page,\n \n For heat to flow from a source to a sink, there must be a temperature difference.\n \n When heat is transferred from one body to another, the temperatures equalize. As the temperature of the heat source falls, that of the heat sink rises. \n \n When temperatures are equal, no more heat can be transferred, even though the hot and cold objects still contain heat. \n \n When heat is converted into work, the temperature of the heat source falls, approaching that of the heat sink. \n \n If there is no temperature difference, no heat can be converted into work. But if there is a temperature difference, some of the heat will be used to raise the temperature of the heat sink. \n \n If some of the heat must go into raising the temperature of a sink, not all of it can be converted into work. \n \n Therefore, It is not possible to construct an engine which \n does nothing but convert heat into useful work. \n \n or more generally,\n \n It is not possible to convert one form of \n energy to another with 100% efficiency. \n \n \n The only exception is that 100% of any useful energy can be dissipated as waste heat. \n \n This has important consequences for how we use energy. Normally it is always better to use energy with as few changes of form as possible; so that it is, in principle, better to use the rotary motion of an internal combustion engine to drive a car's wheels than to use the same engine to drive a generator, then use the electricity to drive the car's wheels. \n \n However, in practical engineering we sometimes find that it is better to use a device as a secondary source of energy than as a primary source. For example, one of the simplest hybrid automobile designs does what we just said was the wrong thing to do: it uses an internal combustion engine to drive a generator which stores electricity in batteries, then turns the wheels with electric motors. \n \n BUT it turns out that real automobiles do not normally operate at the most efficient engine rate because the engine is coupled to the wheels. Decoupling from the drive train allows the engine to always function at optimum, more than making up for the energy losses incurred by converting rotary motion into electricity, then back into rotary motion. \n \n The Second Law of Thermodynamics can be stated in several ways: \n \n It is not possible to convert one form of energy to another with 100% efficiency.\n \n Heat will not flow spontaneously from a cold body to a hot body. (This is from your text.) \n \n Refrigerators and air conditioners use mechanical work to move heat against its natural preference, that is, from a cold place to a warmer place. See the reserve articles and this page from How Stuff Works. \n \n Every isolated system becomes more disordered with time. This is NOT a statement of the Second Law, but a metaphor; see Prof. Lambert's site on the Second Law.\n \n The entropy of an isolated system remains constant or increases. This is a verbal statement of the most precise, mathematical form of the law.\n \n Unfortunately, entropy is something for which it is difficult to give a precise verbal description. See Prof. Lambert's more mathematically detailed site on the Second Law.\n \n Remember, \"entropy always increases\" only applies to isolated systems. The Earth, and the surface ecosystems of the Earth in particular, are not isolated systems! Individual parts of a system, even an isolated one, can decrease their own entropy at the expense of a larger increase somewhere else within the system. \n \n Consequences of the Second Law of Thermodynamics include\n \n No perpetual motion machines! \n \n The arrow of time. \n \n Energy can never be used with 100% efficiency. \n \n The eventual heat death of the universe.\n \n The Arrow of Time \n \n Time's direction is a direct consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This is because any process in which entropy increases is irreversible, and we can always tell if a movie of the process is running backwards. \n \n How many shattered lightbulbs have you seen spontaneously reassembling -- unless a movie is being run backwards? \n \n Energy use \n Energy can never be used with 100% efficiency; some of it must always be dissipated. This is another way of saying that perpetual motion is impossible. \n \n The Heat Death of the Universe \n \n Left to themselves, all things tend to equalize their temperatures. In an isolated system, eventually everything will be the same temperature and heat will no longer be able to flow. But since heat engines or reasonable facsimiles are the only things capable of performing useful work, this means that no part of that isolated system (now isothermal as well) will be able to do work on any other part.\n \n The universe is an isolated system, unless Someone outside intervenes.  \n \n *********************************************************\n Of particular interest here:\n \n Every isolated system becomes more disordered with time. This is NOT a statement of the Second Law, but a metaphor; see Prof. Lambert's site on the Second Law.\n \n This site shows that some ancient questions about \"things going wrong\" in our lives \n have surprisingly simple answers in modern basic chemistry \n (even things happening to us which cause that painful cry of \"Why me?\") \n \n Still more important to one's philosophy about life, these chemical ideas can startle \n us into seeing how fortunate we all are: that things don't go wrong more often! \n \n We'll talk mainly about down-to-earth things -- common solid objects of wood, metal, \n and bone, not about complex computer chips or programs going wrong \n (nor about personal relations that fall apart. Even chemistry has limits.) \n \n Simple things often are involved in annoying or deadly happenings to us: breaking a \n surfboard (that then hits us), having a tire blow out, being in a fire in Malibu, \n flying the X-1 (as Chuck Yeager had to) with a corroded battery cable \n or riding a horse and being thrown -- ending up with a broken neck. \n \n Why? Why do we get harassed or even have our lives ruined by events like these?\n \n Life is hard. But it's harder if you don't know how the material world works! \n \n Here are some of the powerful keys to understanding from chemistry:\n \n \n \n Students: If you're in a time bind or an exam is coming up,\n go here for a shorter approach to understanding the second law and entropy.\n \n The e-mail address is feedback@secondlaw.com \n \n -< Next Page -<< Last Page\n \n Frank L. Lambert, Professor Emeritus\n Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA 90041 Version 6.0, April 2005\n \n \n The Encyclopedia Britannica gave this site an Internet Guide Award and allows a direct search link here to its Concise Encyclopedia Articles. Thus, albeit in brief summaries, you can access the entire span of knowledge in the Britannica -- all of science, the humanities, and practical matters in the world. \n \n **********************************************************\n A Student's Approach to the Second Law and Entropy\n The material here is scientifically correct and written for you quickly to get a clear idea of both the second law and entropy. What you learn will help you understand the subject. However, it is more modern than most 2003 textbooks. Thus, if your text and instructor describe things differently, don't argue with or correct her/him! Just memorize what you read in the text and hear in class so that you can give the expected answers on exams. Grades are important at this time in your life :( but understanding will last a lifetime.\n \n The Second Law of Thermodynamics\n Many texts define the second law as \"the entropy of the universe increases during any spontaneous process\" and then throw qrev/T or free energy = &#916;H and &#916;S at you.\n \n That's too complex too fast. We'll see that the second law and entropy are simple, at the level of first-year university chem. \n \n The second law is based on human experience. It doesn't come from complicated theory and equations. So, think of these experiences that you have had: A rock will fall if you lift it up and then let go. Hot frying pans cool down when taken off the stove. Iron rusts (oxidizes) in the air. Air in a high-pressure tire shoots out from even a small hole in its side to the lower pressure atmosphere. Ice cubes melt in a warm room. \n \n What's happening in every one of those processes? Energy of some kind is changing from being localized (\"concentrated\" somehow) to becoming more spread out. Look at those examples again to see how that statement fits them all.\n \n OK? That's it! That's the fundamental science behind the second law: \n Energy spontaneously disperses from being localized to becoming spread out if it is not hindered.\n \n But what about \"entropy\" and \"universe\" in that standard textbook definition? We'll see what entropy is in a minute. But the \"universe\" just means \"the system you're looking at PLUS its surroundings, i.e., everything that's close around it\". System plus surroundings. If that \"system plus surroundings\" bothers you, or if you want details of three of the processes described above, read the next paragraphs. \n \n If not, skip down to \"What Is Entropy, REALLY?\"\n \n The rock has potential energy localized in it when you lift it up above the ground. Drop it and that PE changes to kinetic energy (energy of movement), pushing air aside as it falls (therefore spreading out the rock's KE a bit) before it hits the ground, dispersing a tiny bit of sound energy (compressed air) and causing a little heating of the ground it hits and the rock itself. The rock is unchanged (after a minute when it disperses to the air the small amount of heat it got from hitting the ground). But the potential energy you localized in it by lifting it up is now totally spread out and dispersed all over in a little air movement and a little heating of the air and ground. [System: rock above ground, then on ground. Surroundings: air plus ground.] \n The iron atoms in a hot frying pan are moving rapidly and therefore the hot pan has localized motional energy among all its atoms. That energy in the pan tends to spread out - if it can. Whenever the less rapidly moving molecules in the cooler air of the room hit the hot pan, the faster iron atoms transfer some of their energy to the air molecules. The pan's overall localized energy thus becomes dispersed, spread out to molecules in the room air. [System: pan. Surroundings: room air.] \n Iron in nails or other objects doesn't have to be hot to have 'localized energy' within it in a chemical sense: Iron atoms plus oxygen molecules of the air have more energy localized within their bonds than does iron rust (iron oxide). (That's just a different way of saying that iron reacts with oxygen to release energy, i.e., that the reaction is exothermic. But don't forget that even substances with lots of energy in their bonds are hindered - extremely! - from immediately spreading out that energy. It takes much energy to break the bonds before/as they react, even though far more energy may be then given out as the result of the reaction as the new bonds form.) Therefore, especially in moist air that speeds up the process, iron spontaneously (but not very rapidly) reacts with oxygen and each spreads out some of its bond energy to the surroundings when the iron and oxygen form iron oxide. [System: iron and oxygen, iron oxide. Surroundings: the nearby air plus any object in contact with the rusting iron.] \n What Is Entropy, REALLY?\n Entropy just measures the spontaneous dispersal of energy: how much energy is spread out in a process, or how widely spread out it becomes - as a function of temperature. (Sometimes, it's a simple equation, Entropy change = \"energy dispersed\"/ T, or qreversible/T , as in phase changes like melting or vaporization where &#916;S = &#916;Hfusion /T or &#916;Hvaporization /T, respectively.)\n \n (In chemistry the energy that entropy measures as dispersing is \"motional energy\", the translational and vibrational and rotational energy of molecules [Figure 1 of http://www.2ndlaw.com/entropy.html ] and phase change energy - both motional or phase change energy being designated either as \"q\" or &#916;H in many equations. \"Bond energy\", the potential energy associated with chemical bonds that we talked about in the iron oxidation example, is only measured by entropy when it is evolved (or absorbed) as motional energy.)\n \n Is that description of an entropy change complicated? Entropy is only a kind of \"before and after\" yardstick - measuring how MUCH energy is spread out/T after a process, after compared to before, or how WIDELY spread out/T is the energy after something happens than before. Maybe entropy seems confusing and abstract when the first entropy equation is thrown at you in your text, about a change in entropy in a reversible process: &#916;S = qrev / T. Let's look at it by using a \"how MUCH\" practical example: ice spontaneously melting in a warm room. (Phase change &#916;S, an increase in entropy)\n \n Phase Change - a \"how much\" energy is dispersed example\n From your experience - remember, that's the basis of the second law - what direction do you think the energy of molecules would go - from those faster moving air molecules in the warm room to the slower moving water molecules in the cold ice .....or vice versa from the ice to the warm air? Sure. From the hotter to the colder. Always. [If you need a math proof, it is given in the middle of www.secondlaw.com/six.html] The greater motional energy of the air molecules spreads out some energy to the cold ice and this breaks (or alters) bonds between the water molecules in the ice. Liquid water forms at the tiniest temperature above the melting point of 0oC (273 K) and, reversibly, solid ice forms at the tiniest temperature below 0oC.\n \n Technically, the motional energy of the warmer air molecules that is transferred and dispersed in the ice breaks or alters many hydrogen bonds in the ice. Therefore, this allows the molecules to move with the same amount of energy that they had when just \"dancing in place\" in the ice. But their speed is not increased. Thus, the resulting liquid's motional energy is unchanged, and the temperature doesn't rise above 273 K when ice melts to water. There is only an increase in the potential energy of the liquid water at 273 K.\n \n How MUCH energy is dispersed in melting ice? The enthalpy of fusion, &#916;Hfusion , of course! That's why your text says the entropy increase in melting is &#916;S = qrev /T = &#916;H/T. \n \n Standard Entropy - a \"how much\" energy is dispersed example\n Then, many texts go on to talk about \"standard entropies\", So298 , of all kinds of elements and compounds. Actually, \"standard entropies\" should be called \"standard entropy changes\" for substances. This is because the entropy values of So298 that are listed in Tables come from the total amount of energy (qrev ) that has had to be reversibly spread out (at each fraction of temperature) in any substance as it was very slowly heated up from 0 K to 298 K - a big change from 0 entropy at 0 K to So at 298 K.\n \n Texts usually urge you to look at So298 values to see the differences between the standard entropies of different types of molecules - monatomic gases vs. polyatomic, gases vs liquids of the same element, graphite vs. diamond vs. metals vs iodine. However, texts fail to tie these differences to the energetic relationships shown by entropy values: the energy implicit in these So298 numbers shows the comparative amount of energy that each particular substance must have to exist at 298 K - substances that are capable of more free motion need to have more energy spread out in them or they just could not be stable at 298 K. \n \n Volume Increase: Gas expansion, gases mixing, liquids mixing - \"how widely\" examples\n Most texts show before and after illustrations of a gas spontaneously expanding into an evacuated bulb. When that happens, there's no energy change, no temperature change. Thus, the total motional energy of the initial gas in one bulb initially is the same as half the gas in each of the two bulbs finally. WHY should a gas behave this way? \n \n Your text may use that kind of illustration and then talk about calculating the probability of the gas all being in one bulb versus being in two - with little red dots for energetically colliding molecules and tables for calculations. (But they don't usually emphasize the energy of those little molecules that are racing around and hitting each other!) If your text does that kind of calculation, go along with it; memorize it; you're going to have it on an exam. But \"probabilities\" are a mathematical result of the gas expanding; they don't cause molecules to move from one bulb to the other.\n \n YOU know the real cause for a gas to move into an evacuated bulb-the motional energy of the molecules (translation and rotation) spreads out as widely as it can, if it is not hindered. (It certainly wasn't hindered from spreading out just as soon as that stopcock between the two bulbs was opened!) Since the gas has become dispersed more widely, its entropy increases.\n \n (How to calculate the entropy increase in the spontaneous expansion process is not obvious, because it is an irreversible process unlike the reversible melting of ice at 273 K. [That means you can't use the simple equation with qrev,. There isn't any energy change at all after the stopcock is opened. The gas is simply showing the basic nature of its motional energy to disperse] It isn't a \"how much energy is dispersed\" situation, it's a question of \"how more widely spread out in two bulbs\" is the gas than it was in one. Of course, from the definition of entropy, there is an entropy increase in the expansion because the energy of the gas has dispersed spontaneously. In your text probably this entropy increase is calculated from the energy required to reversibly compress the gas back to the volume of one bulb. (For a recap of such calculations for entropy change in gas expansion, see www.entropysite.com/entropy_isnot_disorder.html#m1 .) \n \n Gases spontaneously mix - a \"how widely\" energy is dispersed example; \n If you put two different gases in that same two-bulb apparatus we talked about just now - but both at the same atmospheric pressure - when you opened the stopcock, they would slowly spontaneously mix. Why? Just the second law, of course!\n \n The molecules of each gas are rapidly moving and colliding; they have \"motional energy\". So, as the second law predicts, the motional energy in those molecules will cause them to spread out if it is not hindered. When you open the stopcock, you are letting the motional energy of each gas spread out more widely into the larger volume of two bulbs rather than staying in one. Big deal calculation of lots of probabilities? Sure, if you want to check the results, but if you want to know the cause, just think about the energy of each gas becoming more widely dispersed in a newly available larger volume - shared by both gases - and so the entropy of each increases.\n \n Liquids spontaneously mix (if they are like each other) - a \"how widely\" example\n When liquid water and alcohol are added to one another, they spontaneously mix and their volume increases. Thus, just as in the example above for gases, there is a larger new volume in which the original motional energy of each liquid can be spread out more widely. The entropy of each increases in the resulting solution. (This is true of all liquids that are somewhat like one another, for example, gasoline and kerosene.)\n \n A small amount of solute is added to a solvent - a \"how widely\" example\n When even a small amount of solute is added to a solvent - not enough to make a big volume change (such as we were talking about just above) - the motional energy of the solvent (and the solute) in the new solution are each more dispersed. (Why and how is not as simple as the examples we have discussed. A brief summary is here http://www.entropysite.com/entropy_isnot_disorder.html#m2 )\n \n If you realize that a solvent's energy is more dispersed in a solution than when it is a pure solvent, you can understand why a solvent in a solution has an increased entropy compared to its entropy as a pure solvent. Greater energy dispersal means greater entropy. Obviously also, the entropy will be larger depending on how many molecules of solute are added to the solvent. That increased entropy of the solvent in a solution is the cause of the \"colligative effects\" that you study: (1) osmotic pressure, (2) boiling point elevation, and (3) freezing point depression. The solvent has more tendency to stay in the solution (because its energy is more dispersed there) and (1) not move as readily through a membrane that allows solvent molecules from pure solvent through it from the other side, (2) not be in equilibrium with solvent molecules in the vapor phase at the normal boiling point of the solvent (and require a higher temperature to cause more molecules to leave the solution to form vapor), (3) not be in equilibrium with the solid phase at the normal freezing point (and require a lower temperature to cause more molecules to leave the solution to form solid).. All of these colligative effects increase as the amount of solute in the solvent is increased because the entropy (i.e., energy dispersal) of the solvent increases.\n \n Heating a substance - a \"how much\" energy is dispersed example\n Textbooks that do not use calculus omit this example, but it can be described qualitatively because we know the basic idea - energy spontaneously spreads out if it is not hindered. Motional energy from hot surroundings is spontaneously spread out in cooler systems/substances, never the other way around. The entropy of the cooler system increases more as it is heated than the hot surrounding decrease in entropy. (Calculations available here: http://www.entropysite.com/entropy_isnot_disorder.html#m3 )\n \n Chemical reactions - \"how much\" and \"how widely\" energy is dispersed\n Spontaneous exothermic reactions are usually due to the chemical bonds in the reactants being relatively weaker than the bonds in the products. (What you actually calculate in the &#916;H change of a reaction is the enthalpy [\"heat\"] of formation of products minus the enthalpy of formation of reactants. Enthalpies of formation are closely related to bond strengths/energies) That \"how much\" energy difference of &#916;H is spread out by the product molecules in moving much more rapidly than the reactant molecules did at the original T. Then, this motional energy of the products is dispersed to the surroundings and the temperature of the system returns to T. \n \n Now, consider the entropy change in a reaction. It is the reactant's motional energy (plus any phase change energy in them) that determines the value/magnitude of the entropy state of each reactant at T. However, because the entropy values of possible products at T are always different than those of the reactants, the &#916;S in the reaction must be calculated from &#916;Sproducts - &#916;Sreactants . That difference is a combination of \"how much\" and \"how widely\" is energy dispersed in the entropy function. (Thus, the &#916;S change alone can be responsible for an exothermic reaction even though it usually either simply adds to or subtracts from the larger &#916;H change.)\n \n Both kinds of energy difference (i.e., \"how much\" and \"how widely\") are combined in the &#916;S change you calculate, but often you can estimate whether the &#916;S change in a reaction is greater or lesser simply by estimating the \" how widely\" factor of energy spreading out in the products as compared to the reactants. This is the scientific reason for the textbook 'rules' of entropy increase in reactions: (1) if more molecules are produced, this involves \"how widely\" (motional energy is more widely spread out if there are more molecules); (2) if a phase change from a solid to a liquid occurs (a phase change involves \"how much\", an increase in potential energy from that in solids to liquids, and \"how widely\", less restricted locations in space in a liquid allow energy to be more spread out); (3) if a gas is produced from a solid or liquid (as stated in (2), the process involves a phase change in which both \"how much\" and \"how widely\" energy is more dispersed.) \n \n Spontaneous endothermic reactions are due to the great motional energy in the hotter surroundings that can be transferred to reactants in a system. As you know from the Gibbs equation, &#916;G = &#916;H - T&#916;S, a high temperature makes the T&#916;S function dominate. Thus, entropy change is causal in endothermic reactions. \n \n In the Gibbs equation, &#916;G = &#916;H - T&#916;S, each term describes an aspect of the energy that is dispersed because of a chemical reaction occurring in a system:\n \n &#916;G is the total energy that is spread out in the universe (system plus surroundings) due to the reaction that has taken place in the system. \n \n &#916;H is the energy from the reaction that is dispersed from the system to the surroundings. \n \n T&#916;S is the energy that is dispersed in the system - in the products of the reaction as compared to the reactants. \n \n If each term is divided by T, the Gibbs can be seen as an \"all entropy\" equation. \n \n The Gibbs \"works\" because it corresponds to the second law as we would state it, \"Energy spontaneously disperses, if it is not hindered. When it does so, entropy increases in the combination of system plus surroundings.\"\n \n This is what the conventional statement means when it says more succinctly but more obscurely, \"The entropy of the universe increases during any spontaneous process.\"",

If you want to call a molecule's total kinetic energy its \"temperature\" then no one can stop you.\n \n \n \n...\n Then if you brought the vessel of gas to absolute zero, would not all the molecules pile up on the bottom of it?\n\n I can't think of a substance that would be a gas at absolute zero.\n They would \"pile up\" in that they would condense into a liquid and then freeze into a solid.\n \n \nIf not, what would keep them from it?\n\n They would, because they'd freeze.\n \n \nThe contents of the vessel includes the gas molecules.\n\n We really are having a cognative disconnect here.\n \n \n They have kinetic energy {individual molecules}, which when they are all added up and averaged can be measured as a temperature.\n\n \nThen I suppose it's not possible for a moving stream of a gas at atmospheric pressure to be colder or hotter than another. A 20 mile per hour wind can be at almost any reasonable temperature.\n\n What the hell does this have to do with the price of tea in China?\n What are you talking about?\n This doesn't even make sense.\n \n\n A convection oven works by recirculating HOT air. It's the TEMPERATURE of the molecules that causes the greater exchange of heat between the air and the meat. By raising the temperature of the air, you are raising the temperature of the molecules that make up the air within the oven.\n\n No, this is where you don't get it.\n You raise the temperature of the gas as a whole, or of parts of the gas, but you do so by raising the kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas. The temperature of the gas increases as the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, not the other way around.\n \n \n \n\n You are speeding up the motion of electrons in each molecule by heating the molecules.\n\n At first I put \"No, that's just not how things work.\"\n But then I thought about it and...\n \n Well, in a way, and probably not how you are thinking.\n When a substance goes from a lower temperature to a higher one, more molecules are able to be promoted to higher energy states. The distribution curve shifts with temperature. Along with this, more of the electrons are also able to be promoted to higher energy states. This does not mean that the picture of a particle electron wizzing around a nucleus is an accurate one, but if one wanted to calculate the relativistic velocity of that electron they could by plugging the energy of the electron into this equation:\n \n E = mc^2 / SQRT(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n \n where v is the velocity of the particle, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n \n But really, when an electron is an an atomic or molecular orbital, it's usually portrayed as a standing probability wave. One has to invoke the particle part of particle/wave duality to start talking about velocity.\n \n \nTheir temperature depends upon the molecular kinetic energy within each molecule. Their ability to transfer heat to the meat is dependent upon their ability to come in contact with the meat which requires motion of the molecule. The heat in the meat comes from the molecules of air, the temperature of which goes down as it transfer its heat to the meat.\n\n Ok. Nothing wrong with that.\n \n \nIts nothing of the sort. Pressure is related to the cooperative affect of all the molecules pounding on the inner surface of the container vessel.\n\n It's precisely the sort, because temperature is related to the cooperative effect of all the molecules whizzing around, vibrating, and rotating. \n \n \nYes it does. Your fathometer needs upgrading.\n\n I don't know what that is, but if you really want to you can define \"molecular temperature\" as the total instantaneous kinetic energy of a molecule, then you can define \"molecular pressure\" as the instantaneous force exerted on a surface by a single gas molecule. \n \n \nThe temperature of a molecule is a measure of its internal kinetic energy.\n\n If that's the way you want to look at it, but you can't measure it in degrees Kelvin, Celcius, or Fahrenheit. It would be measured in Joules or Calories or some measure of energy, not of temperature.\n \n \nHere's two links...both of which use the term \"molecular temperature\". How can you possible say such a thing doesn't exist?http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412003\n\n I loved this paper when it came out.\n Well, not this paper, but the original paper where they first demostrated the interference pattern with C60.\n \n I hate to break it to you but here they aren't talking about what you are talking about. Actually, they are \"misusing\" terminology.\n \n Here they are not:We study C70 fullerene matter waves in a Talbot-Lau interferometer as a function of their temperature.\n \n The matter waves have a temperature that can be measured in degrees.\n \n Here they are misusing it: While the ideal fringe visibility is observed at moderate molecular temperatures, we find a gradual degradation of the interference contrast if the molecules are heated before entering the interferometer. \n \n The vessel containing their C70 is heated and has a certain temperature (900K) where the molecules are sublimed.\n \n The stream of molecules being shot through their interferometer has a certain temperature because it is further heated by lasers, but the individual C70 molecules do not have a temperature, not the the standard way temperature is defined. They could and should have left the word molecular out of the sentence. It asctually would have made more sense.\n \n This is a simple case of throwing a word in where it doesn't belong and no one caring. :)\n \n If you read the body of the paper you'd see they don't imply that a single molecule has what can be defined as temperature.\n \n \n\n http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/scripts/atmosphere/\n\n Ok, terminology in atmospheric science may be different.\n I don't know what they mean here.\n \n Whatever the term \"molecular temperature\" means in this case, it does not mean the temperature of a single molecule.\n \n Now, that I'm googling, I am seeing cases in computational molecular modelling where the term \"molecular temperature\" is used, but I can't figure out what they mean by it. I see some calculating it in eV and some actually calculating it in Kelvin. In other cases I see the term \"molecular temperature\" being used. They also have the term \"molecular pressure.\"\n \n I think these have been labelled these things because in computational chemistry you have to minimize calculations by putting as few molecules as feasible into \"force fields\" that mimic the environment they'd be in. These force fields or tensor fields might be what they are talking about when they use the \"molecular\" versions of temperature and pressure.\n \n Like this one: http://www.mines.edu/~jely/Papers/FPE_217(1)_111.pdf\n \n But notice they say:\n \n \"T is the molecular temperature of the system held constant by a Gaussian thermostat and Q is a ...\"\n \n So, even here the terminology they are using does NOT mean the temperature of a single molecule.\n \n \nTheoretically, they can.\n\n Theoretically, they can't.\n \n \nI don't know that you could devise an experiment to prove it by letting a fixed set of molecules all get to the same temperature, but it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE!\n\n Ok, getting a SET of molecules to the same temperature is not hard at all.\n Getting all molecules in a system into the same energy state is what is impossible.",

   "This has to do with the exchange of the thermal energy of matter, or heat as it is defined. And gluons werent the only bosons I was talking about. I was just trying to point out that if a mollecule/atom gained a bosonic particle, then the kinetic energy of the mollecule/ atom would increase due to the increase in mass. An example would be if a photon excites an electron, it stays with the electron in the excited state and therefore increases the electrons kinetic energy. When the electron discharges a photon, the electron drops to a lower quantum state, hence a lower kinetic energy. This increase/decrease in kinetic energy of the electron in an atom would increase/decrease the kinetic energy of the mollecule/atom.\n\n I see. \n Photons do all this, but I don't know what gluons have to do with thermal energy, except that when the strong force is overcome, you have nuclear fission.

As they collide, the energy of their motion is distributed among them, and the average kinetic energy accounts for what we call \"temperature.\" The temperature of the air is thus a consequence of molecular dynamics. But it makes no sense whatever to speak of the temperature of a single molecule, nor even of a half a dozen molecules. Temperature is an emergent phenomenon, which only becomes significant when a great many molecules are involved.\n\n \n But, really people in certain fields of research will actually talk about the temperature of a molecule. The \"temperature\" will usually be in units of eV, but sometimes they even put it in Kelvin.\n \n In Pump-probe spectroscopy or Transient-absorption spectroscopy, there is usage of the terminology \"hot molecules\" and \"cold molecules.\" Or they say what they really mean and call them \"vibrationally hot molecules.\" \n \n What they are talking about is a molecule that is in a certain vibrational energy state(s). These states can be distributed also within a single molecule as long as the molecule is large enough to accomodate intramolecular \"relaxation\" of vibrational modes, or even vibrational states coupling to rotational or electronic states. But really, I can't think of a single molecule occupying more than a handful of vibrational states, unless the thing is huge like a protein.\n \n In this way, from the distribution function of the single molecule's energy states, a \"temperature\" of the molecule can be calculated (maybe, I think).\n \n So, I'm not really sure of this, but there may be something to this.\n \n Hopefully someone can enlighten us.",

While the ideal fringe visibility is observed at moderate molecular temperatures, we find a gradual degradation of the interference contrast if the molecules are heated before entering the interferometer. A method is developed to assess the distribution of the micro-canonical temperatures of the molecules in free flight. This way the heating-dependent reduction of interference contrast can be compared with the predictions of quantum theory. We find that the observed loss of coherence agrees quantitatively with the expected decoherence rate due to the thermal radiation emitted by the hot molecules.\n \n \n http://www.chemie.hu-berlin.de/ernsting/publications/abstract27.html\n \n The cooling of p-nitroaniline (PNA), dimethylamino-p-nitroaniline (DPNA) and trans-stilbene (t-stilbene) in solution is studied experimentally and theoretically. Using the pump-supercontinuum probe (PSCP) technique we observed the complete spectral evolution of hot absorption induced by femtosecond optical pumping. In t-stilbene the hot S1 state results from Sn\u00aeS1 internal conversion with 50 fs characteristic time. The time constant of intramolecular thermalization or intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) in S1 is estimated as tIVR<<100 fs. In PNA and DPNA the hot ground state is prepared by S1\u00aeS0 relaxation with characteristic time 0.3-1.0 ps. The initial molecular temperature is 1300 K for PNA and 860 K for t-stilbene. The subsequent cooling dynamics (vibrational cooling) is deduced from the transient spectra by assuming: (i) a Gaussian shape for the hot absorption band, (ii) a linear dependence of its peak frequency nm and width square G2 on molecular temperature T. Within this framework we derive analytic expressions for the differential absorption signal DOD(T(t),n). After calibration with stationary absorption spectra in a low temperature range, the solute temperature T(t) may be evaluated from a transient absorption experiment. For highly polar PNA and DPNA, T(t) is well described by a biexponential decay which reflects local heating effects, while for nonpolar t-stilbene the local heating is negligible and the cooling proceeds monoexponentially. To rationalize this behavior, an analytic model is developed, which considers energy flow from the hot solute to a first solvent shell and then to the bulk solvent. Fastest cooling is found for PNA in water: a time constant of 0.64 ps (68%) corresponds to solute-solvent energy transfer while 2.0 ps (32%) characterizes the cooling of the first shell. In aprotic solvents cooling is slower than in alcohols and slows down further with decreasing solvent polarity. This contrasts with nonpolar t-stilbene which cools down with 8.5 ps both in acetonitrile and cyclohexane. Comparison of the cooling kinetics for PNA in water with those for DPNA in water-acetonitrile mixtures suggests that the solute-solvent energy transfer proceeds mainly through hydrogen bonds.\n \n \n \n http://cphys.s.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/iccp5/p2-html/p2-49.html\n \n P2-49 \n Intrinsic Molecular Temperature and Entropy Production in Reactive Energy Flow in Solution \n Masataka Nagaoka \n Graduate School of Human Informatics, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan \n Reactive energy flow in condensed phase [1-2] is analyzed via the instantaneous probability density distribution obtained by solving the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation [3]. The kinetic temperature and the heat flux, which are often used in the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) in bulk systems, are extended, for the first time, to define an internal-spatially \"local\" (ISL) kinetic temperature and heat flux for chemical reacting species in condensed phase. They should offer good measures for the molecular deformability. On this basis, the ISL entropy production rate is calculated for a typical reacting system modeled from the recent pump-probe experiment [3]. The \u00efntrinsic\" molecular temperature (IMT) is defined as an integrated quantity of the ISL kinetic temperature and was found to show a maximum at 620 K arround 100 time unit [3]. It is concluded that the present approach can clarify the fast microdynamics during chemical reactions which shows transient and time-dependent nonequilibrium nature. \n [1] M. Nagaoka, Y.

Erythrosin B (FD&C red#3) was doped into sucrose glasses to investigate its utility as a probe of matrix molecular mobility. The phosphorescence lifetimes (t) of Erythrosin B were determined as a function of temperature (T) from 3-77oC in the absence of O2. Lifetimes decreased monotonically from 750-500ms with increasing T and the system exhibited hysteresis from 15-77\u00b0C, with lifetimes on cooling ~10% higher than those determined during the heating cycle. An Arrhenius plot of the log of the phosphorescence decay rate (1/t) versus 1/T showed two different slopes with a break at ~60oC, near the Tg of dry sucrose, indicating that both the rate and the activation energy for collisional quenching due to matrix molecular mobility increased at T<Tg. Delayed fluorescence (DF) and phosphorescence (P) emission spectra were obtained from 4-85oC. The emission of DF and P were both red-shifted (lower energy); DF intensity is increased while P intensity is decreased with increasing T. A plot of the log of the ratio of peak intensities (log{IDF/IP}) versus 1/T was linear, signifying Erythrosin B as molecular temperature sensor. The phosphorescence emission was lower energy (longer wavelength) when excited at 560 nm than at 530 nm, the energy difference decreased at higher T indicating greater matrix dipolar relaxation due to mobility at higher T; excitation energy had no influence on the emission in mobile aqueous sucrose. An Arrhenius-type plot of the log of inverse energy difference upon excitation at 530nm and 560nm versus 1/T had a sharp break at T~60oC, suggesting a novel relaxation process was introduced at T<60oC. These results demonstrated the validity of luminescence to study molecular mobility in amorphous sugar glasses.\n \n \n http://newton.ex.ac.uk/aip/physnews.393.html\n \n MILLIKELVIN MOLECULES can now be clasped in the same sort of magnetic trap used to chill atoms down to nanokelvins. Molecules are extended objects and not so easily cooled by laser beams, normally the first step in cooling several atom species to ultracold temperatures. Instead, Harvard researchers put calcium- monohydride molecules on the road to refrigeration by mixing them with a buffer gas of helium. Thereafter they were cold enough to load into a system of magnetic fields where the more energetic molecules are allowed to escape. This evaporative cooling brings the molecular temperature to below 1 K, opening up a new regime for collision studies and spectroscopy of cold molecules. (Weinstein et al., Nature, 10 September 1998.)\n \n \n http://www.fgf.de/fup/tagung/thema/ScopeWorkshopSubtleThermalStuttgart-November-21-23_16062005.pdf\n \n http://www.genetical.com/dc/ScientificResearch/Rowland/GPED/Usage.html\n The effects of finite molecular temperature can be crudely approximated with the q_lij_rij setting. This attributes small distributions to the atomic positions. Note that for C60 a setting of 0.0055 is expected to correspond to a temperature of 1000K",

It should be intuitively obvious that each molecule MUST have a temperature.\n \n \n \n \n \nYou can feel as certain as you like.\n But I AM certain that this is not what these people mean.\n \nAgain, if you are certain this is not what they mean then what do you propose they mean. How do you interpret \"molecular temperature\" as used in any one of these papers?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou can post the same links over and over if you want, but just because these people use this term doesn't mean that they define it the way you think they do.\n \n Look I can google too:\n http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q...=en&btnG=Search\n \n This paper (I don't know if the link will work for you):\n http://ej.iop.org/links/q00/Dr+J4ng...xSSg/d60409.pdf\n uses the terms \"molecular temperature\" and \"atomic temperature\" and what they mean in this case is the temperature of molecular hydrogen and comparing that to the temperature of atomic hydrogen, both of which are present in their plasma. But they also talk about Maxwellian Distributions, as in what I've been going on about. \n \nI imagine a plasma temperature being in the range of metal cutting temperatures, far above the levels associated with cold gases where the molecular temperatures are closer to equal.\n \n \n \n \n \nElsewhere in the paper they refer to these two temperatures as the molecular temperature and the atomic temperature.\n \n \n The one where they ask \"What do we mean by molecular temperature?\" \n Is getting to the part where I said in special circumstances you might be able to define something like the temperature of a molecule, but it wouldn't be the same as the temperature of the air. Here they are talking about proteins where one part of the protein \"melts.\" This is one of those things where people put macroscopic qualities on molecular-scale things. In this case it's like squeezing a square peg into a round hole.\n \n \n I went through all of those links and not one of them was using the term to mean the temperature of a single molecule. Not one.\n \n But honestly, I don't know why these people are using the words \"molecular temperature.\" I mean, on of those papers just said that a certain substance could act as a \"molecular temperature sensor.\" This is an example of chemists making something sound fancier than it really is (they do this a lot, it's part of the game). But they don't mean that they are sensing the temperature of one molecule, they mean that the molecule (of which there are a lot in their experiment) acts as a temperature sensor. In the other cases, the physics ones talking about ultracold atoms in laser traps, I honestly don't know what they mean.\n \n Tell you what. I'll go over to the physics forums and start a thread about this.\n I'll ask some questions about it. Believe me, people there will know.\n \n I'll get back to you about what they said, or just link to the thread.\n It may take a few days, but I'll do it.\n \n I'm very curious about this, and I wonder what is meant when this phrase is used in these cases.\n \n \n (Oh, and in this one: http://www.csc2004.ca/Abstracts/00001081.htm\n they mean \"intermolcecular and intramolecular temperature-dependent vibrations...\" They left out a hyphen. The vibrations are inter and intramolecular and they are temperature dependent.)\n\n Finanly, you admit that there may be a definition that works. And you're right about one thing. They may not be detecting the temperature of a single molecule, but they are calculating what that temperature must be.",

In your very last sentence where you point out the hyphen error, you agree that intermolecular and intramolecular temperatures exist.

If I had read it thoroughly instead of skimming it, I would have come across this passage:\n \nThe laser heating increases the molecular temperature by 140 K per absorbed photon.  We calculate that they reach up to 5000 K for very short times, but the re-emission of thermal photons is so efficient that even the hottest molecules are cooled to below 3000 K when they enter the interferometer 7.2 cm behind the heating stage.\n \n That \"per absorbed photon\" is the giveaway. I would have wanted to say to them \"don't you mean it's energy since the energy it absorbed was the energy of the photon?\" Then they would have said, you silly chemist, don't you know modern physics? emoticon_xclown \n \n So let me C&P some posts from the thread in another forum, and maybe it'll explain. But this board doesn't allow [tex][/tex] tags to represent equations and greek letters properly so it might not work out so pretty.\n \n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n \n \n \nYou are confusing thermal with statistical temperature.\n \n Thermal temperature is a old concept, it is derived from thermal entropy and it applicable only to macroscopic bodies.\n \n Statistical entropy is a modern quantum generalization like statistical temperature. It is applicable to single molecules, atoms, or even single atomic nucleus.\n \n In fact, from quantum thermodynamics one can predict phase transitions on nucleus. For more information on molecular, atomic, and mesoscopic temperatures can see CPS: physchem/0309002 and references therein on nuclear studies (a copy will be available online in www.canonicalscience.com in brief).\n \n Note: In the macroscopic limit both temperatures agree.\n\n \n \nHow can you have statistics on one molecule, atom, or nucleus?\n \n What is temperature if not a thermal measurement?\n\n \n \nIt appears that you have read books in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics or kinetics and are misunderstanding statistical in a broad sense with statistics of a population of molecules or atoms. It also appears that you believe that thermal temperature and kinetic temperature are the same that statistical temperature.\n \n One can perfectly do statistics of a single molecule, atom, or nucleus, taking the different quantum states of that system like a \"population\".\n \n The general formula for the entropy of a system is\n \n S = -k Tr {p ln p}\n \n <here the p should be rho and thr r is subscript<\n \n \n where p is the density matrix of the single molecule, atom, or nucleus and is k the Boltzman constant. One also know the energy E of a single molecule, atom, or nucleus, therefore\n \n 1/T = deltaS / deltaE\n \n <here the equal sign should be the necessarily by definition equals sign and the dels should be lower case deltas, as in partial derivatives<\n \n \n I think that you error is in believing that entropy is a macroscopic quantity applicable only to a great number of molecules, what is not true.\n \n From above definition of temperature one can obtain kinetic temperature (average of kinetic motion) and thermal temperature (internal energy by unit of entropy for an Avogadro number of molecules) like special cases.\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted\n It appears that you have read books in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics or kinetics and are misunderstanding statistical in a broad sense with statistics of a population of molecules or atoms. It also appears that you believe that thermal temperature and kinetic temperature are the same that statistical temperature.\n \n One can perfectly do statistics of a single molecule, atom, or nucleus, taking the different quantum states of that system like a \"population\". \n \n \n Wouldn't this be a rather small population?\n \n {No, I'm just a chemist who took the word of certain professors back in the day...}\n \n \n Of course, since I am a simple chemist, I've only seen something like:\n \n S = k{ln Omega}\n \n <here Omega is an uppercase omega<\n \n It's this sort of understanding (or really this level of understanding) and this defintion of entropy that I am working with. Or really I am thinking along the lines of relating entropy and temperature via the heat capacity of a given substance. These are all \"macroscopic\" terms in this line of thinking, of course.\n \n But anyway, are you saying that perhaps the equation you have above is a quantum modification or a generalization of the old-school Boltzmann Principle? \n \n \nQuote:\n One also know the energy of a single molecule, atom, or nucleus, therefore\n \n \n \n \n Yeah, see that's what my problem here is.\n I always thought of the Bolzmann constant as was a way to relate energy to temperature, especially since it's expressed in terms of J/K. \n \n I guess here you are defining temperature as a relation between entropy and total energy? In this case would the entropy be a component of this total energy? If that is indeed what you mean by since it's vague to me what you are talking about here. \n \n Any time I see this sort of thing (where temperature is in an equation that can apply to a single particle) I assume that the temperature in the equation is the \"ambient temperature\" or the temperature of the surroundings. For example, when someone talks about the temerature dependence of some molecular or lattice vibration, they don't mean the temperature of the single vibration or the temperature of the single molecule, but the temperature of the surrounding medium. But, I'm probably wrong in this way of looking at things.\n \n \n \nQuote:\n I think that you error is in believing that entropy is a macroscopic quantity applicable only to a great number of molecules, what is not true. \n \n \n Well, I guess I wasn't thinking in terms of entropy so much.\n I was really looking at a temperature as an average and nothing more.\n I guess you are saying effectively the same thing as Nicky.\n That since there is an ensemble of energy states within a single molecule at a given instant, whether they are different manifestations (ie, vibrations, rotations, electronic states, etc), that these energies can all be averaged into a temperature? \n \n So, in the old-school Boltzmann principle, the value for could be very small, but as long as it's more than 1, all is good?\n \n \n \nQuote:\n From above definition of temperature one can obtain kinetic temperature (average of kinetic motion) and thermal temperature (internal energy by unit of entropy for an Avogadro number of molecules) like special cases. \n \n \n So you are saying that in the fullerene beam paper, when they use the term \"molecular temperature\", the authors are perhaps referring to the kinetic temperature of single fullerene molecules? \n \n For instance when they say:\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by Arndt et al.\n We change the internal temperature\n of the molecules in a controlled way before they enter a\n near-field interferometer, and observe the corresponding\n reduction of the interference contrast. \n \n \n \n that this is what they mean?\n \n It's almost like they wanted to say internal energy, but said temperature instead. \n \n Or here:\n \n \nQuote:\n Decoherence of the fullerene matter waves can be induced by heating the molecules with multiple laser beams (514.5 nm, 40 \u00b5m waist radius, 0 &#8722; 10 W) before they enter the interferometer. The resulting molecular temperature can be assessed by detecting the heating dependent fraction of fullerene ions using the electron multiplier D1 over the heating stage. \n \n \n \n Do you think they could have used the term \"beam temperature\" and it would have just meant the same thing?\n \n But then they MUST mean the temperature of single fullerenes here:\n \n \nQuote:\n The laser heating increases the molecular temperature by 140 K per absorbed photon. We calculate that they reach up to 5000 K for very short times, but the re-emission of thermal photons is so efficient that even the hottest molecules are cooled to below&#8764; 3000 K when they enter the interferometer 7.2 cm behind the heating stage. \n \n \n But they then sort of talk about the way they calculated these temperatures:\n \n Quote:\n \nFIG. 3: Spectral photon emission rate R\u0015 of C70 molecules, as used for the calculation of thermal decoherence. We use the published [25] absorption cross-section for (S0 !S1) and a heat capacity of CV = 202kB. The fall-off to short wavelengths is determined by the limited internal energy of the molecules, while the decrease at long wavelengths is due to the lack of accessible radiative transitions at energies below 1.5 eV. The figure shows that in the absence of cooling a single molecule at 2500 K travelling at 190 m s&#8722;1 (that is, with a transit time of 4 ms through the interferometer) would emit an integrated number of three visible photons. This is sufficient to determine the path of the molecule if the emission occurs close to the second grating. \n \n \n Is that heat capacity they are talking about a \"molecular heat capacity\"?\n \n I'm convinced now, of course, that these folks are talking about the temperature of single fullerene molecules, but am I being too presumptuous in thinking that \"molecular temperature\" (or atomic or nuclear) cannot mean the same thing as traditional bulk temperature? They do talk later about molecular analogs to blackbody radiation, thermionic emission, and evaporative cooling, and it is obvious to me how these analogies are drawn, so the temperature they speak of is merely a molecular analog and not the same thing as a bulk temperature.\n \n Is it like thermal entropy vs. informational entropy where people use the same word to actually mean two different (but maybe analogous) things?\n\n \n \n\n \nWouldn't this be a rather small population?\n \n \n Yes, but entropy is defined even for a population of a single element, trivially is zero then. \n \n \nQuote:\n What's ?\n This is the first time I've seen this equation.\n\n \n It is not , it is , what is the trace operator.\n \n Your Boltzmann-Planck formula is a special formula, it is not the proper definition of entropy like many (all?) physical chemistry and statistical thermodynamics textbooks argue.\n \n Only when the system is at microcanonical equilibrium being closed, without long-range correlations, external EM fields, absence of gravitatory effects, etc. the quantum state of the system is\n \n p = 1 / Omega\n \n <p is rho<\n \n and the Boltzmann-Planck formula S=k{ln Omega} follows from the Von Neumann definition by direct substitution.\n \n S=-kTr{p lnp}\n \n but in general the quantum state is not defined by the inverse of number of available states.\n \n You are relating entropy and temperature using specific concepts aplicable only in determined situations.\n \n The definition of temperature is that i wrote. It is the standard definition of temperature in physicists books. It is know since 1930 at least, but irrelevant chemists textbooks ignore rigorous formulations and still work with heat engines (19th century thermodynamics).\n \n In CPS: physchem/0309002 i did a criticism to a 2002 paper by a group of very famous chemists (one was Evans) published in PR claiming for an experimental violation of second law of thermodynamics in nanoclusters. They used arguments from usual chemical thermodynamics (even a very very wrong argument from the Levine on physical chemistry, Do you know the book?). Of course all the paper was wrong. Since chemical thermodynamicians have no idea of rigorous thermodynamics. At least, two physicists published a formal comment showing that article was completely wrong with basic misunderstanding of elementary 20th century thermodynamics. A specialist from institute of microelectronic contacted with me and said that my criticism was correct, the only violation of thermodynamics \"was in the title of paper by Wang et al.\"\n \n I have atempted to modify the ideas of chemist and correct their really great errors, but many of them ignore modern stuff and continue to publish wrong papers and books; many physicists, biologists, and enginners simply don't read chemical literature. In some cases, enginners have a more elevated level than chemical thermodynamicians like celebrated Klotz (do you know?) \n \n E is the internal energy of the system, the notation E is used in statistical theories and the notation U in thermal macroscopic. However, one can introduce the total energy (internal more kinetic) into dS.\n \n \n \nQuote:\n I assume that the temperature in the equation is the \"ambient temperature\" or the temperature of the surroundings.\n\n \n This is a common error of chemical thermodynamics. The above definition is the definition of temperature of a body from its entropy and energy. It is an intrinsic property of that body. Only at equilbrium (chemical thermodynamics deals only with that) body is equal to T external T and you can talk of \"external\" or \"ambient\" temperature.\n \n Temperature is not average. It is the definition that i said. After, in special systems and situations, it \"looks like\". For example, aplying the above definition to an equilibrium ideal gas of classical puntual molecules one recovers the idea of temperature like average of kinetic motion (velocity).\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by shrumeo\n So, in the old-school Boltzmann principle, the value for Omega could be very small, but as long as it's more than 1, all is good?\n\n \n If Omega = 2 then entropy is not zero. If Omega = 1 entropy also exists! then it is zero. However, the Boltzmann-Planck definition is only valid in the restricted conditions above stated.\n \n \nQuote:\n So you are saying that in the fullerene beam paper, when they use the term \"molecular temperature\", the authors are perhaps referring to the kinetic temperature of single fullerene molecules? \n\n \n I didn't read Arndt et al. paper but i don't think that are refering just to kinetic energy. It appears that they are talking about the thermal agitation of the molecules in different quantum states without kinetic motion, only internal motion and the posterior cooling of the molecule. Probably they are doing an experiment of nuclear temperature and measuring (in-)coherence of nuclear wavepackets and reduction (localization) by an external perturbation.\n \n Note: the nuclear thing is not what they are talking about but the second sentence is more like it.\n \n \nQuote:\n Is that heat capacity they are talking about a \"molecular heat capacity\"?\n\n \n I don't know because i didn't read. But i think that you believe that heat capacity is a macroscopic concept but is not. In fact, the definition of heat capacity for any system is\n \n Cz = T ( delta S / delta T)z\n \n <the z's are subscript, the deltas are lowercase deltas as in partial derivatives, C is the heat capacity, S and T are entropy ans temp, of course<\n \n Thermal (or bulk) temperature is above definition that i wrote\n \n 1/T = delta S / delta E\n \n when aplied to a macroscopic system\n \n 1/T bulk = (delta S bulk/ delta E bulk)\n \n Informational entropy and information temperature are other concepts; are more conceptual (mathematical) than physical. For example, one can talk of informational temperature of a trasmited message for a coaxial line but it does not signify that the coaxial is heated.\n\n \n So, it seems that my total misunderstanding of this stems from my training as a chemist, where apparently, we all have it wrong when it comes to temperature. emoticon_xclown \n \n Even the textbooks are wrong! emoticon_wow",

In this case the electrons' deBroglie wavelength and velocity change with voltage. \n \n But in an orbital, I'm not so sure the electron has a definite velocity, so I'm not sure if the relativistic mass could be calculated.\n \n \n Well, the orbital characteristics that depend on charge are the pairing energy. Since electrons repel each other, that's why they don't want to be in the same suborbital if they can find another one to be in \"alone\". \n \n I don't think the mass ever really comes into play.\n \n The shapes of the (sub)orbitals and their characteristics just come from \"solving\" the Schrodinger equation using each set of quantum numbers.\n \n Or more specifically, you \"calculate\" Psi*Psi, or the wavefunction times its complex conjugate, which gives a probability density. It's this probablity density graphed in 3D space that gives the shape of the orbital.\n \n The hyperphysics website can explain it way better than I ever could.\n Psi (or the wavefunction is the thing that looks like Neptune's trident.)\n \n http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/schr.html\n \n The first three quantum numbers fall out of the Schrodinger equation for a H atom:\n \n http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydsch.html\n \n http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/qnenergy.html\n \n I'm sorry I'm just linking to hyperphysics, but it just lays it out plainly.\n \n We have to take whole classes in this s-. It can get really hairy.\n But, the more times you read it and practice things and see it applied in the real world (like in spectroscopy) it all starts to make \"sense\" and that makes it easier to remember.\nThank you for all of these links, they were extremely helpfull! What kind of background do you have in quantum physics? Are you going into a profession that deals with these things?",
