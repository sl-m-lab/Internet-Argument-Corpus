   "Rent this movie and change all your views on what you thought of America and all our rights! \"Bowling for coulumbine\" I didn't spell that right, but go to the video store and rent it today. I don't think its so much that America has easy access to guns, because in Canada, they will give you a gun when you open up an account at a bank. I am an American, Irish, Crazy and pumped full of fear as I sat and watched the news two nights ago. I sit and I stare like I am a damn zombie and watch as my country falls apart. Two years ago, I promised myself I wouldn't watch the news anymore, it was my new years resolution to be honest. I sleep with a 16 inch hunting knife under my pillow because I am so afraid of what will happen to me if I can't protect myself and someone breaks into my house. Since I was 10 years old I have had ordinary kitchen knifes stabbed into my stuffed animals bodies sleeping only inches away from my face just so I could know that I would be safe. America has done this to me. \n Gun controll? Sure, I am all for it. Don't give anyone in the whole world a gun for all I care, but you might as well take away fireworks, gasoline and lighters. People are just out of thier minds afraid of what will be come of them if for whatever reason they become loosers. They figure \"My life sucks and I want to die... I think I'll just go to WALMART and buy a gun, go into a crowded area and off people, just for fun\" Why? BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO OWN A GUN. \n But I am not saying anything about that... you can buy a gun at any Walmart, in any country... why though, do we have almost 13,000 gun shooting MURDERS in America each year? And why does Canada only have 163? AND! Every country in the world combined does not have as many gun murders in one year as we do in 8 months. Why? I don't really know. Maybe because we as a country are just too afraid of whats out thier, what can get us. We might as well get them before they get us right? Our own damn government teaches us that every day with a war on terrorism. It's a part of our history, murder what you don't think is right. Kill because you are a Christian and you have your rights. Kill African Americans because they \"are taking over\" KKK. Because we have the right to fight for what we believe in. Go to your school and shoot innocent people because you have the right to finally stand up for yourself. Drop a nuke on a deprived country because they don't like America. Start the Gulf WAR because they wouldn't give us oil. Kill thousounds of our own innocent soldiers in Vietnam because WE as a country have the right to STICK OUR NOSES WHERE THEY DON'T BELONG. Kill your wife in a heated rage and plead temporary insanity. We have all these RIGHTS as human beings... well, I have a right to be afraid of what is happening to my country as fat cats and war hungry presidents make thier mark in history by starting wars, teaching MY CHILD that this war is okay... because it's not about terrorist anymore, it's about oil now... hundreds of american soldiers have lost thier lives already over oil... GUNS are not the problem, people are. WAKE UP AMERICA! BEFORE WE DROWN OURSELVES IN BLOOD.",

The scary thought is that violence in this country is being PROGRAMMED into very young children. Children across all economic, racial, and geographic regions in this country are being bombared with notions and society values that respect and accept violence. Taking away guns will not change any of that. Children across this country are not starting off with the proper socialization and citizenship skills they will need later in life. Instead they are learning behavior from Chuck Norris movies instead of loving parents.",

I don't know of any places like that in the US.\n\n \n What is \"a lot\"? Do you mean the people in Montreal leave thier doors unlocked?\n \n Here is one place for you that you missed in the USA:\n http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/neighbors/sequim/safe07.html\n \n How about cars, most of Americans seem to be unconcerned about locking doors:\n \n http://www.collision-insight.com/news/20010827-progressive.htm\n \n The Canadians do the same thing:\n \n http://www.mucda.mb.ca/auto_theft.htm\n \n They are both getting jacked.\n \n The price of freedom is eternal vigilance agains enemies. Ask the Pearl Harbor survivors. I prepare for any disaster. I keep stocks of food/water, medical supplies, and ammo. I keep my CPR and first aide cards up to date. Self reliance and independance go hand in hand. I prepare not just for crime, I prepare myself for any event. Good citizenship is being prepared. That does not mean you go out of the way like a survivalist. What it means is you do not do NOTHING to prepare. If your not prepared your part of the problem. It is just being minimally prepared vs doing nothing to prepare. Preparedness could be in the form of helping a choking baby in a restaurant, having garden tools to grow vegatables in the yard or dig collasped buildings, ready to care for the kid who fell off his skateboard until paramedics arrive, taking care of my own plubming, etc. If you are not prepared, then you do what most people who are not prepared. They do nothing. People who are not trained or prepared do what they practice. If you do nothing to prepare, then you wait for the government to drive by with blankets and food when there is a disaster. Or when there is a choking baby you wait for the paramedics to arrive.\n \n I am prepared not only to take care of myslef, but my friends and neighbors. Self-reliance means not asking for help and not offering it. I am also not above asking for help when I absolutely need it, nor will I turn my back on neighbors in desperate need. Citizenship is preparedness to take care of you and and your neighbors. If you have done nothing, then you are just sheep, and are part of the problem.",

If it's just a problem with violence then why doesn't the US have an incredibly high knife homicide rate compared to other developed nations? Only when it comes to violent crimes involving guns does the US clearly have a violent crime rate much, much higher than other developed nations. So guns do seem to be part of the problem.",

Guns are related to our violence. They do not cause our violence.\n \n The solution to ANY problem, is the solution to the root cause. Removing guns does not address any of the root causes of crime and violence. Removing guns from our society is like treating a virus infection with anti-biotics. It may take care of secondary bacterial infections, but it is not a cure for the root cause, the patient is still sick.",
