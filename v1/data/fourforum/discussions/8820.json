   "Wow, and this is just after a debate I had with a mixed person who definitely had nothing to do with the black side of his race. At all.\n \n Haha, I don't think they need to be classified as anything. I've seen mixed heritages take either or both side of their ancestry (some on rather strategic/opportunistic moments), and I'm surprised you'd try to group together all the situations a person became and experience a life of mixed heritage. Does society influence this? There's no way that it couldn't, but in the end I think a person is responsible for defining themselves.\n \n How a person may choose whether to represent one or both sides may depend on how much interaction or influence either side on the society had on them. I tend to meet more 'black' mixed people in black-dominated settings, more 'white' mixed people in white-dominated settings, and more 'equally supportive' mixed people in mixed societies, where both sides of his/her family had an equal role, or just unusually accepting about things. Looks also may come into it, but if it does matter I don't know how consistent or important it is.\n \n To me it should be a choice that they make for themselves, amd all that I met seemed fine (all the kinds I mentioned above plus all others) with how they place themselves in society, and I'd be disturbed if anybody tried to herd them to a particular label for their own needs or goals.",

   "I think people have to determine for themselves how, or indeed if, they want to define their ethnicity. That said, there is a fairly well established concept of \"politically black\", whereby people with a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds consider themselves black because they share a common experience of being on the receiving end of racism in preodminantly white countries, and can include anyone discriminated against on the basis of physical racial attributes, so everyone from afro-carribeans to south asians to chinese to native americans, and anyone from a mixed background would be considered black.",

There's whites and non-whites, its hard to imagine, but any other race could just as well be considered the \"default\" if you will. In an alternate universe it might be the case that there are blacks, and non-blacks, and in that case, anybody who had any white Asian or Hispanic physical features or strong cultural background would be considered non-blacks.

You point about the whole \"default\" thingy is an excellent point. evitehr your white or your not. Basically this translates you are either white and if u r not white then you are Black (even if you are 50% or in some more than 50% White). any slight level of colour or Black features makes you Black. I don't really agree with this but its undoubtedly the case. \n \n -really come on i mean how can Cloin powell be called Black.Look at his skin colour. Its verging on White for christ's sake But he would still be classed as Black because he has slight Black-ish features. Its a funny one IMO!!http://www.chally.com/images/powell2.jpg",

   "1st question - Well, they can't \"drastically inherit more genes from their white parent\". Each parent gives half. I think it does stem from the \"one-drop\" rule, but I think that it is mostly applied to those who are HALF black, any less and it becomes hard to tell. Plus it's \"hip\" to be \"black\" right now and generally people root for the \"underdog\".\n \n 2nd-It's been \"proven\" that African genes are more dominant. Most scientists believe that \"black\" people were the first people and as genes mutate they become less dominant. I think your view on color is skewed, if they are lighter than the black parent you will probably say that they are closer in color to their \"white\" parent. If you look at hair color and texture mixed people generally have hair that looks like the hair of \"black\" people. Also, eye color is generally brown.\n \n 3rd-I think that if they have to have a classification it would be \"mixed\".",

Mulattoes, should begin an organization that recognizes them as a race unto themselves but devoted to the advancement of all people. \n Their intelligent and reasoned approach to world issues will eventually overshadow the self serving goals of people who represent races in the false name of equality or self preservation. \n We, likely will not live to see the grand results of the rise of mulattoes to positions of power that will bring harmony.
