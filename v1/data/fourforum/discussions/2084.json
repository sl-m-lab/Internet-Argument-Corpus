   "Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush\n by John W. Dean\n \n http://www.buzzflash.com/premiums/watergate.html\n \n BuzzFlash Recommendation:\n \n With a title like \"Worse Than Watergate\" -- and written by THE John Dean -- do we need to say anything more?\n \n John Dean, a favorite of ours at BuzzFlash, knows of what he speaks. The legal counsel to the White House who warned Nixon that there was a cancer on his presidency can spot an ethically and morally corrupt administration when he sees one.\n \n Dean documents how Bush and Cheney have \"created the most secretive presidency of my [Dean's] lifetime.\" For someone who was exposed to the dark secrets of the Nixon administration, there can be no more searing indictment.\n \n And an indictment this book is. The only thing that keeps Bush and Cheney from being impeached is the carefully crafted veil of secrecy that they have created to hide their misdeeds from public and legal scrutiny.\n \n Of course, controlling all three branches of government -- Soviet style -- helps. And it also helps to have an Attorney General who is as blindly loyal as a pet pooch.\n \n \"To say that their secret presidency is undemocratic is an understatement,\" Dean declares.\n \n The only thing, Dean argues, between Bush, Cheney and orange jumpsuits and jail bars is the revelation of the truth. John Dean gets as close as one can get in this book.\n \n Dean's book makes you realize that the Bush Cartel is going to do everything they can to steal the 2004 election. Because if they lose, they might end up in a federal prison, if they don't pardon themselves before they are indicted.\n \n The White House doesn't have enough shredders to cover up their likely crimes.\n \n Thank you, John Dean, for casting a light on an administration that believes the laws of the United States of America do not apply to them.\n \n http://www.buzzflash.com/premiums/watergate.html",
