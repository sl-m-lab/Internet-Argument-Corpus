   "Ok, I`ll bite ;)\n \n Well, not really. I`m convinced that genes can play an important role in many aspects of our personal characteristics. But, I also believe that enviroment can play an important role in many aspect of our personal characteristics. As for those particular characteristics you mentioned I think that genes may or may not play an important role, depending how you define the words.\n \n Intelligence. The word intelligence is a common word, and is often used in very different circumstances and with very different meaning. Intelligence as cognitive ability is one thing. Intelligence as logic is another. I`m sure that depending on how you use the word inteligence, genes play everything from a very important role, to a not-really-important role at all.\n \n industriousness: With industriousness I`m assuming that you mean \"hard working\". To be honest, I doubt this is a genetical trait. I think hard work is a matter of preferences. If you value the fruits of hard work higher than others, you will be more industrious than others. If you value free time more than others and/or dislike the physical or mental strain of hard work more than others, you will be less industrious than others. And unless these preferences are caused by genes (which I doubt), industriousnes \u00ectself isn`t caused by genes either.\n \n Edit: I did a search on the subject sociobiology and it appears like they argue that preferences are highly caused by natural selection (examplified with sugar and how it once served an important purpose to enjoy the taste of sugar). And while I think that it seems like a plausible theory, I don`t really know how much explanatory power it has for measuring differences between individuals. Its one thing that natural selection has weeded out certain basic preferences and promoted others. Its another that it actually explains the difference between individuals.",

I found a metanalysis of 212 twin and family IQ studies, and the authors found that IQ was somewhere between 47 and 68% genetic depending on the model. Their findings in fact were more conservative than usual because they found a stronger role for pre-natal envirnoment than other studies (by the way, all biological factors are underappreciated, not just genes). As far as I can figure, these twin studies are powerful research designs which I find very compelling. \n \n IQ tests typically measure something along the lines of abstract problem solving. The activity on this forum is the sort of thing that IQ taps. While there is some wiggle room in the meaning of intelligence, I think people usually have this abstract problem solving in mind when they say, \"That person is intelligent.\" They usually don't say that if they mean a very different kind of ability like good social skills or musical ability for example (which by the way are probably substantially genetic as well).",

To the extent that the identical twins are more similar, this is attributed to genes. Identical twins are usually much more similar. This research is the basis of the finding that homosexuality is partly inherited. \n \n Another method is to compare identical twins raised together with identical twins raised apart. The extent that the twins raised together are more similar to each other than twins raised apart, the more that is attributed to the environment. Identical twins are usually very similar, whether or not they are raised together. \n \n Yet another method is to see if adopted children turn out more like their adoptive parents or their biological parents.

   "i think i may be the person your debate is aimed at. i am not convinced that genes has a significant role, if any, in the formation of an individual's character\n \n the identical twin study shows a weak correlation at best, barely any category showed more than 50% corelation. id like to see a similar study for close siblings, where the genetic similarity is less, and see if the results would be any different. that would surely show that the twin connectiveness is stronger.\n \n i think big orn's post points out well how immensely significant environment is in identity formation. i have never seen, nor do i think it is possible, for a gene to exist that would predispose big orn's friend to change nearly as dramatically without the influence of the environment he went through\n \n i also agree that pointing fingers at genes as the reason why people take certain actions or habits is a cop out\n \n i suspect that my motives will be an issue that galton may address, so let me get that out of the way early. i am not buying the '[insert tendency here] gene' story simply because i have looked at the articles both for and against, as well as made my personal observations of behavior and environmental influence, and i have come to that conclusion. it has nothing to do with religious or political affilliation\n \n if i see conclusive reports based on experiments and observation that links genetics to behavior, then i would be happy to look at it, but so far i cannot say that i have\n\n Several points: Those numbers I gave in the original post are not correlations; they are the percentage of behavior that is explained by genes, calculated by comparing how much more similar identical twins (100% the same genes) were to each other than fraternal twins (only 50% the same genes) were to each other. These numbers are conservative too since I did not include the percentage of the behavior explained by the interaction of genes and environment.\n \n Second, it is an error to think that the logic of environmental influence is any different than genetic influence. Both approaches claim some X (or combination of X's) cause Y. If Y is high school dropout, for example, environmental explanations may pick poverty for the X; genetic explanations may pick academic ability. They both equally imply that some \"external\" force outside of free will causes dropout. The logic of envirnomental determinism says \"Dropout is not his fault\" to the same degree that genetic determinism does. If you don't like \"excuse\" theories, then logically you should dislike nurture as much as nature theories. (As an aside, the fact is that most nurture folks are just about 100% envirnonmental determinists. No biological person is extreme like that, dismissing any role of the environment.) \n \n Third, if a person doesn't like evolution, that is no reason not to dismiss biological explanations, because biology could influence behavior, whatever its origins. My view is that a person's behavior is the combination of genetically-influenced traits and experiences, as well as choice among a variety of alternatives. I don't deny the importance of any of the three. \n \n One example of the power of genetic explanations is that environmental approaches have a difficult time explaining why siblings often turn out very different from each other since they are all raised in a very similar environment. According to the biological approach, each child receives a unique combination of genes from their parents, making each sibling unique from each other (and from every other human being). So this theory implies that we will see diversity among siblings where environmental theory has to develop post-hoc explanations to account for this diversity.",

My view is that a person's behavior is the combination of genetically-influenced traits and experiences, as well as choice among a variety of alternatives. I don't deny the importance of any of the three.\n\n like i said before, my position on this has nothing to do with accepting evolution. i dont deny that genetics play a major role in the one's physical limits, and therefore their abilities to do certain things, but behavior and abilities are separate things. and identity has more to do with self-perception than anything else.\n \n \nOne example of the power of genetic explanations is that environmental approaches have a difficult time explaining why siblings often turn out very different from each other since they are all raised in a very similar environment.

So this theory implies that we will see diversity among siblings where environmental theory has to develop post-hoc explanations to account for this diversity.\n\n again, even the closest siblings encounter different experiences, form different world perspectives, and develop different perceptions of themselves. i hope im not being thick-headed, but somehow the genetic explanations still always leave gaps\n \n do you have any links to studies where the behavioral similarities between twins growing up together were compared to those of siblings growing up together?",

Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes strong and consistent findings from more than 20 controlled family studies indicating nearly 5-fold greater relative risk of suicidal acts among relatives of index cases with suicidal behavior compared to relatives of nonsuicidal controls. Relative risk was greater for completed suicide than for attempts. \n \n Contributions of genetic instead of environmental factors are indicated by a higher average concordance for suicidal behavior among co-twins of suicidal identical twins compared to fraternal twins or to relatives of other suicidal subjects, in at least seven studies. Three studies indicate significantly greater suicidal risk, particularly for completed suicide, among biological versus adoptive relatives of suicidal or mentally ill persons adopted early in life. \n \n Molecular genetics studies have searched inconclusively for associations of suicidal behavior with genes mainly for proteins required for central serotonergic neurotransmission. Complex interactions of environmental with heritable risk and protective factors for suicide and psychiatric illnesses or vulnerability traits are suspected, but specific intervening mechanisms remain elusive. \n \n Familial or genetic risks for psychiatric factors strongly associated with suicide, such as major affective illnesses and alcohol abuse, as well as impulsive or aggressive traits, have not consistently been separated from suicidal risk itself.",

   "how do people come to the conclusion that behavior is genetically influenced? \n\n \n Your question prompted me to do a quick search. Here's a bit of what I found (from http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/behavior.shtml):\n \n \nWhat indications are there that behavior has a biological basis? \n [text provided by Joseph McInerney]\n \n Behavior often is species specific. A chickadee, for example, carries one sunflower seed at a time from a feeder to a nearby branch, secures the seed to the branch between its feet, pecks it open, eats the contents, and repeats the process. Finches, in contrast, stay at the feeder for long periods, opening large numbers of seeds with their thick beaks. Some mating behaviors also are species specific. Prairie chickens, native to the upper Midwest, conduct an elaborate mating ritual, a sort of line dance for birds, with spread wings and synchronized group movements. Some behaviors are so characteristic that biologists use them to help differentiate between closely related species.\n \n Behaviors often breed true. We can reproduce behaviors in successive generations of organisms. Consider the instinctive retrieval behavior of a yellow Labrador or the herding posture of a border collie.\n \n Behaviors change in response to alterations in biological structures or processes. For example, a brain injury can turn a polite, mild-mannered person into a foul-mouthed, aggressive boor, and we routinely modify the behavioral manifestations of mental illnesses with drugs that alter brain chemistry. More recently, geneticists have created or extinguished specific mouse behaviors-ranging from nurturing of pups to continuous circling in a strain called \"twirler\"- by inserting or disabling specific genes.\n \n In humans, some behaviors run in families. For example, there is a clear familial aggregation of mental illness.\n \n Behavior has an evolutionary history that persists across related species. Chimpanzees are our closest relatives, separated from us by a mere 2 percent difference in DNA sequence. We and they share behaviors that are characteristic of highly social primates, including nurturing, cooperation, altruism, and even some facial expressions. Genes are evolutionary glue, binding all of life in a single history that dates back some 3.5 billion years. Conserved behaviors are part of that history, which is written in the language of nature's universal information molecule-DNA. \n\n \n As you and I seem to agree, we don't have enough info tell for sure exactly what Greg's brother's problem truly is. But you seem to be dismissing the whole field of behavioral genetics a bit quicker than you should.",

   "fishpower, lets take a look at the article you pasted. first of all, we know for a fact that genes dictate physical features (eye color, hair type, nose shape, etc). physical features put limitations on what a particular creature can and cannot do. the physical feature of relatively large and strong claws would be associated with the behavior of living in burrows rather than in trees. the physical feature of a sharp sense of smell would be associated with the behavior of hunting from downwind. so it it the behavior itself that is dictated by the genes? or is it the physical features and the animal's adaptation to use these features as an advantage?\n \n again, we know for a fact that behaviors can be learned. with conscious effort, we can teach ourselves to be more patient (or impulsive), and we can teach a dog to use a door lever.\n \n based on what is known about genes, and about behavior, it seems quite extraordaimary to think that genes that have been extensively shown to alter physical attributes can also alter the information in someone's brain. as far as we know, genes do not put information into anybody's brain. the only way information gets into our brain is through sensory reception. behavior has been repeatedly shown to be a manifestation of what an individual has in their mind\n \n the sentence you highlighted about altering mouse behavior is very interesting. is there any further study on that with the specifics of that experiment?",

   "So my question is, what type of evidence would you need to see in order to acknowledge the influence of genetics? Would you ever acknowledge it?\n\n to me, what would be a useful indicator that genes affect behavior is the identification of a specific gene or gene sequence, or a limited and unique pattern of genetic information, shared exclusively by individuals that exhibit a particular behavior. not only that, but there would need to be some basis to assume that such a behavior cannot be learned by anyone with the gene sequence, or unlearned by anyone with it. it would also be important to demonstrate that this behavior has been hard-wired into the individual from birth. finally, genetics should be able to correctly predict that a particular individual will manifest a particular behavior by looking at and identifying that particular genetic sequence. and such behavior should become manifest regardless of the indivdual's environment or learning aptitude\n \n why so strict? what do we know about genes as of now? lets take for instance eye color. for instance, eye color is a result of genetic inheritance. as a form of verification, the exact chromosomes and allele loci have been identified. by looking at the dna of a single cell of an individual, studying these specific chromosomes, and matching the alleles at the known loci, we can accurately determine the eye color of the individual without even seeing the person. this is the extent to which genetics dictates physical attributes, and the extent to which the relationship between genetics and physical attributes have been studied\n \n this same standard can be expected and achieved for all aspects of an individual that genes control. if general behavior is one of the aspects that genes control, then why shouldnt this standard apply?",

There are no young around, so they can't learn this behavior simply by watching. (I saw this on a nature show - I can't garauntee I'll find it if asked to provide a reference). Sea turtles are programmed upon hatching to make their way to the sea. In this case there's not even time to learn the behavior - it's just there. Where do these come from, if not genetics? \n \n \nbased on what is known about genes, and about behavior, it seems quite extraordaimary to think that genes that have been extensively shown to alter physical attributes can also alter the information in someone's brain. as far as we know, genes do not put information into anybody's brain. the only way information gets into our brain is through sensory reception. behavior has been repeatedly shown to be a manifestation of what an individual has in their mind\n\n \n Schizophrenia affects behavior in a big way, by directly affecting what an individual has in their mind, as you put it. Schizophrenia has been shown to have genetic origins, as it runs in families (I should note that no one seems to think it is caused exclusively by genetics). What other example do you need? But wait, we were talking about more general behaviors, such as temperment and disposition, not these extreme cases, you might say. Well, consider the bi-polar person. Certainly we wouldn't classify them as insane, as we might a schizophrenic, yet they experience wild fluctuations in mood, thus their outward behavior can be erratic.

His face would just turn blood red, he would never utter a word, and he would just stare at my Mom, with eyes that could reach out and kill. My mother always said when she swatted him she felt like she had just swatted a hornets nest. Once when I was 9 and he was 15, I heard a ruckus in the kitchen, I rushed in and found him holding my mother up off of the floor, her back pinned to the wall, with his right hand around her neck.....\n \n \n I may have erred in saying that he is a product of a different gene, but his behavior was not \"learned\" from his siblings, that is what I am disputing.

My wife has two grown sons from a previous marriage. My wife's mother and father both, are the most gentle creatures one could ever meet. My wife's grand mother and grandfather were gentle people, , and sister and all her neices , nephews, all gentle , loving people. My wife's one son is like her, gentle to the point of almost being semi comatose , and loves all animals.

   "greg, i understand your point. i was not rying to ridicule you for assuming that genetics was the cause of your big brother's deviance, but my point was that you cannot make any conclusive statements about the role of genes as a factor in your brother's behavior. there are quite a number of variables that influence behaviour. the internal resolution to stand up against oppression can manifest the way you described. or perhaps something your brother heard or saw caused him to lose respect for his parents. i'm not proposing that these are the actual causes, but that nothing about an aggressive and disrepectful attitude can be as yet founded in genetics, unless your brother has some sort of undetected mental defect\n \n fishpower, here's how genetics work. for everyone on the planet that has blue eyes, there is an identical and unique dna sequence on a particular locus in a particular chromosome. as long as the individual has that particular eye color, we can accurately predict exactly what we will find in that locus on that chromosome, and vice versa. this works for every physical trait and body function. genes dictate how the physical body will be, and thats how the physical body is.\n \n as we know, there is a segment of the scientific community that proposes that homosexuality is genetically based. however, not once has a comparison of genetic sequences among genes of gays been made to find a unique sequence (as has been done with eye color and other physical features that genes control). the most extensive experimentation in this regard is basically limited to the survey of family trees and looking for similarities in sexual orientation, then concluding that the family shares this gay gene. it is quite obvious that the factor environment can be a significant or even the only factor that causes gays to have gay family members, and nothing about the surveys can eliminate this factor. we end up with uncontrolled and multivariate experiments, and scientists making conclusions about one of the variables without addressing the others\n \n from what we know about genetics, the term \"genetically influenced\" is an oxymoron. genetics dictate physical attributes. there is no \"influence\" in terms of creating \"tendencies\". if you have a gene for thin lips, it is not a \"probability\" or likelihood\" that you will have thin lips, but a fact. thats the way genes operate, as far as science has shown us\n \n alan, your point echoes exactly what i have noticed about society using the \"genetically influenced behavior\" card. citing genetics as the innate cause of behaviors removes the responsibilty complete away from the person. many serial killers, thrill seekers, religious fundamentalists and business proffessionals testify that they've \"been that way all their lives\". does this give us solid grounds to conlude that these types of personality traits are also genetic? if they are, can we criticize them for acting according to their \"nature\"?",

   "1) I would appreciate not being lectured on how genetics work. I would say that both our understandings here amount to \"just enough to be dangerous.\"\nMy apologies. i'm glad that we at least have a common knowledge of this and can move on from there\n \n \n2) Genes control eye color. Genes control how many fingers you have.

As I've demonstrated previously, both latter items affect mood and behavior. So the physical affects the mental and genes have a mechanism by which to influence behavior.\n\n very true. genes do control chemical functions that can influence moods and behavior. in this regard i agree. we also have to remember though that how the individual responds to stimuli, be it internal or external, is entirely up to the individual, based on the knowledge that individual has about how to respond to such stimuli. hungry puppies run towards food and eat it without any apparent forethought. humans under the same circumstances can decide what action they will take. interestingly enough, we can train dogs to eat food only from a certain area, rather than from wherever food is found. how is this possible?\n \n3) Were you not paying attention when I mentioned (and gave you a link to) the mouse study finding that a single gene was demonstrated to affect how that organism behaves? Is this not exactly the proof that you've been demanding?\n\n thanks for the link and sorry for overlooking it before. that is an excellent example of a detectible and identifiable gene influencing the production of a chemical that controls the behavior of the mouse. without their instinctive inhibitions, the mice are relentless in their agression.\n \n like i said before, i dont rule out the possibility of genes playing a role in human behavior. its just that all the claims based on the observations made (by looking at behavioral quirks/similarities in related individuals) are not satisfactorily valid conclusions to me.\n \n4) I'm still curious as to what your take is on the mating and instinctive animal behaviors that I mentioned earlier is.\nok, lets take turtles. we know that if we displace eggs and allow the turtles to hatch on a beach different from where they were laid (which would be the beach on which their mother was laid), they would locate the beach they hatched from, not the beach their mother was hatched from. so we know that it isnt the information of the particular beach that is inhereted, but the ability to return to the beach on which they were hatched. obviously turtles have some unique geo-locational function that allows them to do this, and it is obviously a function they are born with. i never denied that functions and internal mechanisms weren't inherited, because they are\n \n as for the mating rituals, obviously what can be done is limited by physical ability of the creature. males going through mating rituals are essentially competing against other males of the same species. young males have to compete against older males, who started off doing the ritual as a young male competing against older males. i cannot say how the first courting ritual could have started, but its proliferation is obviously a result of perpetual competition.\n \n it would be interesting to see if animals born and bred in capitivity and with no competition would engage in these mating rituals. i'll have to look that up\n \n now bear in mind, i'm not saying that this is definitely the case. it could well be that these mating movements are purely hereditary. but my point is that simply observing this behavior and making any type of conclusion without a controlled experiment is simply not very scientific, imo\n \n4) Just because you don't like the philosophical ramifications for responsibility and free will that these findings indicate, that doesn't negate their validity. Myself, I'm not sure how I feel about it, but that doesn't mean I'm going to pretend like this extremely interesting field of study isn't valid.\n\n my motive for questioning the validity of the study is not because i have preconceived philosophical notions. but i made a point about it because very often people that willingly accept that homosexuality is hereditary very quickly dismiss the possibility that \"deviant\" or \"harmful\" characterstics can possibly be genetic as well. this is an obvious double-standard\n \nFun debate, eh?\n\n indeed ;)",

Humans, despite whatever impulses we might posses, have evolved enough intelligence to rise above them should we choose to. I think the issue this leaves us with is just how much effort does it take to overcome the impulses we're predisposed to? For example, a person with a genetic tendency towards addiction can still choose not to do drugs, or gamble, or whatever the case may be, but they have to work significantly harder than you or I do to make the same choices. And of course there's classic conditioning, which your dog example brings up. We're certainly capable of modifying other species' behavior as well as our own, through positive and negative reinforcement, but what is that conditioning for, if not to eliminate a behavior that's there inately? I'm reminded of the movie A Clockwork Orange here, where the hero undergoes training to suppress his violent tendencies, but it doesn't change what he is fundamentally.\n \n \nlike i said before, i dont rule out the possibility of genes playing a role in human behavior. its just that all the claims based on the observations made (by looking at behavioral quirks/similarities in related individuals) are not satisfactorily valid conclusions to me.\n\n \n True, looking at family trees alone doesn't really give us definitive evidence for a genetic root for behavior. But given that we know that schizophrenia, depression and other lesser mental illnesses are heredetary, all with psychological and behavioral manifestations, all with identifiable genetic compenents, plus evidence from family trees, plus other inate, observable behaviors in other species, then we have enough evidence to form a theory that there is in fact much that genetics has to say on the basic behavioral patterns of organisms. \n \n \ni never denied that functions and internal mechanisms weren't inherited, because they are\n\n \n We call it instinct. A biologist might call it a genetically programmed behavioral response. Your theories on the birds & turtles are interesting. Maybe they're even correct. But weighed against what we know about how information is passed from generation to generation, plus the consistency in behavior from one member of the species to the next (if the bird \"art\" for example, was a copied behavior, we would expect it to change significantly from one generation to the next as errors and changes were made, much like a game of telephone), my money is on genetics.\n \n \nnow bear in mind, i'm not saying that this is definitely the case. it could well be that these mating movements are purely hereditary. but my point is that simply observing this behavior and making any type of conclusion without a controlled experiment is simply not very scientific, imo\n\n \n Good point. I'm backing off from my more had-nosed position here, but I'm still folding it into the theory, as it only backs up what we already know.\n \n \nmy motive for questioning the validity of the study is not because i have preconceived philosophical notions. but i made a point about it because very often people that willingly accept that homosexuality is hereditary very quickly dismiss the possibility that \"deviant\" or \"harmful\" characterstics can possibly be genetic as well. this is an obvious double-standard\n\n \n Oh, all sorts of things can be passed down through DNA, beneficially and not-so. I've never said homosexuality is a good thing - it is what it is. However, I think there are actually some theories that it serves some kind of subtle societal function, because of its omnipresence in social animal populations (homosexuality has been observed in ducks, ferrets, rabbits - you name it). Interesting stuff, but just shots in the dark right now.\n \n I dunno about you, but by this point I think I've made all the points I'm capable of making on this subject...whew!",

   "thanks for sharing your views. we seem to have a lot of common opinions about behavior and genetics, and i agree with most of what you said\n \n about suppressing default behaviors (which is essentially what happens when we train dogs not to eat the food on the floor, but only in the bowl or whatever), there comes a stage in the training of the dog where the lesson is so strongly inpronted in its brain that reinforcement is no longer necessary and the dog automatically does whatit was trained to do. in fact, the trained action becomes the default behavior for the dog, since its decisions are more compelled by what it was trained to do than what comes \"naturally\" (eat the food wherever it is, as long as you're hungry). could it be that the \"nature\" of the dog has changed? could the mechanism that controls the dog's decisions about food be permanently changed, completely erasing what is \"innate\" and replacing it with what is \"conditioned\"? or do the innate decision paths still remain there and could resurface at some point?\n \n \nif the bird \"art\" for example, was a copied behavior, we would expect it to change significantly from one generation to the next as errors and changes were made, much like a game of telephone\n\n whats to say the bird \"art\" isnt changing (not significantly) but comparatively from the bird's point of view. after all, its about competitive advantage, and each bird will try to outdo the competing birds. i wouldnt expect to see \"significant\" changes between generations, but something more closely resembling natural progression of evolution\n \n the real litmus test of this theory would be to observe a bird born and bred in captivity either with no competition or competing with other birds born and bred in captivity. observing the bird's behavior during mating season, or what types of advances it would make towards females, and the response from the females, would be the best indicator as to whether these behaviors are as innate as we suspect",

IMHO, there's two reasons. The first one being that as we graduate onto solid food and begin to truly understand nourishment, the biological urge to do so dissipates and is replaced by other urges. The second factor is the curbing of the behaviour by both the parents and the peer group. In effect, the biological urge is overcome to some extent due to the learning of a new behaviour. The child is taught that sucking their thumb is wrong and dirty.\n \n IMHO, the combination of both factors leads to the outcome that adults no longer suck their thumbs. \n \n As an aside - you do see adults revert to a child like state - fetal position, thumb sucking, etc... when they face an emotional breakdown due to fear, loneliness, etc... and are seeking some form of comfort.\n \n Anyhoo, what I was really thinking about was the Canada Geese I saw on my way home enjoying the first open water on the Bow River in a couple months. They mate for life. Geese that have been separated as goslings and reintroduced to a new flock exhibit the same behaviour. That's VERY difficult to explain as a learned behaviour. I can't provide a hard link to prove that, but I remember watching it on a documentary about the guy that flies back and forth with the geese on their annual migration in his ultralight plane. \n \n My next thought jump was to humans. IMHO, monogamy is not innate to humans. I think it's a largely a learned behaviour, especially marriage. That would be an example of how our ability to reason and think allows us to overcome what for me anyway, is a strong urge to procreate with just about every attractive woman I see. I'm quite certain I didn't learn that urge.\n \n Again, I know I'm simply repeating myself, but it would seem to me that the evidence for a strong biological influence/control on behaviour is very difficult to ignore, let alone refute.\n \n Waxy",

   "i think that at one point in history monogamy was the norm rather than the exception.\n\n \n I would have to disagree with that assertion, unless you mean recent history, though I can't link to any studies as proof. I would simply point to the behaviour of other primates. IMHO, polygamy is most likely our default condition. I find it very hard to believe that \"cave men\" were monogamous.\n \n \nbut i dont think man ever lacked the urge to have sex with different partners, so in a way the tendency to be polygamist (as males, that is) was always there i guess. i am quite sure that this is because of the human urge to get pleasure, and not for procreation. but as you noted, it is quite common for men to overcome their urge to lay multiple women and stay monogamous all their lives. it may be a constant act of self-suppression, but it actually seems to be more beneficial than damaging to society as a whole (of course, benefits/detriments to society is purely subjective)\n\n \n IMHO, it goes beyond the simple aspect of pleasure. I know we've had this debate before, but IMHO, the sex act is pleasurable to re-inforce the act. The biological attraction to the opposite sex, and urge to copulate goes far beyond simple pleasure IMHO. It's simply the best way to ensure the survival of the species. The more sex is going on, the more babies there'll be - and human \"strength\" is in large part derived from numbers and community. To go out on a limb - I think the increased diversity caused by the mating of multiple partners is also beneficial to the species as a whole. In short, I tihnk you can make a pretty strong case for polygamy being beneficial to the species. That being said, I also realize that a commitment to the raising of offspring is also critical to the species survival.\n \n \ni think we agree in large part that while there are behaviors that are innate, it is our conscious (or subconscious) thought process that really has the final say concerning our behavior\n\n \n I think so. \n \n I feel that we have the power to mentally overcome our innate urges for the most part, but the urges will manifest themselves in those mental processes as well. \n \n Further to that, IMHO, we don't have the ability to erase or completely change the innate, only to modify it, or in some cases, simply curb it. \n \n The strength of the urge is also a big factor in the ability of the mind to overcome the body IMHO. Something as subjective as taste - not liking asparagus, is far easier overcome than the fear of snakes, or one's sexual orientation.\n \n Waxy",
