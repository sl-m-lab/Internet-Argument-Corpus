   "World oil market was feverish last week, for oil giant BP became target of federal grand jury, the Environmental Protection Agency and congressional investigators for letting its Alaska pipeline crumble. \n \n http://www.examiner.com/a-208847~BP_Faces_Scrutiny_for_Pipeline_Shutdown.html\n \n The Justice Department is pursuing possible criminal charges in connection with the oil spill (some 2,000,000 liters) in March on one leg of BP's feeder system in its Prudhoe Bay field. \n \n The problem is that BP itself does not bother for maintenance of its pipeline systems throughout the world, while it is up to local authorities that must take timely notice of pollution of the environment by BP when no experts are able to have any records on the physical condition of pipelines. \n \n The March oil spill is surely not the only incident of this sort in BP, however, no record is available. Of cause, BP withholds them, for it would have to shut down all its oil transit pipelines and go bankrupt. \n \n According Mica Mino Pauello, a staff member of the international ecological organization Platform, Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline owned by BP-Georgia is even a greater headache of world ecologists than that in Alaska. As explained by Pauello, Georgian and Azerbaijani sections of BTC pipeline is subject to rapid corrosion, especially in Georgia, where their condition is close to catastrophic. This could clearly bring about an enormous ecological catastrophe in Georgia. Local oil spills take place here and there along the pipeline from time to time, but Georgian authorities seem to take no notice of it. In all appearance, BP Company makes use of elastic conscience of greedy Georgian authorities and prefers to pay hush money rather than take action.",
