A lot of the problems in Wikipedia tend to not be factual inaccuracies as such, but opinion or rumour passed off as fact. This is more common in obscure areas, one recent example I came across was propagating the unsupported (but widespread) rumour that the UK student organisation Student Broad Left is a front for Socialist Action. The problem is that for more obscure areas, they are visited by someone knowledgable enough to know that it is inaccurate very rarely, and hence articles such as the one I mentioned can be written by political opponents in order to undermine the organisation.",

   "I wouldn't rate Wikipedia close to a professional job like Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n \n Here's a couple of amusing howlers on Wikipedia I read about a while ago. There's the case of Climbing Jack, an April Fool's joke article that lingered for eight months before being removed. Another example is Erdosville, Nebraska. Since the town does not exist, it should have been simple to detect and remove references to a notable but non-existent place. But the entry stayed up for over a year and a real estate agent advertised being able to sell houses near \"world famous Erdosville\". \n \n Due to the selection bias of authors and editors in Wikipedia, there is a weird ordering of priorities. For instance the entry on Britney Spears is (or was) the same length as the article on Henry VIII (13 pages). There are nearly two hundred entries for Battlestar Galactica. This includes particulars not only on each of the actors, but articles on each of the characters, technology, and even the religion portrayed in the show. \n \n I shall continue to use Wikipedia as a quick reference to other sources of information.\n \n James.",
