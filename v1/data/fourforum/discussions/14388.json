   "Did I read that correctly?\n \n How utterly simplistic, if I did.\n \n How does one manage to reduce morality to raw liberty?\n \n Liberty without responsibility?\n \n Some interesting commentary:\n \nOver the course of this century the ideals of liberty and personal responsibility have increasingly drifted apart. This means both ideals, liberty and responsibility, have become distorted. Personal responsibility cannot exist without liberty, and liberty will not persist without responsibility. Liberty without responsibility is license. Liberty-as-license has become widespread in our culture. It manifests in many ways: In desires for freedom to do anything without restraint and without cost - the cost to be borne by someone else; the demand for income as a right-someone else to produce the income; the expectation of guaranteed commercial success - someone else to pay the costs of government subsidies and protection from foreign and \"unfair\" competition.\n\n Liberty and Responsibility: Inseparable Ideals\n \n Mr. Moore goes on to say that \"liberty is not license,\" and adds, interestingly:\n \nIf social chaos and disintegration do not concern us, then we may demand freedom alone. If, however, we wish to live a productive, rewarding life in a flourishing society we will affirm that in demanding liberty we agree to take charge of ourselves. Freedom from outside control merely leaves a chaotic void if not replaced by control from within.\n\n I must say I don't find chaos and societal disintegration to be particularly attractive and there is that interesting aspect of \"libertarians\" in that they appear to want the freedom to do whatever they want, but they also want someone else to pay for the damages done.\n \n Nice work if you can get, but no thanks!\n \n I'm not footing the bill for your licentious excesses.",

   "Hate to break it to you Simone, but as usual you failed to understand the article you are quoting.\n \n The author of that article is a libertarian, so saying you agree with his views, contra libertarianism, is inane at best.\n \n I realise your attention probably wandered by the third paragraph, where the author, More, (not Moore, the obese commie), argues \n \n \"They call for government programs, for regulation, for tougher measures. Both history and economic theory clearly show that such centralized approaches have failed and will fail. \"\n \n You also clearly missed the more precise point of his piece, which is that the liberty that libertarians want is not licence. It becomes licence when you involve the state, and get it to force others to subsidise your bad decisions. \n \n Liberty means you can drink alcohol until you get liver disease. Licence means you then expect the government to pay for it.\n \n Liberty means free markets. Licence means government bailouts when you fail.\n \n Try again next year.

When people speak about freedom & liberty, some are speaking about freedom & liberty from suffering; while others see these concepts as the freedom & liberty to indulge in free enterprise. Both views are conflicting & sometimes contradictory. I think the words mean different things to different people. (I also think of George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. He took the concept of language as metaphor & powerful, powerful tool & created a work of fiction describing a negative utopia where the aim was to destroy or distort the meaning of words. The goal, aim or objective being complete & total control. The end-product would be a language pared down to basically consist of 2 words - Good - Bad. If you don't have a word, symbol, metaphor, etc. to describe an idea it does not exist for you = complete & total control.)\n \n Modern day Libertaryans often seem disconnected to present day reality, like conservatives in drag. They often seem long on baffling word band aids & short on solutions:\n \n \nThe \"Theses on Feuerbach\" are eleven short philosophical notes written by Karl Marx in 1845. They outline a critique of the ideas of Marx's fellow Young Hegelian philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. But the text is often seen as more ambitious than this, criticizing both the contemplative materialism of the Young Hegelians and all forms of philosophical idealism. \n \n The \"Theses\" identify political action as the only truth of philosophy, famously concluding: \n \n \"Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\"\n\n \n If change is desired, or more than likely necessary, action (leading toward solutions) is required. Without action, it's just playing with words. The biggest problem I can identify with this way of thinking (the mental masturb8ing with words) is that it leads the policy makers (& others) to make decisions based on IDEOLOGY & NOT on REALITY. \n \n & all THAT seems to do is to give the guns, gods & circuses crowd more disinfotainment soundbites to revolve their circular reasoning around. \n \n It's a con job. The question remains whether the American people will continue to be convinced (conned into believing) \"that the success of the financial sector should be measured not by how well it provides financial services to actual consumers and corporations, but by how effectively financial firms make money for themselves.\" \n \n Sure it sounds (& is) crazy but will they continue to pull it off?\n \n PT Barnum (of REAL circuses fame) used to say, \"There's a sucker born every minute.\" There's one born to take'em every minute too. \n \n The problems escalate because people seem to be insisting that a great big baffling word band aid on real problems will FIX them. \n \n The solutions to problems continue to elude us. In fact, the problems are perpetuated by the reliance on the same o lame o ideology.",

   "The USA was not started with a business plan (or a sketchy one at best). A country coming into existing today might begin that way?

   "These people are known as Maoists.\n\n \n \nEtymology\n The term libertarian in a metaphysical or philosophical sense was first used by late-Enlightenment free-thinkers to refer to those who believed in free will, as opposed to determinism.[12] The first recorded use was in 1789 by William Belsham in a discussion of free will and in opposition to \"necessitarian\" (or determinist) views.[13][14]\n \n The use of the word 'libertarian' to describe a set of political positions can be tracked to the French cognate, \"Libertaire\", which was coined in 1857 by French anarchist communist Joseph D\u00e9jacque who used the term to distinguish his libertarian communist approach from the mutualism advocated by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.[10][15][10][16] Hence the term \"libertaire\" has been used as a synonym for left wing anarchism or libertarian socialism since the 1890s.[17]\n \n Libertarian socialists such as Noam Chomsky or Colin Ward state that the term libertarianism is considered throughout the world a synonym for anarchism.[18][19][20] Academics as well as proponents of the latter note that free market libertarianism has been successfully propagated beyond the US since the 1970s via think tanks and political parties [21][22] to the extent that libertarianism is increasingly employed elsewhere to identify a free market pro-property stance.[23][24][25]\n \n In the 1950s in the United States many with classical liberal beliefs began to describe themselves as \"libertarian.\"[26][19][27] Academics as well as proponents of the free market perspectives note that free market libertarianism has been successfully propagated beyond the US since the 1970s via think tanks and political parties [21][22] and that libertarianism is increasingly viewed worldwide as a free market position.[24][25]\n Libertarianism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n \n \nThese people are known as Maoists.\n\n \n Actually, if people were given the choice, I think there are many who would desire freedom & liberty from suffering & tyranny.\n \n Is the great big baffling free market band aid working? A 'free?' market where costs are socialized but profits are privatized? Who benefits? & where is that 'invisible hand?' Maybe it's called invisible because it does not exist. Yet another faith based economic theory. \n \n Faith based economic theories have resulted in people clamoring for other people to:\n \n Don't rock the boat but dammitt keep on bailing!\n \n Let's face it, no one wanted the bailouts, even the people who received them. They would've rather succeeded on the uneven playing field slanted in their favor since the deregulation sprees of Reagan & his voodoo economic theory & continuing in a bipartisan effort up to the present.\n \n Those who benefit do not want you to rock the boat in their effort to keep the status quo afloat.\n \n Apparently the con job seems to be working.",

Another relic of the Bush administration.\n\n \n Nice try, but it's you and yours who want people to know what to think rather than how to think. I recall seeing a picture of then-senator Barack Obama in a 2007 textbook. In another section, there was a picture taken at a Brady Campaign rally with the caption \"young people often play a role in protesting injustice. I normally give the tests the answers the teachers want to hear, but I keep an eye out for where textbooks are left-wing biased. But you think all problems that leftists create can be blamed on Bush.\n \n Whenever you see a problem, the first (and normally, only) thought that comes to your mind is \"This is Bush's fault!\" or \"This is some business owner's fault!.\" BTW, George Bush was about as conservative as you are. I'd say the leftist bias can't be blamed on anyone but big federal government. Left-wing bias in schools was around since the 60s. Well before Bush was ever heard of in US Politics.",
