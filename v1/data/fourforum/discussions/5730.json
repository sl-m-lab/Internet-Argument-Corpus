Guns are crucial for ensuring protection from a tryannical government, and for personal protection.\n Tax- Progressive tax, the more you make, the more you pay, with a cap somewhere around 40%.\n Healthcare- Free health care an option, with private plans for those who want them.\n Education- Free education through high school, and we definately need to put more money and focus more attention on the problem.\n Death penalty- Support it\n Iraq war- Government lied in order to embroil us in a war that will probably end up creating a revolution in this country.\n Abortion- Up through the first three months\n Hunting- Personally, I find it distasteful unless you're doing it with a spear or bow and arrow (whats fair about taking out a dear from half a mile away with a sniper rifle?), but I don't want to stop people from doing it altogether. Restrictions are needed, and outright bans (punishable with death) on hunting endangered or threatened species.\n Europe- I support the EU, but I live in the US, so take this with a grain of salt. Great institution, and i thnk the idea of a united European continenet needs to be something the member countries should devote a lot of their energy working towards.\n Monarchy- As long as it is me :) I think a democratic system is a lot better.\n Imigration- Legl immigrants areall good. Illegal ones should be treated humanely, but sent back to their home countries, but after they've been told how to immigrate legaly. \n \n I don't know what that makes me.

Better yet, remove the government benefits of marriage, and let any adult declare a union w/whoever (and however many) they wish. Marriage can remain in its religious context then.\n Gun laws- Allow guns for any lucid, law-abiding citizen. Deny it from the insane and felonious.\n Tax- Reformed to a consumption/VAT system. And only increased by 2/3 majority and Pres. sig.\n Healthcare- Those that can pay for their own, pay for their own. Limit the medical insurance prices, and allow outside (foreign) competition if the prices do not come back to a reasonable level.\n Education- Paid and controlled by the states. Reformed to match the changing job situations. And required levels of learning thru HS.\n Death penalty- Allow for the slam-dunk cases of murder. And all life-sentences MEAN life - no parol.\n Iraq war- Would not it supported given today's knowledge, but will be a good thing if handled correctly now.\n Abortion- Allow in cases of rape and maternal health threats. Disallow after 6th month. Also reform the adoption system so the involved cannot be tracked - ever. All attempts to find biological parents/kids expressly forbidden\n Hunting- Absolutely allowed when the target is not endangered. And all fees go back to the protection of said wildlife.\n Europe- Should be an open-border system of commerce and interraction. AFA the rest (same laws, etc.), undecided.\n Monarchy- Should not be in control of any part of government, and should fend for themselves. \n Imigration- Allow when viable. Anyone illegally border-hopping banned from ever legally emigrating. emoticon_idea And perhaps tatooed as well :) \n \n Also, change the lobbying laws so no politician can have worked for as a lobbyist then enter government for at least 5 years before.
