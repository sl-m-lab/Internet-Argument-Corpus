I say it because the circumstances you indicate seem to say that unless it is unbearable that you would be better off to let someone else complain.

Another option, and I think this the best, is to simply have a conversation with the teacher and let them know how it makes you feel. ASK them if they would remove it. Don't tell them they have to (too confrontational for your circumstances). You might find you make an ally that way and increase understanding between you and this teacher. Teachers like kids to be interested. They also like kids that ask and not tell and kids that are polite and willing to discuss rather than demand. It could improve your circumstances. Make sure the teacher knows that you are okay with their decision whatever it is but that you wanted them to know how you feel about it. \n \n SP: you are very intelligent and articulate and I believe you can pull this off.

   "There is a time and place for everything, and when you live in America and want to enjoy the freedoms granted you by the constitution, like freedom of speech, you also have to live by the other laws set forth in that document- like the separation of church and state.\n \n How about I go into the nearest polling place on Election day, and start passing out literature and loudly telling everyone to vote for Bush?\n How about I walk into any doctor's office and start telling them all about homeopathy?If you have no problem with people using free speech whenever they please, how about I go into your church next Sunday and interrupt the homily as I read The Satanic Bible out loud?\n\n \n \n ......right. A time and place for everything. That's a bit rediculous. Obvioulsy life isn't quite like that. A time for killing, racism, nuking people... and on and on.\n Constitution. Free Speech. Free Press. Free Religion. We're not forcing religion on ANYONE, just suggesting it. If were were all gullible enough to fall for anything that we saw, we'd be in a definite pile 'o poo. \n Really, if we think this poster is a threat, think again. There are bigger fish to fry. Someone expressing their opinion without killing people and shedding blood... and we're going haywire over that?? We should be spending more time worring over what we're going to do in 10 years with our resources and public relations, not over removing some poster from a classroom, especially in a case like this. The only reason this poster is a problem is because we're MAKING it a problem.\n I know 'free country' doesn't mean 'FREE country', but we should still have some freedom.\n \n (BTW, there's a difference between free speech and sheer stupidity. If I were you, I wouldn't read the Satanic Bible during a sermon, superbuddhaman. Free speech involves - usually, expressing your opinion. I hope you don't hang on every word of the Satanic Bible... I know trying to argue logic stemming from worshipers is pointless at times, so I won't ask you why you'd do that.)",

Rulers have already found that they cannot rule us religiously because of the religious diversity, so they are out to ban religion. (also another one of my opinions. No I don't have anything to back it up, I'm just trying to get out a different perspective..)\n I picked up the Language Police this morning in a bookstore, and was appalled. It's all about censorship. That's what this whole arguement is about.\n All of a sudden everyone is finding that anything that causes questioning and controversy to be a pain, so they get rid of it completely. That's why public schools barely read classics, and if they do, they aren't the origional. \n Taking away this poster is censoring the classroom, so to speak. It causes questioning, and the education leaders and politicians would rather not have questioning in the classroom, so they take away the opportunity. Learning is all about questioning. I'd rather have someone asking questions about proof of the poster's quotes, rather than requesting to have it taken down. \n \n Creative minds are dangerous, after all. We'd better put an end to them.\n \n We're also teaching are children that if they don't like something, they can do something about it. Good OR bad. But then I guess the only way we learn is by mistakes, so my whole argument may be wrong. Maybe we should let them take all of this stuff out of our education and learn from that mistake. I'd rather not wait around for the results personaly, though.",

   "I think that with the current laws, it should be taken down. However, in my personal opinon, if the teacher isn't trying to force you to listen to their religious beliefs while they should be teaching or judging you academicly based on your opinions of religious things, I don't think having people express their religious feelings is bad for an education invironment. Instead, I think open talk about all things is important for people to grow mentally.\n \n I've been raised Jewish and have fairly agnostic views. In eigth grade, my language arts teacher was a very conservative Christian. She had an little angel on a filing cabinent, a couple posters with occasional reference to things relating to religion, holiday related decorations, and religious books sitting on her desk. She was a very nice person, open to differnet people and ideas, who many of her favorite students were non-christians, she never tried to force her views on us, although she did bring up religious-related examples for things in class (because thats what the knew). There was definitely religion, and probably we could have gotten her forced to take some stuff out of the class room, but it would have been silly because she was encouraging, not discouraging learning with an openness to ideas.\n \n Maybe we're taking the separation thing a little too far?",

There is no need to teach religion to people in school in order for them to grasp the skills and concepts neccesary for them to be productive in society. I would not mind if there was an elective class offered in schools teaching religion, then it is up to the students to decide. Other than that, religion is an individual subject, and should be handled by the parents. There are religious schools that children can attend also. And in our schools, children are not taught that there is no god, god should really not even be mentioned. Children do not need to be offered a chance to think for themselves, they can do this on their own. If you desire your children to learn of chrisitianity, teach it yourself at home. If you do take up the argument that christianity should be taught in school, then you also must support the teaching of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Wicca, etc...
