   "I know I said I wasn't sure of the importance of knowing when there is fetal \"brain waves\", but I couldn't let it go and did some digging. First you should understand that there is an EEG detectable because the brain has a huge honking amount of neurons. All neurons propagate their signal through an action potential, a coordinated fluctuation of ionic state along the surface of the cell. It is not like electricity through a copper wire, but it does have voltage. Although each individual cell has a tiny change in potential, clump a bunch together and you can detect it on the surface (comparable to the heart and an ECG.) You can detect brain activity with just a bunch of neurons, but when a brain is functioning, you get a characteristic pattern.\n \n The problem with using information that references something else is that without the original source, you never know what you have. I am unable to get electronic full text articles for anything before about 1995. I did find an article that is a systematic review of fetal pain. A systematic review is a highly rigorous review of a subject that attempts to look at all work on a subject to come to a conclusion.\n \n Lee SJ, Ralston HJP, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA. Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54.\n \n There is a section on EEGs, but first here is the abstract, so you know the essence of the paper to show you this has not been taken out of context. It also speaks to indirect evidence of consciousness in the fetus (the only kind of evidence possible, in this case, of course.) FYI: to feel any sensation you need a thalamus, and thalamo-cortical fibers carry that info to the cortex to be conscious of it.\n \n \nContext\n Proposed federal legislation would require physicians to inform women\n seeking abortions at 20 or more weeks after fertilization that the fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia administered directly to the fetus. This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion.\n Evidence Acquisition \n Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks' gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.\n Evidence Synthesis \n Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.\n Conclusions \n Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.\n\n \n Now, specifically about the fetal EEG:\n \n \nElectroencephalography. The histological presence of thalamocortical fibers is insufficient to establish capacity for pain perception. These anatomical structures must also be functional. Although no electroencephalographic \"pain pattern\" exists, electroencephalography may be one way of assessing general cortical function because electroencephalograms (EEGs) measure summated synaptic potentials from cortical neurons. However, EEG activity alone does not prove functionality, because neonates with anencephaly who lack functional neural tissue above the brainstem may still have EEG activity. Normal EEG patterns have been characterized for neonates as young as 24 weeks' postconceptional age (PCA) (ie, the gestational age plus number of weeks postpartum). Electroencephalographic activity is normally asynchronous between the hemispheres and mostly discontinuous at less than 27 weeks' PCA, becoming mostly continuous around 34 weeks' PCA. Interhemispheric synchrony increases around 29 to 30 weeks' PCA, then declines, then increases again, reaching almost complete synchrony by term. Given these baseline differences between neonatal and adult EEGs, patterns associated with impaired consciousness in adults are inapplicable to the analysis of neonatal EEGs. Some investigators contend that EEG patterns denoting wakefulness indicate when consciousness is first possible. Wakefulness is a state of arousal mediated by the brainstem and thalamus in communication with the cortex. In preterm neonates, the earliest EEG pattern representing wakefulness appears around 30 weeks' PCA. However, wakefulness alone is insufficient to establish consciousness, as unconscious patients in a persistent vegetative state may also have wakeful EEGs. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) may also provide evidence of pain processing in the somatosensory cortex, although they are not used clinically to test pain pathways. SEPs test the dorsal column tract of the spinal cord, which transmits visceral pain sensation to the somatosensory cortex via the thalamus. SEPs with distinct and constant N1 components of normal peak latency are present at 29 weeks' PCA, indicating that thalamic connections with the somatosensory cortex are functional at that time.\n\n \n Clearly, the EEG at 6 weeks is not accurate and likely did not reflect what the original source intended.",

   "I know I said I wasn't sure of the importance of knowing when there is fetal \"brain waves\", but I couldn't let it go and did some digging. First you should understand that there is an EEG detectable because the brain has a huge honking amount of neurons. All neurons propagate their signal through an action potential, a coordinated fluctuation of ionic state along the surface of the cell. It is not like electricity through a copper wire, but it does have voltage. Although each individual cell has a tiny change in potential, clump a bunch together and you can detect it on the surface (comparable to the heart and an ECG.) You can detect brain activity with just a bunch of neurons, but when a brain is functioning, you get a characteristic pattern.\n \n The problem with using information that references something else is that without the original source, you never know what you have. I am unable to get electronic full text articles for anything before about 1995. I did find an article that is a systematic review of fetal pain. A systematic review is a highly rigorous review of a subject that attempts to look at all work on a subject to come to a conclusion.\n \n Lee SJ, Ralston HJP, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA. Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54.\n \n There is a section on EEGs, but first here is the abstract, so you know the essence of the paper to show you this has not been taken out of context. It also speaks to indirect evidence of consciousness in the fetus (the only kind of evidence possible, in this case, of course.) FYI: to feel any sensation you need a thalamus, and thalamo-cortical fibers carry that info to the cortex to be conscious of it.\n \n \n \n Now, specifically about the fetal EEG:\n \n \n \n Clearly, the EEG at 6 weeks is not accurate and likely did not reflect what the original source intended.\n\n \n These items do not address personhood. Pain is irrelevant. The point being that there is a living growing baby. It can be seen in images at a very young age. It also does not justify killing anything that would grow into a functional human in society.\n \n if we go by your logic then there should be no problems with a post term abortion (currently we call that homicide) also there are no arguments posted concerning the fact that the legal system currently offers additional punishment for killing a pregnant woman and in fact charges with two murders in some states and then those states where it is \"special circumstances\" it is because of multiple murders.\n \n I am sorry folks. I do not mean to diminsh the anguish that one must suffer in making such a decision. I do not think it is taken lightly by women in general and am a firm believer in choice.

It most certainly is not the pro-choice movement. The anti-abortion group claims that some folks use abortion as their only birth control.

Also, sometimes pregnancy occurs even with being careful.\n \n I think using the word \"inconvenient\" is unfair and off the mark. I do not take the issue of abortion lightly. This is not a trifle of a decision. There is a continuum from fertilized egg to newborn. The zygote is not a person. The baby is. Somewhere along the line, personhood occurs and NOBODY knows when that is. I would hope we err on the side of caution and use abortion as early as possible. But, because of this unknown, it is a very weighty decision that a woman or a couple must make. No responsible adult would decide to have an abortion because it is an \"inconvenience\".

   "Why don't you answer that? Also, answer what we should do about adults who are severly mentally retarded?\n \n EF\n\n I think I have already answered that in previous posts. Moral Personhood is what gives human beings objective value and thus in turn gives them rights.\n \n Personhood=Mind/Soul,including but not restricted to Consiousness and Sentience.\n \n Terms:\n \n Personhood - A person is defined by philosophers as a being who is in possession of a range of psychological capacities that are regarded as both necessary and sufficient to fulfill the requirements of personhood. These are, in general, that it is capable of reasoning, that it is self-conscious, and that it has an identity that persists through time. \n \n Mind - Mind refers to the collective aspects of intellect and consciousness which are manifest in some combination of thought, perception, emotion, will, memory, and imagination. The mind is the result of the activity of the brain.\n \n Soul - The soul, according to many religious and philosophical traditions, is a self aware ethereal substance particular to a unique living being. In these traditions the soul is thought to incorporate the inner essence of each living being, and to be the true basis for sentience\n \n Consciousness - Consciousness is a quality of the mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as subjectivity, self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. \n \n Sentience - Sentience is a capacity for basic consciousness-the ability to feel or perceive, not necessarily including the faculty of self-awareness, the ability for sapience is not a necessity. The word sentient is often confused with the word sapient, which can connote knowledge, higher consciousness, or apperception\n \n Sources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n \n \n \nVI. RELEVANT TYPES OF NECESSARY BRAIN ACTIVITY \n The claim that brain activity is necessary for moral personhood, though certainly a reasonable conclusion to draw from the preceding analysis, is somewhat unclear. The fetal brain develops very gradually over time from a comparatively simple structure consisting largely of no more than an inchoate brainstem to a more complex structure that comprises a number of functionally differentiated neurological components, including the critical cortex. The occurrence of different forms of brain activity begins, as one would expect, at different stages in fetal development; after all, cortical brain activity cannot begin until there is a differentiated cortical structure. \n \n There are at least two stages that are potentially relevant with respect to the issue of when selfhood emerges: (1) the very first occurrence of brain activity in the fetus; and (2) the beginning of cortical activity. The very first electrical activity that is associated with the brain occurs in the brainstem of the fetus. Though there has been at least one report of brain activity occurring as early as seven weeks into pregnancy,22 researchers have determined that the first electroencephalogram (EEG) activity usually occurs in the brainstem at around 10 weeks of gestational age.23 \n \n Cortical activity begins much later. Empirical data indicate that conscious activity begins as a series of isolated discontinuous episodes at around 22 weeks of gestational development.24 As Burgess and Tawia describe this stage of development: \n \n Between 22 and 25 weeks of gestation the most distinctive feature of EEG activity is its discontinuous nature. At this stage of development the EEG is made up of bursts of activity of up to 20 seconds interspersed with periods of no activity for up to 8 minutes. At 24 weeks, periods of activity occupy an average of only 2% of the EEG recording time and the EEG consists of a variety of slow waves (Burgess, et al, p 20).24 \n \n These periods of EEG inactivity, which indicate, among other things, the absence of conscious mental states, diminish as the fetus develops until around 29 to 35 weeks at which time EEG activity becomes more consistently continuous, comprising over 80% of recording time. Indeed, most researchers generally locate the beginning of consciousness at this point. Thus, although discontinuous cortical activity typically commences in the fetus at around 20 weeks of gestational age, consistent cortical activity begins at approximately 29 to 35 weeks of gestational age. \n \n \n\n \n http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/31/1/48\n \n Severly mentally retarded individules Contain ALL of the above,and are (born seperate individules protected under the constitution)\n \n No maybe you can explain to me what gives mere biological life equal value to personhood?",

   "I think I have already answered that in previous posts. Moral Personhood is what gives human beings objective value and thus in turn gives them rights.\n \n Personhood=Mind/Soul,including but not restricted to Consiousness and Sentience.\n \n Terms:\n \n Personhood - A person is defined by philosophers as a being who is in possession of a range of psychological capacities that are regarded as both necessary and sufficient to fulfill the requirements of personhood. These are, in general, that it is capable of reasoning, that it is self-conscious, and that it has an identity that persists through time. \n \n Mind - Mind refers to the collective aspects of intellect and consciousness which are manifest in some combination of thought, perception, emotion, will, memory, and imagination. The mind is the result of the activity of the brain.\n \n Soul - The soul, according to many religious and philosophical traditions, is a self aware ethereal substance particular to a unique living being. In these traditions the soul is thought to incorporate the inner essence of each living being, and to be the true basis for sentience\n \n Consciousness - Consciousness is a quality of the mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as subjectivity, self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. \n \n Sentience - Sentience is a capacity for basic consciousness-the ability to feel or perceive, not necessarily including the faculty of self-awareness, the ability for sapience is not a necessity. The word sentient is often confused with the word sapient, which can connote knowledge, higher consciousness, or apperception\n \n Sources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n \n \n \n \n http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/31/1/48\n \n Severly mentally retarded individules Contain ALL of the above,and are (born seperate individules protected under the constitution)\n \n No maybe you can explain to me what gives mere biological life equal value to personhood?\n\n \n The reason I use Severly mentally retarded individuals as an example is that many of them are incapable of interacting with their environment. They do not see, hear, speak. They cannot reason (from all indications) Arguments have been made by many that they do not have a soul and no meaningful identity (I would not agree with that argument). The point being that it is a very subjective call as to when true personhood begins. \n \n Thelmoose stated this very clearly below and I agree with him. NOBODY can really tell where that fine line is. I am one who advocates to err on the side of life rather than not.\n \n Abstinence is the only 100% form of birth control. \n \n At what point do we declare that the \"potential\" person has enough value so that people are using birth control, or are abstaining, are talking with parents, teachers, friends, etc BEFORE they go having unprotected sex somewhere.\n \n My legislative bend is that we would be better off spending our money on that kind of education, teaching people about the preciousness of life, rather than supporting abortion clinics. If there is going to be an abortion, lets put it in the general medical milieu (if you will) instead of making it such a special class. Spend our tax money in better places that will prevent the problems in the first place.\n \n Thelmoose, I know I used the word \"inconvenience\" but there are a LARGE number of women who are having abortions simply because they won't use birth control of any kind. I will see if I can get the statistics on abortions of convenience verses those of health and safety.\n \n EF",

I cannot say for sure whether or not it is identified as a person until about 10 weeks or so. Then I am pretty certain. For now, in my personal beliefs, I err in favor of the life or \"potential\" life. It just seems more rational to me. After all, our society declares it a double homicide (in most states) when a pregnant woman is killed. At the very least it considers it special circumstances making the crime all the more heinous. I am also against the death penalty. It might come to your surprise that I am a conservative christian. I believe human life is sacred. I believe that Jesus died to give me the choice to choose him or not. How could I possibly violate that decision he made and force someone else into a choice.\n \n As for children under the age of majority, there are procedural safeguards already in place should there be disagreements with ones parents. However, there are also long standing legal precedents that minors cannot consent to treatment and cannot enter into contracts. Both of these occur when a minor has an abortion.\n \n I know of one case in PA where a 14 year old girl was pregnant and had chosen along with her parents to keep the child. The father's parents took her across state lines where there were no parental notification laws and refused to return her until she had an abortion. A federal parental notification law would have prevented that. As it was they kidnapped her and could be prosecuted but she was FORCED to have an abortion.
