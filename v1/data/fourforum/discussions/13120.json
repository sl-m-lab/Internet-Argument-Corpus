God is not a ruler who threatens his subjects with death and torture in order for them to do his bidding. God has Himself supplied the route out of eternal separation from Him through His sacrifice on the Cross. \n \n So your premise is a complete lie and you are attempting to deceive us by denying that this is a baiting thread. You want us to consider this question from the perspective of a human ruler, yet you place the thread in the Religion Forum. Why is that if we are discussing the character of a human ruler and how he treats his subjects? The answer? We aren't. This is just one more juvenile attempt to fallaciously condemn the God who has done all of the work to save you from your deserved fate and to restore a personal relationship with you which was lost when A&E fell from grace. For this effort you lie about Him and mischaracterize Him as you demonize Him.\n \n Archangel In your ignorance you completely pervert our place in life and our relationship with God by mischaracterizing what He is attempting to accomplish by reuniting fallen Man to Himself as it was before our fall from grace. \n \n You either fail to comprehend, or are incapable of comprehending that our fates as descendants of A&E are sealed since we inherit their fallen nature at birth. THAT FACT IS A DONE DEAL. WE ARE CONDEMNED AT BIRTH UNLESS WE DIE PRIOR TO REACHING THE AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IN OTHER WORDS, ONLY MINOR CHILDREN CAN GO TO HEAVEN WITHOUT ACCEPTING JESUS AS THEIR SAVIOR.\n \n So what you ignorantly and mistakingly interpret as a threat to respond to Him or be damned, is in fact the greatest act of love imaginable since God has created a way for us to be permanently redeemed, reconciled, reunited with Him spiritually through Christ in a way that was formerly impossible according to the OT Law. \n \n So when you say God is threatening us, you corrupt the truth since we were born separated from Him. All He has done is provided a way to repair a previously broken relationship with us as He warns us of the impending fate for those who die apart from that provision He has offered us in the person of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. To die in ones sin is the only threat which we as human beings face, and repairing that is what God has accomplished for us. Amen... emoticon_xgood",

Which of course to rational people is not the only view despite your attempts at tying. \n \n \n13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but he could not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may well be applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost state into which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives in displeasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints, that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is the misery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is all in wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe the gospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin of Israel as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerful interposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but a shadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lord would not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time, Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in good works, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will be found as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of God will wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall come to nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare, shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and from sin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.\n\n \n \nGood job on the epic failure to accurately interpret the content of the book of Hosea child.

The other link I posted says everything necessary to correct your perverted interpretation of the bible. And this one adds to it. The Case Against Abortion: Biblical Teaching\n\n \n Let's look at what else the Bible has to say:\n \n  --Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. \n \n If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life.  -- Exodus 21:22-23 \n \n \n  --The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. \n \n And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 \n \n \n  --Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. \n \n Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 \n \n \n  --God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. \n \n And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 \n \n Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14 \n \n Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16 \n \n Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16 \n \n \n  --God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents. \n \n Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14 \n \n \n  --God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives. \n \n The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ... \n \n And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28 \n \n \n  --God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women. \n \n Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. -- Genesis 38:24",
