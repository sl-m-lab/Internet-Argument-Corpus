It's like I told the principal, she should have better control over her teachers.\" \n\n \n =snip=",

Maybe the teacher in question showed such a censored version, if one exists, I don't know, but if she showed the release version, then it was inappropriate. Still, even with the sex scenes removed, there's a lot to the movie that's pretty mature emotionally, and I'm not sure it would make as much sense without them, anyway -- wouldn't it be a sort of bowdlerised version?\n \n I'm not arguing against every portrayal of gay and straight love to 8th graders -- they have just gone or are going through puberty, and need some guidance. However, I think materials more designed for a younger and more immature audience would be better than a movie intended for adult audiences. I'm not saying parents shouldn't allow their kids to watch it, either, that's up to their judgement, but a movie like that needs a lot of discussion even with adults -- many straight adults I know point-blank refuse to see it because they find the scenes and ideas uncomfortable, and they don't know how to relate to gay love. It must be even more difficult to discuss it properly with kids at that age, with all the overtones of adultery and betrayal thrown in, too.\n \n Still, on the other hand, I can't see any great damage was done, for the most part. Kids are mostly more resilient than many adults give them credit for, though there are always some delicate flowers. However, was the teacher conscientious enough about the delicate flowers?

   "\n I'm not saying the story isn't true, but I have to wonder how often kids in high school see entire 2-hour movies in class time. I don't recall any such thing! Even if the teacher is a sub. It may be possible she just showed excerpts. After all, it's not as though frivolous nuisance lawsuits haven't been used by the religious right before to intimidate people and schools. Far right organisations have a fund for this sort of thing.\n\n \n Agreed, likely the entire movie was not shown. Given her comment of what happens in this class stays in this class the impression I'm given is that the focus was on the homosexual nature of the relationship, which gives weight to what the lawsuit alleges.\n \n To be fair, there are legal defense funds for all sorts of groups, even \"left-winged\" ones.",

   "Since I first became a Christian in 1989, I've seen firsthand the devastating effects of the homosexual lifestyle on our culture. And yes it does threaten the family structure with confusion. No amount of \"education\" (indoctrination for those of you in Rio Linda) will ever change the truth. That the family structure of one man/one woman has worked well from time immemorial. Why? Because it is indeed G-d's design. If homosexuals wish to pursue their lifestyle, it is indeed their choice to do so, with all the negative consequences thereto. But to force \"acceptance\" of their lifestyle down the rest of our collective throats is just plain wrong.\n\n \n \n So with such high divorce rates and high rates of adultery within the heterosexual family structure you still have the nerve to put this structure on a pedestal. Interesting. Maybe you should redirect your attention to the much needed help your \"lifestyle\" so desperately needs in these areas than towards the many very stable gay families that exist, like Jitobear's.\n Also, by all means, please compile a list of these devastating effects you speak of that the gay lifestyle has had on our culture. It would be interesting to see.",

   "Much of this has already been stated.\n \n As to whether this is appropriate, I question whether seeing a feature length film in school is appropriate unless one is in a film class. Certainly, in some humanities class, appreciating all kinds of art, including film would be appropriate.

I think it is inappropriate for this age group mainly because it is contains themes of human relationships that are complex and nuanced that a kid just couldn't understand. I think the single brief sex scene is a very minor part of the film and is no racier than things one sees on prime time American TV. I think the film is a brilliant work of art in so many respects. The sex was such a tiny aspect of this, it always amazes me why it even gets mentioned. Far more disturbing was the discussion of what happened to the gay cowboy in the past, when he was murdered. This memory was a key point of the movie and was horrendous. \n \n As to this film causing psychological trauma to anyone, piffle.

   "Hey all, I'm back from vacation and raring to go! :) \n \n As to this topic, I have to agree with Jito and Bassman on this - it was rated R and had sex scenes in it: it was completely inappropriate for it to be shown to middle-schoolers without paretal consent. The same should be ture for any sort of movie rated R containing such things be it homosexual or heterosexual.\n \n Moving on:\n \nSince I first became a Christian in 1989, I've seen firsthand the devastating effects of the homosexual lifestyle on our culture. And yes it does threaten the family structure with confusion. No amount of \"education\" (indoctrination for those of you in Rio Linda) will ever change the truth.

If homosexuals wish to pursue their lifestyle, it is indeed their choice to do so, with all the negative consequences thereto. But to force \"acceptance\" of their lifestyle down the rest of our collective throats is just plain wrong.\n\n \n Bassman, can you really not see the complete hypocrisy in this post of yours? You speak of gays trying to \"force their lifestyle down your throat\", and yet you try to force your own \"lifestyle\" down their throats. Like Robbie, I find it ridiculous that you try to put the heterosexual \"lifestyle\" up on a pedestal what with the 50 some percent divorce rate, the thousands upon thousands of broken homes, etc. that are caused solely by the heterosexual \"lifestyle\".\n \n Also, don't you dare presume to speak for other heterosexuals on what is being \"forced down our throats\". As a heterosexual, I say :xcensored that sort of talk - I will have no part in your fear of homosexuality - I have no problem (and neither do many others) with this being \"forced down our throats.",
