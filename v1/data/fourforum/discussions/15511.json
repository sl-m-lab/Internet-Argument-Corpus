   "Norway suspect 'fundamentalist Christian'\nPolice say the Norwegian suspect in the two attacks that left at least 92 dead described himself as a fundamentalist Christian, as evidence emerged that he had flirted with the political far-right.\n \n The 32-year-old, previously unknown to police, was arrested on Friday after a bomb blast in central Oslo killed seven people and a shooting rampage at a youth camp near the capital left at least 85 dead and scores wounded.\n \n Local media have identified him as Anders Behring Breivik, whose picture on his Facebook page shows a man with longish blonde hair and piercing eyes.\n \n The posting lists his religion as \"fundamentalist Christian\" and his political opinions lean \"to the right\", police said.\n \n \"He has certain political traits that lean to the right and are anti-Muslim but it is too early to say if that was the motive for his actions,\" police commissioner Sevinung Sponheim told public television NRK on Saturday.\n \n In less than two hours on Friday the suspect allegedly carried out two attacks that appeared to target the ruling Labour Party.\n \n The first strike was a bomb attack near the offices of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and those of other ministers in the heart of Oslo's government quarter.\n \n In the second attack, about 40km from the capital, the suspect allegedly masqueraded as a police officer before opening fire on young people attending an island camp run for Labour's youth wing.\n \n The head of the populist right-wing Progress Party (FrP), Siv Jensen, said on Saturday she was sorry to learn that the suspect had been a party member between 1999 and 2006 and for several years a leader in its youth movement.\n \n \"Those who knew the suspect when he was a member of the party say that he seemed like a modest person that seldom engaged himself in the political discussions,\" she said in a statement on the party's website.\n \n He was also a member of a Swedish neo-Nazi Internet forum named Nordisk.\n \n Nordisk hosts discussions ranging from white power music to political strategies to crush democracy, according to the Stockholm-based Expo foundation that monitors far-right activity.\n \n Behring Breivik's Facebook profile says he is \"conservative\", \"Christian\", and \"single\", interested in hunting and video games such as World of Warcraft and Modern Warfare 2.\n \n On an Internet debate site Document.no in 2009, he expressed his frustrations with the Progress Party. In their desperate attempt to satisfy multicultural expectations and \"the suicidal ideals of humanism, they have thrown the baby out with the bath water\", he wrote.\n \n He also said he was the manager of an organic farm, Breivik Geofarm, which would have given him access to raw materials that could be used to make explosives.\n \n He reportedly bought six tonnes of fertiliser in May, an agriculture cooperative said.\n \n Tax records, which are open to the public in Norway, show that the suspect listed no income for 2009 and modest sums in the previous years.\n \n On his Twitter account, Behring Breivik posted only one message, dated July 17, in English adapted from a quote by British philosopher John Stuart Mill.\n \n \"One person with a belief is equal to a force of 100,000 who have only interests,\" he wrote.\nI post this not to imply that all Christians are killers (as, had the suspect been gay, a certain poster most certainly would have done--as he has repeatedly--with the clear intention of conveying the message: \"See? You see how gays are?\")\n \n I only post it as yet another example of an extreme fundamentalist mindset resulting in tragedy. Though there is no evidence yet of what motivated this man, I will not be surprised if it turns out he sincerely believed himself a \"true Christian\", acting under God's orders...just as the abortion-doctor killers and the religion-inspired killers of gays, like John Joe Thomas did.\n \n No doubt he was unbalanced, but fundamentalism seems to attract unbalanced minds (as some of the posts on this forum would seem to confirm).",

(or keyboard)\n\n \n Horse dung. Neither you or he has any clue what a Christian is or what one believes.\n \n From a review of his beliefs at Crosswalk.com:\n \n Breivik demonstrates no belief in the deity of Christ, in part because he's not really sure that there is any God at all. Although he says that those who live \"under full surrender with God the Father\" will receive his \"anointing\" for battle, he also says that belief in God is a crutch in the face of death. He writes:\n \n I'm not going to pretend I'm a very religious person as that would be a lie. I've always been very pragmatic and influenced by my secular surroundings and environment...Religion is a crutch for many weak people and many embrace religion for self serving reasons as a source for drawing mental strength...Since I am not a hypocrite, I'll say directly that this is my agenda as well. However, I have not yet felt the need to ask God for strength, yet...But I'm pretty sure I will pray to God as I'm rushing through my city, guns blazing...\n \n Breivik describes how he will be on a steroid rush in the midst of the attack, listening to his iPod (perhaps Clint Mansell's Lux Aeterna, he says), in order to ward off fear. He explains that he chooses to pray and believe in God in order to overcome the fear of death. He recommends other martyr-crusaders do the same, as religion is \"ESSENTIAL in martyrdom operations.\"\n \n So, while it was obviously wrong for some commentators to rush to the assumption that this attack in Norway was perpetrated by a Muslim, it is a dramatic mischaracterization to say that it was perpetrated by a \"Christian fundamentalist.\" He might have been a \"cultural Christian\" by some definition, and a political fundamentalist, but he was certainly no \"fundamentalist Christian.\"  It's important to be clear: by almost every definition, Anders Behring Breivik was no Christian at all.",
