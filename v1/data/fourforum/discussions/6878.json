   "Oh, come on. Associating one of the only free media organisations in the Arab world with...well, I assume it's terrorists or just plain Satan...is an act of such blinkered ignorance it defies belief.\n \n I assume that as you \"won't even attempt to open a link\" from this globally highly regarded (mostly outside the US, of course) organisation that you have no idea of what their site is like, what their views are, how they present their stories, or what kind of coverage they give at all.\n Why not have a look? Surely you are strong-minded enough to resist their propaganda?\n http://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage\n \n And check out this while you're at it: http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,922498,00.html\n \n \nThe Qatar-based channel won the award for the best circumvention of censorship at Index on Censorship's third annual Freedom of Expression Awards last night.\n The judges, including the former Channel 4 news presenter Sheena McDonald and the Daily Mail's veteran foreign reporter Ann Leslie, said: \"Al-Jazeera's apparent independence in a region where much of the media is state run has transformed it into the most popular station in the Middle East.\"\n \"Its willingness to give opposition groups a high-profile platform has left it with a reputation for credible news among Arab viewers. But that same quality has enraged Arab governments and the US - which have sought to have the station more closely controlled.\"\n\n \n In fact, if you didn't read the articles, why did you bother to reply?",
