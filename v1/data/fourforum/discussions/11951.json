   "From CNN\n \n \nOn the first Sunday after a gay marriage ban passed in California, activists rallied in defiance, including hundreds of protesters outside an Orange County megachurch whose pastor brought Barack Obama and John McCain together last summer for a \"faith forum.\"\n \n About 300 gay-rights advocates fanned out along sidewalks leading to Saddleback Church in Lake Forest to voice their anger of the church's support of Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment approved by voters Tuesday that overturns a state Supreme Court decision in May legalizing same-sex unions.\n \n Ed Todeschini, a Human Rights Campaign volunteer, accused Saddleback in particular of helping propagate what he called misinformation about the Supreme Court ruling, including that gay marriage would have to be taught to kindergartners.\n \n A message seeking comment left at the church's main office, which was closed Sunday, was not immediately returned.\n \n \"They told such obvious lies. They used their lies to deceive the public,\" Todeschini said of the church, which gained national attention in August when its pastor, Rick Warren, brought Obama and McCain together to discuss their religious faith. The two candidates embraced during an often-contentious presidential campaign.\n \n Todeschini said Sunday's rally was peaceful, with demonstrators waving placards with slogans including \"Equality for all\" and \"Shame on you.\"\n \n The amendment was passed last week with 52 percent of the vote, and backlash at churches over their support swept across California on Sunday after days of protests.\n \n In Oakland, a large protest at the city's Mormon temple led the California Highway Patrol to close two highway ramps to ensure pedestrian safety. Protest organizers said they hoped to tone down the anger that has characterized some previous demonstrations.\n \n \"Our intent is not to disturb churchgoers,\" organizer Tim DeBenedictis said in a statement. \"Our goal is to mend fences and build bridges so that all Californians can achieve marriage equality under the law.\"\n \n The pastor of the 4,000-member All Saints Church in Pasadena spoke out against Proposition 8, calling the religious community's support of it \"embarrassing.\"  Watch iReport on protests in Los Angeles >>\n \n The church announced that while it could no longer legally marry same-sex couples, it would continue blessing gay civil unions.\n \n \"It's very unfortunate and embarrassing that the (Christian religion) is in large part responsible for this act of bigotry,\" the Rev. Ed Bacon said after his sermon. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on same-sex marriage\n \n In Sacramento, a protest at the state Capitol was boisterous but peaceful as speakers led the crowd in noisy chants. Protesters waved rainbow flags, a symbol of the gay rights movement, and \"No on 8\" signs as police watched from the side.\n \n Speaking on CNN's \"Late Edition\" Sunday, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed disappointment at Proposition 8's passage.\n \n \"It is unfortunate,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"But it is not the end because I think this will go back into the courts. ... It's the same as in the 1948 case when blacks and whites were not allowed to marry. This falls into the same category.\"\n \n I'm glad to see that at least some pastors in this world have integrity and are not bigoted and want all citizens to have the same rights. It's refreshing to see that there are many churches like this (my own is similar), but I wish there were more who were not bigoted. The others give Christianity a bad name and cause people to associate Jesus and the church with intolerance and removal of equal rights.\n \n Oh, and couldn't agree more with Ahnuld.",

The fact that the minority support a position doesn't make it any less valid. A minority of churches were once against slavery. The minority of churches today have women in leadership roles. It doesn't make these churches \"fake\", and the others \"real\". It doesn't make the minority wrong. Likewise there are differing views on birth control, non-reproductive sex, masturbation and sex before marriage, divorce and re-marriage, and marrying someone of different religion. If my church's position isn't in the majority on these issues either, or on the gay issue, it doesn't make it wrong or invalid.

No dishonesty there unless you're living in a la-la land.\n \n \n EDIT: ACtually, I just started a thread in the Liar's Corner where I expect you to defend your claims and back up your accusations.\n\n \n Let me explain by reposting my response to you on the other thread just to clear the air. :)\n Sorry, I can't retract it even though you were being either your spiritually ignorant or spiritually dishonest anti-christian self, so I'll defend it until we figure this out, ok? You were either being spiritually dishonest or spiritually ignorant by claiming, and I quote you: I'm glad to see that at least some pastors in this world have integrity and are not bigoted and want all citizens to have the same rights. Your dishonesty lies in claiming that pastors who support homosexuality have (religious) integrity when what they believe and practice goes against everything their own bible says about what homosexuality stands for in Gods sight. \n \n And then to hold them up as examples in which to condemn churches/pastors which do hold to Gods word regarding this issue, that too appears very dishonest of you, unless you're claiming ignorance. Are you ignorant or dishonest SP? If you're admitting to spiritual ignorance, then I guess I will retract calling you dishonest, do I retract it? You tell me. \n \n You also said this, which not only showed a lack of spiritual integrity but was totally dishonest, or again, just ignorant. and I quote you once again: but I wish there were more who were not bigoted. The others give Christianity a bad name and cause people to associate Jesus and the church with intolerance and removal of equal rights.\n \n To call the religious Right bigoted is also dishonest or spiritually ignorant because we aren't motivated by any bigotry at all, nor do we hold any personal animosity toward homosexuals. Our position is based on honoring what God say's about this practice being unnatural and an abomination before Him, in His word, so we are unable to \"condone\" it on moral and spiritual grounds. \n \n And furthermore, Jesus said to every person He ever dealt with to \"GO AND SIN NO MORE!\" And the bible clearly defines homosexuality as a sin, so where do you get off implying that Jesus was tolerant of any sin, much less homosexuality? It is another example of dishonestly or again, your spiritual ignorance in your describing what Jesus stands for and who He is as Messiah. \n \n So in conclusion SP, for you to hold up an unchristian pastor who doesn't even follow the holy book of the God which he claims to follow, as an example of what true bible believing pastors \"should be\", That is the epitome of dishonesty, or ignorance. Which was the point I tried to make on the other thread but didn't accomplish as I was rushed at the moment. I apologize for excluding the option of claiming ignorance in my original post. \n \n But I'm glad I got this opportunity to clarify my position for you now in a more complete manner. So I wont be retracting my statement of your dishonesty. All I needed to do was clarify what I meant to say originally because your lack of spiritual integrity and your spiritual dishonesty on multiple levels remain, as I have clearly shown here. Unless you respond by admitting you wrote the premise of this thread in spiritual ignorance. In that case, you would be correct and I was wrong to mistake your ignorance for dishonesty, and I will immediately and profusely apologize for calling you dishonest. The choice is yours SP, It's one or the other. And I remain at your service. :)",
