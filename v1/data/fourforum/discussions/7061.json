We have a local junior college (no longer PC, they're now labeled community colleges) offering what could be considered vocational and transferable courses. My comment was based on the number of 'students' attending on what would be considered a part-time basis as a means to live with their parents on a free basis holding a part-time job with no intent of securing enough credits for transfer to a four-year school. Accord to our local newspaper that practice is widespread, an obvious babysitter for lazy people into their middle and upper 20s, a waste of resources.\n \n My apologies to those using community colleges with the intent of securing higher education.",
