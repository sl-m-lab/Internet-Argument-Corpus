   "Yall please pray for me. I just went to a Missions Conferance for my church and io think God wants me to be a missionary to Egypt. The only problem is I already had my life planned out. i was gonna go to college, then I was gonna go to the air force and later become a polotician. I have to follow Gods will for my life. Every time they said something about how the young folks were gonna go to the mission feild i felt this thing inside me and it made me wanna cry (sometimes I did). Pray that God will help me be strong in my commitment ok. \n \n \n P.S. If your just gonna make fun of me or put me down then don't bother posting. emoticon_rolleyes",

Do you deny that it means all the Jews, Muslims, Traditional Native American religions, Buddists, Bahai, Hindus, Agnostics, etc, etc, etc arent good enough for your perception of God? According to all I have learned the basic christian belief is this: on the \"day of the lord\" (rapture), Jesus will return to earth and take all \"his people\" to heaven (dead and alive) to be with god. those \"left behind\" (please dont get me started on that book!) will have to live in wars and famines...and in some Christian sects, there will be a chance for redemption, but only if the belief in Jesus replaces your current one.
