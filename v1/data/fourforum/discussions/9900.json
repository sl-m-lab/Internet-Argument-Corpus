Technically, the counselor was acting illegally and should be prosecuted for it.\n \n However, morally, I have mixed feelings about forcing counselors (and others who are placed in a position of trust by those using their services) to inform on their clients without the client's consent. It undermines the trust that one can put in such a counselor. I would rather have young women who are underage be able to trust a counselor and, perhaps, have the counselor be required, by law, to pass on certain information about the legality or give certain advice. I just think that these girls need to know that they can trust such counselors if they go to them. That includes having it be the client's (girl's) choice whether the counselor informs the authorities about the relationship.\n \n That being said, there may be extreme cases (as with a 40 year old using his authority to pressure a 14 year old into sex, where the 14 year old is too scared to say anything) where a counselor informing the authorities without the client's consent would be a good idea. I think there needs to be some way of defining laws or policies which could catch the outrageous cases while still allowing such young clients to be able to trust their counselors.",

   "I would say that both parties have a case here. The clinic and worker were taped without consent which does violate CA law. Also, the video has been splashed all over the net on sites like YouTube and the like, plus broadcast on some major news networks. (The O'Reilly Factor showed the video last night.) Can't really dispute the fact that the law was broken when you have seen the video. \n \n In the same respect, the actions of the planned parenthood clinic are deplorable. Instructing a girl claiming to be 15 years old to lie in order to circumvent parental notification and state notification laws is rediculous. Again, after seeing the video, there is really no denying what was said. \n \n The only question I wonder about is if the video would be admissible in a court of law due to the fact that it was illegally made.",

Ask Planned Parenthood if they would consent to \"counsel\" this 18 year-old who will pose as a 15 year-old statutory rape victim in order to see how they will handle the scenario; to see if they will obey the law?

As unfortunate as it may be, she must make some adult decisions, even if it is to continue the pregnancy.  Unless, of course, you wish to suggest that parents may choose to terminate their child's pregnancy.\n\n \n So you're actually endorsing that parents have no right to know when their 13 year old daughter is dealing with an issue like pregnancy or an STD ? This is your version of adult oversight, as in none ? And as to the bolded. If a 13 year old child is going to keep a pregnancy from her parents, what OTHER possible decision can she make other than abortion ? Deciding on adoptions gonna result in them noticing, wouldn't you say ? So your endorsement of her not having to tell her parents is paramount to endorsing non consensual childhood abortions.\n \n \nThe State did not allow or prevent her pregnancy, nor is the State requiring her to abort or continue the pregnancy. They are providing services that are considered essential to both reproductive and general health. Whether or not the girl is emotionally mature, she is physically capable and thus there is every justification to allow access to services that maintain and treat problems with her systems that she can physically use.\n\n \n Note the bolded: Then obviously you endorse and support adolescent sex. If 12,13, or 14 year olds are physically capable of having sex then to heII with their emotional maturity. Who are we as their parents to expect to have the right to intervene before they reach the legal age of accountability ? Are you for real ? Or are you really a 13 year old with spellcheck ? Cuz you can't be an adult with children. Or an adult with one ioda of common sense.\n \n \nYet parents do not own their children's bodies. They cannot require their teenage children give blood or give organs. In matters regarding as fundamental a freedom as bodily integrity, pregnancy and reproductive health parents do not and should not have ultimate authority. Your question is erroneous because it is not the State that has authority over the girl, it is the girl who has some authority over herself.\n\n \n When the State relieves the parents of financial and legal responsibility for the actions of their children, you just might have a point. But you dont because it's the responsibility of parents to be a part of such important matters in a minors life. No matter how well you try to trivialize their relationship, nothing, and I mean nothing should overrule that relationship. \n \n \nWhile it is the parent's responsibility to teach their children common sense, it is not part of the powers of parents to use an illness as punishment or as a tool to teach responsibility. It is morally abhorrent to use pregnancy as either of these things as well.\n\n \n Who said anything about using an STD or a teen pregnancy as a punishment ? Not I. If it's an abortion they decide on, the parents will finance it. If they choose to carry and adopt out the child, the parents are needed for consent. If they decide to keep the child, the parents are needed to help raise it. Your way of endorsing secrecy only allows for one outcome. ABORTION, and there in lies the agenda and why you would support such irresponsible balderdash. \n \n \nI'm saying that a 13 year old girl who contracted an STD should have access to treatment regardless of her parent's views.\n \n \n Would you point out where I said a pregnant 13 year old should be locked in the basement without medical care ? \n \n \nShe can continue her sexually promiscuous ways regardless of whether her STD is treated;\n \n \n Not if her parents learn about it and have an opportunity to intervene and help her reconsider the repercussions of her current lifestyle. I pity the type of parents you must have had in order for you to have such a low opinion of them. But all parents aren't insensitive oafs. Mine weren't and neither was I with my two daughters.\n \n But I raised them with moral values and to respect their bodies. Something you seem to be completely devoid of. \n \n \nit is the State's desire and responsibility to prevent widespread illness, not to enforce moral behavior.\n\n \n Which is precisely why children need parents to teach moral behavior and social responsibility. You see, fixing that girls one STD isn't going to stop the spread of them if she goes right back to having random sex with random boys. The cycle will just continue as before. How can you not be aware of that obvious progression ?\n \n And all due to a declining moral center that is promoted and endorsed by people like you who see no problem with bypassing parental rights and responsibilities ? Admit it, just between you and me. You're just a kid right ? No one else is here, you can tell me. Really, what are you, 13, 14 ? Well it's 10:30 so get to bed.

But you dont because it's the responsibility of parents to be a part of such important matters in a minors life. No matter how well you try to trivialize their relationship, nothing, and I mean nothing should overrule that relationship.\n [snip]\n Who said anything about using an STD or a teen pregnancy as a punishment ? Not I.\n [snip]\n Would you point out where I said a pregnant 13 year old should be locked in the basement without medical care ?\n \n\n \n What is to prevent the parents from doing so when they have ultimate authority over all aspects of their teen's life? What would prevent them from having an abortion done on their pregnant daughter? I'm endorsing that girls have a right to confidential health services, Archangel. This is like objecting to patient-doctor confidentiality (which exists even for underage children) on the grounds that parents have some \"right\" to know everything when they obviously do not. We do not live in your mythical world where parents have some absolute authority over their teen's lives.\n \n Why would the State relieve the parents of financial and legal responsibility? As I said, your question is erroneous. The State does not gain authority over the girl, the girl gains a certain amount of authority over herself. \n \n \nAnd as to the bolded. If a 13 year old child is going to keep a pregnancy from her parents, what OTHER possible decision can she make other than abortion ?Deciding on adoptions gonna result in them noticing, wouldn't you say ? So your endorsement of her not having to tell her parents is paramount to endorsing non consensual childhood abortions.\n \n\n \n Archangel, your understanding of the situation is flawed. The question is not about keeping the preganancy confidential, it is about keeping services such as STD testing or abortion confidential. If the girl wants to keep the pregnancy that is her business and she can either tell or not tell her parents on her own. As you say, it will probably be hard to keep secret but that is totally up to her, not the State.\n \n I'm sorry, nonconsensual abortions? I'm afraid I cannot see how anything I have ever said could be construed to mean that abortions should be forced upon anyone.\n \n \nNote the bolded: Then obviously you endorse and support adolescent sex. If 12,13, or 14 year olds are physically capable of having sex then to heII with their emotional maturity.\n\n \n Sigma had said:\n Whether or not the girl is emotionally mature, she is physically capable and thus there is every justification to allow access to services that maintain and treat problems with her systems that she can physically use\n \n If a 14 year old girl contracts a STD, her lack of emotional maturity will not shield her from the negative effects of that STD, nor would it shield her from the stress and danger of pregnancy or abortion. Unless you wish to suggest that treatments should not be available to her in some misguided attempt to force the \"you made your bed now lie in it\" mentality, what you have stated here makes absolutely no sense. If the girl is physically mature, there is every justification to have these services available since her emotional maturity, or lack thereof, has no effect on whether she has problems with her physical body.\n \n \nOr are you really a 13 year old with spellcheck ?Cuz you can't be an adult with children\n\n \n At least I'd have a spellchecker. Seriously: \"cuz\"?\n \n \nWhich is precisely why children need parents to teach moral behavior and social responsibility. You see, fixing that girls one STD isn't going to stop the spread of them if she goes right back to having random sex with random boys. The cycle will just continue as before. How can you not be aware of that obvious progression ?\n [snip]\n Not if her parents learn about it and have an opportunity to intervene and help her reconsider the repercussions of her current lifestyle.\n [snip]\n But all parents aren't insensitive oafs. Mine weren't and neither was I with my two daughters.\n\n \n Archangel, if the services weren't confidential, likely the girl wouldn't come in to have those services done and the State wouldn't tell the parents anyway. In terms of cost/benefit, there are more benefits with treating illness than there are costs by keeping those services confidential.\n \n If she does not get tested she will not know if she has a STD. If testing were not confidential she would not get tested. In either case she may indeed continue having random sex with random boys. You are right, parents are responsible for teaching moral behavior and social responsibility. Not the State. In this situation, it is the State's responsibility to attempt to control the spread of STDs as best they can. Keeping those services confidential allows boys and girls to come in without fearing repercussions at home. Then, at least, the problems can be treated. Whether they continue their irresponsible ways is not the responsibility of the State since enforcing moral behavior is not within the purview of the State.\n \n Luckily enough, your two daughters can get certain reproductive health services without fear of you finding out :)",

   "This may be a tangent to the main discussion here, but I would like to say that I also am disheartened to see how much sex teenagers are having nowadays. However, it is not from moral reasons about teenage sex. I don't have many qualms about teenagers having sex who can practice sex truly responsibly. Good quality sexual education (still seemingly a fiction in this country) would be able to convince most teenagers to be responsible. \n \n Of course, I, as most others, am concerned about those teenagers that have sex irresponsibly, and thus risk STDs and pregnancy. However, another main concern is that I think that teenage girls, more so than in earlier decades (except, perhaps, with many groups in the sixties), are valued by their peers (especially boys) largely on their sexuality. It seems to be an expected part of their culture now. I think that girls had more of a choice in the past whether or not to engage in sex. They could be virgins through their teenage years and still be considered cool. I don't think that is the case now - which I think is sad. I think that many girls engage in sex due to social pressures which are stronger now than in the past. I think that those advocating for abstinence have to find a way to convince their teenage audience that a girl can be a virgin and still be cool. Moralizing certainly won't work since moralizing is a very un-cool thing to do. You would need to use other tactics - such as showing hip young celebrities who are virgins.",

   " once the girl is pregnant there are two choices: continue or abort. No action on the part of the parents will shield her from the stress and dangers of the situation. No matter what decision she makes she will be faced with stress and danger. We no longer have the luxery of simply stuffing the cat back into the bag.

The only exception I can think of would be if it was impossible to get a guardians signature in a life or death situation, which a first trimester abortion definitely isn't. \n \n \nAs to access to abortion services without parentel consent thats not a life and death decision nor is the use of Plan B or similar or even birth control.\n\n \n Precisely, thanks for making my point. I marvel at how you can contradict yourself without even realizing it. You are confirming though that because none of these situations are emergencies then the permission and authority of parents over their minor children should never be bypassed.\n \n \nPoint is we no longer live in the Roman empire and parental rights are not absolutely supreme. Minors are not chattel and we no longer treat them as such.\n\n \n An absolutely ridiculous statement because nobody is claiming children are chattel. What they are is innocent and in need of responsible guidance. Something they obviously wont get with your emotional, intellectual or moral ilk. And one more thing about legal rights that completely eludes you chemist. 13 year old minor children are NOT even legally capable of agreeing to have sex which is why having even consensual sex with one is statutory rape. So given that LEGAL FACT, how can you then propose that they could agree to receiving an abortion, the Pill or the morning after Pill ?",

Most won't change their dogmatic beliefs of this subject. Religion and politics often being more easy to pursuade than this. I'm here because I'm bored and the rest of the forums were quiet on a lazy Sunday.\n \n \nIt doesn't really matter.

Nor am I worried. My implication on 'Do you know me' is that you're new to these forums. Had you been here and paid attention to many of the posts I've made in the past years, I'm more than comfortable with my lawyers beating the snot out of anyone who'd stand against me.\n There are many exceptions to the use of 'trademarks' I happen to be one who enjoys using them. \n \n \nNow, on to a substantive issue.\n You continually conflate \"fetus\" with \"child\", which is absurd on its face. It's not a child until it's born.\n\n Actually, I haven't conflated anything as we're not really talking at this juncture about the thing in the young woman but about the young woman herself. Her rights or lack tehre of. \n As for fetus and child though, they are both steps of human development.\n There are laws that punish one for terminating that unborns life except in the case of an abortion done at the choice of the woman carrying it.\n If I were to go up to a pregnant woman, a hit her in the stomach causing a miscarriage, I could face charges for terminating the pregnancy that go beyond simple assault. Same thing if I killed a pregnant woman, I could face a double homicide charge in the US.\n These laws do exist in the US.\n \n \nHowever, let's for the sake of argument follow your erroneous reasoning to its illogical conclusion.\n If abortion = murder, then it is a crime.\n\n I never said that abortion is murder\n I have pointed out that there are laws that DO punish the taking of the fetuses life in some circumstances. \n \n \nIf it is a crime, then it must have a sanction at law. One of the criteria for imposition of the death penalty in those backward states that still permit such barbarity is the heinousness of the crime.\n\n Once again you're leaping to conclusions and jumping over many small stepping stones to get there. You also show undue bias. Recall what I said above. What's the point in debating such an issue when the opposition clings to bias without demonstraited reason? My interjections in this thread is to point out what I've done.\n \nSince a fetus is a most defenseless critter, then it must follow that its \"murder\" meets the criterion of being especially heinous.\n\n I don't know where you come up with this 'defenseless'. Some of them suckers are down right evil and desire to terminate the womans life.\n \n \nConclusion: Women who abort must be subject to execution, as well as their physicians (on the hit man theory).\n\n Extreme faulty cause and effect. The woman could simply be suffering from one of many short term neurosis or psychosis...or even any number of other factors or societial pressures that impell her to believe that an abortion is the only way out of her prediciment.\n Much like you drowning in quick sand and all of a sudden, I'm there with a salted up piece of rusty razor wire as a life line to toss to you rather than that soft length of hemp rope in my other hand. \n Will you call me a life saver for tossing your the wire? How about if you're not even told about the hemp rope (that I only use for people I like).\n \n \nAre you willing to see women and their doctors executed for the abortion of a fetus?\n If not, then you're being a grade A hypocrite.\n\n Have you stopped beatting your mother? \n \n You lay out only one possible path when many others could exist. \n \n It's one of the other reasons I typically avoid such a thread. Neither side wants to honestly work towards any common ground or solution. Arch and I pointed out very clear issues where minors aren't allowed to engage in some things. Somehow, you think the magical word 'pregnant' makes a difference. When it doesn't. A pregant 16 year old still is not considered a legal adult, Can't get a tattoo, can't drink alcohol, vote, sign for an operation nor buy many medications, enter into a legally bonding contract and could be expelled for taking an aspirine at school. Their rights to free speech are even infringed upon...or, maybe they don't exist as fully as some think they do as witnessed in the Bong Hits for Jesus controversy that happened not too long ago.\n As I've said, Abortion 'rights' are one of those odd loopholes. They are at this moment being worked on by both sides with various pieces of legislation writen, passed, shot down, etc. etc. Eventually, it will be removed and we'll go back to the way it was in the 60's or it will be more clearly defined. \n \n In the news in the past week in New England, a woman has been charged with the deaths of ~4 children. From what I gather were fetuses.\n All yes, here's one link.\n \n \nOcean City, MD (AHN) - Worcester County State's Attorney Joel Todd dismissed on Thursday first- and second-degree murder and manslaughter charges against Christy Freeman in the death of her pre-term baby born last week, and instead filed new murder charges in the death of another infant born to her in 2003. It was not immediately clear why the previous charges were dropped, but in a statement to reporters Todd said that the new charges were \"more applicable.\" \n \n The new charges \"are more applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case than charges brought under the Viable Fetus Statute of 2005,\" Todd said, according to the AP reports.\n \n The 2005 law allows for the prosecution of murder or manslaughter charges in the death of a viable fetus.\n \n Initial autopsy reports revealed Freeman gave birth to a stillborn child last week.\n \n Freeman came under the suspicion of local authorities last week she showed up at an area hospital with remnants from her recent pregnancy but no baby. A search of her Ocean City home found dead bodies of three babies in addition to the one found wrapped in a bloodied blanket under her bathroom sink.\n \n \n Edit: apparently there's a clause that allows for self induced abortion...\n \n \n I find most of those who want to abolish abortion unwilling to do anything else to actually and meaningfully help in most cases that would lead a woman to consider an abortion to begin with. \n I find many who want abortion rights no matter what.\n I find many who ignore facts on both sides of the debates, more so when it doesn't suit them.\n \n Really a silly topic to deal with. \n \n But, it eats up useless hours on a lazy Sunday.\n Think I'll go read a book or something.",

   "And I thank you for your support since I sometimes work for Defense Attorneys and help put the lawbreakers back on the street where they can pay their taxes - and my fees of course! And I am also a highly committed atheist by philosophy and when doing science a strict agnostic. Keep up the good work.\n \n Lets ask the next legal question then. Was dropping the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima / Nagasaki a war crime in your opinion or not. Certainly it was the deliberate targeting of civilians. Or to use a perhaps less emotional case how about the fire-bombing of Dresden? Military targets were they?\n\n \n emoticon_xgood \n \n I'm one of the few people who've advocated for lawyers.\n The more willy, the better.\n I loves em...much. Don't like paying them...but, in a cost effectiveness situation...hey, crime does pay.\n I'm told by many that I should have been one too.\n But...I cheat too much. \n \n As to the A-bombs. Did they violate any known laws and conventions of those times?\n If so...was anyone in a position to do anything about it?\n \n But...this was a time of alleged 'total war'. Civilians were viewed as fueling the machines needed to wage war. Operating munitions factories and food processing plants vital to the war effort. That they built these things inside cities in a time when percision bombings were extremely rare and hazardous...\n Such has always been the case through out history. Civilian targets being the ones to bear the brunt of looting and rape to satisfy the under paid levy or warriors with their dandruf up.\n If we want to carry this concept over to the current era with terrorists (enemy forces) striking at whim at citizens.\n I'm perfectly willing to comply in kind.\n Actually, I'd love to nominate myself as War Lord with the finger on the button.\n I'm positive my theory of Out Terrorizing the Terrorists will work.\n *looks sheepishly* Of course, some of those I'd be 'defending' may take umbrage against this...but, I'm willing to eliminate them too. For giving comfort and assistance to the 'enemy'. :) \n \n Think of it like this.\n Do you bring a knife to a gun fight?\n Do you strap on boxing gloves to settle a grudge while your opponent is sharpening his sword?\n Me, I prefer to be there with the biggest and the mostest. Since such costs money and time, I'd seek other means to resolve differences. But, raise a fist and I'll probably empty a fire arm into you, and sue your estate and seek a crafty lawyer if I find myself unable to simply walk away from the mess.\n Escalation is simply a waste of time.\n \n The only consideration leaders have in cases of total war is to their own people an cause. If the enemy is too stubborn to know when they are out maneuvered and out fought to seek some settlement or even surrender...then who's falt is it for continuing to fight to the finish.\n \n I'm reminded of a case where police were investigating a gang shooting.\n Gang member A had his gun drawn on Gang member B. B continued to run his mouth and taunt A, daring him to shoot. He did, killing him.\n So, is this a case of A murdering B or B using A to commit suicide?\n \n In the case of legalities...\n Is it really illegal to do something when those supposed to enforce the law can't or won't? It's like when I and a hundred other as zooming down the highway 15 mph over the speed limit...only to be passed up by the fuzz. Who apparently isn't on a call.\n Seriously, who was going to prosecute the president and US commanders for killing a bunch of nips? Especially after other horrific things came to light on the other side. Rape of Nanking. The Holocaust.\n Vaporizing thousands of women and children and what ever men left to push the enemy into surrendering early and avoid further slaughter may have been considered a small price to pay.\n \n As for letting people mind their own business...oh how I wish this would apply to all things.\n I'd much rather you mind your own business as I do as I please.\n I'm sure you'd much consider the various issues as apples and oranges but, as I've been recently reminded in my own personal life...they's still all fruit.\n The unborn are part of the human life cycle. Many believe that distinctions shouldn't be made when determining when something has a right to life(barring a few mitigating circumstances). \n The pro-choicers/abortionists want to determine when such subjective concepts as personhood begins. Believing such to have an important bearing on being human. Over looking conflicts to this concept an the proven slippery slope this has caused in the past. \n \n I mean, seriously, I doubt many anglo's had much of a problem dropping bombs on uppity and barbaric heathen Nips during WWII. \n Heck, they even incarcerated them in semi-concentration camps.\n What about the Nazi's who deemed the retarded to be a burden on society and euthanized them?\n A new born isn't more of a person with 'mental existance' that the unborn child it was a few moments ago.\n Nor are the profoundly retarded who are still occasionly found even today.\n \n Seems some want to draw the line at birth. Such seems to be the case now.\n In philosophy (and sometimes this is translated into practice) can we move that line up or down?\n Some here think 3rd term abortions never happen. (Mostly non-Americans who's laws dealing with abortion have been different to Americans and they are ignorant of this). Should we place personhood at birth? End of 2nd Trimester?\n 1 year old? How about a little later?\n \n \n So, tell me why a woman should be allowed to terminate her human fetus?\n Sounds like she might be hysterical and need a simple slapping to bring her to her senses...well, that seems to always work in the 1950's movies.\n Is a born child a few hours old more valuable than it was slightly earlier while still in the womb?\n Who get's to determine this value?\n \n These discussions could easily be tied in with the philosophy thread on Are all humans created equal. Could be expanded even further.\n Are minorities less equal than those in the majority? Men vs Women? Aged vs Young. Zygots vs a Fetus. \n \n As it stands, a womans own choice in this particular matter seems to be all that counts. Such an issue doesn't exist in any other realm from what I've ascertained.\n I want to have this power of life and death myself for other cases too.\n I know for a fact that most cops are less than average in intelligence. \n They really need a whacking.\n Except the three who are my personal friends. They're pretty cool.\n Ahhh. Choice...\n \n On second thought. This doesn't sound like a good idea for me. Someone may want to choice me out of the picture too...and as much as I like to be there with the biggest and the mostest...even I can run out of ammo. And I do have to sleep.\n Which is what I should be doing now instead of rambling in a thread I don't really care that much about in a bout of insomnia...\n Maybe I should pick my book back up and take another bath...or enjoy some choice nookie with the wife. emoticon_xgood",

Obviously that's a concept you are lacking. Mass murderers and child rapist/killers willingly forfeit their rights to life according to both God and Mans Laws. To preserve them as if they deserve any justice greater than they showed their victims is one reason why our Society is in the condition it's in today. Our morality is upside down when people like you call me inconsistent for wanting to hold responsible adults accountable for violently and selfishly stealing the lives of innocent human beings, while arguing in favor of stealing the life of perfectly innocent children who have never asked for life but none the less are growing in exactly the same way each of us did in order to attain our current status. To consider them nonhuman as you sit and reason the words you're reading right now as a sentient human being is either the epitome of ignorance or hypocrisy. I'll let you define yourself though.\n \n \nBesides which, it's not a baby until it's born.\n There is no more guilt in removing a fetus than there is in removing a diseased organ.\n\n \n How you can claim they aren't people just because they haven't breathed air yet simply boggles the mind. Yet it's you left wing nutjobs who claim the high road of compassion, respect for human and civil rights and equality for all. Just think how ridiculous you sound. 2 hours before a womans water breaks she is carrying nothing more than a tumor in your opinion.

While you are living your life, do not attempt to extend your warped \"morality\" to my wife, my three daughters, or my two granddaughters.\n\n \n This is the whole issue capo, I have morality.

   "[QUOTE=Archangel;276603]Then as a chemist you also know that a fertalized egg grows into a santient human being if not brutally killed in the womb too. So why do you so adamently insist on dehumanizing it and endorsing its murder for the convenience sake of its mother ? Your stande is totally inconsistent and hypocritical from a scientific perspective given what is known today about the development of a child in the womb./QUOTE]\n \n As a chemist (and a biologist) I know well that a zygote differs so substantially from a human being that assignment to the category of person for a zygote is absurd. Its NOT as I have indicated an issue of potentiality its an issue of what IS at the time of abortion. And your stand is inconsistent and hypocritical unless and untli you admit an unfertilized egg into the same class as a zygote. After all that egg has the potential to become a human being does it not? Any woman who does not have sex at an appropriate time while releasing such an egg is guilty of homocide is she not? If not why not?\n \n \n \n \nIf you see no reasonable justification for executing a cold blooded murderer according to your sense of justice, then how can you justify killing unborn children by the millions per year when you know that if left to grow undisturbed, they will all grow into people just like you are ? And how can you hold such a view without feeling like the hypocrite that one must be to believe as you do ?\n\n \n Well for starters a murderer is a human being and a zygote is NOT.

The hell if I know, no one can be sure. But I don't think it really mattered.

It was also for this reason that the US was willing to overlook Russia's many horrible flaws as an ally.\n \n So, sorry to venture so far off topic, but I find the subject interesting.

It will either change into it's next human cycle as a fetus...or it will terminate for any number of reasons. Unlike other 'organs' which stay exactly the same.\n \n\n \n A zygote is human, a liver is human, a toenail is human. The question is whether a zygote is a person not what its genes are. And other \"organs\" change and evolve over the course of the phenotypes lifespan and often in predictable and useful ways. Consider the development of sexual capacity for example! Even the brain continues its development after birth as do the bones, heart, liver etc etc etc.\n \n \n \nSee, what you're trying to do is think that a zygote is the end all, be all of itself and seperate from human. Which is untrue. Same for Fetus. All of these are Human. Simple. Not part of a human. Not something that could become a human. But actually are HUMAN. It's a stage of Human development. NOT a stage in becoming human. It can't become something that it already is.\n\n \n Nope the zygote is of human origin but it IS NOT A HUMAN. The difference is hardly a subtle one. Your toenails are human, but they are NOT A HUMAN. And potential as I have said is not a valid argument mode here, the issue is what a zygote IS not what it might be.\n \n \nZygote, fetus, infant, child, adult are all human.\n The names listed above are merely some the descriptions of the developmental stages a human goes through.\n\n \n Yes zygotes and feti tissues are living and they are of human origins. That does not make them HUMANS however. Again the difference is not subtle. The clear difference is often overlookd by \"pro-life\" advocates of course as it gets in the way. Tissues of human origins are not accorded the same moral status as actual human beings are - nor should they be.",

There are beginning points for an independant life that does not have to continue on with the chain. Thus, you could terminate your cycle at the elderly stage in your human life. \n This is pretty elementary education stuff.\n If you terminate at one point, then ALL that happened to get you to that point happened 1st...before.

Define all you like the stages of the human reproductive cycle, you will not find anyway to reliabley jump from \"the cycle is at the zygote stage\" to the inference \"a new human being now exists\" with any bright line certainty. The line is necessarily drawn with uncertainty and subjectivity. If this were not so then we would have scientific proof that a zygote is a human being - and we do not. If anything the science indicates otherwise.\n\n This isn't about the reproductive cycle. \n It's about human development and the stages that individual human goes through.\n \n I'm curious, since you think a zygote isn't human, what is it?\n What about a fetus?\n \n I'm also curious what your nationality is.\n \n \nActually that would not be legal after the second trimester in most circumstances. But if I were to become pregnant and seek your services to abort my fetus, and you possessed the means and medical qualifications to do so, and did so at my request and with my consent, then neither of us would be in any legal pickle.\n \n On the other hand if you walked into my home and opened me up and killed my fetus without my consent etc then YOU are liable for your actions. Its a matter of consent you understand. \n\n However, in order to face a murder charge, wouldn't I have to murder a person. You seem to be saying a zygote/ fetus isn't one. Law (subjectively and occasionally) says otherwise. \n I do understand consent. But, the issues is even having the power of consent to begin with.\n \n \nAs a pregnant woman I have the decision making authority and can if I wish consent to an abortion OR I can if I wish NOT seek an abortion. In either case a coercive abortion is not tolerated by the legal system.\n\n \n Which goes to support my case to a degree.\n Causing you an unwanted abortion isn't a simple assault or other crime. It can be considered murder with recent laws.\n \n You, the mother can determine if your fetus is a person and give birth and have it protected by law. Or you can determine that it isn't and have an abortion.\n \n Thus, unlike your previous mentioned statements, there is no clear cut definition for personhood or whatever you want to say and when it actually/ technically happens. \n \n Furthermore, there's a natural leaning by the law to consider it a 'person' for legal issues.\n So, if you're pregnant, haven't made any communications to anyone on whether you wanted to keep it or not and I kill you...I could easily face a double homicide charge.\n \n Let me remind you of your comment again;\n \nYep its all well defined all right. A separate and identifiable human life starts precisely at the moment the cord is cut not one nanosecond sooner. Its well defined, its measurable, and its easily observable. Now you may not like that statement but its the absolute truth and you cannot possibly contest it!\n\n See, that isn't the truth except in your own mind and by the desires of your cohorts. Not only have I contested it but, many other humans have and so have as well as the law.\n But, maybe you want to contact Scott Peterson's lawyers and let them know your truth.\n I'm also sure others would like to know that their convictions are unjustified seeing as that identifiable human life they took never happened (well, not in the manner you describe it).\n \n See, human life begins at conception. Prior to that, it's sperm life and egg life. And, seperate is also irrelevant considering it doesn't matter what stage the life is in or what it form it takes. Life is life.\n \n \n If you want to argue that you have no value/use for the fetus and don't think you should be forced to care for it against your will, fine.\n Much more sound arguement.\n And if someone accuses you of being selfish or cold hearted...so what? They'd consider that of you no matter what.\n \n Sigh.\n \n Someone go make a comment in Religion, Politics...anything fun.\n I'm pretty bored with this.\n No insult to you Chem, but this is pretty much what the Abortion debate is all about. After a few moments of it, you should realize that unless you just want to poke fun at people, there really is no point debating.\n I just don't have much fun looking for things to poke fun at in these forums.\n Not much material to work with...if you get the pun. ;)",

What about after birth but before the embilical cord is cut, when there are still nutrients being received from the mother's body. Is it fully human then, to the degree of getting rights, or only once the embillical cord is cut? What about Siamese twins, whose bodies are dependent on each other - are they not human beings with rights? \n \n I argue instead that what makes us human beings is the fact that we have individual minds and that we are of the human species. \"I think, therefore I am\". That can start to happen around the beginning of the third trimester. Since 84% of Americans would keep abortion restricted in the third trimester, which would include most pro-choice advocates, this and similar considerations are a common concern. (Note: From the same poll, 66% would keep it legal during the first trimester - from pollingreport.com/abortion).

The effort is doomed to failure from the start. At best a society can draw a rather arbitrary line by convention and then live with the choice.\n\n We would have to agree as a society about the criteria that are important for having rights to begin with. I agree that life itself is not enough since, after all, unfertilized eggs are alive as well. Having a full set of human DNA doesn't entice me either since all of the cells in our body have that. I can understand how the start of the growth process (i.e. conception) can entice some but, to me, it is really just a step that brings a life form closer to full humanity than an unfertilized egg - the probability goes way up. That is not enough to give it rights, in my view. From my point of view, I analyze why I would not want born people killed and, mainly, it comes down to the fact that I would not want to be killed if I were in their shoes - would not want to go through the physical and mental suffering, the sense of loss and emotional turmoil, etc. Reciprocity in treatment underlies the moral systems of much of the human race. From that point of view, a very late fetus would already have fears, sense of pain, etc - just like a newborn baby. Those are some of the motivations that drive my criteria of mental existence.\n \n As for when that mental existence starts, yes it doesn't just kick start into full function but gradually develops, where that first possibility seems to happen around the beginning of the third trimester. That first possibility cannot be determined exactly (since it probably can vary from fetus to fetus by a few weeks), but neither can birth or conception - all of which take hours to finish (unless you want to call the final snip of the umbilical cord the moment of birth).

   "Ok then remove it and put in a bowl of cherrios and see how it does! I will lay odds that it will not achieve its potential as a human being. Its not an actual human, for example if you found a zygote by the side of the road you probably would not even notice it, if you found an actual human you most certainly would. And by the way your concept of the interaction between the woman and the zygote is extremely wrong, the interactions go much deeper than that and in fact they DO have elements of parasite host interactions in which the parasite mobilizes host resources for its own selfish benefit.\n\n \n Yes, in the parasitical stage, a human will die if removed from it's host.\n Considering that that's how it sustains itself during it's early incarnation as it grows.\n I'm reminded of the louse...poor lice, Remove them and they die quickly too.\n \n Much like anything though. Remove it's means to sustain itself and it dies.\n \n Even born infants will quickly die without a host to sustain them in one manner (or with modern ingenuity, the use of formula or another animals milk) or another. They certainly can't care for themselves. Disgusting parasitical creatures :p\n It's just that in this form, the parasite has detached itself from the host.\n \n As for the interaction. Of course that's what parasites do.\n Often times, they also trigger chemical reactions that could almost lead to a symbiotic relationship. I do know hormone changes are noted in the host.\n Ever note how a blood sucker releases anti-coagulants into it's host?\n \n \nNope human life never begins - its an unbroken chain for any living human. All the parts are alive, all are human right back to the first common ancestor. All the components are alive and all are of human origin. This of course does not mean that the components are human beings. Only that they are human cells and are alive.\n\n Riiiggghhttt. \n Alive and a life are not exactly the same thing as you've stated.\n \n A human is the sum of it's component parts. \n \n I won't touch that 'human being' term you keep pushing out unless it's clearly defined. Many pro-choicers/abortionists often attach connotations to it to get a different meaning.\n \n \nYes a zygote is an identifiable structure. Even so that does not make it a human being or a person. And it is parasitic on the host woman. A tapeworm is a whole also, but its not a person either.\n\n And there you go...once again.\n Tossing out relative and subjective terms like 'person'.\n Can you hold the argument without resorting to terms that require value judgments?\n I'm unconcerned with person / personhood / being / mental existence or what ever demarcation used to enact a value judgment.\n I never said anything was a person. All I maintain is that a zygote is a stage of human development (since you don't like life 'cycle').\n If you don't want to attribute these things to an inutero entity, fine. But, you're still killing something. Even if you value it no more than you do a tape worm.\n Just know that many other humans do. And laws exist to support them in some circumstances. Much like they do for you.\n Arbitrary laws to support peoples arbitrary desires.\n \n \nAnd of course human life begins at birth. There is nothing prior to that but a developing mass of tissue. See before birth there was the zygote (not a human being) and before that the fetus (not a human being). Before birth there were only tissues and structures which were not a human being. Upon birth the potential to be a human being is realized and not before.\n\n Hmmm...\n Didn't you previously say that human life has no beginning?\n Ahh yes, you did.\n \nNope human life never begins...\n\n You intentions seem to muddle personhood with human and waffle on when individual life begins or doesn't...hard to tell.\n You also know what?\n I can use your same logic and apply it to a born infant.\n Before human adulthood / maturity is reached, all that exists is a lump of cells and tissue that has the potential to become a human being\n \n Did you know that a human continues to develop until they reach maturity?\n Even this concept of person isn't formed until the late 20's when personality cements into a constant. \n Did you also know that many women would attest that their fetus possessed a personality on it's own while in the womb. Each pregnancy differing from one another.\n \n \nYour arguments are both silly and poorly structured. They readily are reduced to the absurdities that they are.\n\n Really?\n I hadn't noticed that I backed off from my stances nor waffled in commentary.\n I did alter 'life cycle' to 'development' to make it easier for you to understand what's being discussed.\n You haven't repudiated this but continuously skulk to the refuge of subjectiveness of validating why it's okay to terminate a human life at a certain stage in it's existence.\n I'd hazard a guess as to why you won't openly admit to doing this is because the bar can be raised and lowered and standards of acceptance of that human life manipulated until it may affect you personally.\n \n \nYes indeedie do, your arguments are purely objective and without any value judgements. On the other hand if you claim (by proclamation) that a zygote is a human being, then I will simply claim that only birth indicates a human being. BOTH are value judgments you realize and the biological milestones do not and cannot be used to infer human being from mere human life.\n\n And thus the proof in my points about your side.\n I never inferred 'being' (euphemism for person) as being the same as human life. \n As I've been trying to convey all along, it's (zygote / fetus) a human life. \n You are the one who imposes a milestone.\n For me, from beginning to end, zygote to deathbed...it's simply a human in one form or another. \n As I said previously, I don't 'value' it at all (in any stage) except as it relates to me directly or indirectly.\n Termination of this life at any stage is termination of a human life.\n In the philosophy forums, you'll find that I don't champion any form of beliefs in equity between various humans as equity and value are subjective.\n What you've done here, has been to attach value judgments at every opportunity to support your beliefs. \n \n \n But on the other hand there is a huge difference between a zygote and a human being.\n\n What, praytell are they?\n \n Would you care to define human being for me?\n As asked, what separates an inutero fetus from an exutero new born?\n It's parasitical nature? Additional legal protections? \n How does one become a person?\n \n \nYep all such issues revolve around value judgements just as when a human being first comes into existense does. You cannot escape the subjective nature of the question.\n\n So, in the end, all that matters is who has the most support/ power to enact their value judgments upon the masses.\n Thus, if I have more to support me in defining human being, person or personhood as not including whatever I want excluded, I is teh winna?\n \n See?\n As I initially stated, abortion debates are pointless. What I need is more jingoism, charisma, razzle dazzle and constant threats and promises to sway the masses.\n \n \nAll three however are alive\n\n Actually, skin cell is alive but isn't a life.\n A zygote, being a human, is alive and is a life much like it is in it's adult version once development has been completed or at anytime inbetween.\n \n \n Want to deal with larva and their mature forms?\n Or, do you consider them alive but not a life...per your definitions.",

Some don't.\n\n \n Well thats going to depend on what the criteria are to be a WHO isn't it? Since you have apparently never faced the issue of whether or not to carry a fetus to term, perhaps your thoughts here lack a certain perspective. Did you ever consider that? The issue is not which of two human beings (the mother or the fetus) will prevail its actually of whether or not the woman has the right to decide or not. This is determined by whether or not the zygote/fetus is a person or not. Since there is no evidence that a zygote is a person (other than metaphysical speculation based in superstion rather than solid science) then the issue is undecidable as a general rule. Such issues are best left to the choice of the woman rather than to a single universal rule or law. Its subjective either way, but with pro-choice its subjective at the individual level, with pro-life its subjective and enforced society wide. There is a huge difference.\n \n \nAs it stands, value judgements are being used to aritrarily determine which human lives and which dies.\n In abortion, we deal with the zygote and fetus stages of that human.\n\n \n Indeed it is subjective and value judgements are applied. The issue is not that value judgements are applied but rather WHOSE value judgements. Shall we allow individuals to judge for themselves or should we force all individuals to conform to a single value determined by the majority or the central authority? Freedom is preferred by most of us.\n \n \n \nIn euthanasia, we deal with other forms of that human.\n\n \n OK, but you miss a key point. The only legal euthanasia requires consent of the individual, or a decision made by someone he/she (or the courts) designates as his/her agent. There is no question of personhood involved at all. Where problems develop is where there is no clear agent designated by the patient or by the law. \n \n \nIf you have no value placed upon them (or others), of course you not care if it lives or dies. You don't see any impact upon you life. I could say you're myopic and don't see a larger picture.But, I could also simply be being reactionary.\n\n \n Too many iffs there of course. But its not my choice or yours in these cases. In pregnancy the choice clearly devolves upon the woman. In euthanasia it devolves upon (in order) the individual, the designated agent, or failing an agent the courts. {Anyone without a durable power of attorney for health decisions take note - set one up as soon as possible - its an essential tool of modern life}\n \n \nGiven humanity's past and our noted inhuman treatment of one another...I'd say the odds are on me being correct.\n\n \n Most people who are involved in these types of decisions are close family members. Frankly humans are social critters and in MOST cases we do pretty well by each other. Not always but far more often than otherwise. And bear in mind we have built various mechanisms to contain and constrain abuse of one person by another. Indeed the current pro-choice enviornment is one of those mechanisms.\n \n \nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a fund raiser for eugenics programs to attend. Must help create that great superman master race of mankind...since this one is obsolete.\n See you in the work camps.\n\n \n Nope what your approach leads to is ROMAINIA.emoticon_cry \n \n http://www.country-studies.com/romania/demographic-policy.html\n \n ========================\n The Ceausescu regime took more aggressive steps in the 1980s. By 1983 the birthrate had fallen to 14.3 per 1,000, the rate of annual increase in population had dipped to 3.7 per 1,000, and the number of abortions (421,386) again exceeded the number of live births (321,489). Ceausescu complained that only some 9 percent of the abortions performed had the necessary medical justification. In 1984 the legal age for marriage was lowered to fifteen years for women, and additional taxes were levied on childless individuals over twenty-five years of age. Monthly gynecological examinations for all women of childbearing age were instituted, even for pubescent girls, to identify pregnancies in the earliest stages and to monitor pregnant women to ensure that their pregnancies came to term. Miscarriages were to be investigated and illegal abortions prosecuted, resulting in prison terms of one year for the women concerned and up to five years for doctors and other medical personnel performing the procedure. Doctors and nurses involved in gynecology came under increasing pressure, especially after 1985, when \"demographic command units\" were set up to ensure that all women were gynecologically examined at their place of work. These units not only monitored pregnancies and ensured deliveries but also investigated childless women and couples, asked detailed questions about their sex lives and the general health of their reproductive systems, and recommended treatment for infertility.\n \n Furthermore, by 1985 a woman had to have had five children, with all five still under her care, or be more than forty-five years old to qualify for an abortion. Even when an abortion was legally justified, after 1985 a party representative had to be present to authorize and supervise the procedure. Other steps to increase material incentives to have children included raising taxes for childless individuals, increasing monthly allowances to families with children by 27 percent, and giving bonuses for the birth of the second and third child.\n \n Although government expenditures on material incentives rose by 470 percent between 1967 and 1983, the birthrate actually decreased during that time by 40 percent. After 1983, despite the extreme measures taken by the regime to combat the decline, there was only a slight increase, from 14.3 to 15.5 per 1,000 in 1984 and 16 per 1,000 in 1985. After more than two decades of draconian anti- abortion regulation and expenditures for material incentives that by 1985 equalled half the amount budgeted for defense, Romanian birthrates were only a fraction higher than those rates in countries permitting abortion on demand. \n =====================",

   "And the Romainian approach led to some side effects - like massive pediatric AIDS: Good advertisement for pro-life. \n \n \n http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/528693\n \n \n \nIn 1989, a dramatic epidemic of nosocomial HIV infection was discovered predominantly among orphans and hospitalized children in Romania. They were probably infected through transfusions of unscreened blood and injections with improperly sterilized equipment. (acute hepatitis B infection among young children in the late 1990s was also associated with receiving injections.[2]) Other underlying factors enabling the rise of this epidemic stem largely from Communist policies aimed at population expansion. Before 1989, under the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, abortions and forms of contraception were banned unless women had given birth to 5 children.[3] These policies, designed to coercively raise the birth rate, resulted in many infants being abandoned by their parents shortly after birth. Many of them were institutionalized in orphanages and hospitals by the state.[4] State-run \"institutions\" were created, but they were overcrowded and understaffed, failing to meet even the most basic needs of the children.[5]\n",
