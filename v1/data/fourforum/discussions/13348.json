   "SHAWN WILLIAMS: FIRST, ADMIT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME PROBLEM\n \n (I don't pick the titles but this one isn't too bad)\n \n Too often, African-Americans cover their ears when the talk turns to black homicide rates. Yet the statistics are beyond alarming: Blacks make up nearly half of this country's murder victims, and nine out of 10 times those deaths are the result of a black hand squeezing the trigger of a gun.\n \n Shawn Williams&#8217; Dallas Morning News Column: Black on Black Gun Violence | DALLAS SOUTH\n \n It's especially revealing when a black leader such as Jesse Jackson can admit being embarrassed when, walking at night and hearing footsteps behind him, he nervously looks back and then feels a sudden sense of relief upon seeing that the person behind him is white.\n Coastal Post Article - Black-On-Black Crime\n \n I guess Van Jones never heard of Nicholas Elliot. But I have. During my research for my book on school shootings, The Scarred Heart: Understanding and Identifying Kids Who Kill, I described Elliot's case. He was a black sixteen year old male who attended a Christian Academy. He was quite shy and taunted and teased by classmates. On December 16, 1988, Nicholas came to school with a semiautomatic pistol and two hundred rounds of ammunition and entered a classroom. He opened fire, killing one teacher and wounding another. Luckily, his gun jammed before he could accomplish a bigger mass shooting. At his trial, the psychiatrist who evaluated Nicholas testified that was a \"pressure cooker\" who was unable to express his feelings and exploded after being tortured by classmates. \n Dr. Helen: Are there really no black school shooters?\n \n The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics report offers a snapshot of racial disparities among violent crime victims. Black people represented an estimated 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2005, the latest data available, but were the victims of 49 percent of all murders and 15 percent of rapes, assaults and other nonfatal violent crimes nationwide.\n \n Most of the black murder victims - 93 percent - were killed by other black people, the study found. About 85 percent of white victims were slain by other white people.\n Feds: 49% Of Murder Victims Are Black Men - CBS News",

   "Interesting sidenote to the Elliot case:\n \n Gun Shop Held Liable\n \n * On January 16 a jury ordered Guns Unlimited, a Virginia Beach, Wa.-based gun shop, to pay $100,000 to the family of a teacher who was shot and killed by a student. The teen-ager's 40-year-old cousin had bought the gun illegally for the boy at the store.\n \n Daren Farley was a teacher at the Atlantic Shores Christian School in Virginia Beach when she was fatally short with a 9mm pistol in December 1988 during a rampage by student Nicholas Elliott. Elliott also wounded another teacher with the pistol that had been bought three months earlier at Guns Unlimited.\n \n According to Associated Press, the cousin, Curtis Lee Williams, testified he bought the $300 gun with money given him by Elliott, then 15.\n \n Williams, who served a 15-month prison term for lying on the federal paperwork involved in the sale, claimed Elliott was with him in the store, told the sales clerk which gun he wanted to get, andcarried the firearm from the store.\n \n Tony Sassengill, the sales clerk, said he could not remember Williams or Elliott. He said he knew he could not sell any handgun to a minor and would not have allowed such a transaction as described by Williams.\n \n Farley's family had sought $3 million. Randy Singer, the family's attorney, asked for a new hearing on the issue of damages.\n \n Peter Manson Jr., an attorney representing Guns Unlimited, said the case against the gun store was based entirely on the word of Williams, who was convicted of lying on the sales form, and that there was no way the clerk could have known the gun would be used to commit a crime. Manson has asked for a new trial.\n \n Anti-gun groups immediately heralded the decision. Dennis Henigan of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence told AP this was the first time a jury had held a gun shop liable for damages in such a purchase.\n The legend lives on - Colt files for bankruptcy | Shooting Industry | Find Articles at BNET",

   "Now back to the thread. Excellent post Sarge. \n \n I do take notice of how it could have started a conversation about how we could and should be talking about ways to lessen B on B crime, but instead we got some misdirection. emoticon_smile\n \n   Crime factors from the FBI website\n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \n Population density and degree of urbanization. \n Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commutingXpatterns, and transient factors. \n Modes of transportation and highway system. \n Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n Climate. \n Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n \n Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of their criminal predators. What do you say you work for changing these conditions instead.",
