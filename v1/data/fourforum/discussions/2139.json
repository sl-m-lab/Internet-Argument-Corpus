People compare atheists to hitler but for that to be a fair comparision you would have to show me a christian who would run out and kill people if you destroyed their faith.\n\n \n This is how it is. Belief in God has very little to do with acting morally. There are some people who believe in God but dont act morally. Acting morally however is not what counts. What counts is being born again. When one has asked Jesus into his/her heart to be their personal Lord and Savior, that is what counts. There are so many churches and so many people attend church. But the majority of the people attending churches today have no ideo what it is to be born again because there isnt any real understanding of the Word of God. God has created humans with free will. He created us with freedom. That is why there was the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve. Freedom is power and God gave Adam and Eve the power to ruin their lives. If their wasnt any evil they wouldnt have truly been free because they wouldnt have been able to do evil (sin). All humans have free will so they choose for themselves whether to act morally or not. But when a person becomes born again they want to act morally because they want to live their lives as if Jesus Christ Himself was walking next to them with their every move. They have to choice to sin and they have the choice not to. It is totally up to them though. I think that feeling of superiority that you mentioned is not so much what you think. In born again christians though I believe that feeling is not one of superiority but of great faith and confidence that when we die we will go to heaven and not hell. Its just feeling good. When a person is living his/her life right in the sight of both God and man there is no doubt in their mind and it is amazing how good that person will feel when they are doing so. Man cannot be saved be works alone. It is the precious blood of Christ that was shed on Calvary for us. We must be washed in that blood. We must have that advocate with the Father. That advocate is Jesus Christ because He has paid the price for the sin of all mankind and we are only saved if we have accepted that fact and the fact that we are all sinners and need to repent for the remission of sins. Ive written enough for now I suppose but if you want to learn more ask me in a reply or open up the Bible for youself and ask God to show you the way.",

That's not very fair, now is it?\n\n \n To answer the side question...I am referring to the sin that we commit becauwse we are imperfect humans, because we are all sinners.\n \n Now to answer the main question. You are right. If you dont accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior you will go to hell. But that is why Jesus came, so that we wouldnt have to go to hell. I know of a man from India. He was a Hindu and the Lord saved Him. The Lord is faithful to reveal Himself to everyone in ways that other people may not even recognize. But it is the individual soul that matters. Your eternal life is between you and the Lord only, no other man. This man from India is now a pastor of many churches in India and he trains many students in a Bible school he founded and those students graduate and go to other parts of India and start churches. What pushed this man; his name is Charles by the way, Bro. Charles, a name he adopted after reading a book about Charles Finney when he got saved; was when he tried to kill himself. He jumped off a damn but lived. The Lord revealed Himself to Charles and changed his life totally around and much fruit has come of it. Everyone has a spiritual conscience and a soulish conscience. Yes that is two consciences. The spiritual conscience will never lead you wrong because it is the Holy Spirits voice that the Lord has been good enough to plunk into everyone. By this conscience everyone, even the \"atheist\" knows that there is a God and that He created all things. All of creation proclaims the righteousness of God and that He is. \n \n Charles Singh, the man I spoke of previously has come to visit my church in Syracuse, New York for the past few years. You can learn about him and his ministry in India that my church helps to support by going to www.livingwrd.org. That is my churches website. You can also learn more about what you must do to be saved. \n \n Just remember that the Lord is faithful to show Himself to all mankind because He loves us with a love that is greater than we can even imagine. God will reward those who diligently seek Him and He is faithful to all generations.",

If you've had some experience that you want to attribute to the touch of God, then fine. But don't make the mistake of thinking that just because the choice was clear for you that it should be equally clear for everyone else.\n\n \n \n First of all I didnt say that God would \"touch\" everyone. What I said was that He is faithful to reveal Himself to everyone. That just means He will let everyone know before they die that there truly is a God who loves each and every soul.\n \n Now you tell me that I shouldnt take my experiences with those of a few friends and translate it to the whole world. But I have to point out that you did the very same thing when you said that most of the world hasnt had and experience like the one I described. And then you backed it up with what you heard from some people you talked to. You cant make a statement like that any more than I can unless you have truly spoken to most of the people in the world. So I would really appreciate it if you would make sure youre practicing what you preach before you preach it; especially if youre going to criticize someone else.\n \n Now about Gods foreknowledge of our deaths...God does know when we are going to die. But His foreknowledge is not His control. It is like God knows every choice that we will be faced with in our lives and He knows what will happen to us depending on what choice we make. So you see this does not violate our free will. There isnt any such thing as predestination in the Kindom of God because we as humans have been given free will to make what choices we will. However God doesnt control our every move just so that we will die at some predetermined date in His head because there is no such predetermined date. We arent Gods little puppets here on earth and therefore Joe does have a chance to change his mind because he has a spiritual conscience that God has put into every man. The only way God will intervene is if it is His will for Fred to live longer or for Joe to have more time to receive salvation and spend his life working for the Kingdom of God rather that in prison the rest of his life.\n \n Now for children there is an age of accountability. Three years old is obviously too young to understand much of anything of such caliber that we're talking. However I dont believe it has to do so much with age but rather the time of accountability has to do with when the child is old enough to understand the difference between right and wrong and have control over themselves to do either one. On the other hand I do know people who have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ into their hearts at as little an age as 4 yrs old. If a child has not reached that time of accountability in their life then they arent responsible for their actions until that time. God is fair in every way.\n \n If you have had an opportunity to accept Jesus then you should wait too much longer until you do because the Word of God says that to those who knew and chose not to receive the Lord will send them strong delusion and they will believe the lie.\n \n The clarity of the experience depends on Gods will for every persons life. Some may have an experience that leaves no doubt in their minds which way God is calling them in but even the least clear experience is clear enough for and intelligent human being to put a few things together and see the truth. God wont send a really unclear message to someone who has some sort of mental dissorder. He know the needs of every man and what it is going to take and He acts accordingly.",

It in fact goes against everything in the Bible. If you can provide some scripture to back up what ur saying fine but you wont find any. I think anything that anyone has to say against creationists who believe in the Bible should come up with some scriptures that undermine what they are saying if they are going to say it goes against Christianity. After all the Bible is the basic book of Christianity. And the other thing that has to be kept in mind is that modern Christianity is so watered down that modern Christian standards dont follow what the Bible says. Christian means follower of Christ but so many people use that term to describe themselves and yet live in sin. This is not true Christianity. Many churches dont even use the Bible anymore but rather turn to modern day phychologists and other garbage put into peoples minds by Satan himself to try and divide the Church. It doesnt matter what anyone says to some people, no matter how true it is, they wont see the truth because they choose to be blinded to the truth. Time will tell however who is right and who is wrong. When the truth is revealed some will see it and some will grow even more against it and they will be destroyed in the end and prophesied in the Bible. One last thing im gonna say is that the Bible came first before all of this evolution garbage and the reason for that is because Satan had not yet been able to delude peoples minds to the point he has been able to in the past couple hundred years. When you look at history, most of it has been filled with people who believed in creationism and believed in Heaven and Hell and believed there are consequences for living lives of sin. So tell me now who are the ones who look silly. All evolutionists that have ever been are still in the great minority as compared to all creationists that have ever been.",

The only way to interpret that is that it's God's will that certain people get into heaven, and it's his will that others don't, and there's nothing they can do about it. Again, your God is damning people without any chance of salvation. That's evil.\n\n \n You cant possibly know that God doesnt reveal Himself to everyone. Even those you have talked to still cant be considered everyone. And they havent all died yet either I bet. There is still time for God to reveal Himself to them. Believing in the Bible I believe that He is faithful to do so in His time. Maybe it will take some to be on their death beds to finally see it. But you cant say that seeing it and accepting it are the same thing. That is what you are talking like. Some people are just in denial because they believe there is no God. But I still maintain that everyone knows that there is a God because we are created to know with a spiritual conscience that God puts in us at our very beginning. Even the atheist knows there is a God despite how much he denies it. And you know that there is a God. \n \n I didnt explain the \"degrees of experience\" or whatever quite like I want to but I did the best I can. But the degrees arent determined by God, they are determined by the person and how willing they are to accept that there is a God and how open they are to receiving such a message. But it goes a little more like this. God has put more than enough evidence on this earth that He has created for all of mankind to understand what is really going on in this world. It can all be seen in our everyday lives and if we choose not to accept it it is us damning ourselves not God. It is His wish that we all come to the knowledge of His truth but He wont force it on us because He has created us with free will. We are the imperfect ones so it is up to us to find out and understand. God owes us nothing. He has formed us out of the dust of the ground and that is all we are and that is where our bodies return. Our spirits and souls are indestructable though and they live forever in Heaven or Hell. Your responses are just proof that Satan is at work in this world trying to deceive and damn as many people as he can before his time runs out. My advice to everyone who is really looking for the truth and not the lack thereof, to call out to the Most High and ask Him to reveal Himself to them and I guarantee He will do so according to His plan. But He wills that all should find the truth and that none should parish. We humans are nothing. We spend 1/3 of our entire lives sleeping. God doesnt sleep. He is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. He is the Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and The End. And He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. He wont reward those who mock Him and try to find every opportunity they can to try and prove He doesnt exist and who try to drag others down in their own folly which originates from Satan. Even if God didnt reveal Himself to everyone it would still be just because He has already done so much for us and He owes us nothing. It is us that owe Him. But He has done so much for us that we could never repay Him for it all. All we can do is accept that He is, that He sent His Son Jesus Christ to pay the price for our sins, and that we are all sinners and need His grace. Mocking God certainly wont get anyone any closer to God and it certainly wont make Him want to get any closer to us. Only one person forsook all that He had to come to this earth and live a life as His creation, to pay the price for His creation, and only one died for His creation and rose again and is sitting at the right hand of the Father in Heaven. That person is the God man Jesus Christ, Savior of the world. \n \n \"Let him who has ears let him hear.\" \n Let him who mocks reap what he sows.",

That is the first step toward honesty. Unfortunately, you then take the dishonest step of simply declaring the first statement as false.\n \n \n \nGod owes us nothing.\n\n And yet he gets to determine what is right and wrong and punish those who do wrong. This is the morality of a thug. I wish fundamentalists would just admit it; the god they worship is a psychotic thug. Worship of this thug isn't based on love, it is based on fear. And for the sins of a few, this god will kill and destroy an entire nation. Look at god's punishment of the Hebrews for the sins of Achan (in the book of Joshua).

   "Oh dear, umust, I really don't know where to begin.\n \n \n In other word, you recognize that there is a contradiction between the statement \"there is no evidence that god exists\", the statement \"god will punish unbelievers with eternal torment\", and the statement \"god is good and just\". That is the first step toward honesty. Unfortunately, you then take the dishonest step of simply declaring the first statement as false.\n \n \n \n And yet he gets to determine what is right and wrong and punish those who do wrong. This is the morality of a thug. I wish fundamentalists would just admit it; the god they worship is a psychotic thug. Worship of this thug isn't based on love, it is based on fear. And for the sins of a few, this god will kill and destroy an entire nation. Look at god's punishment of the Hebrews for the sins of Achan (in the book of Joshua). Look at how, to punish Achan, his entire family was killed. Look how the Hebrews, after conquering a city, killed everyone, men, women, and children. Look at the comments made by Jerry Falwell after 9/11.\n \n \n \n Again, this is a pathetic attempt to convince yourself that your contradictory beliefs must be correct. You will make no attempt to investigate the logic of your beliefs. You will close your mind to other points of view, clear logic, and obvious evidence... and then you will accuse us of being blinded by Satan.\n \n \n \n I already done that. I was a fundamentalist Christian. When I was losing my faith, I did everything I could to retain it -- including calling out to the Most High to \"help thou mine unbelief\". And he did nothing.\n \n \n \n Advice I give back to you.\n\n I actually make every attempt to investigate the logic of my beliefs. I am filled with the Holy Spirit and I pray that He reveal His word to me. I am confident in my beliefs, not pathetic, and I know that what the Bible says is true because it is the infallible Word of God and it will never fail. Just explain to me how so many prophesies in the Bible have been fulfilled, that is all prophesies of things in the past have been fulfilled and we are seeing those of the future unfolding before our eyes.\n \n You seem a bit shaken in your beliefs since it is you who has switched them 180 degrees.\n \n If you believe I said that there is no evidence that God exists you are mistaken. If it is written somewhere on here by myself it is a typo. I think that even if you were to create something and it totally rejected you as ever having anything to do with it you would want to punish it and I think you would believe that you get to decide what is right and wrong for that thing. For an example, humans havent created dogs but they train them. When they have them as pets they expect the dog to do what they say and if the dog doesnt there are consequences to pay. So that morality of a thug is bestowed upon just about every dog owner IN THE WORLD! So every dog owner that wants their dog to do what they say is a thug. This is the same concept only God has more of a right to expect us to obey Him because He created us, He didnt just train us. You also have to understand that this doesnt contradict the free will that we as humans have been given because in the culture of the days when the Bible was written people didnt have a problem with attaching some extra baggage to the word free. Man can do what he wants but if it isnt the right thing then there are going to be consequences to pay.\n \n So you were a fundamentalist Christian and you called out to God when you were losing your faith. Now you dont believe and your blaming it all on God. Sounds to me like you want to believe but you dont know how or like you lost your faith and dont know how to get it back. If your calling out to God for help and for faith you cant honestly expect Him to help you if you still want to hold on to whatever sin you have in your life. Its like the woman at the well, in the Bible, who asked the Lord for His gift of living water. He told her to go get her husband. This is because He knew by His Spirit that she was living in sin. She was shacking up with one man and had five husbands as well. She was living in fornication and had a serious problem with infidelity. \n \n Now I dont know your exact situation but it sounds to me like you called out to God but didnt really want His help all that bad or didnt stick around long enough to receive His help because to you the world was looking a lot better, the broad path with all of the goodies on it that leads to destruction was looking a lot better to you than the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life. Whatever the case might be its useless to blame it on God because anyone who knows enough sees right through Satans trick to try and convince the world that God isnt who He says He is by causing you to say things like you do. Sounds to me like you are the one who needs a bit of honesty in your life and admit that you stumbled and you fell because you know without a doubt that it was your fault you lost your faith and that the Lord will never leave you nor forsake you. I know you know scripture because you quoted some. Take the responsibility for your own actions and mistakes.",

   "I'd agree there are likely to be varying degrees of religious dedication amongst a random sample of people who consider themselves to be Christian.\n \n \n \n To an atheist, that description would be irrelevant- God does not exist, so neither does Satan. An agnostic might just be mildly patronised emoticon_xangel\n\n \n \n To them it wouldnt but matter but what they think and reality are two totally different things. 99 percent of the world believes there is a god of some sort and atheists are the ones who are correct? I dont think so. What they say is a reflection of the dark they are living in. Only the light of Jesus can reveal the truth to them. Whether they see it or not is another story.",

   "I will simply repeat my first response to this nonsense: it is a coward's way out of a set of illogical beliefs. It is a simple fact that there is no clear evidence that any sort of God exists, much less the Christian God. Conservative Christians believe that God will punish unbelief with eternal torment. This contradicts any reasonable notion of justice, so this \"spiritual conscience\" is a way to avoid facing up the the illogic of the conservative Christian beliefs.\n\n \n \n We shall all see soon the truth behind this matter.",

   "\n You say \"All cars are blue.\" I point to a red car. Therefore, you're wrong. I say \"God is faithful to reveal Himself to everyone, before they die.\" He hasn't revealed Himself to you yet. Therefore, you're wrong again.\n \n\n Last time you posted you said we were all born knowing God existed. Changed your mind again, did you? I'll grant you, changing your arguments continuously does make it hard to refute them.\n \n \n\n Yes He could have spoken to you before you closed your ears if He chose to violate our free will. If He did that with every person there wouldnt be any people in this world who havent received Jesus as their personal Lord and Master. But I know that this is not the case because the Bible says Satan will deceive many with his many false prophets. God's foreknowledge is not His control. He doesnt manipulate time to His advantage concerning us. If He did we wouldnt have any free will.\n\n So you're saying that preserving our free will is more important to God than preventing our souls from being punished for all eternity? Again, that's a twisted God you worship. Except, of course, that what you say doesn't actually make any sense. Allowing someone to make an informed decision is not violating their free will, it's encouraging it. How are you supposed to use your free will and choose the right path when God gives you no clue what the right path is. You are saying yourself that he doesn't get the message to everyone at a time in their life when they can hear it, so clearly God is perfectly willing to damn people, giving them no chance at salvation. \n \n You keep saying that you know that God is good, but your own arguments depict a God who damns people on a whim. More than anything else you sound like a parent who's just been told that his child is a killer, and despite the clear evidence just sits there saying \"But he's a good boy\" over and over again. Snap out of it and face the facts. There's no way for your theology to be correct and God to be benevolent. You've got to give up one of these conceits.",
