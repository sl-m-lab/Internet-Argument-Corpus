   "The following was recently posted in the gun control forum, and since it can concern activity of \"well meaning groups\" throughout the political spectrum, I thought it was profound enough to justify a new thread. \n \n \nSo...yea...the NRA is completely dishonest. They have wound up in the same situation as so many other well meaning groups...there is too much money in the fight for them to risk actually winning it. \n\n \n I'm not necessarily agreeing that the NRA is \"completely dishonest\", but I'd like to explore the subject of special interests with a goal, who garner support from a segment of the public that shares their passion, then deliberately doing things behind the scenes which prolong the battle to keep support coming - to keep the ball rolling. The NRA does a few other minor things besides opposing gun control (gun safety, all the interest involved with different types of guns, hunting, and all of that) but it is mainly a political organization. Without the threat of gun control, the NRA has little to do, and little money coming in. Without pollution, the EPA has nothing to do, and no money coming in. Without computer viruses, anti-virus software companies have nothing to do, and no money coming in. From that same post in the gun control forum;\n \n \nThey even pretend to be a pro gun group when, in fact, they have negotiated, and given approval, to virtually every gun control law passed in the last 30 years,\n\n \n I'd have to see a lot more evidence before I could believe a conspiracy theory of this magnitude, but it is possible. It's possible for the EPA to support pollution, or a fear of non existent pollution, to increase support for themselves. It's possible for anti virus software companies to have something to do with promoting viruses. \n \n How many other organizations could this apply to? Has it increased recently? Does it increase in proportion to a bigger and bigger government? Obviously, the public supporters of these organizations #1 priority would be the goal, with the life of the organization as a distant second. The #1 priority of those within the organization would be the life of the organization, with the goal as secondary. \n \n The bottom line is that these organizations have a clear motive for doing something against the interests of their supporters. They undoubtedly often have enough resources at their disposal to conceal it. \n \n Can, or should, anything be done about it? Or, in a free society, should people be expected to have their eyes open enough to see these things, and keep them under control? \n \n Will a discussion of this subject have the usual party line divisions, or will it be a non-partisan discussion?",

The NRA does this all right out in the open and people are too stupid to recognize it for what it is. Look at the last 2 pieces of gun legislation to hit congress. The last was the DC gun ban. Remember the outrage when DC more or less completely disregarded both the plain text meaning and spirit of Heller? The NRA did that:\n \n TheHill.com - Pro-gun House Dems reach deal with NRA\n \n \nPro-gun Democrats have reached a compromise with the National Rifle Association to avoid an election-year showdown on gun laws in the District of Columbia.\n \n The deal was negotiated with the powerful gun-rights group by Reps. John Dingell (D-Mich.), Mike Ross (D-Ark.) and John Tanner (D-Tenn.), according to two sources familiar with the negotiations. The NRA has also signed off.\n \n Details of the compromise were still incomplete late Wednesday, but a bill is to be introduced Thursday that would narrowly enforce a June Supreme Court decision rejecting the District's decades-old handgun ban.\n\n \n And the updated background checks:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/newreply.php?do=newreply&p=345975\n \n \nDemocrats, NRA Reach Deal on Background-Check Bill\n \n Senior Democrats have reached agreement with the National Rifle Association on what could be the first federal gun-control legislation since 1994, a measure to significantly strengthen the national system that checks the backgrounds of gun buyers.\n\n \n The truth is that there has not been ONE, SINGLE PIECE of gun control legislation passed in this country in 30 years that the NRA has not negotiated and eventually given approval to. While they loudly opposed the assault weapons ban in their newsletter they were negotiating the list of weapons to be banned with the democrats. When control of congress flipped to the republicans BECAUSE OF the AWB, and incoming congressmen felt they had a mandate to overturn it, and there was no question that they had a veto proof majority to overturn it, the NRA and Gingrich killed the plan to have it overturned. \n \n Gingrich and N.R.A. Will Delay Effort to Repeal Ban on Assault Weapons - The New York Times\n \n \nGingrich and N.R.A. Will Delay Effort to Repeal Ban on Assault Weapons\n \n In a deal with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the National Rifle Association has agreed to postpone its push for a repeal of the ban on assault weapons until after the House completes work on other elements of a new crime bill.\n \n\n \n They ended up postponing it forever because the AWB turned out to be GREAT for NRA business. \n \n \nHow many other organizations could this apply to? Has it increased recently? Does it increase in proportion to a bigger and bigger government? Obviously, the public supporters of these organizations #1 priority would be the goal, with the life of the organization as a distant second. The #1 priority of those within the organization would be the life of the organization, with the goal as secondary. \n\n \n This has always been an inherent problem with special interest groups. Look at the march of dimes. The march of dimes was a charity that was created with the goal of wiping out Polio. They did great things. Money from the march of dimes was used to develop a polio vaccine and deploy it. When they actually cured and wiped out polio, though, there was panic in the ranks at the march of dimes because they no longer had a reason to exist. They considered picking up another disease, but it was pointed out that if they did that, and their program worked on that disease as well, they would be right back to where they were. That being the case, instead of doing anything useful they settled on kind of a broad do gooder mentality that would not expire if somebody inconveniently cures whatever dread affliction they were working to cure.",

   "A conspiracy would imply secrecy. The NRA does this all right out in the open and people are too stupid to recognize it for what it is. \n\n \n Your post from the control thread read like this;\n \n \n.......they have negotiated, and given approval, to virtually every gun control law passed in the last 30 years, \n\n \n I thought you were indicating that you had evidence or reasonable suspicion that they were negotiating behind closed doors, without their members knowledge or consent. Possibly my fault for taking it that way. If they're doing it out in the open, that must mean that they're able to convince their members why it's in their best interests, and I've no doubt their members had lots of questions. If you don't agree with the explanation that they've given their members, it doesn't necessarily mean you're right and they're all wrong. \n \n Politics is complicated - if the NRA doesn't negotiate at all, or to a lesser extent, they could be portrayed by their political enemies as unreasonable and impossible to work with at all, and that could do the second amendment even more harm. Or by allowing certain gun control laws under certain circumstances, the NRA could possibly prove some kind of overall ineffectiveness of gun laws. All in all, I think the NRA does far more good than harm, when it comes to the interests of gun owners. \n \n I see nothing wrong with any political negotiation from this type of organization, provided their supporters are kept honestly informed. I don't fully trust the NRA to do it - I don't trust any non-profit organization that pays one or more of its administrators six figure salaries. \n \n \n \nThis has always been an inherent problem with special interest groups. Look at the march of dimes. The march of dimes was a charity that was created with the goal of wiping out Polio. They did great things.

That being the case, instead of doing anything useful they settled on kind of a broad do gooder mentality that would not expire if somebody inconveniently cures whatever dread affliction they were working to cure. \n\n \n I agree, and think this is a growing problem, in light of todays ever increasing cleverness, and dishonesty, in marketing. It's safe to say there will always be attempts to destroy the 2nd amendment without secret help from the NRA, the same as there will always be pollution and computer viruses without secret help from those in the business of preventing them. But the potential for dishonesty is there more than ever before. It should be watched for closely. It would be a good job for our news media. emoticon_rolleyes",
