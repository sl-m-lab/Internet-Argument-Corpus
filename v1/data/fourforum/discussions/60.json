   "It is perfectly legal for anyone to sell a legal owned firearm to anyone who is legally owned to have one, period. I can sell one in the newspaper, I can sell one on the street corner, and I can sell one in the parking lot of Walmart. I don't sell firearms as a primary income. I am not required to perform a background check. I am even prohibited by law from performing a background check. I have to use sound judgement when selling a firearm.\n \n All gun dealers must perform background checks at gunshows. To the law a gun dealer making a sale at a gunshow is the same as a gun dealer making a sale in a retail store.\n \n A private citizen can walk into a gunshow holding a firearm and a \"for sale\" sign and sell a firearm with no background check.\n \n The gunshow loop hole that anti-gunners are trying to close, will also nullify existing laws regard private citizens selling firearms. So when an anti-gunners says they are trying to close the loop hole, don't you believe them. They are after the private sale of firearms. Should I be posting this under \"Liberal Lie\" thread?",

If someone comes up to us and says they want an off the paper transaction, we will not do the sale. The same thing goes with such activity at our shops. We will also write a description of the person down and notify one of the police offers on duty at the show.\n \n Now, a few people I know will sell one or two of the long arms during the shows. What a majority of them will do is come to a dealer to handle the transfer to be absolutely safe.\n \n See there seems to be this idea that people will just sell anything to anyone, \"No questions asked\". This is one of the things the Gun Control people are pushing.\n \n Where it might happen, it doesn't happen all that much because if you sell a gun to someone who shouldn't have one, and they go out and kill someone with it, you will have legal action brought against you.\n \n Just look at the Columbine case. The person that bought the AB-10 pistol for the killers, even though he bought it at a gun show, he went through a dealer he still did an illegal purchase and had charges filed against him. Purchasing a gun for someone else is a felony, also known as a \"straw purchase\"",

   "Let me first make an observation and then a suggestion that I think would deal with the valid concerns about selling weapons at gun shows without back ground checks. First of all, I have been to shows and was impressed by how many types, numbers of guns, and varieties of guns these sellers had for sale in their respective booths. I also know that for the cost of renting the space for a booth at these shows, a guy with only 5 guns to sell will never pay for the space to sell them there. So the sellers at these shows are more than just private sellers, that is somewhat of a legal loophole to make that claim. They truly appeared to me to be much more than just private sellers. \n \n With that said, and considering the day and age we find ourselves in with terrorism, I would suggest 2 classes of private type sellers out there. One would be guys like me who might want to sell one or two guns every few years or whenever he does. For him, because he's unable to affectively do a background check, all that's required is that he do the necessary paperwork to make sure that the registration for the weapon he's selling is properly and legally transfered from himself to the buyer who supplied to valid forms of ID with a photo attached. \n \n As for the gun show sellers, they can only qualify to rent a booth if they have a license to collect and sell weapons, and must be hooked up to the ATF criminal check system so IDs can be checked on the spot so back ground checks can be done with no inconvenience to the seller or the buyer. If that isn't possible, then the local police station should make a phone bank available to do criminal checks as the sellers call in with a predetermined code verifying who they are. The buyers SS#, License# and DOB should be all that's needed to confirm identity which the seller will compare to the pictured ID the buyer provides.\n \n Prior to 9/11/01 I would have been staunchly against everything I'm saying here and would have argued for deregulation and no government intervention at all. But times have changed and so must our willingness to allow minimum scrutiny so as to prevent real criminals or non citizens from being allowed to purchase weapons.",
