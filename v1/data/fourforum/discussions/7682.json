   "Anyone hear about this? I can't decide whether to laugh or be appalled. I particularly find the bolded ludicrous.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/02/catholic.town.ap/index.html\n \n \nNAPLES, Florida (AP) -- If Domino's Pizza founder Thomas S. Monaghan has his way, a new town being built in Florida will be governed according to strict Roman Catholic principles, with no place to get an abortion, pornography or birth control.\n \n The pizza magnate is bankrolling the project with at least $250 million and calls it \"God's will.\"\n \n Civil libertarians say the plan is unconstitutional and are threatening to sue.\n \n The town of Ave Maria is being constructed around Ave Maria University, the first Catholic university to be built in the United States in about 40 years. Both are set to open next year about 25 miles east of Naples in southwestern Florida.\n \n The town and the university, developed in partnership with the Barron Collier Co., an agricultural and real estate business, will be set on 5,000 acres with a European-inspired town center, a massive church and what planners call the largest crucifix in the nation, at nearly 65 feet tall. Monaghan envisions 11,000 homes and 20,000 residents.\n \n During a speech last year at a Catholic men's gathering in Boston, Monaghan said that in his community, stores will not sell pornographic magazines, pharmacies will not carry condoms or birth control pills, and cable television will have no X-rated channels.\n \n Homebuyers in Ave Maria will own their property outright. But Monaghan and Barron Collier will control all commercial real estate in the town, meaning they could insert provisions in leases to restrict the sale of certain items.\n \n \"I believe all of history is just one big battle between good and evil. I don't want to be on the sidelines,\" Monaghan, who sold Domino's Pizza in 1998 to devote himself to doing good works, said in a recent Newsweek interview.\n \n Robert Falls, a spokesman for the project, said Tuesday that attorneys are still reviewing the legal issues and that Monaghan had no comment in the meantime.\n \n \"If they attempt to do what he apparently wants to do, the people of Naples and Collier County, Florida, are in for a whole series of legal and constitutional problems and a lot of litigation indefinitely into the future,\" warned Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.\n \n Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist said it will be up to the courts to decide the legalities of the plan. \"The community has the right to provide a wholesome environment,\" he said. \"If someone disagrees, they have the right to go to court and present facts before a judge.\"\n \n Gov. Jeb Bush, at the site's groundbreaking earlier this month, lauded the development as a new kind of town where faith and freedom will merge to create a community of like-minded citizens. Bush, a convert to Catholicism, did not speak specifically to the proposed restrictions.\n \n \"While the governor does not personally believe in abortion or pornography, the town, and any restrictions they may place on businesses choosing to locate there, must comply with the laws and constitution of the state and federal governments,\" Russell Schweiss, a spokesman for the governor, said Tuesday.\n \n Frances Kissling, president of the liberal Washington-based Catholics for a Free Choice, likened Monaghan's concept to Islamic fundamentalism.\n \n \"This is un-American,\" Kissling said. \"I don't think in a democratic society you can have a legally organized township that will seek to have any kind of public service whatsoever and try to restrict the constitutional rights of citizens.\"\n",

   "Pizza magnate modifies plans for Fla. town\n Copyright \u00a9 2006 AP Online \n Last updated Friday, March 3rd, 2006\n By BRIAN SKOLOFF, Associated Press Writer\n \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Domino's Pizza founder Thomas S. Monaghan, who is helping to bankroll the birth of a Florida town and university, backtracked Friday from comments that he'd like the community to be governed by strict Roman Catholic principles.\n \n His ideas about barring pornography and birth control, he said, apply only to the Catholic university.\n \n \"There are a lot of misconceptions,\" Monaghan said Friday. \n Both the town of Ave Maria and its Ave Maria University, the first Catholic university to be built in the United States in four decades, are set to open next year about 25 miles east of Naples in southwest Florida.\n \n Monaghan's comments Friday contrasted with statements he made last year to a Catholic men's group in Boston that pornographic magazines won't be sold in town, pharmacies won't carry condoms or birth control pills, and cable television will carry no X-rated channels.\n \n \"I would say I just misspoke,\" Monaghan said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press. \"The town will be open to anybody.\"\n \n Monaghan had declined to comment earlier in the week, while his attorneys were reviewing legal issues surrounding his original ideas. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida had said it would sue if the proposals were instituted. Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist said he saw nothing in Monaghan's proposals that violated state law. \n \n The town is being developed through a 50-50 partnership with the Barron Collier Co., an agricultural and real estate firm. Barron Collier and Monaghan will control all commercial real estate. \n \n The town will not allow adult bookstores or topless clubs. However, it will merely suggest, not prohibit, businesses from selling adult magazines or contraceptives.\n \n \"We are not going to censor any of that information, but in deference to Ave Maria University, we are going to request that they not sell that merchandise but we are not restricting,\" said Barron Collier chief executive Paul Marinelli. \n \"The misconception we're trying to clarify is that this is not going to be a strictly Catholic town. ... I think it would be boring if in fact it was all Catholic,\" Marinelli said. \n \n He said the town would welcome \"synagogues as well as Baptist churches.\" \n Barron Collier executive Blake Gable said homosexuals will be welcome despite the church's belief that homosexuality is a sin.\n \n Also contrary to Monaghan's earlier statements, the town will not restrict cable television programming.\n \n Marinelli said the town, expected to attract 25,000 residents, will offer affordable and extravagant housing, including seven different communities for groups from seniors to young families.\n \n \"We're just trying to create an environment where children will be safe on the streets, where they can ride their bikes and play ball in the park,\" he said. \"We're truly just trying to create a town with traditional values.\"\n \n \n http://www.tri-cityherald.com/24hour/nation/v-special/story/3216356p-11932679c.html",
