My understanding is that this is the Bush Administration's plan: Fostering tax cuts and an economic expansion that will increase overall revenue despite lower rates.\n\n \n I don't buy that. Tax cuts haven't been shown to lead to significent economic expansion. The president of one of the federal reseve banks said a week before Congressed passed the first cut that he thought that the recession was over. It's worse when the GAO comes out with a report highlighting that the tax cuts are responsible for 35% of the deficit. The very notion of a tax cut doesn't make sense. Rational expectations states that if the public knows that the tax cuts are going to temporary, they are not going to spend a significent chunk of the money, thus defeating the purpose. While Bush has made it clear he wants it permeanant, few politicans back it, and therefore rational expections creates behavior that we saw in the US and Japan when they tried to cut taxes. Supply side economics has two proven facts: it leads to high deficits and huge government.\n \n Daewoo, I'm not having kids. :)",

Taxing and spending is done for the underlying purpose of bribing voters to vote tor the candidates who promise them more goodies than the other guy.
