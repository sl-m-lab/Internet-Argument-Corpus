From a practical standpoint, I am doubtful that the house of Saud would be able to remain in power without the consent of the clerics. It seems that the Saudi clerics are loosing influence, though, and the US is having to do more to support the totalitarian Saudi government. It seems that more and more Saudis are turning to non Saudi clerics and religous icons (like OBL) for guidance. I think this partially explains the recent \"crackdowns\" on islamic militants in Saudi Arabia. For the first time, the Saudi clerics do not have enough influence to stop attacks against the Saudi government, and the US does not have enough world influence to do the same. \n \n \nI find it interesting to observe the US president preaching a return to fundamental Christian values, including a puritan era moral stance, while supporters condemn Muslim Nations for 'not being in the 21st Century' with their fundamentalist values. \n \n \n It is also interesting to note how he picks and chooses the moral vlaues he wishes to see imposed. \n \n \nMost areas of the world we've touched with our foreign policy were moderate and somewhat stable before we brought them our one size fits all mentality at the point of a gun.

I think there was actually an impact before that with WWII.\n \n \nHad the Democratic nation not been overthrown I seriously doubt a fundamentalist government would have rosen to power 26 years later.\n\n \n Our footprint on their religion has been relatively small. We certainly never took out full page ads saying, \"Ladies. Let down your hair.\" Visitors from the West make an attempt to be ever mindful of their culture.\n \n I don't think we've yet come to the bottom of their religious outpouring - all directed at the West. My instinct is that it's nothing more than a power grab by religious leaders. They saw their way to power and took it. It's the mindless blind following of a leader who's only promise is salvation. Salvation. That's a pretty tough party platform. Religious leaders can't get elected with that. Just because that leader is wearing a robe, it makes him no less a dictator. And huge numbers are happy with that.\n \n I'm a firm believer that everyone, at their core, people are totally self-serving. Find what they're getting out of it, and you've answered every question. So, what do the followers get out of it? I hate to sound like a feminist, but I have to say that that's the only answer I can come up with. It's not necessary correct. But it's the only one I can find. Given enough time, given enough educated women, the men will loose their power. That's why a woman driving a car is so threatening to them. It plants the idea.\n \n It's not our money. And it's not our manipulation. Although that stunk. Isolationism is their only way to save their way of life. It can't survive a society that sees the big picture.\n \n It's societal changes because of our presence that brought this on. Look at America's shift to the right in the last 40 years. What brought that on? The '60's. The '70's. Bra burning. VW busses with mattresses in the back. ABORTION. Parents feeling they'd lost control of the next generation. The answer. Jimmy Falwell. When there isn't a good logical method to control others, religion is always on the horizon. The only answer better than \"because I said so\" is \"because God said so.\"",

I promise that that was never the intention. Quite the opposite. Our society requires that we turn a blind eye to the fact that one group does it this way and one group does it that way. As visitors, we ignore, don't interfere with religious practices, and just go on our own way. Silence on the subject is meant to be the ultimate form of respect. I suppose that we expect the locals to ignore us, too. To falsely emulate them would feel to us as if we were insulting them.\n \n Which, I'm afraid, brings me back where I started. While very few Americans travel to the ME, many ME'ers travel here. ME'ers are born here, immigrate here, are educated here, or visit here. Certainly, those well educated leaders already know what I've just said. They know that terrorism is counter-productive. They're leading their followers, who are desperate and frustrated, down a path that only benefits the leaders. And I'll concede that the list at the top is the reason for their frustration. However, that money would be better spent on a 5th Avenue P R firm. And I don't mean that to be flip. I'm serious. If terrorism is meant to bring their cause to the uninformed public, why not a method that's goal-oriented? Bill boards are good. How about photos of a Palestinian child with his school books crossing through that gate? That's human rights. That's what we cut our teeth on. Now that's much more likely to sway public opinion - and ultimately foreign policy.\n \n GWB's reaction was and is completely predictable. Notice that I said GWB - not America. The upturn in violence in Iraq is likely to re-elect him. (Although I personally won't vote for him. I think that the concept that he's being made a fool of is just too deep for him.) Watch the polls. When asked the question who can better handle the war on terrorism, every 6:00 news pushes GWB higher. Again, doesn't appear goal-oriented. Or is it? Since I give the fundamentalists credit for properly evaluating us, I also have to assume that the leaders are achieving their desired results. Their own little power base. The US didn't create fundamentalism. Every religion has always had their share. It's a tool.\n \n If it's not an attempt to stop unwanted social change, I'm still looking for a reason why the followers follow.",

Given that hope for a better life in the ME for most people is limited due to their government and foreign governments they turn to extreme views of religions to provide hope..\n \n \n As some American general said, \"There are no athesits in fox holes\n\n \n Yes. Exactly. Fill a void. Governments don't create or close voids. At least not on a personal level. Parallel - joining a cult. It's actually social reasons. Even non-extremist religions survive, at least in part, on the social comradery. Pot luck dinners, bake sales, etc.\n \n This region is the cradle of civilization. How, after thousands of years, are these governments so weak, their hold on power so tenuous that the US, with a swipe of it's little finger, is able to topple or prop up unwanted governments. I suggest that strong governments never existed to begin with. The US can only deal with those who step up and CLAIM to be the leaders. It was always the responsibility of the people there to have a supportable, strong, undisputed leadership.\n \n Why don't they? Religious infighting? Sadly, Saddam was good at one thing. He held together 3 groups that hated each other. His method did work.\n \n I saw a news piece last year. Can't remember where, but it was in in-depth type of thing. It focused on the Palestinians. It said that the Palestinians are still displaced after all this time because they're not welcome any where else. The neighboring countries won't let these refugees in. If that's true, the entire region is willing to take up their cause - but not let them live in their own country?\n \n And the ME is a relatively small plot of land to have so many countries, factions, etc. It's the equivalent of North Dakota hating South Dakota - Texas hating New Mexico. They keep comparing Iraq to the size of California. Just in Iraq there are Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. Let's face it. They can't even agree to vote on a leadership because they're too busy counting the noses in each group and planning who would win or lose.",

   "Was Islamic fundamentalism a big issue in 1950, how about 1900? I don't remember in reading about strong Islamic fundamentalism during those periods. I don't remember reading about Fundamentalist states being in power. Which is why I was talking about modern Fundamentalist Islam.\n\n A brief response...\n For Muslim attempts at genocide\n See:\n http://www.fr-d-serfes.org/orthodox/memoryof.htm\n and\n http://debate.org.uk/topics/history/xstnc-6.html\n \n More detailed...\n Have you forgotten the genocide of the Christian Armenians at the hands of the Turks? If you want, read about the Dhimmi (see Appendix for definition of Dhimmi). Read any book by Bat Ye'or who gives a history of oppression. (I have read \"The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude : Seventh-Twentieth Century\", but there are other books by the same author). And there's an article link at\n http://www.dhimmitude.org/archive/by_lecture_10oct2002.htm\n There's also a number of links you can follow at\n http://www.dhimmitude.org/d_history.php\n \n You probably didn't read it about it because the fundamentalists weren't attacking the west, they were content at the time killing their own Christian minorities. Most people aren't aware of what's going on in the world.\n \n The Turks through their empire continually levied a tax of people; drafting Christian boys into the Janissaries, until the practice was abolished only in the 1800s as the west began to chip away at the Turkish Empire; notable Russia gained concessions to protect native Christian populations.\n \n What is a fundamentalist anyway? One would think, that in reference to Islam, one who believes things such as the Koran being the unaltered word of their god (that's 90% of them), who don't follow any liberal interpretation of the teachings of the Koran (that's 90% of them).\n \n Most Muslims are fundamentalists. The oppression of minorities has been practiced since the foundation of Islam, and was encouraged by Mohammed. Starting with the murdering of over 900 Jews\n The Banu Qurayzah tribe which had aided him in his early struggles, refused to convert to Islam (recall that Muslims will quote - there's no compulsion in religion'!)\n The members of the last surviving Jewish tribe in Medinah, Banu Qurayzah, were even less fortunate. Muhammad offered the men conversion to Islam as an alternative to death; upon their refusal, all 900 were decapitated in front of their enslaved women and children. The women were subsequently raped; Muhammad chose as his concubine one Raihana Bint Amr, whose father and husband were both slaughtered before her eyes only hours earlier.\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/February1999/0299Trifkovic.htm\n This info is itself based on Muslim sources...\n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa', the tribe of 'Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina.\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362)\n There were, in the time of Muhammad, Arab tribes that were Christian. Some were pagan, and some were Jewish. One such Jewish tribe, the Banu Quarayza helped Muhammad in battle. However, \"their loyalty was questioned and inevitably, after the siege, Muhammad moved against them. Realizing that they had no chance of surviving, the Banu Quarayza agreed to surrender on condition that they quit Medina empty-handed. Muhammad refused and wanted nothing less than unconditional surrender. The Jews then appealed to their ancient friendship with the Banu Aws and asked that Abuy Lubaba, an ally belonging to that tribe, be allowed to visit them. He was asked what Muhammad's intentions were; by way of reply Abu Lubaba drew his hand across his throat, indicating that they must fight to the end, as death was all that they could hope for. At last, after several weeks, the Jews surrendered on condition that their fate should be decided by their allies, the Banu Aws. The latter were inclined to show mercy but Muhammad decided that the fate of the Jews was to be decided by on of the Banu Aws. Muhammad nominated Sa'd ibn Muadh to be the judge...He pronounced, \"My judgement is that the men shall be put to death, the women and children sold into slavery, and the spoil divided among the army.\" Muhammad adopted the verdict as his own: \"Truly the judgment of Sad is the judgment of God pronounced on high from beyond the seventh heaven.\"\n \n During the night trenches sufficient to contain the dead bodies of the men were dug across the market place...In the morning, (Muhammad), himself a spectator of the tragedy, commanded the male captives to be brought forth in companies of five or six at a time. Each company as it came up was made to sit down in a row on the brink of the trench... The butchery began in the morning, and lasted all day...(Muhammad) returned from this horrid spectacle to solace himself with the charms of Rihana, who's husband and all of her make relatives had just perished in the massacre\"*\n \n \"And yes, a revelation came down from heaven justifying the stern punishment meted out to the Jews: sura 32.25 - \"And He has caused to descend from their strongholds the Jews that assisted them. And he struck terror into their hearts. Some you slaughtered and some you took prisoner\"\n \n Ibn Warraq (1995) \"Why I am Not a Muslim\", pp95-96.\n Mohammed himself wrote this letter of warning. \"Peace be upon the one who follows the right path! I call you to Islam. Accept my call, and you shall be unharmed. I am God's Messenger to mankind, and the word shall be carried out upon the miscreants. If, therefore, you recognize Islam, I shall bestow power upon you. But if you refuse to accept Islam, your power shall vanish, my horses shall camp on the expanse of your territory and my prophecy shall prevail in your kingdom.\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Muhammad/oman.htm\n For rights of Dhimmi see also...\n http://www.answering-islam.org/NonMuslims/rights.htm\n Current persecutions of Christians\n &#8220;Documenting the Persecution of Christians in the Islamic World&#8221;\n http://www.domini.org/openbook/\n and\n Voice of the Martyrs\n http://www.vom.com.au/\n (note this site also includes persecutions of Christians by non-Muslims)\n \n APPENDIX - THE DHIMMI\n For those unaware of the \"Dhimmi\", Mohammedans have a special legal status for non-Muslims; which was called Dhimmi. These &#8216;protected&#8217; people had rights curtailed by Islam. For example\n Dhimmi: had to pay a special poll tax\n wear special clothing\n refrain from trying to gain converts\n could not have a church higher than a mosque\n were unable to have the same rights of testimony as a Muslim.\n could not build a new church, and needed special permission to repair an existing one.",
