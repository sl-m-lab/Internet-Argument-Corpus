   "Caribbean island criminalizes abortion\n Charlie Butts - OneNewsNow - 5/1/2009 4:00:00 AM\n The Dominican Republic has enshrined the right to life for preborn babies by rewriting the constitution.\n \n \n \n Christian Newswire reports a bill was passed in Santo Domingo by a vote of 167-to-32 that said \"the right to life is inviolable from conception until death.\"\n \n The vote came during a time when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted an Obama administration goal of spreading \"reproductive rights\" throughout the world. Keith Mason, head of Personhood USA, believes reproductive rights are code for abortion -- and he applauds the Dominican Republic for its bravery.\n \n \"It shows an example to the rest of the Latin American countries that we must fight abortion at every level and resist the Obama administration,\" he contends.\n \n Mason notes the Obama administration had a strong presence at the recent campaign in the Dominican Republic. \"I know that the Obama team was present in the Dominican Republic, and there were lobbyists daily while we were there raising awareness for the abortion issue. So we're so excited that that little Caribbean island took a stand to protect life,\" he adds.\n \n Personhood USA also had representatives on hand to encourage lawmakers to take a stand for life, which they did.",
