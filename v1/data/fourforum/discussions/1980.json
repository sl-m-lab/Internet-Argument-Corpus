Reproduction!\n \n Thus, they will not survive! This in itself is proof that homosexuality is not normal!\n\n \n THEY still survive, up until their deaths. They do not produce offspring, therefore the population does not survive in this particular case. \n \n This in no way proves that homosexuality is not normal. Do it this way...put a man and a woman on the island, with everything they need to survive. They again survive until their deaths. The couple could reproduce offspring, which in turn could reproduce offspring, etc etc. The population could go on indefinately. But just suppose that the man and woman reproduce up until they are physically unable to, and all of the offspring are male. The population dies when the offspring die. So does that mean that heterosexuals are also not normal? Certainly not. Therefore, your theory is flawed in the scientific method. If I chose not to produce a child with my wife, does this mean that I am not normal? Reproduction is a process by which life is continued, not a process used to define what is normal and what is not. Just because 2 people do not produce offspring lends no weight on whether or not they or their lifestyles are normal.\n \n And also, I noticed that you entitled this thread Gay Rights?
