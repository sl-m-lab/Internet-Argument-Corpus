The scientific world is leaving their dark ages \"fear of God\" superstitious views behind and they don't like it.\n \n The really ad thing is these people really do think they can have the modern world, with it's advanced medicines, medical techniques, hi-tech gadets etc, without people having to be taught science.\n \n America is standing at a precipice. You can let this nutters beat you and you will fall back into into the primitive dark old days and the rest of the world will leave you behind. You will become another Afghanistan, with extreme religious nutters in control, free speach gone and witch burnings for anyone who mentions evolution or who suggests the Bible may not be 100% true. Or you can beat them and continue to pretty much lead the world scientifically.",

   "This is really stupid. The whole basis of science is that we observe something and ask the question \"why?\" We observed the fact that we are here on Earth. Science attempts to explain it. Darwin explained it with his theory of evolution and if creationists want to objectively perform an experiment like Darwin did and give even some proof that another being created the Earth than it can be taught in science class, as long as it's \"some people believe\" it belongs in a religion class, not a science class. Intelligent design is a valid religious belief and may have happened, but it shouldn't be taught in SCIENCE class.\n \n \n \n and this redefining shi*. Aren't these the same people who don't want to redefine marriage because of their agenda. So their stance is to modify the dictionary to fit their purposes, but use the dictionary as back up when it suits them. Great strategy. Not!",
