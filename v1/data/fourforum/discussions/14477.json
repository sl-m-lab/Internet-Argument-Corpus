   "1. Federal Obligation\n Congress must maintain the present FICA tax level and must meet the current Social Security obligations. Alternatively FICA tax rates can be increased or made progressive based on income.\n \n 2. Privatization of Benefits\n a. Federal Investments\n Congress must prohibit the government of the United States from investing any revenue derived from FICA taxes in any investment other than bonds and securities of the United States.\n b. Individual Retirement Accounts\n Congress should immediately grant tax credits to employers who contribute to an employee retirement account providing that no tax credit exceeds two thousand dollars per year for each employee. The retirement accounts shall be owned by the employees and shall be transferable between employers. Congress shall levy a forty- percent tax on any funds withdrawn from any account prior to twenty years after the date on which the account was created except in cases where mental or physical disability prevents the account's owner from having gainful employment or the death of the account owner requires the account to devolve upon the owner's estate. No tax may be levied on funds withdrawn after twenty years, but Social Security benefits may be reduced in an amount equal to the amount withdrawn from the retirement account. \n \n This way workers can have both Social Security and a private retirement account. If private investments go bad, a worker would still have Social Security to fall back on. If private investments are good, a worker would have more retirement income than he would otherwise get through Social Security.",
