   "It's true... socialist systems raise poverty rates, unemployment rates, other assorted rates.\n\n \n While I would agree with the unemployment part (but it does increase efficiency in the labour force and helps to cushion the negative spiral effects of a recession), poverty rates are not raised by a socialistic wellfare system. If you take a look at the poverty as in percentage of the population below the poverty line, or as in the economic resources belonging to the poorest 10-20 per cent of the population I think you will find that the less social security a country has, the higher poverty rate it tends to have. A quick comparrison between the more \"socialistic\" countries in europe and america would show: that the poorest 10 per cent in the US controls roughly 2% of the resources while the poorest 10 per cent in Norway, Finland and Sweden controls 4% per cent of the resources. And that 13,6 per cent of the american population lives on under 11 dollars per day, whereas Sweden has 6,3 per cent, Finland 4,8 per cent and Norway 4,3 per cent who lives of less than 11 dollars per day\n \n Source CIA world factbook and nationmaster.com",
