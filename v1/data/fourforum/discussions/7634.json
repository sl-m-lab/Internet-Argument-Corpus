There are many other religons try focusing on them tooo...dont just base your arguements on Christian beliefs.\nMostly because I live in a 'Christian' country. Christianity therefore is the main religion that people believe in and hence the most appropriate to argue against. I can only think of a handful of people of other religious denominations that post here, and none of them really have the uncompromising attitude of some of the Christian posters. They are moderate and therefore I respect that.\n \n I take your point though, but I know far less about other religions to intelligently talk about them.",

Most find questions and then come out on the other side stronger than ever before. And there's nothing that says following what Thomas Jefferson called, \"...the sublimest system of morality that has ever been taught..\" is an exercise in blindness. \n \n I submit the truly blind folks are the ones Jesus spoke of in Matthew 13:\n \n In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \n \" 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; \n you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. \n For this people's heart has become calloused; \n they hardly hear with their ears, \n and they have closed their eyes. \n Otherwise they might see with their eyes, \n hear with their ears, \n understand with their hearts \n and turn, and I would heal them.",
