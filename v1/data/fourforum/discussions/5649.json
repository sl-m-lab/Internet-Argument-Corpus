   "China's demand for oil causes prices to rise. Of course the chicken littles here will tell us the price is due to \"inflation.\" Looks like China won't have any problem getting rid of those excess dollars. They will send them to OPEC where the price fixers will keep raising prices due to DEMAND. \n ==============================\n June 13, 2005, 6:29AM\n \n Katy Freeway at rush hour? Nope. Welcome to Beijing.\n China's economic growth is in the fast lane, and it means higher prices at the pump for us\n \n By LYNN J. COOK\n 2005 Houston Chronicle\n \n BEIJING - To understand why Americans are paying more at the pump these days, all you need to do is take a look at Beijing's freeways.\n \n Just like Houston's Loop 610 at rush hour, Beijing's Third Ring Road runs bumper to bumper as commuters make their way from jobs in towering skyscrapers to homes in the suburbs, burning gasoline as never before.\n \n http://images.chron.com/content/news/photos/05/06/13/a-china.jpg\n \n While idling in traffic, members of China's emerging middle class get an eyeful of slick billboards advertising sprawling golf course communities, perfectly \"feng shui-ed\" luxury high-rises and neat-as-a-pin, single-family dwellings away from the urban chaos - think Pulte homes with pagoda roofs.\n \n Turns out, the Chinese dream looks a lot like the American dream. And as they buy ever more oil to keep their gas tanks full, prices around the world rise.\n \n \"We both have big-country syndrome,\" said Edward Williams, a Beijing-based attorney with the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n \n Crude oil consumption is one area where China is following right in America's wake - and OPEC, which is meeting Wednesday in Vienna, Austria, knows it.\n \n Since 2003, when China overtook Japan as the world's second-largest importer of oil behind the United States, this country of 1.3 billion people has generated a lot of talk at the table when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets.\n \n Wednesday should be no different when the organization convenes to decide whether to push up the summer production ceiling by 500,000 barrels per day, a symbolic move since most members are already pumping more oil than their stated quotas allow.\n \n Jeff Logan, China program manager for the International Energy Agency, says China's roaring economy is still glowing white-hot despite the government's efforts to slow growth. That's nothing but good news for OPEC, which not long ago some were writing off as irrelevant to world oil prices.\n \n According to the IEA, the cartel supplies 38 percent of the world's oil, but by 2030 - thanks in part to China's growing demand - the group's market share is expected to zoom to 54 percent.\n \n That's because once-gushing oil fields are slowly playing out in such places as the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Caspian Sea and even West Africa.\n \n And, barring a massive economic collapse, most analysts think China and the United States will increasingly compete for the same barrels of oil in the Middle East in the next 20 to 30 years.\n \n Market 'volatility' expected\n Fereidun Fesharaki, senior energy fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said global oil production will peak in the next 10 to 15 years, although he's quick to add this will not come as a sharp climax followed by a collapse in the number of barrels of oil on the market.\n \n \"Prices will go up and then demand will go down. There's going to be a lot of volatility,\" he said. \"You can't argue with what God gave you. Outside of OPEC, we are now hitting the bottom of the barrel.\"\n \n In May, President Bush gave a speech calling for the United States to help developing countries such as China curb their yen for oil. But the United States seems to set only an example for excess.\n \n With less than 5 percent of the world's population, the United States manages to consume 25 percent of the oil. Gavin Thompson, of energy consultants Wood MacKenzie, said 2005 forecasts show China's crude demand still adds up to just one-third what the United States will need.\n \n But that gap is closing.\n \n Cars replacing bikes\n Every single day a thousand new cars roll on to Beijing's broad lanes and snaking highways. More than a million new vehicles will be in circulation between now and 2008, when the city hosts the Summer Olympics.\n \n That's just Beijing. The newfound love of the open road is contagious, with cars rapidly replacing the throngs of bicycles in all of China's big cities - from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Chongqing to Guangzhou.\n \n These wheels are not the type of tiny 1-liter-engine cars popular in energy-conscious Europe. The swelling ranks of China's middle class are enamored with the same kind of titanic sport utility vehicles and comfy sedans Americans love to drive.\n \n Western status symbols are all the rage with China's nouveau riche - regardless of how the money is made.\n \n Chinese urged to drive\n \n In Beijing's tony watering holes, stories circulate about Bentleys bought with suitcases of cash by men with soot under their fingernails. And on a recent Monday afternoon in front of the State Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters the prime parking space by the front door was taken by a shiny, black Hummer. (The GM gas guzzler retails for more than $100,000 in China.)...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/printstory.mpl/front/3222450",
