   "As we have all seen, the past 48 hourse has got the UN ####### themselves and the media in a buzz about the bombings in Lebenon and Israel. One side condemns Israel, the other supports Israel's right to defend itself. The question is what next? Hazbulah's leader has declared open war on Israel and Israel in return has done the same. Syria says it will aid Hazbulah, and now Iran says if the Israeli's attack Syria, Iran will openly attack Israel, and of course who will answer Israel's aid? America. So people of this forum will it just simmer down to mere rockets and an occasional airstrike? Or is this a powderkeg that will explode into a new world war? I also just heard that 4 Israeli sailors have been declaired missing as well as the other 2 soldiers taken hostage on Friday. Should the US be invlolved? What of gas prices and the feeble trembling stock brokers in New York? It ssems as if w ehave seen this senario played out in past conflicts involving Israel but this time you have opne terrorist groups, as well as sovergn nations who openly declare war upon Israel. If you care for my opinion I believe that Israel has a right to defend itself from terrorists and to if necessary fight to protect it's right to exist as a nation. I also think that the US should aid Israel as we have promised, as far as supplies and medical personel etc. It should only come to boots on the ground in only the most dire of situations. But it already seems that the situation is already dire. Israel simply refuses to listen to any mention of a cease fire, and will continue to bomb southern Lebanon until Hezbolah is utterly destroyed.",

   "The only thing that you can be certain of when it comes to aid to Israel is that whatever number you have, it is wrong. The problem lies in the fact that much of our aid is off the books or hidden and we do ot count it as \"aid\". For example, we are bound to purchase predetermined amounts of military equipment from israel, and they are required to purchase predetermined amounts form us. The difference is that we are required ot pay cash for ours, and they are not, and over 90% of the revenue form our sales of military equipment to israel over the years has gone unpaid either becuase they have quietly defaulted on those payments or because they are later forgiven by the US.\n \n http://www.washington-report.org/html/us_aid_to_israel.htm\n \n Conservative estimate put total cost of israeli aid at rougly $90 billion. The GAO issued a report in 2000 than showed that, including incurred liability and debt service costs, that number is closer to 1.2 trillion in real numbers. \n \n The one thing that we know for certain is that we have sent them a hell of a lot of money, and we may as well have flushed it down the toilet for all the good it has done us. In fact, it may have been best if during the 7 days war we had stood by and done nothign and allowed israel to be wiped off the map. 9/11 almost certainly owuld not have happened, nor woudl trillions of dollars have been blown in the ME in the recent past.\n \n The current situation shows how ungrateful the scumbags running Israel are to the US. People do not seem to realize that israel has completely SCREWED us here by escalating regional conflict and invading another country. \n \n Lebanon went to the UNSC and asked for them to issue a chapter 7 declaration calling for an immediate stop to agression in the area. EVERY nation on the curren security coucil was ready to roll with this excpet for the US. The US told the UNSC that we would veto any resolution that would halt israels agression. That SAME afternoon, russia signed a new arms deal with the iranians....one that they were contemplating but had not signed due to US objections.\n \n Lebanon just managed to shrug off syrian control. This was claimed by the bush administration as a victory (though the bush administration had NOTHING to do with it). The new gvoernment was doing very well against Hezbolla, with Hezbolla holding only 23% of seats in parliment and 12 of those expected to be lost in the next election. That has turned around now, with the lebanese population showing massive support for hezbolla because they see the new governemtn as having been proven wrong. The new government promised its people that if they played nice, the US would protect lebanon from israel. That has turned out not to be true.\n \n The simple fact of the matter is, Israel is wholly dependant on US aid and a militant stucture. Lacking either of those, israel would not survive a month. This is why every tiem there are positive steps made int he region, Israel blows a gasket and escalates things. They simply cannot afford to loose the income and the excuses for military expenditures that peace would bring.\n \n We can pretty much kiss any meaningful action against Iran goodbye, as well as any meaningful action against N Korea, becuase while th eUs has no problem with blatant double standards in its foreign policy, other nations do, and they do not want to be seen slapping sanctions against Iran or N Korea, neither of who has actually done anything wrong or illegal, while failing to move against Israel, which is in blatant and unquestionable violation of the law.",

As a percentage of GNI, next to last. Of 2005 $27.5-billion US aid to developing countries, 18%, $5-billion, went to Afghanistan and Iraq, countries we destroyed. \n \n If you're pointing political fingers, a poor measure of trade agreements primarily driven by business interests, Nixon actually opened the door for China's emergence as a world economic power. China had already laid the groundwork for and completed much of its infrastructure improvement using Taiwan and Hong Kong as trade outlets long before Clinton. Want some personal stories on how much Taiwanese labeled product was produced in China in the 1980s by using cleverly worded US import policy? \n \n The US simply became lazy, with wages escalating and product quality declining to a point where we became non-competitive in a global marketplace. That created a declining demand for US expansion capital, which went offshore to obtain acceptable ROIs. Out of curiosity, why would you condemn Wal-Mart's business strategies? what makes their responsibility to stockholders any different than that of a failing GM? The intent of business is to produce profits. \n \n All wealthy countries use aid to forward their interests, be them military or commerce. The US is currently stuck on selling Petrodollar debt for survival and aid to Israel facilitates US military dominance over the ME, the only question being how long the US can maintain debt service, including Israel, for military dominance without the industrial capability to generate new wealth. Historically, that formula has always had a finite span. \n \n http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp?so=d2004#ForeignAidNumbersinChartsandGraphs\n \n http://www.oecd.org/document/40/0,2340,en_2649_33721_36418344_1_1_1_1,00.html",

   "Do you have a link to this GAO report?\n\n \n I wish I did. I still have my hard copy, but can't find the original report online anywhere. \n \n \n ....meh, It seems like it is a significant part but assuming they don't get attacked I think they could hold their own economy. Aid has been reduced and their economy has grown....better than the rest of the middle east atleast ;). See GDP numbers.\n\n \n Over 45% of the Israeli economy is linked to their military expenditures. That is a HUGE chunk of your economy based on military agression....the only nation in modern times with a similar ratio is Nazi Germany. \n \n The big problem with the Israeli economy is that nobody in their right mind would be willing to do business there. Their polcies and legal framwork for their companies is openly racist. The entire region is unstable, and the Israeli government has a long and illustrious history of severely screwing foreign corporations. \n \n Even Israel admits that they could not survive without US aid, which keeps their people fed and their military machine ticking over. Subtract US aid from Israeli numbers and it quickly becomes apparent that without it they cannot afford to feed their people.\n \n The problem is largely one of location. When the Zionists moved into what is now israel and began their terrorism campaign to turn it into the current state of israel, they assumed that they would draw wealth for their new nation based on petro oil and olive oil. At the time, olive oil was an expensive commodity and a large percentage of the worlds olive oil came from palestine. \n \n The jews forced the palestenians out and took over the olive groves. They estimated at the time that olive oil exports would make them the wealthiest nation in the Middle East. \n \n A problem arose because most of the olive groves they took had been in the same family for hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of years. The knowledge to make those orchards thrive had been passed down father to son for generations. The newly arrived zionists had no clue what they were doing and the groves suffered. At the same time, the palestenian farmers that were displaced were recruited by corporate growers to run their operations. Most of thsoe palestenian farmers died millionaires, because they managed to ramp up corporate olive oil production up to magnificent levels. The israelis ended up with a bunch of worthless olive groves that they had pretty much destroyed though mismanagement. Thus ended the zionist plan to steal the olive oil wealth of the palestenians.\n \n Their plan to get rich on petro oil was flawed for obvious reasons (like...there was none). \n \n So, Israel has no resources worth mentioning. Nobody is willing to do business with them, and they pretty much suck when it comes to manufacturing things. Japan thrived with limited resources because they were willing to work cheaper than dirt to build up a base. Israel has made it clear that they are not willing to do that. What are they going to do to make their economy thrive? Nothing. They are instea going to continue to devote their attention to assuring that the nations around them fail, thus hiding their shame.\n \n \nAs for letting Israel get whipped off the map....that seems a little harsh. I'd rather not save money then see mass genocide.\n\n \n I am talking abotu erasing lines, not erasing people. From a practical standpoint, there are 2 ways we could go on this, and I woudl support either one. Either we could simply announce that we willno longer suport Israeli agression. This would remove the problem as Israle simply cannot survive without us. Alternatively, we could force Israel to annex the occupied territories, and give the palestenains there rights, such as the right to vote. Israel would cease to exist in its present form after the next election.",

   "Daewoo, the Israeli's lost nothing like that. 85% may have been the losses of one or two of the front-line units but nothing like the whole of their army.\n\n \n YES, the whoel army. Israels equipment losses during the war were STAGGERING. Yom Kippur has been extensively studied not just int he US but in Israel as well as how NOT to run a war. Do a little polking around. The Israelis did several studies to try to figure out why the war was such a failure. What is boils down to is that the Israelis completely over ran their supply lines and commadn and control broke down completely. At the end of the war, most Israeli units that had penetrated into egypt were forced to abandon their equipment and WALK back to israel because they could not get fuel for ther machines. There are still burnt out bits of Israeli military equipment scattered across the egyptian desert that was destroyed because the Israelis simply could not get it home. \n \n The Yom Kippur war DID teach us some things...like don't let israel run a war, and NEVER let field commanders in the IDF make important decisions. It also taught us a little more about the price of arrogance. The isralis KNEW they were overrunning their supply lines, they just though that they were SO GOOD that it would be OK. It does not matter how good you are, if you are out of bullets, fuel, and food.\n \n \nJust dropping supplies is not enough. Resupplies requires extensive time to get them into working order, the troops to familiarise themselves with them etc. Remember also the \\Israeli's would not at that time have been familiar with US equipment as they had been armed mainly by the French and to a lesser extent by the British. The US had supplied a small proportion of obsolescent armour\n\n \n The Arabs had been using russian equipment for YEARS. They did not need any training on it. Cut loose the chutes, drag it off the pad, and go to town with it. During the Yom Kippur war, the equipmetn the US was dropping was direct replacement for destroyed Israeli stuff. There should not have been any learning curve at all. The only thing we could not get and provide was the phantom fighters that Israel was using. \n \n \n \nIn the 6-day war The Russians had supplied all the Arab nations especially Egypt and there was no way the US would have stopped them without a shooting war. The Russians then quite happily resupplied them but again getting equipment there takes time. The brilliant results of the Israeli campaign which took them to the Suez canal, the Golan Heights and the the river Jordan meant they could negotiate from strength. They weren't out to wipe out their opponents as opposed to their opponents who wanted to wipe out Israel\n\n \n WRONG. We simply threateend a shootign war with Russia, and they backed down. Suring the Tom Kippur war, the russians threatened a shooting war with us if we did not stop our air drops, and we stopped them then went to the UNSC and pushed for an end to the war. \n \n \nIn Yom Kippur the Israeli's reactions were first rate and they were able to throw back the Syrian assaults and cross the Canal invading Egypt proper and trapping at least one of their main armies. Another brilliant campaign which allowed for negotiation.\n\n \n Have you studied any military history or tactical planning? The Yom Kippur war was a failure by the Israeli military. The only reason that Israel was not completely destroyed is that the US intervened AGAIN on their behalf. I worked with some IDF commanders at one time in a joint operation, and even they acknowledge that the Yom Kippur war was only a god example of how to loose most of your equipment, plus billions of dollars worth of somebody elses.",

   "I never realised the Israelis lost the Yom Kippur war.

The Israelis managed to loose almost all of their equipment, plus billions of dollars worth of US provided equipment. In order to end the war, the US had to agree to pay Syria and Egypt hundred of billion of dollars up front, PLUS billions of dollars per year to egypt, payments which are still continuing today.\n \n Does that sound like a victory to you?\n \n You have got to be either enlisted, or IDF. Officers get tactical training, and every tactical training course I have ever attended includes the failures of the Yom Kippur war. Many of them actually have retired Israeli officers come and lecture about their first had experience with that failure. It was not until such a speaker came to my own tactical class that I understood what a complete and utter failure that war was. Most of the time, the Israeli command did not eve know where their units were.\n \n It was certainly an overall vistory for Israel. They got to replace all their military gear (which was destroyed) with nice new gear form the US, at US expense. Additionally, they did not have to pay the hundreds of billions to get the Syrians and Egyptians to back off, the US did that, and continues to do so today.

   "I wish I did. I still have my hard copy, but can't find the original report online anywhere. \n what is the number on the hard copy.... I can access it at work if it isn't online.\n \n \nOver 45% of the Israeli economy is linked to their military expenditures. That is a HUGE chunk of your economy based on military agression....the only nation in modern times with a similar ratio is Nazi Germany. \n Can you provide some links for this :) I'm an accountant...we need evidence ;) Even if this were true it shoudn't come as a surprise (we spend what...30% on military each year?) considering everyone in the Middle East wants to kill them all.\n \n \n\n The big problem with the Israeli economy is that nobody in their right mind would be willing to do business there. \n They actually have very nice trade agreements with the US and EU (among others) and many places do business with them...more so than other Middle East countries.\n \n \n\n Their polcies and legal framwork for their companies is openly racist. The entire region is unstable, and the Israeli government has a long and illustrious history of severely screwing foreign corporations. \n They due tend to run a cutthroat lifestyle there. I honestly understand why..doesn't make it good though.\n \n \n\n Even Israel admits that they could not survive without US aid, which keeps their people fed and their military machine ticking over. Subtract US aid from Israeli numbers and it quickly becomes apparent that without it they cannot afford to feed their people. \n Well, assuming no attacks they could scale back their military and actually have a fairly successful economy. They have been growing fairly well in recent years (minus a recession when we had one).\n \n \n\n The problem is largely one of location.\n Yeah...pretty area but the people are a little on the crazy side.\n \n \n\n The jews forced the palestenians out and took over the olive groves. They estimated at the time that olive oil exports would make them the wealthiest nation in the Middle East. \n errr, blame the UN for making Israel its own state...It wasn't like the palestenians were the first their anyway. Their little feud has been going on forever.\n \n \n\n A problem arose because most of the olive groves they took had been in the same family for hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of years. \n I wouldn't go that far ;)\n \n\n Their plan to get rich on petro oil was flawed for obvious reasons (like...there was none). \n which is odd considering the area\n \n \n\n So, Israel has no resources worth mentioning. Nobody is willing to do business with them, and they pretty much suck when it comes to manufacturing things. \n so are we :) They have a lot of technology stuff there.\n \n \n\n Japan thrived with limited resources because they were willing to work cheaper than dirt to build up a base. Israel has made it clear that they are not willing to do that. What are they going to do to make their economy thrive? Nothing. They are instea going to continue to devote their attention to assuring that the nations around them fail, thus hiding their shame.\n \nI doubt they are doing this...they don't have to. The problems with their economy and lifestyle go beyond the scope of Israel being \"mean\".\n \n \n\n I am talking abotu erasing lines, not erasing people. From a practical standpoint, there are 2 ways we could go on this, and I woudl support either one. Either we could simply announce that we willno longer suport Israeli agression. This would remove the problem as Israle simply cannot survive without us. Alternatively, we could force Israel to annex the occupied territories, and give the palestenains there rights, such as the right to vote. Israel would cease to exist in its present form after the next election.\n Well option 2 would probably result in the extermination of many jews...probably not a popular stance. Option 1 is not needed as their isn't much aggression going on. Israel just wants to be left alone and it appears that the neighboring countries can't live with that. They couldn't live with it when Israel was created (palentinians were given the option of their own state...divided between the two) and nothing has changed in the last 70 yrs.",

What effect is this likely to have on hezbollah? Will it weaken them, or will they find more recruits and more backing from people who have lost homes and family to israeli agression?",

TO be specific, America's government has been evil to Native Americans and blacks in the past, yet no one is saying that now America shouldnt fight back when terrorists attack it.\n\n \n Check out the death tolls on both sides. During the course of the entire conflict, israel has oukilled the palestenians somewhere between 981:1 and 1243:1, depending on whose numbers you like. Even in the \"new\" conflict, they have outkilled the palestinians at an alarming rate. Take a look at http://www.ifamericansknew.org/index.html \n \n The Israelis, who, according to you, take great pains to minimize civilains deaths, have killed 739 palestenian children, while 121 Israeli children have been killed. Look through the entire page. It is well documented, and methodology is explained. \n \n In addition to the simple fact that they have been butchering the palestenian people for years, the first target in every invasion by the israelis to date has been records buildings. Specifically, they have destroyed birth and land records. This makes it impossible for palestenians to prove that they own anything, that they are citizens, or even that they exist. Over 4000 Palestinian homes have been demolished since 2000. Tens of thousands were demolished prior to that, and tens of thousands of palestinians have been forcibly evicted from their homes, in many cases homes that have literally been in their family for THOUSANDS of years. \n \n Is what the US did to the indians right? Hell no. The fact that our ancestors did evil, though, does not mean that I have to resign myself to stand idly by while my nation supports evil. Besides, up until the 70's, there was ALWAYS a militant native american movement in this country. If we were israel, we would have packed up every native american, put them in walled reservations, starved them, and every time one objected, we would have shrunk the reservation, demolished some homes, and killed anybody who opposed us, then claimed that WE were the victims. \n \n The terrorist attacks on the US are a complicated issue. I have said before, and have not seen anythign that woudl change my mind, that we EARNED those attacks. Frankly, the terrorists have a point. The US has done some dispicable and evil things and we have no right to whine when we get hit for them. \n \n An interesting bit from Reuters (syndicated in the mail and guardian):\n \n \nIsraeli air strikes on Lebanon killed 57 civilians and a Hezbollah fighter on Wednesday, the deadliest toll of the eight-day-old war, as thousands of villagers fled north and more foreigners were evacuated.\n\n \n This is pretty standard for Israeli battle tactics. 57 civilians killed, ONE enemy fighter. In the past, Israel has shelled refugee camps becuas ethey believed that enemy fighters might be there. \n \n For israel to expect the palestinians to simply forget about the atrocities that have been committed is unreasonable. For them to expect the palestinian authorities to be able to intercept and stop every attack on israel is ludicrous. Israel simply has to resign itself to the fact that when you visit atorcities upon people, there are going to be folks that want to strike back and you simply cannot stop them all.",

   "It is unfortunate that the situation had to reach the point of war. The reality is that in war there are no winners - just look at the injured persons on both sides.\n \n But despite this, I must say that I cannot support the action of Israel in this issue regardless of what Hezbollah is or does. Recent events were triggered by Hezbollah kidnapping two soldiers from Israel. In response, Israel began its action against the people of Lebanon - yes the people of Lebanon - people who would have no role to play in any offensive. Or maybe they are part of the problem - the many injured toddlers were the masterminds behind the kidnappings and attacks on Israel. Roads and bridges are part of the machinery that makes missles. Or maybe the factory manufacturing paper tissues was involved in weapons that would destory lives.\n \n While I am on that issue, the airport that would get many foreginers to safety was also destroyed and many of these foreigners include US citizens. And yes Israel may have hit a TV station belonging to Hezbollah but are all the workers there part of the organisation ar may they just be employed as journalists? And would the attack on the TV station not be an attack on the fundamental civil liberty of Freedom of the Press?\n \n The inital reason that was given for Israel's offensive was that it was necessary to recover the kidnapped soldiers. In the battle, I fear that these soldiers are forgotton. Israel asserted that its action was to ensure that all its soldiers are safe. but I must ask this - when one becomes a soldier, is there not an understanding that he or she may no longer have a safe life but may have to give up their lives for the sake of country?\n \n I must make it clear that i am not supporting Hezbollah's actions in the matter. they have made it clear that even though they are part of the electoral system of Lebanon, their continued offensive in not returning the soldiers suggest that they have no regard for the many lives lost. BUT then again, to continue along this line is foolish because it is obvious that this war is no longer about returning captive soldiers but is an attempt at a fast route to peace. \n \n Does anyone actually believe that the actions of Israel would result in peace? peace? No it would not, it just stirs the heart of many enemies of Israel because in their minds, the many innocent that have perished deserve revenge.\n \n We must ask why was there no attempt in diplomacy. Could there have not been any negotiations between parties involved. WE may never know because for this recent issue and I am not speaking about dialogue that has been lagging on for 20 years but fresh attempt revolving around this issue.\n \n But what is most painful about this issue is that while and obivious crisis contiues not a dog in the international community is barking against Israel's rash actions. They may not say that they support Israel but their action says that they do. But then again they are silent because they are scared of certain powerful countries who refuse to hear a complaint against Israel. It is for this reason that i often hope for another superpower so we may have democracy in the international community and not a dictatorship that makes the word \"democracy\" an ornament to fool the masses. But that is another issue by itself.\n \n I hope countries would speak up on this issue and do not just send ships to ensure that thier citizens are safe. The International community has meddled in country affairs in the past and i see no reason why they should stop now when it is the right time to meddle.\n \n I end with this thought: \n \n In Nazi era, when they came for your neighbour on the left, you said nothing.\n When they came for the neighbour on the right, you said nothing.\n But when they came for you, you turned to the left abd the right for help but there was no one to speak up for you.\n \n i hope to hear sufficient voices against the war in the Middle East at the moment.",

The article you linked as proof has already been posted here. However, \"quibbling\" would involve disagreement as to whether it was 93 billion or 103 billion that we have given Israel in the form of aid or that the '73 conflicts in the ME cost us 1.2 trillion or 1.4trillion. The preposterous claim that the GAO reported in 2000 that the real numbers regarding U.S. aid to Israel are 1.2 TRILLION is nothing more than falsification and deceit. The difference between a billion and a trillion is a factor of 1000 (one thousand).\n \n I do not share your description of the conflict. It's not Israeli aggression that keeps this conflict going. Israel showed great restraint in the 91 war when they were being peppered with scud missiles; Israel showed peaceful intent when they withdrew from Gaza and forced some of their own disgruntled settlers to leave it to the Palestinians; Israel properly retaliated against the rocket attacks that immediately followed. Their target is Hezbollah, not the Lebanese general public. They bombed the runways to keep supplies from being flown in by the many anti-Zionists, anti-semites, Jew-haters and various other supporters of Hezbollah. Those who would \"wipe Israel from the map\" are unfortunately plentiful.\n \n Get rid of (KILL)emoticon_xkill all the terrorists (AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEM) and peace will be prevalent in the ME.",

   "Check out the death tolls on both sides. During the course of the entire conflict, israel has oukilled the palestenians somewhere between 981:1 and 1243:1, depending on whose numbers you like. Even in the \"new\" conflict, they have outkilled the palestinians at an alarming rate. Take a look at http://www.ifamericansknew.org/index.html \n \n The Israelis, who, according to you, take great pains to minimize civilains deaths, have killed 739 palestenian children, while 121 Israeli children have been killed. Look through the entire page. It is well documented, and methodology is explained. \n \n In addition to the simple fact that they have been butchering the palestenian people for years, the first target in every invasion by the israelis to date has been records buildings. Specifically, they have destroyed birth and land records. This makes it impossible for palestenians to prove that they own anything, that they are citizens, or even that they exist. Over 4000 Palestinian homes have been demolished since 2000. Tens of thousands were demolished prior to that, and tens of thousands of palestinians have been forcibly evicted from their homes, in many cases homes that have literally been in their family for THOUSANDS of years. \n \n Is what the US did to the indians right? Hell no. The fact that our ancestors did evil, though, does not mean that I have to resign myself to stand idly by while my nation supports evil. Besides, up until the 70's, there was ALWAYS a militant native american movement in this country. If we were israel, we would have packed up every native american, put them in walled reservations, starved them, and every time one objected, we would have shrunk the reservation, demolished some homes, and killed anybody who opposed us, then claimed that WE were the victims. \n \n The terrorist attacks on the US are a complicated issue. I have said before, and have not seen anythign that woudl change my mind, that we EARNED those attacks. Frankly, the terrorists have a point. The US has done some dispicable and evil things and we have no right to whine when we get hit for them. \n \n An interesting bit from Reuters (syndicated in the mail and guardian):\n \n \n \n This is pretty standard for Israeli battle tactics. 57 civilians killed, ONE enemy fighter. In the past, Israel has shelled refugee camps becuas ethey believed that enemy fighters might be there. \n \n For israel to expect the palestinians to simply forget about the atrocities that have been committed is unreasonable. For them to expect the palestinian authorities to be able to intercept and stop every attack on israel is ludicrous. Israel simply has to resign itself to the fact that when you visit atorcities upon people, there are going to be folks that want to strike back and you simply cannot stop them all.\n\n \n That last sentence. I think I've already responded to it, but reading it again, as an Israel supporter, it struck me as incredibly ridiculous. Israel is NOT going to resign itself to the fact that terrorists bomb its innocents. I can guess that you do not like Israel, so this may not mean much to you, but Israel (being the Jewish state) has one of the highest populations of Jews in the world (the total population being incredibly small). Israel has a responsibility, like any other country, to protect its civilians and whether you like it or not, Israel is going to try to stop all of the terrorists! As for the idea of the Palestinian government stopping every attack on Israel, that most definitely is ludicrous.

Why is it that our society seems to defend these people, and criticize Israelites for wanting to defend their own freedom?

Their only aggressive action since that war has been the fact that they live and breathe. The Muslim countries need to get over it -- you lost, now deal with it and live in peace. Israel has not been trying to build an empire, they are ruled by a hungry dictatorship. They just want to live in peace and govern themselves.\n \n Sharon gave them the Gaza strip, as a peace offering, and this is the response. These people understand only force, so let's show it to them. I hate to sound like this, but let's forget 'being civil' and worrying about collateral damage. \n \n Israel needs to continue the air and land campaign, and level Hezbollah in Lebanon. If that means fighting the Lebanese themselves, then so be it. Then they need to focus on the source of Hezbollah's strength, and go after Syria and Iran. Ideally, all free nations with the capability should assist, not just Great Britain and the US.

If they are considered to be terrorists, they would obviously do as terrorists would - spread terror. They fight for a cause and they can be anywhere - what is stopping them from staying among the people of Lebanon. They can attack their enemy in anyway they choose that is convenient to them and can stay among them. \n \n if you are in war would you keep youself exposed to the enemy ? no you hide.

Their hatred for Jews is deeply rooted in their religious past. It's that simple. \n \n \n\n \n \n Let me say that I firmly do not believe that Israel is a Nation of mostly God-Fearing, peaceful people. history and religion suggest otherwise.\n \n History tells us of the many wars that have been fought by israel. If religion is to be considered, the very origin of Israel is from war. the Israelis came and took the lands of the people of Jerico, Ai and other civilizations that inhabited the land. And they did so with war, destroying many lives in their path. So I would not say that they are mostly peaceful in nature. But of cource we cannot judge those of today by actions of the past.\n \n Even the events with Lebanon today tell us that most people are not peaceful. Was there any attempt at negotiations before beginig this offensive? NO there was none. And do not tell be about any lagging \"negotiations\" of twenty years because the kidnappings should have been the inspiration to show that issues can be trashed outr without the guns. And speaking about the soldiers, when was the last time you heard about rescuing them? At the start of the offensive. But now they can be dead, probably by the missiles that hit the alledged 50% infrastructure of Hezbollah destroyed.\n \n AND it would be obvious that military actions of such nature and magnitude would kill innocent - muslims and others included - before starting.\n \n And polls show that most Israelis support this war. I remember hearing disgust being expressed by some citizens of Israel that their govenment should not engage in peace talks but should bomb the palestinians when peace talks about the gaza were going on. Are these qualities of a peaceful people - people who do not try to avoid violence by dialogue before becoming aggresive. \n \n I am not saying that there are no peaceful people in Israel. i am sure that there are many who would be against the war taking place in the manner it did.\n \n AS for what was said about muslims. I say that it was hatred Jews had for muslims too that stems from the earliest days. Hatred on both sides. The entire issue shows us why hatred should not be cultured - because it proves to be a hindrance to issues that really matter like dealing with poverty and disease.",

   "I went back this morning and reviewed my papers on this, and it was not the GAO report that showed aid in excess of a trillion dollars...\nFirst you posted a figure of $1.2 trillion from an alleged GAO report. When asked for a reference link to corroborate your assertion, you said you wish you had an online source but that all you had was your hard copy of the GAO report.\n \n Now that you've conceded that the figure you posted did not in fact come from your hard copy of a GAO report, one is left to wonder how you initially failed to distinguish between your alleged hard copy of the GAO report and your subsequent online reference to a disingenous piece of propaganda that overstates aid to Israel by $1 trillion. It appears jim's trucking has you pegged correctly.\n \n \n \n... it was the analysis which accompanied the report that pointed out that the GAO report failed to take into account things like the billions paid out to Egypt and Syria following the Yom Kippur war.\nYou're already in a hole of your own making, but still you dig deeper. Your updated claim now is that the GAO report was accompanied by an analysis. It was kind of you to offer two reference links, but anyone who reviews your links can see that neither of them corroborates your claim about an accompanying analysis to the GAO report. If you think I err, then look again at your references and see if they say what you claim they say: \n \n \n\n http://www.washington-report.org/arc...3/0306020.html\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1209/p16s01-wmgn.html\n \nWith respect to the GAO report, your first reference is dismissed simply for the fact that it makes no mention whatsoever of the GAO report. Besides, the website you linked to is widely recognized for promoting anti-Israeli propaganda. The website's intellectual dishonesty is even illustrated in the caption of your linked article -- The Costs to American Taxpayers of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: $3 Trillion -- since even Thomas Stauffer himself who wrote the opinion piece repeatedly cites the figure of $1.8 trillion for the U.S. cost of supporting Israel.\n \n You're second reference is also a dud with respect to the GAO report. It's clear you can google a keyword search on GAO and Israel, but you appear to have no comprehension of the search results. Else, you would have noticed the glaring discrepancies in your assumptions and assertions. More specifically, you stated:\n \nGoogling the second number nets this page:\n \n http://www.ameu.org/summary1.asp?iid=189\n \n where you can download the full GAO report\nYou would have been well-advised to simply concede your error and let it rest. But you rather choose to compound your error. As the prolific Scottish poet Walter Scott wrote in his epic poem Marmion,\n \"Oh what a tangled web we weave\n When first we practice to deceive!\"\n Did you download the GAO report from your reference source? Of course not, since contrary to your claim it's not there. If you had bothered to click the link to what you claim is the full GAO report, you will find only some commentary by Samir Abed-Rabbo & Mohamed El-Khawas.\n \n Furthermore, it apparently escapes you that the analytical commentary in your reference link is dated December 1983, yet you previously stated your hard copy of the GAO report is dated 2000. Were you caught in some sort of time warp? A tangled web indeed. The analysis you cite did not \"accompany\" your GAO report but rather appears to have preceded it by nearly two decades. Go figure!\n \n Lastly, no doubt you failed to notice the actual figure for the amount of aid to Israel that is stated in your reference source by Drs. Samir Abed-Rabbo & Mohamed El-Khawas. In the 35 years from 1949 to when the analysis was written, your reference states that U.S. aid to Israel totaled $30.7 billion. This figure is grossly at odds with the $1 trillion figure Stauffer cited for the 1973 war alone, though it is consistent with numerous credible sources that put the total aid figure at less than $100 billion from 1949 to date.",

That sounds reasonable to me, and by that very standard, cumulative aid to Israel is less than $100 billion. So where is the basis to hype the exaggerated claim of $1 trillion plus?\n \n A partial review Stauffer's analysis exposes some of the economic gymnastics his numbers rely on:\n --The most egregious example of groundless assessment is the $1 trillion Stauffer attributes to Israel for the economic costs of the 1970s Arab oil embargo and the establishment of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He blames Israel for Arab belligerence in the 1973 war and the subsequent Arab oil embargo, and he argues the SPR is \"designed primarily to insulate Israel\" from the Arab oil weapon.\n --Stauffer contends that the tens of billions of dollars the U.S. gives directly to Egypt and Jordan must be listed on Israel's side of the ledger, since we give that money simply to appease Arab hostility and ambition to destroy Israel.\n --Stauffer assumes that in the future Israel will default on all commercial loans backed by U.S. loan guarantees, even though Israel has yet to default on any such loans.\n --Stauffer believes that unofficial private transfers of money, for example U.S. residents investing in Israeli bonds, constitute U.S. aid to Israel.\n --Stauffer inflates his numbers by imputing a lost opportunity cost, as well as adjusting the figures in current dollars to account for the fact that $1 today is worth less than $1 in aid distributed decades ago. That's like giving someone a $1000 gift in 1980, then claiming years later that the gift amount was actually $5000, after adjustments.\n \n In short, Stauffer magnifies the costs of supporting Israel by piling on dubious expenses while at the same time ignoring significant dividends that the U.S. has received from Israel. Stauffer charges Israel for the cost of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but where does he credit Israel credit when the SPR is drawn upon to help moderate heating oil prices in New England? Stauffer charges Israel for the qualitative military edge it has on its neighbors, but where does he credit Israel for the benefit of taking out Saddam's nuclear reactor in 1981? Indeed, where does he credit Israel for sharing with the U.S. any of the scientific and technological innovations in medicine, agriculture, armaments, etc.\n \n Just imagine if Stauffer would use the same skewed standards of opinion and analysis to calculate how much it costs the U.S. taxpayer to support Korea, or Japan, or Western Europe since the end of WW2.

I fail to see any dividends from US aid to Israel, and certainly wouldn't consider Israel's destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor as a US dividend. \n 2. If you're implying US payments to Egypt and Jordon to sign treaties with Israel benefit the US, please define that benefit. \n 3. Israel has not defaulted on any US indebtedness or trade guarantee primarily because the US has a long history of forgiving those transactions. \n 4. What innovations has Israel developed with US money that benefit the US without an offsetting benefit to Israel? \n 5. Aid to Korea, Japan and Western Europe provided almost three decades of markets for US manufactured industrial and consumer products. I haven't done the numbers, but would think the per-capita aid factor to Israel would dwarf that of the aforementioned countries and Western Europe with no measurable return. \n \n If there was a tangible return to the US for ongoing aid to Israel or former USSR participation disrupting the ME regional balance of power, perhaps I'd be more sympathetic to your comments. As it is, given the nature of self-serving federal accounting practices, I'd think Stauffer's calculations were probably conservative. I'd now add the cost of the Iraq folly and subsequent increases in world oil prices. \n \n I view Israel as a US stepchild well into maturity, unable to fend for itself without concentrated, constant US parental assistance and refusing to observe its UN assigned territorial playpen. A loose cannon that has fewer and fewer dictator oppressed ME nation playmates taking US payoffs to let it run amok and secure neighboring territory. Now, with a US parental blessing, Israel invades and destroys yet another country under the guise of security and you're defending that action, the aid that makes it possible and condemning any critique of that aid. We'll have to agree to disagree on what I consider your rationalized motivation.",

   "I live in a Jewish household ...\nDoes that mean you are Jewish?\n \n \n \n ...and would venture that I know far more about Jewish history and customs than the average goyim, and investment opportunities in Israel regarding resettlement, so forget the prejudice statement. \nKnowing history, customs and investment opportunities in Isreal does not keep one from being predjudiced against its existence.\n \n Being Jewish does not preclude prejudice against Israel.\n \n \nYour statements are based on a position that Israel should be allowed to keep land taken in war, period, and retaliation against Israel is wrong. Am I correct?\nNot exactly. Israel hasn't kept all the land it has conquered in warfare. As a matter of fact, I believe the Sinai has been returned twice. The Gaza strip was being returned, much to the chagrin of some Jewish settlers who's own countrymen ran them out.\n \n My favoring of Israel in this ongoing bloodbath is based primarily on the fact that the Israelis have been retaliatory in their struggle to maintain the existence created for them in the late forties. They have the military quality to defend and conquer threats from well equipped, religious fanatic Arab bullies who continually XXXXX Israel's body with random rockets, car bombs and other IEDs...just for the hell of it. Israel listens to threats of being wiped off the earth, watches artillery and troops massing on both southern and northen borders...whips the aggressors asses and gets blamed for the fight. That's BS.\n \n I am proud of what the Israeli military is doing. Give them a few more weeks and they'll do some serious damage to Hezbollah, (Hizbullah, His Bull Ahh). I just wish we could loan them a bunker-buster or two to blow the cowardly leaders of it from their underground safety. \n \n (Have you ever noticed how these 'brave' warriors always designate some dumb bastard to be the suicide bomber while they themselves hide in caves?...\n \n ...I'm sure to get the misguided comparison of a country's leader being protected while the front line marches into a hail of bullets, but I think that's a different yardstick.)",

   "1. I fail to see any dividends from US aid to Israel, and certainly wouldn't consider Israel's destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor as a US dividend. \n 2. If you're implying US payments to Egypt and Jordon to sign treaties with Israel benefit the US, please define that benefit. \n 3. Israel has not defaulted on any US indebtedness or trade guarantee primarily because the US has a long history of forgiving those transactions. \n 4. What innovations has Israel developed with US money that benefit the US without an offsetting benefit to Israel? \n 5. Aid to Korea, Japan and Western Europe provided almost three decades of markets for US manufactured industrial and consumer products. I haven't done the numbers, but would think the per-capita aid factor to Israel would dwarf that of the aforementioned countries and Western Europe with no measurable return.\n\n The failure to acknowledge any dividends from Israel's destruction of the Osirak reactor is perhaps rooted in your geographic distance from the threat. No matter, even without your approval the dividends accrued, not only to Israel and the U.S. but the world community at large. The broad coalition of Gulf War troops from the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Arab world did not have to face a nuclear-armed Iraq.\n \n Peace, even a cold peace, is still an improvement over the repetitious wars that had earlier been the norm for the Arab belligerents. The benefits to the U.S. for this relative stability have varied over time. The strategic sphere is not as significant after the demise of the Soviet Union, though it remains important. Politically too, Egypt is our strongest ally in the Arab world, and of all the Arab power states, Egypt is the most pro-Western. It's also another battleground for Islamic extremism, so helping the Egyptians reform their economy surely serves our interests. Our support for Jordan is also support for stability in the region. Their continued commitment to co-existence with Israel is one less concern for the U.S. to deal with.\n \n There are loans and there are grants. If you wish to call the grants by another name-forgiven loans-then admit there are no economic or military grants. You can't have it both ways. The facts of Israel's debt to the U.S. government are made clear in your own reference link, the one you offered as evidence that Israel is not economically self-sufficient. Will you now dispute your own source? Apparently you're due a refresher, so open your source to page 9 to the section 'Loans with Repayment Waived' and start with the first sentence: \"The United States has not cancelled any of Israel's debts to the U.S. government...\" Contrary to your unsupported claims, it is clear that Israel's true loans were never forgiven, unlike the $6.7 billion in Egyptian debt that the U.S. cancelled.\n \n As for the U.S. cost to support the Koreans, Japanese, and such stalwart West European allies as the French, I see you would rather speculate than put pencil to paper.",

   "First you posted a figure of $1.2 trillion from an alleged GAO report. When asked for a reference link to corroborate your assertion, you said you wish you had an online source but that all you had was your hard copy of the GAO report.\n \n Now that you've conceded that the figure you posted did not in fact come from your hard copy of a GAO report, one is left to wonder how you initially failed to distinguish between your alleged hard copy of the GAO report and your subsequent online reference to a disingenous piece of propaganda that overstates aid to Israel by $1 trillion. It appears jim's trucking has you pegged correctly.\n\n \n Yes, and when I recognized that I had made a mistake, I immediatly admitted it. Certainly sounds dishonest to me. \n \n I found the page I linked by googling \"US aid to israel trillion GAO\". Several pages came up. That was one of them. \n \n I screwed up in my original cite largely due to the way my report is laid out. the cover page simply reads \"Analysis of US aid to Israel\" Followed by an introductory page, then a table of contents, then a brif introduction, then the GAO report I cited in its entirety, including the title page with \"Government Accountability Office\" in large type across the middle of the page. What stuck in my mind was that title page. In fact, when Steeve asked for a reference # for the report, I simply flipped to that page and pulled it off the upper left hand corner. It was not until Jim pointed out that the numbers in the GAO report did not match my claims that I actually went back and re-read the entir thing. Following the GAO report is the analysis of that report, which is where my number came from.\n \n So in short, yes, I made a mistake. Enjoy it. Revel in it. It does not happen very often.\n \n \n Now, I am still not seeing much by way of problems with the analysis that I did link, which suggests that not only was my cite incorrect, but my number was low. \n \n \nYou stated that from an accounting viewpoint, any payment, grant, debt forgiveness or US other cost made to a foreign nation and not repaid by that nation should be considered as aid. That sounds reasonable to me, and by that very standard, cumulative aid to Israel is less than $100 billion. So where is the basis to hype the exaggerated claim of $1 trillion plus?\n\n \n First, I assume that you mean \"payment made\" since \"cost made\" in this context is nonsensical. If that is the case, you missed a very important component, which is costs incurred as a result of those actions. Yo do not seem to be able to adequatly debunk his numbers, and frankly your attempts are pathetic.\n \n \n--The most egregious example of groundless assessment is the $1 trillion Stauffer attributes to Israel for the economic costs of the 1970s Arab oil embargo and the establishment of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He blames Israel for Arab belligerence in the 1973 war and the subsequent Arab oil embargo, and he argues the SPR is \"designed primarily to insulate Israel\" from the Arab oil weapon.\n\n \n \n This is one of the least questionable of his claims. There is absolutly no question that the oil embargo was a direct result of our support of Israel. Whiel that was not direct aid to Israel, it was a direct cost incurred as a consequence of our aid to israel. There is absolutly no question of this. \n \n The cost of establishing and maintaining the strategic petroleum reserve is potentially questionable. While it ws established as a direct result of the embargo, which was unquestionably a result of US aid to Israel, some might argue that we would need the SPR regardless of our support (or lack of support) for Israel due to regional instability in the ME. That argument has some problems because Israel is the primary destabilizing influence in the ME. I suppose a compromise could be worked, where we calcualte a portion of the cost of the SPR and attribute it to indirect cost of israeli aid. \n \n \n--Stauffer contends that the tens of billions of dollars the U.S. gives directly to Egypt and Jordan must be listed on Israel's side of the ledger, since we give that money simply to appease Arab hostility and ambition to destroy Israel.\n\n \n \n This one is potentially more questionable than the above, but in reality, there is no question that it is correct. We started giving Egypt and Jordan aid as part of our brokered end to the october war (Yom Kippur war). Syria got in on that as well, but unlike Egypt and Jordan, Syria did not insist on perpetual payments, merely a few aid packages over a relative short period of time. \n \n \n--Stauffer assumes that in the future Israel will default on all commercial loans backed by U.S. loan guarantees, even though Israel has yet to default on any such loans.\n\n \n Israel has never repaid those loans either. From fiscal yrs 1994-1998 Israel recieved nearly $30 billion in waived loans. Currently there is roughly $10 billion in such loans outstanding and not only has israel not paid a dime on those, they do not even have a plan in place for repayment. I suppose it is possible that they will begin repaying their loans, but it has never happened before, and I think that snow in the sahara is as or more likely a scenario than Israel suddenly beginning a massive program to repay US gauranteed loans.\n \n \n--Stauffer inflates his numbers by imputing a lost opportunity cost, as well as adjusting the figures in current dollars to account for the fact that $1 today is worth less than $1 in aid distributed decades ago. That's like giving someone a $1000 gift in 1980, then claiming years later that the gift amount was actually $5000, after adjustments.\n\n \n The term you are looking for is \"constant dollars\". Calculating long term payments for comparison purposes in constant dollars is just SOP. This is the most pathetic of your \"rebuttals\". Google \"Constant dollars\". Not only will you find tens fo thousands of economic reports where the results are calcualted in constant dollars, you will find tens of thousands of pages explaining why things are done this way.\n \n Lost opportunity costs are a valid component of any cost analysis. \n \n What that report essentially does is takes our aid to Israel and calculates it using real cost analysis techniques (generallt accepted techniques). For example, the oil embargo is not counted as US aid to israel, but it is without question a legacy cost of that aid. \n \n It has been pointed out here and other places that if a private company kept their books the way the US government does, the folks in charge of doing so would go to prison. Even Enrons book keeping was not as shady as our government book keeping. \n \n Compare this calcualtion of ISraeli aid to the GAAP report on government spending. You apply GAAP methodology to government boks, and our debt baloons to nearly 30 trillion and our yearly deficit runs well into the trillions. Is that right or wrong? It is unquestionably RIGHT by every standard on the planet...except for the US governments standard. \n \n This is the same thing. The numbers he is using are without question verifiable costs related to our aid to israel. They are correct by every standard excpet for those who for whatever reason have an axe to grind\n \n It has been said that when a mad who is honestly mistaken is shown facts, he will either cease to be honest or cease to be mistaken. I think I have shown pretty clearly that I prefer to cease to be mistaken (mostly becuase I have no horse in this race). Apparently you an jim simply prefer to cease to be honest (assuming you ever were). Sad.",

Yasser Arafat (Egyptian) co-founded the Palestine Liberation Committee in 1957. Syrian army intelligence recruited terrorists to attack Israel. Mark the dates January 14 and February 28, 1965. These were the first two successful attacks against Israel. Then Egypt's Nasser joined the hate group. In conferences beginning in 1964 the Arab leaders ratified the PLO, declared their resolve to destroy Israel and decided to divert the Jordan River to spoil Israel's planned use of the water. Mid-May 1967, Nasser speaks on Radio Cairo saying that Israel must be destroyed. Egypt told the UN peacekeepers to leave the Sinai and the Gaza Strip. Egypt closed the straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.\n \n Now you tell me who's being bullied around here.\n \n Israel took the Sinai, West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the Six Day War. They've since given most of their winnings back. This doesn't sound like an imperialistic posture to me.

I could mount a \"Jim is a liar\" campaign based on your record, but it would be redundant. Everybody is already aware of your dishonesty in pretty much all matters. I don't really blame you. If I was carrying as much emotional baggage as you, I would have trouble being objective as well.\n \n \nYour ad hominem attacks and foolish name-calling have little to do with the truth of the matter. You seem to get rather childish when you have no decent argument.\n\n \n No attack there, Jim, merely suggestimg that you ned to keep in mind in considering these things that not everybody thinks like you. Most people love theri families and get very upset when they are killed. I know that if my wife, or one of my children, were to be killed by a soldier, regardless of what nation they are from, especially one that is in flagrant violation of international law, I would kill as many of the bastards as I could. If I had no decent argument, you could refute it. As is, you obviously cannot. \n \n I'll post this again and give you a chance to preserve SOME dignity by at least TRYING to refute it as opposed to your usual \"pretend I didn't see things that pound my argument into the ground\" posture:\n \n \nLets look at some FACTS.\n \n FACT. Israel is illegally occupying land.\n FACT. israel has killed well over 100,000 civilians during the course of the conflict.\n FACT. EVERY nation in the area has offered Israel normalized relations in return for Israel withdrawing to its LEGAL borders.\n FACT. The UK, US, France, Germany, and a host of other nations have all offered to send peacekeeprs to the region to police the occupied territories and completely control the border IF Israel will take the offer of normalized relations in exchange for a withdrawal to their LEGAL BORDERS.\n FACT. Israel will not do it.\n \n Israel can end the conflict with neiborghing states and have a multinational police force 100,000 strong there in a few months if they simply STOP BREAKING THE LAW. The nationalistic aspects would be OVER. They are simply not willing. Israel can end this ANY TIME with full support, and they choose not to. The arabs do not have that option. \n\n \n \nWhether we agree on the partitioning of Israel from the previously created Jordan (under the Brits) the fact is that from 1948 to the early sixties there was relative peace in the area. Yasser Arafat (Egyptian) co-founded the Palestine Liberation Committee in 1957. Syrian army intelligence recruited terrorists to attack Israel. Mark the dates January 14 and February 28, 1965. These were the first two successful attacks against Israel. Then Egypt's Nasser joined the hate group. In conferences beginning in 1964 the Arab leaders ratified the PLO, declared their resolve to destroy Israel and decided to divert the Jordan River to spoil Israel's planned use of the water. Mid-May 1967, Nasser speaks on Radio Cairo saying that Israel must be destroyed. Egypt told the UN peacekeepers to leave the Sinai and the Gaza Strip. Egypt closed the straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.\n\\\n \n You seem to have left a few things out here. First, Israel was the FIRST state sponsor of terrorism. Since before Isreals creation as a nation, Zionist terrorists ran wild throughout the middle east. Isreals first prime minister was also the head of the most violent of the zionist terrorism organizations. Does \"the Lavon affair\" ring any bells? Israeli terrorists planted bombs in several buildings in Egypt, including US buildings, and tried to plant evidence implicating Arabs. Fortunatly, one was caught, and the whole thing unwound.\n \n What Egypt, Syria, and Jordan were doing leading up to the 6 day war is what Israel is claiming to be doing now, which is ending terrorist attacks. The difference is that in the case of the 6 days war, the Israeli governement was DIRECTLY responsible for the attacks. In some cases, members of the IDF were perpetrating the attacks. Leading up to the 6 day was, Johnson stepped in and got assurances from Egypt, Jordan, and Syria that they would not attack. In return the US would pressure Israel to stop the terrorism. SO, Egypt, Syria, and Jordan took their forces off of active standby, started to stand down, and the Israelis pulled a pearl harbor. They essentially agreed to a peace and then started a war when others actually believed them. They were certainly the victims there.\n \n \nPerhaps if you read a good portion of what is there, you won't have to make up numbers to make yourself appear to win a point in an argument that is clearly bristling your anti-Zionist neck hair.\n\n \n Read it. I simply do not see anthing there that suggests that israel, for whatever reason, should be allowed to operate above the law. \n \n Again, if my numbers are bad, refute them.

That would certainly expalin a few things, like how so many Americans can support killing over 100,000 Iraqis using a \"flypaper strategy\" as justification wherein folks who have a real issue with US foreign policy (and lets face it, most of their grivances are fully justified) can go an kill even MORE Iraqis, who have nothign to do with US foreign policy, in order to preserve American lives, when it is Americans whose votes have perpetuated the terrible (and in some cases very nearly evil) foreign policy. It takes some real mental gymnastics to make yourself feel right about that....OR, a good old case of self induced sociopathy.",

   "As we have all seen, the past 48 hourse has got the UN ####### themselves and the media in a buzz about the bombings in Lebenon and Israel. One side condemns Israel, the other supports Israel's right to defend itself. The question is what next? Hazbulah's leader has declared open war on Israel and Israel in return has done the same. Syria says it will aid Hazbulah, and now Iran says if the Israeli's attack Syria, Iran will openly attack Israel, and of course who will answer Israel's aid? America. So people of this forum will it just simmer down to mere rockets and an occasional airstrike? Or is this a powderkeg that will explode into a new world war? I also just heard that 4 Israeli sailors have been declaired missing as well as the other 2 soldiers taken hostage on Friday. Should the US be invlolved? What of gas prices and the feeble trembling stock brokers in New York? It ssems as if w ehave seen this senario played out in past conflicts involving Israel but this time you have opne terrorist groups, as well as sovergn nations who openly declare war upon Israel. If you care for my opinion I believe that Israel has a right to defend itself from terrorists and to if necessary fight to protect it's right to exist as a nation. I also think that the US should aid Israel as we have promised, as far as supplies and medical personel etc. It should only come to boots on the ground in only the most dire of situations. But it already seems that the situation is already dire. Israel simply refuses to listen to any mention of a cease fire, and will continue to bomb southern Lebanon until Hezbolah is utterly destroyed.\n\n what has lebanon done about a army called hezbollah with in its borders that does not belong to them, infact who's army is it?\n \n \n \n The Michigan Malisha never got that fare\n \n in the U.S.A.",

That's a wash. \nThen obviously you agree with me that these non-military-weapons-producing countries have a right to purchase arms from whatever source they please. That's step one.\n \n All the Arab countries surrounding Israel have the right to defend themselves. What they do not have is the right to lob rockets into Israel, send suicide bombers into Israel, kill and maim people at random and then cry \"foul\" when Israel strikes back and whips their cowardly asses.\n \n As I said earlier, I think some of the blame for the constant turmoil should go to the Brits for making two conflicting promises back when they had control of the whole area of which we speak. And don't forget, Jordan was carved out of Palestine too, not just Israel. As a matter of fact, Jordan is quite larger than Israel in square miles. Why don't the Palestinians want a piece of Jordan?...I'll answer that for you...Jordan is not a hated Jewish state. The only thing driving the hatred of Israel is the hatred of the Jews who control it.\n \n \n\n The financial and geopolitical ramifications of the US helping Israel obtain its territorial objectives obviously mean nothing to you, so that's a dead issue for purposes of discussion. \nI have already ruled out financial concerns in the determination of the right to defend the country. I don't recall discussing geopolitical ramifications yet. I do realize that a lot of other countries disagree with the U.S. (that Israel needs help), several agree and many more don't really care or they are likely not even aware of what's happening. I also know that there are neanderthal, skinhead, teardrop-tattooed remnants of Nazism and other Jew-haters who would dearly love to see them ALL killed. I am really not in the least concerned about offending these sorts of people. \n \n \n \n\n As I've said, if Israel pulled back to the original, UN mandated borders and compensated (obviously with US money) its neighbors for damages less neighbor damage to Israel, then I'd recognize an attack on Israel as requiring the US coming to the defense of an ally with aid or military support. With Israel's territorial policies and continued devastation of neighbors for territorial gain, it should stand alone and face the retribution of those self-made enemies. \nNot that I agree completely with your wording here, but it appears you are saying Israel at this time has no right to defend itself but if they withdrew to the original lines , they would have the right. Is that what you are saying?\n \n I don't believe Israel has devastated any country for purposes of territorial gain. Only after being threatened with extinction has Israel struck first in war.\n \n You may be aware that Israel has on more than one occasion captured land when they were pushed into wars, then given that land back. If their maintaining of control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is required for continued higher level of security from random bomb and rocket attacks, then I say let them control those areas.\n \n You may recall that rocket attacks were made on Israel shortly after they \"gave back\" the Gaza Strip (recently) again. I think it makes no difference how much land they claim as part of Israel or as demilitarized buffer zones, the Arab nations surrounding them would still want their heads on pikes. They could withdraw to the original lines and give Lebanon and Jordan additional lands to call \"Palestine\" and there would still be rockets and bombs intimidating the Jews into another skirmish...which they would win hands down and then rightfully occupy the lands they took in the process of whipping XXX.\n \n \n\n I think we've agreed to disagree and there's no sense wasting bandwidth arguing about individual and combination definitions of pragmatism, idealism or imperialism and their application(s).\n...especially when we can't agree on what is right and what is wrong.\n \n I congratulate you for being gentlemanly in this discussion.",

   "What has actually happened here is that you got caught trying to pull the wool over our eyes with your made-up, exaggerated \"cost of our support for Israel\" while we were presenting arguments addressing the right of Israel to defend itself. This a typical tactic of tangiential diversion you often use. Having already established a respectable record here in discussions of economic issues, you hoped to sway readers away from support of Israel without addressing the real issue of whether they had a right to defend themselves.\n \n Your initial refusal to admit your trickery is evidenced in your posts immediately following my claim that you had no hard copy wherein you kept referring us to links that had no answers and no proof of the claim you had made. Regardless of the numbers involved, you were not addressing the main topic, merely trying to undermine any support Israel may have from the people having to pay the bill for it.\n\n \n LOL. I WAS WRONG. I mis cited a source. I have admitted my mistake in several differnt places here now. I was not trying to pull the wool over anybodies eyes. I simply made a mistake. #### happens. \n \n As far as your claim that I am trying to misdirect the conversation....were you high when you wrote this? Maybe you missed the entire debate (in which case your jibberish makes a little more sense). The point is that this is NOT self defense. It is just another militant action by israel designed to ensure perpetual warfare int eh region to ensure that aid from the US keeps rolling in and that their largest industry...their military, stays productive.\n \n That was the whole point of the comparison between Nazi Germany and Israeli economies. With the Nazis, as with Israel, there was very little to their economy besides military spending. Without it, they would have collapsed. The nazis funded and justified military expansion by invading and pludering other nations. Israel is not strong enough to do this, so they ensure perpetual warfare, which ensures a continous flow of foreign aid. \n \n \nRegardless of what number you come up with, the entire cost of turmoil in the ME and increased fuel costs cannot be classified as \"aid to Israel\" by any sane person. There is neither a need nor a benefit to our concurrence on the cost of support or the methods of calculating (miscalculating) that cost.\n\n \n Certainly not. BUT, costs directly associated with aid to isreal should certianly be counted, such as costs of the oil embargo, ongoing payments to Egypt and Jordan, debt service, etc....\n \n \nMy, how you pepper you analogy with inflammatory tidbits. I agree that most males would want to kill anyone that harmed a family member. My kin would not have to be killed for me to fight back, just hurt or molested...and it wouldn't have to be a soldier that did it. \n\n \n So, if somebody just hurt or molested a family member, you would feel justified in killing them, but when Israel hurts, molests, and kills, hundreds fo thousands of palestenians and arabs, their family members ar not allowed to strike back? There is some twisted logic for you.\n \n \nWhen you post some links to reputable sources that verify what you say, I will read them. Show me that Israel is outside the law any more so than suicide bombers and random rockets fired across their borders.\n\n \n I am a littl confused about what you are after here. You were unaware that it is a violation of international allow to attack other countries? COME ON, jim, pretending to be that stupid is beneath you.\n \n \nWhen your argument is backed up with something beside your arrogant, smug opinions, I will pay them quite a bit more attention than I do your usual fare. I am not obligated to nor would I waste my time chasing verification of meaningless numbers and opinionated blame distribution. Either post some links to articles decribing what you say is true (as I have done) or go back to playing your Jews harp.\n\n \n \n You mean like the link provided showing that the cost of US aid to israel is closer to $3 trillion that you still have not managed to refute.\n \n I admitted when I was wrong. Are you man enough to do the same?",

   "Do you honestly feel that historical possession of land ( from 2000 years ago ) is a legitamate claim on land today?\nNo. I do believe the 1948 lines drawn by the UN and agreed to by the world powers of the day should be the basis of sovereignty lines. Israel should have rights to maintain buffer zones (occupied areas) (demiliarized zones) in the areas from which it is easily and continually attacked. This is precisely the situation today. Israel has slightly more land than they were given in 1948...not because they wanted more land and went after it, but because they conquered attacking enemies who were using that land. \n \n \n\n Then how do you feel about Native American land claims, I would expect that you are then planning on moving out of the US to ensure that their historical land claims are respected\nI don't even believe in reparations for the slaves. I think I have said before that if we offer reparations to the decendents of slaves, we should give the Indians back what we stole from them. I'm not in favor of either.\n \n I don't believe in going backwards from demarcations changed by warfare or colonizations hundreds of years ago.\n \n Here's a hypothetical: If the government of Lebanon declared war on Israel and got their asses whipped (as most likely would happen), then Israel would have the right to include former Lebanon in its borders (i.e. take over the land forever.) If Hezballah (in Lebanon) declares war on Israel and loses, then Israel should not expect to own the land once they have killed the cowardly bastards.\n \n I think any lucid person should be able to see that Hezballah is the wicked one here and Lebanon is caught in the middle due to their own weak government. Israel doesn't deserve to keep any part of Lebanon when the fighting is over, but Lebanon should welcome Israel in to rid them of Hezballah. Lebanon should offer shelter to its civilians and inform Israel where Hezballah members hide. But, I am reminded that the government of Lebanon is weak and timid in this regard.",

   "LOL. I WAS WRONG. I mis cited a source. I have admitted my mistake in several differnt places here now. I was not trying to pull the wool over anybodies eyes. I simply made a mistake. #### happens. \nYou made a deliberate mistake and then tried to delay its discovery with some links that did not perform for you. I wasn't the only one to notice that. \n \n \n \n\n As far as your claim that I am trying to misdirect the conversation....were you high when you wrote this? Maybe you missed the entire debate (in which case your jibberish makes a little more sense). The point is that this is NOT self defense. It is just another militant action by israel designed to ensure perpetual warfare int eh region to ensure that aid from the US keeps rolling in and that their largest industry...their military, stays productive.\n \n That was the whole point of the comparison between Nazi Germany and Israeli economies. With the Nazis, as with Israel, there was very little to their economy besides military spending. Without it, they would have collapsed. The nazis funded and justified military expansion by invading and pludering other nations. Israel is not strong enough to do this, so they ensure perpetual warfare, which ensures a continous flow of foreign aid. \n \n \n \n Certainly not. BUT, costs directly associated with aid to isreal should certianly be counted, such as costs of the oil embargo, ongoing payments to Egypt and Jordan, debt service, etc....\n \n The question here is whether Israel has a right to defend itself. That right exists regardless of the cost. Your arguments regarding the excessive cost is nothing more than a sidetrack to undermine those who do support Israel.\n \n \n\n So, if somebody just hurt or molested a family member, you would feel justified in killing them, but when Israel hurts, molests, and kills, hundreds fo thousands of palestenians and arabs, their family members ar not allowed to strike back? There is some twisted logic for you.\nAgain, you have it backwards. Israel is not the aggressor. Israel is willing to live in peace. It's the Arab Jew Haters and others sworn to the destruction of Israel that continue to pick fights they cannot win. Innocent people die on both sides. They are targeted in Israel and they are used as human shields in Lebanon, as they were in Iraq.\n \n Israel is not the culprit.\n \n You can continue with your relentless \"last post wins\" XXXX all you want. The fact remains that you print lies, deceptions and your misguided version of the truth.\n \n \n \n\n I am a littl confused about what you are after here. You were unaware that it is a violation of international allow to attack other countries? COME ON, jim, pretending to be that stupid is beneath you.\nI don't know that it's against international law to retalliate against an attack (or a series of attacks) from a thug group hiding across the border.\n \n If we someday receive rocket fire from Hamas, Hezballah or any other fanatic group that infiltrates or is invited to Mexico to shoot across the Rio Grande, I would expect our military to enter (invade as you will say) Mexico and mop up with whatever weapons we choose, killing some civilians on the way because I know the gutless bastards will be hiding behind them. \n \n ...and I would expect you to come out the next day with some justification for the terrorists activities and condemnation of the US for retaliating. If you are not pretending to be stupid, then you really are stupid.\n \n \n You can take your sympathy and support for terrorists and stick it in your ear.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You mean like the link provided showing that the cost of US aid to israel is closer to $3 trillion that you still have not managed to refute.\n \n I admitted when I was wrong. Are you man enough to do the same?\nThat one link was refuted by myself and someone else (peteratwar, I think). I'll not go back and regurgitate what was said. Your biased source simply included 1.2 trillion dollars as aid to Israel when it was not.\n \n KIll emoticon_xkill all terrorists and those who support them.",

So, you keep spouting the same tired BS and making yourself look a little dumber with every post.\n\n \n \n \n http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570433/Six-Day_War.html\n In the years before the Six-Day War, the Arab countries continually refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Jewish state, and Arab nationalists led by Nasser called for the destruction of Israel. Egypt and Jordan supported Palestinian fedayeen (guerrillas), who attacked troops and civilians in Israeli territory, then retreated to the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip or the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. From its Golan Heights region, Syria regularly shelled Israeli farms. For its part, Israel refused to accept Jordan's control of Jewish holy places in East Jerusalem. Israel also kept tensions high by responding to Arab incursions with reprisals on Arab territory.\n In April 1967, after Syria heavily shelled Israeli villages from the Golan Heights, Israel and Syria engaged in aerial clashes. Israel shot down six of Syria's MiG fighter planes, which were given by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Israel warned Syria against future attacks, and both the Syrians and Soviets were alarmed by the warning. Syria appealed to Nasser for backing, and in mid-May the Egyptian army moved 100,000 troops and 1000 tanks into the Sinai Peninsula on Israel's southern border. The United Nations (UN) had earlier stationed forces in the area as observers, but on May 17, Nasser called for the removal of UN personnel from several locations. Within days, all of the observers were removed. On May 22 Nasser announced the closure of the Strait of Tiran, a vital shipping corridor for Israel with links to the Red Sea and major sources of petroleum. A similar closure of the strait had been a major cause of the Suez Crisis in 1956; Israel had made clear since then that it would regard another closure as an act of war. Israel was further alarmed when Egypt and Jordan signed a treaty placing the two armies under a joint command. Despite a flurry of diplomatic effort, war seemed inevitable.\n Because Israel feared fighting on three fronts (Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian), and because it preferred that fighting take place in Arab rather than Israeli territory, Israel decided to strike first. On the morning of June 5 the Israeli air force attacked Egypt, the largest force in the region. The timing of the attack, 8:45 AM, was designed to catch the maximum number of Egyptian aircraft on the ground and to come when the Egyptian high command was stuck in traffic between homes and military bases. The Israeli aircraft took evasive measures to elude Egyptian radar and approached from directions that were not anticipated. The surprise was complete. Within hours of the strike, the Israelis, who focused their attacks on military and air bases, had destroyed 309 of the 340 total combat aircraft belonging to the Egyptians. Israeli ground forces then moved into the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, where they fought Egyptian units. Egyptian casualties were heavy, but Israel suffered only minimal casualties.\n War was not far behind on Israel's eastern front. Israel had conveyed a message to King Hussein of Jordan asking him to stay out of the conflict, but on the first morning of the war Nasser called Hussein and encouraged him to fight. Nasser reportedly told Hussein that Egypt had been victorious in the morning's fighting-an illusion the Egyptian public believed for several days. At 11:00 AM Jordanian troops attacked the Israeli half of Jerusalem with mortars and gunfire and shelled targets in the Israeli interior. Israel's air force, having immobilized the Egyptian air force, turned its attention to Jordan. By evening, the Jordanian air force had been largely destroyed, again with minimal Israeli casualties. At midnight Israeli ground forces attacked Jordanian troops in Jerusalem, and by the morning of June 6, Israeli troops had nearly encircled the city.\n \n \n Read here for another matching opinion on the causes of the Six Day War\n http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/MidEast/03/herndon/herndon.htm\n \n \n \n Read here for a more accurate account of Johnson's part in the negotiations.\n http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/middleeast/Arab-Israeli_Conflict_3_Six_Day_War.asp\n \n \n Any sane person can see that Israel was NOT THE AGRESSOR!! They merely pre-empted the attack from Egypt whose president was hell-bent on Israel's complete destruction and had been massing his armies at their border.\n \n Israel struck first, fast and furiously, destroying the Egyptian Air Force in just a few hours. Had they not done so, they would not be here today.\n \n Israel had asked Jordan not to join the fight along with Egypt and Syria. Egypt had LIED to Jordan saying that they (Egypt) had won the air battle. Jordan attach Jerusalem and the fight with Jordan was on. Israel whipped their asses, too.\n \n In no way can Israel be painted as the aggressor in this ages old battle.

After so many iterations of similar words, you can appear to have been right in the first place.\n \n Here's what you said:\n \n \nConservative estimate put total cost of israeli aid at rougly $90 billion. The GAO issued a report in 2000 than showed that, including incurred liability and debt service costs, that number is closer to 1.2 trillion in real numbers. \n\n \n The fact is that multiple links have been presented that show aid to Israel at just over 90 billion (I think 93 in one report). No report shows that aid to Israel is anywhere near 1.2 trillion.\n \n There are reports showing that the cost to the U.S. for the crisis in the ME is in the trillions, but this is not aid to Israel. You just blame all the conflict in the ME on Israel and want to attach the cost of everything that happens there to our support of Israel.\n \n Nonetheless, as I said before, this has NOTHING AT ALL to do with the right of Israel to defend itself. They should be able to defend themselves regardless of costs.",

Had we not questioned the number and the source, you would never have admitted your \"mistake\".\n\n \n so I admitted my mistake after otehr pointed it out. Sounds pretty diabolical to me. Damn near lex luthor in its evil genius. When do you admit your mistakes in a debate? Before or after you make them? If I had known it was incorrect prior to using it, it woudl not have been a mistake.\n \n \nUnless you repost links that you claim substantiate your points, I will not pursue this discussion further. As I recall, you posted some meaningless links that still did not back up your as yet unproven claim. It was only after Gator pointed out the FACT that your links were just as bogus as your claim that you reluctantly said there was no GAO report published in 2000 saying that the aid to Israel exceeded a trillion dollars. The TOTAL U.S. aid to Israel does not appraoch a trillion dollars. I believe it has been established that the entire cost of the ME crisis since day one CANNOT be classified as aid to Israel.\n\n \n I have listed it FOUR TIMES in THIS thread.\n \n http://www.wrmea.com/archives/june2003/0306020.html\n \n Gator tried to refute it and did such a poor job,l and made himself look so stupid in doing so, that he has absconded. You have been around long enough to know that this is Gators MO, he shows up, says a bunch of stupid stuff, gets slapped down, and runs off for a few months. \n \n You are right, the total cost of the ME crisis cannot be attributed to the cost of US aid to israel. HOWEVER, the costs DIRECTLY CONNECTED to the US support of israel without a doubt belongs in the \"cost of aid\" column. \n \n \nI am not fascist. I may be ignorant of some things, but I am far from stupid. You on the other hand...\n\n \n That is true. I do not think you are stupid, just willfully ignorant when it comes to just about everything. You were wrong about nearly everything related to the Iraq war, anything related to the economy, you have absolutly NO CLUE regarding Carters foreign policy, the Israeli conflict, or any of a dozen other things that you seem to like to post about.\n \n It is not that you are stupid. It is another example of your Missouri Mule type thoguth process. You are not interested in fact or reality. You have your preconcieved notions, opinions, and emotional baggage, then you go out looking for justifcation for your views rather than doing it the other way around (the proper way), and discovering the facts BEFORE forming an opinion.\n \n You seem to depend on the laziness of most readers to go back and read what you actually said. After so many iterations of similar words, you can appear to have been right in the first place.\n \n \n \n \nThe fact is that multiple links have been presented that show aid to Israel at just over 90 billion (I think 93 in one report). No report shows that aid to Israel is anywhere near 1.2 trillion.\n\n \n Except fo the extremely troublesome one that I keep posting that nobody has managed to refute. \n \n You ar right, that is what I said. Since then, at least 5 times, I have said that I was WRONG.\n \n \nThere are reports showing that the cost to the U.S. for the crisis in the ME is in the trillions, but this is not aid to Israel. You just blame all the conflict in the ME on Israel and want to attach the cost of everything that happens there to our support of Israel.\n\n \n No, I don't. Nor does the author of the report I keep linking. He does not attach all the costs of our actions int he ME to israel, just the ones that are directly attributable to our support of israel. The only figure he includes that I would consider to be really questionable is the $80 billion attributed to the gulf war (gulf I). \n \n \nNonetheless, as I said before, this has NOTHING AT ALL to do with the right of Israel to defend itself. They should be able to defend themselves regardless of costs.\n\n \n And as I have said numerous times before, this is not about their right to defend themselves. The invasion of lebanon hs nothign to do with their right to defend themselves. It is just a way for them to perpetuate war so they can continue on as a nation based on military and charity. I am sure you will ignore it this time like you have all other times I have posted it so you can continue to spout your ignorance based BS as opposed ot actually having to address my points.",

Not according to a BBC report, and not even according to Secretary Beckett's own statements.\n \n If you wish to bluster on a petty issue, at least pay close attention to what the foreign secretary actually said.

Beckett told the press, \"We have already let the United States know that this is an issue that appears to be seriously at fault, and we will be making a formal protest if it appears that that is what has happened.\"\n \n In other words, her impatience got the better of her, and she publicly flew off the handle before having the benefit of the facts. Her subsequent failure to make a formal protest suggests that she couldn't substantiate what she initially believed had happened.\n \n As the BBC noted in the link above, a spokesperson for Prestwick Airport said, \"Since the Second World War Glasgow Prestwick Airport has provided logistical support for military flights moving troops and cargo. That support involves allowing crew to rest, refuelling aircraft and providing food and water. The airport is obliged to allow aircraft from any CAA-registered country to land here.\"\n \n It seems appropriate that the Scottish airport brouhaha is reminiscent of the words of the Scottish king, Macbeth: \"It is a tale ... full of sound and fury; signifying nothing.\"",

   "Jim said, \"The only thing driving the hatred of Israel is the hatred of the Jews who control it.\"\n \n And Jo replied sarcasticly, \nYeah, nothing to do with the fact that there is an entire people and their descendants who want their homes and their land back, from which they were forcibly evicted. Nothing to do with that at all, it's the evul hatin' arabs...\nThe euphemism--\"an entire people\"--no doubt refers to those Arabs who started to call themselves 'Palestinians' about five or six decades ago, after Palestinian Jews established Israel. The UN recommendation in 1947, the Partition Plan, didn't require anyone to move or give up their home or land. It called for Palestinian Jews and Palestinian Arabs to establish their own respective states west of the Jordan R. The Arabs refused to declare an independent state alongside the Jewish state, choosing instead to launch a war of annihilation to prevent Jews from reconstituting their national identity in their historic homeland. \n \n As a consequence of Arab attacks on Israel, the fighting displaced about 750,000 Arabs. About 5% of them were forcibly evicted; most simply fled the fighting and became refugees when they couldn't return home after the Arab defeat. Six decades later one of the predominant Arab demands, as highlighted by Jo, is that peace with Israel requires the Jewish state to commit demographic suicide by admitting millions of Arabs to Israel proper, rather than settling them in an independent Palestine.\n \n Israel is a product of the same historical process that produced the Arab states and Arab nationalism. The Arab denial to accept Israel's legitimacy as a manifestation of Jewish nationalism is the root cause of the ongoing conflict. The problem is further exacerbated by Israel's success in forging a liberal democracy, while Arab states flounder under dictatorship, monarchy, Baathist oligarchy, and theocracy.\n \n Where in the Arab world does one find consensual government with an independent judiciary? Instead, one finds tribalism, sexual oppression, religious intolerance, Islamic fundamentalism, a censored press, corruption, and so on, ensuring poverty and stagnation for the teeming millions who suffer under crass inequality, lamenting their loss of a once-splendid Arab culture that over the centuries regressed to its present dim reality.\n \n Hatred of Jews, as Jim observed and Jo discounted, appears today endemic to the Arab mindset. Allahu Akbar--God is Greater! Oh the indignity and humiliation that the Arabs suffer, all because a small Jewish minority in Palestine refused to succumb to an Arab aggression, the intent of which was to make the rebirth of Israel stillborn. Look at the state-controlled press in the Arab world today. Hatred of Jews is endemic to popular Arab culture. It's an open and unapologetic hate, unmatched on the world stage since the Nazi era. How many Arab generations will be lost to such intolerance and intransigence?",

   "The difference is that the palestinians evicted are still alive and can identify the precise houses and land that belonged to them. The Jewish claim is a general one based on ethnicity rather than individual evidence.\nWhy should the claim of Arab residents be any more valid than that of Jewish residents? The land was mostly in decline during four centuries of Ottoman rule. More than half a century before the rise of Herzl's modern Zionism, the Jerusalem census of 1844 shows that Jews were already a plurality in Jerusalem, outnumbering Muslims as well as Christians. \n \n In any event, low population numbers and depressed living conditions in 19th century Palestine is a moot point today. The Arabs chose war in 1947 and lost. Belligerence has its price to pay, as Germany also learned at the end of WW2. Look at a map of Germany in the 1930s, and compare it with the map of Germany today. Also consider the 15 million ethnic Germans who forcibly expelled from from their homes in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and other countries in Europe where their families had lived for centuries. The small Arab refugee problem in 1948 was minor in comparison to the roughly 40 million people displaced during the world war.\n \n How is it that within a few years of the aftermath of WW2, tens of millions of refugees could be absorbed and resettled in new homes, whereas the roughly 700,000 Arabs displaced in their war on the Jews cannot be settled and absorbed by their Arab brethren despite 60 years? The explanation of course is that the shame and suffering of the Arab refugees was intentionally maneuvered by Arab leaders who did not wish to solve the problem in a way that permitted Israel to exist.",

   "Do you honestly feel that historical possession of land ( from 2000 years ago ) is a legitamate claim on land today?\nIsrael's founding in 1948 wasn't dependent on their ancient kingdom or David's conquest of Jerusalem 3000 years ago. The basis of modern Israel's legitimacy is attested to in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, the May 14th statement that officially announced the Jewish state's founding on the day the British Mandate ended.\n \n References to the ancient kingdom serve to explain the Jewish attachment to the biblical Land of Israel. The spiritual, political, and cultural identity of the Jewish people began here millenia ago and was sustained during their exile. Woe to any people who would forget their historic origins and traditional attachments.\n \n In the pertinent matter of sovereignty and self-determination, the Declaration asserts the natural right of the Jewish people to be like other peoples, exercising self-determination in its sovereign state. This is based on a natural right and is not dependent on the decision of other states or international organizations.\n \n The Declaration also notes the international community's recognition of the right of the Jewish people to return to their country. This was explicitly expressed in the UN partition resolution.\n \n Full and equal citizenship was extended to the Arab inhabitants, and egalitarian principles such as freedom of religion, language, education, and culture was assured.",

   "What saddens me about this whole thing is the fact that people actually believe that if Israel gets out of the West Bank, the terrorism will stop. It's always a lose-lose situation for Israel-- if Israel stays, then Arabs can use that against Israel and claim that the occupation is the reason for the attacks. If Israel leaves, then the terrorists will be able to get even closer to major cities in Israel, and the Palestinians will demand more!\n \n It's important for people to understand that the Palestinians will NEVER EVER agree to a solution where Israel exists at all. What don't people understand about that????? The Hamas leaders-- they say it openly, they don't hide it, they don't deny it. They want all the Jews in Israel to disappear and if you don't think that it is possible for that to happen, it is VERY possible that it will happen, if Israel isn't allowed to respond to terrorist attacks.\n \n So what do you want Israel to do? Use \"proportionate force\"? Withdraw from the West Bank? These options will both result in ethnic and national suicide. Well maybe the wall will help... but I've heard that some people are against that. :xbanghead",

   "I am going to go the lazy route and just wikipedia this...\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War\n \n So, yep, johnson cut a deal with the egyptians and the Isrealis stabbed htem int eh back, screwed the deal, and attacked egypt.\nYou're right about one thing... you took the lazy route, which may explain your misunderstanding of your source. Look again at Wikipedia:\n \n 1. First, no statement in your entire excerpt is corroborated with any references. Perhaps it's credible, perhaps not. All we know is that an anonymous writer added his personal assessment without attribution. Wikipedia's official policy on verifiability states that viewpoints may only be included if they have already been published in a reputable source, and the source should be cited whenever possible. Your Wikipedia link includes 33 citations, but none of them apply to your paragraph. Here's the Wikipedia Guide to Citing Sources. Do a service for Wikipedia and cite a source for the paragraph that you so readily accept as gospel.\n \n 2. Even if we assume that the paragraph is accurate, your paraphrase is a gross distortion and intellectually dishonest. The Wikipedia article states, \"The Johnson Administration received guarantees from Egypt that it would not strike first.\" Yet you assert, \"Johnson cut a deal with the Egyptians.\" Wikipedia doesn't mention 'a deal,' but on the contrary says that while the U.S. was attempting to \"hold the Israeli tiger,\" Nasser ignored for 11 days the request for diplomatic discussions. It was not until May 30 that Nasser finally responded to Johnson's request and agreed to send his Vice President to Washington to explore a diplomatic settlement.\n \n 3. You misconstrue your own reference when you argue that Johnson cut a deal with Egypt. Wikipedia states clearly that the Egyptian VP did not even plan to arrive in Washington before June 7, yet you claim a deal had already been made. In truth, Nasser never relented on lifting the Straits of Tiran blockade. He also disregarded Johnson's request that he urgently send a representative for discussions.\n \n 4. How much trust was warranted by Nasser's \"guarantees\"? The drift to war was preceded by months of escalating tension and even attacks. For example Syria, who had a military alliance with Egypt, could and did target Israeli villages from the Golan Heights. In early April full-scale aerial battles erupted over the Golan after Syria fired on Israeli tractors doing agricultural work. Nasser had promised U Thant that he wouldn't attack Israel, but still the Egyptian leader demanUded on May 17 that the UN Secretary-General remove UN troops from Gaza. U Thant surprised Egypt by ordering UN troops to leave Sinai as well as Gaza. \n \n 5. Nasser moved his armies up to Israel's border and controlled Sharm-el-Sheikh. Once again he couldn't resist the temptation to blockade Israel's access to the Red Sea. The waterway was closed to Israeli shipping on May 23. The Israeli cabinet had decided to launch a pre-emptive strike if the Straits of Tiran were not reopened in 2 days. The U.S. asked Israel to stand down, despite Nasser's action being a casus belli. The U.S. had guaranteed in 1956 that the straits would remain open in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Sinai. \n \n 6. While Nasser kept Johnson on hold, the U.S. tried but failed to mobilize the European powers to help quell the waterway crisis. Meanwhile, Israel's ability was limited in how long it could maintain its army fully mobilized, yet it informed the U.S. it would allow two weeks to work out a diplomatic solution before Israel would use force to open the straits.\n \n \n Next time Wikipedia (or another reference) is used to make your point, take care you don't debunk your argument or undermine your credibility by resorting to fraudulent paraphrase.",

   "Except for the extremely troublesome one that I keep posting that nobody has managed to refute.\nStauffer's paper is only troublesome for you, since you haven't reconciled the huge disparity between the numbers conjured up by Stauffer and the widely accepted aid figures presented in all your other references.\n \n What's so hard to understand? You and Georged both presented at least three different documented sources that all corroborate one another and attest to the fact that cumulative U.S. aid to Israel is less than $100 billion. \n \n Thus, your sources alone are more than sufficient to refute Stauffer's lecture, the odd duck among the bunch. \n \n If you haven't figured why Stauffer is far out of sync with your other sources--his total is 20 times higher--it's because Stauffer's analysis doesn't rest on 'facts' as you seem to think, but rather on personal, subjective, and arbitrary opinion. The belligerent Arab leadership initiated the conflict, so Stauffer's methodology to lay all costs at the feet of Israel is totally arbitrary. It's more rational to lay all costs at the feet of those who chose war in breach of the UN Charter.\n \n You can close or avert your eyes as if no one can refute Stauffer, but the fact remains that all of your other sources stand as a refutation of his assumptions and opinions, so give it a rest that you and Stauffer may everyone look stupid.",
