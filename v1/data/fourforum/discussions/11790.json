   "It seems the level of Debate on this Elections section forum is very poor. \n \n As an interested outsider of the Presidential election I would love to see a proper debate on the policies of both candidates but instead of this we see threads on the following\n \n You got to wonder about Obama - A thread about Hamas supporting Obama\n Elimination of Dissent - Obama supporters boo and jeer McCain supporters\n Troopergate keeps hurting - Another thread on the Palin scandal\n Pilate was a governor, Jesus a community organiser - A thread comparing Obama to Jesus\n \n These threads are from both right and left of American politics, and they don't actually address any of the issues that matter in the election. \n \n Now I am not trying to say this is wrong but it brings up an interesting issue about this election. Are these thread just a reflection of the level of debate on this forum? Or is an indication of the general level debate in the US today?",
