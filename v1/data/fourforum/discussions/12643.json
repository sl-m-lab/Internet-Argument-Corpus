   "Found this here - thought it was interesting: Survey: Support for terror suspect torture differs among the faithful - CNN.com\n \n \nThe more often Americans go to church, the more likely they are to support the torture of suspected terrorists, according to a new survey.\n \n More than half of people who attend services at least once a week -- 54 percent -- said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is \"often\" or \"sometimes\" justified. Only 42 percent of people who \"seldom or never\" go to services agreed, according the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.\n \n White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified -- more than six in 10 supported it. People unaffiliated with any religious organization were least likely to back it. Only four in 10 of them did.\n \n The analysis is based on a Pew Research Center survey of 742 American adults conducted April 14-21. It did not include analysis of groups other than white evangelicals, white non-Hispanic Catholics, white mainline Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated, because the sample size was too small. \n \n The president of the National Association of Evangelicals, Leith Anderson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n The survey asked: \"Do you think the use of torture against suspected terrorists in order to gain important information can often be justified, sometimes be justified, rarely be justified, or never be justified?\"\n \n Roughly half of all respondents -- 49 percent -- said it is often or sometimes justified. A quarter said it never is.\n \n The religious group most likely to say torture is never justified was Protestant denominations -- such as Episcopalians, Lutherans and Presbyterians -- categorized as \"mainline\" Protestants, in contrast to evangelicals. Just over three in 10 of them said torture is never justified. A quarter of the religiously unaffiliated said the same, compared with two in 10 white non-Hispanic Catholics and one in eight evangelicals.\n \n\n \n I'm personally a Lutheran so I guess I'm one of those three in ten that says it is never justified.\n \n Just hought this would be an interesting study for everyone to see.",

That was Buddha's great search (I think his birthday was yesterday?). Why do people suffer? How can people be relieved of suffering? The cross can be seen allegorically, along the lines of the Buddhist view that all of life is suffering -- or, torture .... the eight-fold path to be free of all suffering - or, torture ... as Christians seek a life whereby they will, like the Buddhists, be relieved of torture and suffering in a hereafter called \"heaven\".\n \n The Bodhisattva frees himself of earthly suffering, but like the Christian Jesus, chooses to engage in life on earth for the sake of humanity, and out of compassion for their suffering.\n \n So these are common themes that can be seen across faiths.",

The cause of suffering, according to Buddha, is desire. But he is not just talking about desire, like desiring some delicious food. Or, as in consumerism, desire for a 3rd car and a 2nd home and lots of clothing that sits in the closet. Desire, in this case, means \"attachment\", and applies even more broadly.

That Jesus of Nazareth was a Boddhisatva. One who had freed themselves from the karmic cycle of death and birth, but instead of heading off to Nirvana, like some Buddhas or \"realized beings\" do, had chosen to engage in worldly -- out of compassion for human beings -- to help them, in kind, free themselves, too.
