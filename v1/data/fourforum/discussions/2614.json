Yours thoughts would be appreciated. Blessings, Bert\n \n So in answer to your post is: Yep! and I will say that since God is in control, and as he have said unto Samuel in I Samuel 8:4-\"7-22\"-9:-10:1-25-27.\n \n Now as it is today in these End-Times and all these things going on as what you have mention in the above within your post, I can clearly see, out! , but still looking in, at an spiritual insight that I would say that God is still working out his plan of salvation, \n \n and that he/Jesus Christ/the Messiah Saviour is the one that set up what he has allowed to come to pass inwhich Prophecy would be the answer to this election,\n \n maybe also that since it would be a time for everything, so what do anyone would think spiritually about the time of Jacob Troubles instead of one against another or Republican against Democratic, but as it is today/power to have ones way/power struggle/government controls etc. \n \n Also that it is too many people now! are having their own way as for as some form of lust is concerned, weather hid or think that it's going to be forgotten about, but God has thier number, as others know this factor also, though as people think in their heart,\n \n but as for as this election goes, well! , it will take it own course, so please be aware of it's power. I Cor. 1:10 \" Perfectly Joined Together\" , this we \"feel is what this nation is in great need of\" , whether democratic or republican, but for a nation under God Psalms 91:1-16, II Cor. 7:14, togetherness we stand but divided we fall.\n \n nevertheless for as the scriptures goes! vengeance belongeth to the Lord Deut. 32:35, Acts 28:4.\n \n ------------------\n Walter, Jr. http://www.firstthings1st.com \n \n [This message has been edited by firstthings1st (edited 08-29-2004).]\n \n [This message has been edited by firstthings1st (edited 08-30-2004).]\n \n [This message has been edited by firstthings1st (edited 08-31-2004).]\n \n love you all Fr: Walter, Jr. \n \n http://www.firstthings1st.com",
