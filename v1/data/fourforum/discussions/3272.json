   "We have a good number of discussions about the detail of various sciences relating to the description we have of evolution and the natural world.\n \n Much time and effort is devoted to discussing whether there actually are transitional fossils, the plausibility of radiometric dating methods and so on. This is all very engaging debate, but often the focus is on the defense of evolution etc, without really getting at why the whole issue is so contentous.\n \n Now, I stumbled across this web page:\n \n 17 Evidences against evolution \n \n Which I rather liked in a funny sort of way. Not for the usual \"evidence against evolution\" baloney so often advocated by such articles, but for the fact the author actually stated what the creationist objection is actually about.\n \n \n\n 17. THE BIBLE\n Lastly, and most importantly, the Bible says that God created the universe and every living thing, so the world must have been created. In denying this we call God a liar. And so you can see how evolution theory undermines the omniscience and even the existence of God. And if there is no God, why not do our own thing? Or if God is not all-knowing, indeed, a liar, why put our trust in Him? Evolution theory logically leads to these humanistic ideas. Christians must take a stand for the Word of God, or be accountable on that judgment day for the souls of those whom we did not warn.\n\n \n So thanks to this candid statement we can throw the usual nit-picking of the science points 1-16 out the window and get the crux of the issue.\n \n Creationists cannot tolerate humanism. Attacking evolution is a good way of attacking humanism or anything that takes our minds outside of the boundaries of a literal reading (and interpretation) of the Bible.\n \n Now thats nice and succinct. Would any creationists care to comment on why they are not upfront on this fundemental issue more often? Why is \"humanism\" so problematic?\n \n Other comments are most welcome of course.",

   "To OccamsRazor:\n I'll cut to the chase. The reason why creationists object to evolutionism is because it goes against the Authorative Word of God, the Bible. It is also true that evolutionism justifies atheism and humanism. Those who are atheists and humaninsts will believe blindly in their religion regardless of what the evidence says. Evolutionism does not stem from either science, nor the Bible. It is a naturalistic belief system [or religion] about the past, i.e. how everything here today - which we call the evidence - came to be. A few evolutionists have said, \"Destroy Adam and the original sin [i.e. a literal Genesis] and in the rubble you will find the sorry remains of the Son of God\". Many Christians do not understand that if we lose Genesis, we lose the Gospels too - what did Jesus die for? What did sin do to the world and so on. There are many such problems for a compromised Christian. A building will collapse if it loses it's foundation - likewise, Christianity will collapse if we compromise Genesis with man's fallilbe [religious] beliefs (i.e. evolutionism). \n \n And lampornis, shut up <in a joking manner only - not offensively<. I didn't read all the points, just a few. The first point obviously hasn't been updated since the new evidence was found. From my knowledge, most of what I read appears to be accurate. Also, the article appears to be pretty old, mainly because of the age of the references used - they date back to the mid 1980's so some of the evidence may have changed since then - which is understandable.",

   "Thankyou for a response in the spirit of the candour of point 17 Nu Leader. I have some points for consideration:\n \n \nTo OccamsRazor:\n I'll cut to the chase. The reason why creationists object to evolutionism is because it goes against the Authorative Word of God, the Bible.\n\n \n Okay, so if you are a Christian who sees the story of Genesis as a literal history then this is a serious objection. Then again, I doubt you take everything in the Bible in such a context. But I can see the point that Genesis is the begining of the Bible and that there is a certain security in reality being as written there. However, is your faith not strong enough to acknowledge that the Bible is not to be taken literally? If you want to say it is an absolute truth, and this is the only way the Bible can be read thats fine, but we will then examine just how you feel on some of the things it says. \n \n \nIt is also true that evolutionism justifies atheism and humanism. Those who are atheists and humaninsts will believe blindly in their religion regardless of what the evidence says.\n\n \n Evolution is not a religion- its a science. That topic has been dealt with in detail on this board recently. Same applies for atheism. We could argue semantics over the terms ad infinitum but they are not comparable in meaning or characterisitcs to spiritual religions such as Christianity, Islam, Judasim and so on. With regard to your evidence comment, that sounds like you are refering to the Bible. By default, and athesit won't accept such evidence, and a humanist, well you have an odd perception. Some christians are distinctly humanistic IMO.\n \n \nEvolutionism does not stem from either science, nor the Bible. It is a naturalistic belief system [or religion] about the past, i.e. how everything here today - which we call the evidence - came to be.\n\n \n So what does evolution stem from then? did Darwin find an annoymous manuscript in his study one day entitled \"The Origin of the Species\" that had appeared out of nowhere? Lets not try to paint up some new faces for paganism ;) \n \n \nA few evolutionists have said, \"Destroy Adam and the original sin [i.e. a literal Genesis] and in the rubble you will find the sorry remains of the Son of God\".\n\n \n Maybe they did.... they would not be the first people to speak out against religion in general and Christianity in particular. Perhaps you could cite who said such things so we could consider such comments in the context that they were made.\n \n \n beliefs (i.e. evolutionism). \n \n\n \n You saved the best till last. You rather neatly point out there are some tricky positions for a Christian who chooses to have religious belief and an understanding and acceptance of science that can be seen to be at odds with Genesis. Still Christians do hold such viewpoints, and even thrive on them:\n \n http://www.berea.edu/SpecialProject/scienceandfaith/essay05.asp \n \n Which brings up the whole issue of how do you respond to a Christian Evolutionist? heck, they might even have a humanistic outlook on life as well.\n \n \n I digress though. The fundemental objection by Creationists (particulary of he Young Earth school of thought) to evolution is based upon moral issues- the percieved undermining of the word of the Bible. This is where my main bone of contention lies. Why do Creationists consistently resort to attacking science on its own terms, ie. arguing that dinosaurs were alive a few thousands years ago and so on. The detail does not matter at all....... science could say the earth is 2000 years old and the objection would be the same. Based on this fact why bother with the mock-science at all? you don't believe it, it is just a tool you have created because you are unable to articulate the real message of your objection. How on earth do you expect anyone else to take it seriously?\n \n \n P.S. I hope Montalban will ignore lampornis's unhelpful remark as I'd like to hear what he has to say on this issue.",

   "One that stuck out to me:\n \n In attempting to dismiss Archeopterix as a \"transitional form\" they list various misleading \"reasons.\"\n \n \n 3. It had teeth.\n \n Modern birds do not have teeth but many ancient birds did, particularly those in the Mesozoic. There is no suggestion that these birds were transitional. The teeth do not show the connection of Archeopteryx with any other animal since every subclass of vertebrates has some with teeth and some without.\n\n \n When was this Mesozoic period?\n \n AND:\n \n\n 6. It predates the general arrival of birds by millions of years.\n \n This also has been refuted by recent paleontological discoveries. In 1977 a geologist from Brigham Young University, James A. Jensen, discovered in the Dry Mesa quarry of the Morrison formation in western Colorado a fossil of an unequivocal bird in Lower Jurassic rock.\n \n This deposit is dated as 60-million years older than the Upper Jurassic rock in which Archeopteryx was found. He first found the rear-leg femur and, later, the remainder of the skeleton.\n \n This was reported in Science News 24 September 1977. Professor John Ostrom commented, \"It is obvious we must now look for the ancestors of flying birds in a period of time much older than that in which Archeopteryx lived.\"\n\n \n Yes, now we have been having to push back the date of the arrival of birds (as well as mammals). This still doesn't say anything about Archeopterix being \"transitional\" which is a subjective term in this case, anyway. I'd still like to know when the 60-million years fit into the Young Earth Model's Jurassic and Mesozoic periods.\n \n Their example of number 10 is really just dishonest.\n 10. HOMOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\n \n They pick a couple of enzymes and show that there is significant difference between one species' and certain handpicked others that are quite different. If they were to take a \"tree of life\" type diagram and plot the differences in many common enzymes (why are they common in the first place?) they would see minimal differences from genus to genus, and even family to family. They would also be surprised to see some VERY conserved genes/enzymes, \n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=npg&cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=7498786&dopt=Abstract\n http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/biology/units/genom/experts/eisen.html\n \nAgain, betaglobin in humans is very similar to betaglobin in mice and over evolutionary time, many genes are kept similar to each other even as the species diverge. In particular, [the most conserved genes are the ones] that are involved in the core functions of an organism replicating the DNA, transcribing the DNA into RNA, making the RNA into proteins, or repairing the DNA.\n\n http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=18300\n \nWe have cloned a human cDNA that is related to the RNA polymerase I transcription factor Rrn3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant human protein displays both sequence similarity and immunological crossreactivity to yeast Rrn3 and is capable of rescuing a yeast strain carrying a disruption of the RRN3 gene in vivo. Point mutation of an amino acid that is conserved between the yeast and human proteins compromises the function of each factor, confirming that the observed sequence similarity is functionally significant. Rrn3 is the first RNA polymerase I-specific transcription factor shown to be functionally conserved between yeast and mammals, suggesting that at least one mechanism that regulates ribosomal RNA synthesis is conserved among eukaryotes.\n\n \n \n \n All the rest have been easily refuted a hundred times.",

   "Those everyday conservative Christians I know who oppose (what they call) 'evolution' and advocate 'Young earth Creationism' do so, tendentially, for various of the following reasons...\n \n 1....They possess limited hermeneutic skill\n \n 2....They possess limited interest in improving their hermeneutic skill\n \n 3....They lack a robust grasp of metaphor, and of the pervasively metaphoric nature of language\n \n 4....They do not read literature, and surprisingly often oppose the reading of literature; they thus read scripture with the same skill set they bring to reading the phone book \n \n 5....They largely have not studied geology, archaeology, palaeontology, astronomy, anthropology et al, and would rather not have to do all this book-learnin', preferring instead to rely for their education in these disciplines upon the once-annual sermon of a preacher similarly schooled, and who garners his sermon notes from the Institute for Creation Research website\n \n 6....They need a geology which gives them an earth not much older than we humans are, and won't last much longer than now--this saves so much intellectual effort\n \n 7....They need a biology which gives them life that is unchanging, and not subject to dynamic forces neither described in scripture nor conveniently graspable, given their willingness to exert intellectual effort [see 5, above]\n \n 8....They need a history which is completely circumscribed by explicit scripture, thus avoiding the need to consider cultures beyond our own immediate one and those described in scripture\n \n 9....They need a universe which is functionally, relevantly small, which embraces neither vast (relevant) distance nor the possibility of other intelligent life; note that the conservative Christian argument against the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has moved, now that SETI is no longer government-funded, from the notion that it is not important that we do SETI to the notion that it is important that we not do SETI\n \n 10...They need a scripture capable of a flat, largely demetaphorized reading, free of the richness of fully self-aware parable, legend and myth, so that the (not coincidentally principally middleclass caucasian male) purveyors of Young Earth Creationism can cleave to their brittle, reductivist readings of scripture, and hence to the power they wield, which power arises from a singularly male and anthropomorphic construction of God.\n \n Summary: Young Earth Creationists cling to their views, I believe, in significant part out of a kind of fear, and out of a deep-seated need for a universe and a God made managably small for man.",

And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.\n \n This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth. While this helps to create a powerful system of belief, it can put it in an awkward position when new discovery is made. The nature of peolpe seems to be the same conflicts have arisen again and again- with just the point of contention changing.\n\n in your final paragraph here, you hit the nail on the head. it is completely imperative for any religion to presume the position of absolute truth, especially God-based religions. God himself is the essence of absolute, and anything declared by God must be so, since its God himself that declared it. there is no room for guessing or error concerning the things of God. this is also the reason why faith plays such an important part in religion. faith is literally accepting something as absolutely true, in the absence of supporting evidence, or even in the face of contradicting evidence. because of this, it is not surprise that God-based religious faith will always esteem what the bible says above what science presents.\n \n in the case of creationism, where it directly clashes with evolutionism, to surrender genesis means compromising an established absolute. if this absolute is compromised, it is no longer absolute, since an absolute must be true in every circumstance and in every aspect. if the bible loses absolute status, then it completely falls apart. its like all or nothing\n \n by the way, i never heard of the navel debate. very interesting...",

Fact: Matter and life are all around us in the observable, physical world. Fact: If there is an unseen God that created all of this, then that God created it. Reasonable conclusion: The bible tells us allegorically that God created everything, so if we are going to believe there is a God, then we can believe that God created everything.\n \n 2) At some point in the history of humanity, humanity fell away from God's grace by doing something that God asked humanity not to do. The actions of humanity have necessarily removed humanity from their previous innocent state.\n \n 3) Man can easily 'talk' to God through prayer. If man is open to receiving a response and listens, then man can 'hear' God talking to him through various channels -- including visions, dreams, slow realization, sudden epiphanies, etc.\n \n 4) Sure. God set everything into motion and created everything in His own time. The author of Genesis put the actual history of creation into an allegorical story.\n \n 5) Sure. With the 'proper' interpretation, though. \n \n 6) Sure. If God wants, God can calm storms, etc. The Bible says that Jesus did this. Have you ever had any 'close-calls'? These can certainly be interpreted as God intervening to save you from pain or death if the close-call had been just a little bit closer.\n \n 7) What is the state of humanity as we know it? God created us. Where we are now is a factor of our own actions or inactions. Through faith, we can ask God to intervene for us and save us from ourselves.\n \n 8) Sure! Everybody has an innate sense of something 'greater' than us. Even if we cannot see God, we can feel His presence if we allow ourselves to.\n \n \n Now from a perspective of a non-literal non-Christian interpretation of Genesis:\n 1) Define God. The only evidence for this God is in the minds of individuals.\n 2) Man isn't sinful, but only perceived to be.\n 3) See #1. Individuals can certainly perceived themselves to be in communication with God.\n 4) See #1.\n 5) The bible may contain some tidbits of sound advice for living with others. And it may contain some pieces of historical information. But it is certainly not accurate as a realistic history book.\n 6) There is no physical evidence of any such thing.\n 7) See #1. Humans invented God. This invented God will have as much of an impact as humans will allow this God to have in their individual lives. When many individuals hold similar beliefs about this God, they may have an impact on the world around them. This impact may be perceived to be 'good' or 'bad' depending on the perspective of the observer.\n 8) See #1. There is no physical evidence of such a God. However, it is certainly conceivable that such a God exists.",

Its fair to say that to the stakes are much higher with evolution/old earth and young earth creationism to those who take Genesis as literal history.\n \n Now, thebootfitter has brought up point to consider- is it correct to read 6x24 hour day creation from Genesis at all? is this a \"literal\" interpretation of what is actually written, or is the meaning less clear cut than it is often presented?\n \n Now, I had a quick google and found some interesting Christian viewpoints on the \"certainty\" of the young earth creation story. The reason being is its easy to fall into the typical position of viewing Genesis as a \"young earth only\" story. I found these sites particularly engaging as they approach this issue through an examination of what is written in the Bible and come to conclusion that young earth view is not the only one the Bible can support:\n \n http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/youngearth.html\n \n http://www.wcg.org/lit/bible/OT/sixday.htm\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_bibl.htm\n \n I'm also interested in the origins of the modern young earth creation view. Genesis has been interpreted differently throughout history. Some scholars of the second century AD viewed the days of creation as ages lasting thousands of years. It is perhaps ironic that the return to scripture, or direct reading of the Bible, as opposed to the acceptance of the interpretations of others, that began in the 16th century (which seems to be a catalyst to the formation of creationism) occured at roughly the same time that the foundations of modern scientific thinking were being laid.\n \n So just where did the young earth creation line of thinking originate?",

   "unkerpaulie: Thats a good point about how \"fundemental\" the part of the Bible which relates to geocentrism is compared to creation in Genesis. Its fair to say that to the stakes are much higher with evolution/old earth and young earth creationism to those who take Genesis as literal history.\n \n Now, thebootfitter has brought up point to consider- is it correct to read 6x24 hour day creation from Genesis at all? is this a \"literal\" interpretation of what is actually written, or is the meaning less clear cut than it is often presented?\n\n if you take what genesis says at face value, then it is quite clear that each \"day\" is just as long as a regular day in our time (i.e., from sunset to following sunset, 24 hours). when we take genesis in the context of evidence outside the bible, then thats the only time we question the length of these days. lets exclude everything thats not biblical, and be practiclly oblivious to whatever other information there is. in the purest literal translation, we can take genesis to mean that God actually created order and life, as well as established all the physical and ecological principles on the planet within 6 days (which is what genesis 1 actually says).\n \n whether this is accurate or not is not the issue, just whether it is what it says it is. if we honestly and unbiasly look at what genesis 1 says, then the meaning of \"day\", evening\", \"morning\", etc is simple to grasp\n \n \nNow, I had a quick google and found some interesting Christian viewpoints on the \"certainty\" of the young earth creation story. The reason being is its easy to fall into the typical position of viewing Genesis as a \"young earth only\" story. I found these sites particularly engaging as they approach this issue through an examination of what is written in the Bible and come to conclusion that young earth view is not the only one the Bible can support:\n \n http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/youngearth.html\n \n http://www.wcg.org/lit/bible/OT/sixday.htm\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_bibl.htm\n \n I'm also interested in the origins of the modern young earth creation view. Genesis has been interpreted differently throughout history. Some scholars of the second century AD viewed the days of creation as ages lasting thousands of years. It is perhaps ironic that the return to scripture, or direct reading of the Bible, as opposed to the acceptance of the interpretations of others, that began in the 16th century (which seems to be a catalyst to the formation of creationism) occured at roughly the same time that the foundations of modern scientific thinking were being laid.\n \n So just where did the young earth creation line of thinking originate?\n\n as far as i know, the idea of a 6000 year old human race was always familiar to me. i actually thought the \"metaphorical\" or \"differently interpreted\" versions came after, so i cant answer that\n \n now for the differences in religious interpretations, i'm familiar with the fact that the different types of churches and schools of thought take the biblical accounts differently. in all your links, the articles \n 1. show what the literal meaning of the genesis account is\n 2. point out that it doesnt coincide with contemporay logic\n 3. offers what others think the genesis account SHOULD be\n \n while i agree with the literal interpretation of genesis, and i agree that it obviously flies in the face of logic and evidence, the various \"should be\" explanations is where the whole thing gets messy, and where i dont even attempt to go. my take on it is either take it as it is, or dont take it at all. i have a serious contention with the attempts to reroute and twist the meaning of the bible to fit non-biblical sources.",

Suffice to say, the conflict between the view of science and creation is an issue of whether one sees a historical account in Genesis or a story that alludes a \"general\" meaning. I also note that at this point the arguement about deception could be brought up- if Genesis was a parable, why is it written as such? well I'd also ask how can we humans come to the conclusion that the earth (that God created) is 4.6 billion years old?\n \n \n However, I now want to summarise a set of points which address the question this topic posed based on the discussions we have so far had.\n \n What are the real reasons creationists object to evolution?\n \n 1. Young earth creationists see the Bible as the absolute truth of Christianity, and that to hold any meaning at all it must be read literally. To move away from such a notion is, in their eyes, to compromise and ultimately destroy their faith.\n \n 2. A literal interpretation of Genesis produces a chronology that is very different (by 6 orders of magnitude to put it scientificly) than that derived from an analysis of the physical evidences we have.\n \n 3. Like the age of the earth, evolution is based on the analysis of the physical. It cannot measure the \"God Factor\" so it does not attempt too. However, this is seen by young earth creationists as the exclusion of God, and they have no capacity to reconcile an essentially neutral point of view with their absolute truth derived from Bible.\n \n 4. A Christian who considers evolution and the old earth has to (or is forced to) answer some potentially difficult questions with regard to their belief. In the case of the young earth creationists, these issues are dealt with by saying they are false ideas (ie not part of the Bible, see point 1) and so do not need to be answered at all. In addition, literal Genesis is a much more straightforward way of answering the question of \"how I got here\" than anything science can ever offer.\n \n \n And a final observation on the general nature of religion in peoples minds- it is resistant to change and tends towards a static frame of mind. This is a very different to the type of thinking that has driven the scientific exploration of our surroundings which relys on innovative and adaptive thinking.",

As his Protestant biographer, von Gebler, tells us, \"One glance at the truest historical source for the famous trial, would convince any one that Galileo spent altogether twenty-two days in the buildings of the Holy Office (i.e. the Inquisition), and even then not in a prison cell with barred windows, but in the handsome and commodious apartment of an official of the Inquisition.\" For the rest, he was allowed to use as his places of confinement the houses of friends, always comfortable and usually luxurious. It is wholly untrue that he was... either tortured or blinded by his persecutors -- though in 1637, five years before his death, he became totally blind -- or that he was refused burial in consecrated ground. On the contrary, although the pope (Urban VIII) did not allow a monument to be erected over his tomb, he sent his special blessing to the dying man, who was interred not only in consecrated ground, but within the church of Santa Croce at Florence.\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06342b.htm",

   "It can be argued that Bruno was not punished for his support of Copernicanism but for his theological views, particularly those relating to Christ.\n \n Whatever the reason, he was subjected to a most unpleasant torture and execution for what he did say and for refusing to retract it. \n\n The reason is all important. If you are sent to prison and you're innocent, then the reason for your punishment is very important. Here Close_slave_can stated that the Church punished him for a certain 'crime'. This may just be a lot of anti-Catholic hooey.\n \nIf Galileo had followed suit and not recanted we could reasonably suppose he would have met a similar end to Bruno, but for saying the earth orbited the sun.\n \n Whatever the reason, the Catholic Church has since expressed great regret in its treatment of Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei.\n\n For the most part the following is from a post on the thread \"Grudgingly conceding some points\" #297\n \n ?Russell says the flat earth mythology flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over evolution. He says the flat-earth myth was an ideal way to dismiss the ideas of a religious past in the name of modern science.?\n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html\n \n Most educated people before the Reformation were in the Church, or had been educated by the Church.\n \n Thales of Miletus (http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classe...res/thales.html) is one educated person who, also being probably Greek (Miletus then a city linked to Greece) believed in a flat-earth.\n \n Thales of Miletus (c. 585 BCE): Eclipses and Stellar Studies \n Our sources for all early Greek astronomy are scant, none more so than for Thales, supposedly the first of the philosophers. Various inventions and discoveries are attributed to him, most famous of which is his prediction of an eclipse of 585 (Hdt. 1.74). Modern scholars are fairly sure he was able to do this by consulting known Babylonian eclipse and lunar observations going back about 150 years, long enough to notice that eclipses recur after about 18 years[6]. His activities also seem to have included star-observations and trigonometry, which he is credited with having founded, but the details of his theories are either lost or obscured by later legends about this early thinker who left no written record. He seems to have conceived of earth as flat and water-borne, and to have postulated that there must have been some first substance out of which the world arose, which he guesses is water (Aristot. Met. 983b 6)[7]. \n http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekS...kAstronomy.html\n \n The above site also lists:\n Anaximines of Miletus (c. 525 BCE)\n \n Thus scientists supported a flat-earth.\n \n And what about in the Christian era?\n ?Lactantius\n The earliest of these flat-Earth promoters was the African Lactantius (AD 245?325), a professional rhetorician who converted to Christianity mid-life.\n He rejected all the Greek philosophers, and in doing so also rejected a spherical Earth. His views were considered heresy by the Church Fathers and his work was ignored until the Renaissance (at which time some humanists revived his writings as a model of good Latin, and of course, his flat Earth view also was revived).\n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html\n \n More importantly\n ?In 1834, the anti-Christian Letronne falsely claimed that most of the Church Fathers, including Augustine, Ambrose and Basil, held to a flat Earth. His work has been repeatedly cited as ?reputable? ever since.? (Ibid)\n \n Both this source, and the first one I cited suggest that the notion that the Church believed in a flat earth stems from the novel ?Rip Van Winkle? hardly a reliable source for facts, but certainly a good source for fiction. That you would spout fiction as fact, traced back to this seminal work is very interesting. It seems you're prepared to even believe a work of fiction, so long as it attacks the Church.\n \n Although another site suggests that the moronic notion that the Church was pro-flat earth stems elsewhere...\n ?The myth that Christians in the Middle Ages thought the world was flat was given a massive boost by Andrew Dickson White's weighty tome The Warfare of Science with Theology. This book has become something of a running joke among historians of science and it is dutifully mentioned as a prime example of misinformation in the preface of most modern works on science and religion. The flat Earth is discussed in chapter 2 and one can almost sense White's confusion that hardly any of the sources support his hypothesis that Christians widely believed in it. He finds himself grudgingly admitting that Clement, Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, Isodore, Albertus Magnus and Aquinas all accepted the Earth was a globe - in other words none of the great doctors of the church had considered the matter in doubt. Although an analysis of what White actually says suggests he was aware that the flat Earth was largely a myth, he certainly gives an impression of ignorant Christians suppressing rational knowledge of its real shape.?\n http://www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htm\n \n Whilst Jeffrey Burton Russell (quoted indirectly earlier) (at http://id-www.ucsb.edu/fscf/library.../FlatEarth.html) suggests other culprits might also be at fault for blaming the Catholic Church.",

   "Unkerpaulie -- The position from which you are arguing seems to be stuck in a dualistic world of black and white. From the position that the bible must be understood literally word-for-word, it becomes quickly evident that the bible cannot be 100% true. For even within the bible itself, there are contradictions that cannot be reconciled. And the physical evidence of the world around us contradicts other aspects of the bible. And just what definitions of words are we going to use, anyway -- especially where there are synonyms? Will you go back to the non-existent original texts and attempt to understand the nuances of a language that you do not even understand?\n\n my point is this. if the bible is 100% true, accept it for what it is. if the bible is not 100% true, accept it for what it is. if upon looking at the bible objectively and logically, you realize that the bible does not correspond with proven truths, then the bible is not 100% true, and thats all there is to it. however, when people find discrepncies between the bible and known truths, there is a tendancy to reinterpret the bible in some very radical ways so that the original meaning is completely swapped for a meaning that more closely fits reality. in this way you end up pulling some very unbiblical information out, and saying that it comes from the bible. with this much room for variation and personal speculation, it is no wonder the christian church is so denominated\n \n my stance of black and white \"take it or leave it\" is still retained. i dont think that the bible should have to be doctored to make sense. if its 100% true, it should be able to stand on its own. if its not 100% true, then beileving it is the same as lying to yourself\n \n by the way, i have never seen any irreconcilable internal contradictions in the bible. the contradictions that stand out to me are the ones between the bible and reality",

   "What are the real reasons creationists object to evolution?\n \n 1. Young earth creationists see the Bible as the absolute truth of Christianity, and that to hold any meaning at all it must be read literally. To move away from such a notion is, in their eyes, to compromise and ultimately destroy their faith.\n \n 2. A literal interpretation of Genesis produces a chronology that is very different (by 6 orders of magnitude to put it scientificly) than that derived from an analysis of the physical evidences we have.\n \n 3. Like the age of the earth, evolution is based on the analysis of the physical. It cannot measure the \"God Factor\" so it does not attempt too. However, this is seen by young earth creationists as the exclusion of God, and they have no capacity to reconcile an essentially neutral point of view with their absolute truth derived from Bible.\n \n 4. A Christian who considers evolution and the old earth has to (or is forced to) answer some potentially difficult questions with regard to their belief. In the case of the young earth creationists, these issues are dealt with by saying they are false ideas (ie not part of the Bible, see point 1) and so do not need to be answered at all. In addition, literal Genesis is a much more straightforward way of answering the question of \"how I got here\" than anything science can ever offer.\n \n \n And a final observation on the general nature of religion in peoples minds- it is resistant to change and tends towards a static frame of mind. This is a very different to the type of thinking that has driven the scientific exploration of our surroundings which relys on innovative and adaptive thinking.\n\n i think i agree with this entirely. religions are usually based on a source deemed \"holy\" (inerrant, true, right) by its followers. it is preserved by resisting change and upholding traditions rather than adapting with new developments. in a sense, it should not change, because if it was based on truth from the onset, then a change would mean denying the foundation of the religion and questioning the source that was already declared holy.\n \n truth doesnt change. rather than entertain the idea that the religion is based on falsity, believers would make every effort to preserve their religion in the traditions it was founded on. this is the dilema. no religion wants to be accused of being based in falsity, because that is the death of that religion. even in the face of contradicting reality, it is mandatory for a religion to hold its ground\n \n some religions can subtly change their message and belief ion a way that it seems like it hasnt changed when it has. by gently steering believers toward a doctrine that deviates from the origin, but matches contemporary logic, some religions have found a way to work around the bible/reality discrepancies without destroying their religion. this kind of doctrinal manuvering is what i am strongly against",

   "Re-reading this now... it caught my eye. Perhaps the bible is true in its own context. Perhaps the context of the bible isn't a factual recording of history, but rather an allegorical story. If the entire context of the bible is not the physical world, then it could be completely true on a completely different level than the physical world. \n \n Or perhaps your alternate conclusion of black and white is accurate -- that nothing in the bible can be considered true.\n \n As an aside, I am going to guess that the individual behind 'Unkerpaulie' does not believe the bible is a factual account of history, but poses this dilemma to allow those that DO believe it is a factual account of history to consider the issue from a different perspective.\n\n \"No on should think that the Creation of Six Days is an allegory\" said St Ephraim the Syrian \n \n St. Basil the Great in his Hexatemeron says \"Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.\"",

(Genesis Creation and Early Man, p69).\n \n However ?We (Orthodox) believe that the created world itself is a 'mystery' originating in the sovereign will of God accomplished by the action (energia) of the Holy Trinity. We confess in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed (325/381) that the Father is the ?Creator of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible?, the Son ?He through whom all things were made?, and the Holy Spirit, the ?Creator of life? (zoopion).? http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/a...article8050.asp\n In other words... 'it happened' (just like evolutionists say 'evolution just happened' :)). That is the mystery.

Although I can also say that would end any debate you might take on in any science forum.\n\n I see you want to continue to re-work my argument.... It seems to be a compulsion of yours. Not only did I state philosophical reasons (which aren't solely feeling, but thinking*) but I stated some science as well. You need consult a wider world out there to discover a lot of intellectual thought takes place outside of science. \n It's why you can't even address the science presented. So set have you become that ANY argument I present doesn't have it.\n \nLet's substitute your specific argument:\n I do not believe any conclusion with regards to the ascent of man given through any rational means, reason, or evidence, no matter how sufficient, if it does not include a creator as it's origin, despite the lack ANY evidence whatsoever of a creator, not only with regards to evolution, but with regards to anything we have ever observed in the known universe.\n So, you will not accept it, no matter what evidence or lack of evidence is presented, using belief system. Why even bother debating it?\n\n This is part of the lack of insight I often see from your camp. You pretend to have minds open to evidence, but then you preclude which evidence you'd be willing to see anyway. So, why even bother debating it? Regardless about my own belief in God, I present arguments against evolution that don't rely on my Orthodox belief - hence I posted stuff by Berlinksi. You have made the same mistake that people retorting him make - a belief that anything he says is supporting a young-earth creation.\n And let's look at what you 'feel' to be true. Your own definition, badly given, but let's just go by what you believe, on the meaning of 'rational' means that your own idea of science is irrational, because the proof you give for it is not through science (your only rational means), but through 'common sense' and a definition of English, and your own feeling of what it is. Why bother discussing with someone who states things about rationality and can only prove them through irrational arguments (by your definition)?\n \nFrom a scientific standpoint, you lost the debate the minute you admitted you would not accept a conclusion that was contrary to your pre-set beliefs.\n That's why I cannot understand why you choose to debate in the science vs creation forum, and don't just restrict this particular issue to the religion forum.

Your problem is your mind-set based on an a priori and false notion that anyone in my camp is irrational. Not only have you misunderstood the word, it has blinded you to any science put forward from me. It's like you didn't even see it. You don't even address it. That is why I use words such as dogma to describe efforts on your side to deal with possible outside of a very very limiting mind-set. Your whole premise is in fact extremely arrogant. Government often takes place without regard science. Therefore (according to you) politics is irrational; and therefore law is irrational. Any codification of or application of law is irrational, because it deals with non-scientific evidence every-day. For you, you've made such an untenable statement of your own belief, the magnitude of it is so large that I'm amazed you can hold it in the face of a huge world that goes on without immediate recourse to science. And for you, this boils down to re-working my argument to pretend that I am anti-science. I'm not. I'm against people such as yourself that have an arrogant belief that all there is, is in science. (And I recognise that this doesn't mean that God is true - so you don't need to work that false argument in, as another has done).\n \n The silliest thing about your stance is that you would believe a rationale given by me here is irrational. There's a difference between believing I am wrong, and believing I am irrational. One is not an insult. The other is.\n \n \n * You just have a very warped view on some definitions of things. You've already accused two different scientific endeavours as non-science; exobiology and psychology. Now you rashly belittle philosophy as 'feeling'. You have to do it, because you're compelled to by a thinking that has already established boundaries to what you believe is rational, and what is irrational - even if you now discover some of your own arguments are in fact 'irrational' (by your definition).\n phi\u00b7los\u00b7o\u00b7phy P Pronunciation Key (f-ls-f)\n n. pl. phi\u00b7los\u00b7o\u00b7phies \n Love and pursuit of wisdom by intellectual means and moral self-discipline.\n Investigation of the nature, causes, or principles of reality, knowledge, or values, based on logical reasoning rather than empirical methods.\n A system of thought based on or involving such inquiry: the philosophy of Hume. \n The critical analysis of fundamental assumptions or beliefs.\n The disciplines presented in university curriculums of science and the liberal arts, except medicine, law, and theology.\n The discipline comprising logic, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.\n A set of ideas or beliefs relating to a particular field or activity; an underlying theory: an original philosophy of advertising. \n A system of values by which one lives: has an unusual philosophy of life.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=philosophy",

My arguments against evolution are not arguments in favour of God, they are arguments against evolution.

   "Glad to see things kept busy while I was away. Although Mach has already responded in detail, I have a couple of points to raise re: post # 77.\n \n \n\n However since you're asking; if you want to know why I object to Darwinism (in all its manifestations), is because of several reasons...mainly philosophical, as that is where I have more knowledge.\n I don't believe in putting faith in a scientific theory that doesn't seem to say anything other than 'it just is'... I state this because when for instance you look at the ascent of man, as one example, it doesn't answer 'how' except to say 'through evolution' because it proposes mutually exclusive theories that only agree that 'it happened by evolution'.\n It also discounts God,* who (I believe) is real... in that it proposes how something happened just by itself, which itself doesn't seem to fit as I put forward when I stated...\n\n \n I find your objection interesting for several reasons.\n \n Firstly, you appear unable to accept that it is possible to make observation on the history of life from a scientific stand point. If we consider what \"scientific\" means it is the observation, categorization and analysis of evidences we find in the world around us. In the abscence of a spiritual influence directly in the explaination, you cannot accept it as credible. Do you not see that this is a characteristic of science in general and not an issue that is specific to evolution, age of the earth etc?\n \n Following on from that thought, I wonder if this problem you find with Darwinism- the \"this is what has happened\" extends to other fields of human endevour. I don't think any of our science incorporates the supernatural into its workings yet it underpins our day to day life, from the food we eat to the systems that allow us to engage in this online debate. Maybe you do see the lack of Christian influence in science in general as a major issue- I'd be interested to hear.\n \n I find your often mentioned \"mutually exclusive theories\" to be intriguing. Different explainations of the same evidence are not uncommon in science, and intellectual enquiry in general. Now, without getting into discussion of the relative validity of certain theories about human ancestry (we could choose some other examples relating to the present day world if you wish) why do you build this up to be such an issue? fact- we have fragmentary but significant evidence of ancient human forms; fact- differnent workers have made interpretations which differ on the details of explaining that evidence. However, there is no arguement that humans have evolved between the workers in mainstream science. As more evidence is found with time some current models will probably become outdated where others may be shown to explain new discoveries well. This is a characteristic of human endevour in general- I do not see some difference of opinion as being an insurmountable issue here as to evolutions fesability, so why do you?\n \n Finally, I do not think that saying \"evolution discounts God\" is a very balanced observation. Evolution, like all science cannot quantify the supernatural whether it exists or not, so to cite it in this arguement is a a bit vague. Maybe you see this problem with every aspect of science- if so lets hear why. The reason you seem to take issue re: evolution is because science has strayed into a realm of consideration that has traditionally been the preserve of religion. Which brings us full circle once more- your fundemental objection to evolution etc. is not based upon an understanding of how \"right\" the science is, but on a point of philosophy based on your religious beliefs.",

   "I find your objection interesting for several reasons.\n\n Some think I'm here for comic relief.\n \nFirstly, you appear unable to accept that it is possible to make observation on the history of life from a scientific stand point.\n\n Absolutely false. You can make many scientific observations, and although you can be wrong, I accept you can do it.\n \nIf we consider what \"scientific\" means it is the observation, categorization and analysis of evidences we find in the world around us. In the absence of a spiritual influence directly in the explanation, you cannot accept it as credible.\n\n That's making the assumption that the spiritual is absences. Whilst you might think I am simply making the assumption that the spiritual is present, that still doesn't prove your point.\n \nDo you not see that this is a characteristic of science in general and not an issue that is specific to evolution, age of the earth etc?\n\n Yes, I do, which is why your first statement is false.\n \nFollowing on from that thought, I wonder if this problem you find with Darwinism- the \"this is what has happened\" extends to other fields of human endeavour.\n\n It is true that evolutionary terminology permeates all sorts of fields.\n \nI don't think any of our science incorporates the supernatural into its workings yet it underpins our day to day life, from the food we eat to the systems that allow us to engage in this online debate. Maybe you do see the lack of Christian influence in science in general as a major issue- I'd be interested to hear.\n\n Although I believe in an axiomatic sense that Christianity is correct, I don't believe science need point to it specifically, and in fact that's what ID theorists believe too, they are looking for all possible answers, including non-material, and these don't necessarily equate to proving Christianity. They are not closing their minds to one possibility, simply because of a materialist philosophy (however, this means that they too are driven by philosophy; as are most scientists)\n \nI find your often mentioned \"mutually exclusive theories\" to be intriguing. Different explanations of the same evidence are not uncommon in science, and intellectual enquiry in general. Now, without getting into discussion of the relative validity of certain theories about human ancestry (we could choose some other examples relating to the present day world if you wish) why do you build this up to be such an issue?\n\n When I entered this forum, just over a year ago, the most common argument against religion was 'If religion is true; which one?\"\n Parallel to this was the idea that the mutually exclusive theories of religion diminished any notion that any of them were true.\n Thus I have endeavoured to apply the same arguments, against evolutionists. There is no homogenous evolutionary theory. Not only are there a large number of different evolutionary theories, there's no unity even within the materialistic interpretation of evolution. This notion of division has produced some of the most venomous rebuttals I have been subject to.\n Further, when arguing against any one religious outlook, it was often a case of people arguing with a great certainty of authority (in science). I found it a puzzle that one would argue with such certainty in the truth of evolution, when in fact there is no real truth; not just in science, but the fact that at the end of the day, much of what you can say about evolution, is that it happened - and you can't answer 'how?'\n It just seems odd to me that some pro-evolutionist would assuredly debunk a religious view; when in doing such, that pro-evolutionist's assumptions about the certainty of his own position is actually based on a false assumption; or perhaps the person just hasn't thought about these things... hence statements from people such as Mach that evolution is proven by evidences - how? Who knows/cares, the fact there's a catalogue of evidences seems enough\n \nfact- we have fragmentary but significant evidence of ancient human forms; fact- different workers have made interpretations which differ on the details of explaining that evidence. However, there is no argument that humans have evolved between the workers in mainstream science. As more evidence is found with time some current models will probably become outdated where others may be shown to explain new discoveries well. This is a characteristic of human endeavour in general- I do not see some difference of opinion as being an insurmountable issue here as to evolutions feasibility, so why do you?\n\n It's akin to holding to seemingly (to me) opposing views at the same time.\n 'We are certain that evolution happened.'\n 'This certainty is based on proofs that themselves are uncertain'.\n \nFinally, I do not think that saying \"evolution discounts God\" is a very balanced observation.\n\n I didn't say that. I have been at pains to differentiate between what I believe, and what others do. So that, even though I am not necessarily pro-ID theory, I accept that they accept that evolution is true.\n \nEvolution, like all science cannot quantify the supernatural whether it exists or not, so to cite it in this argument is a bit vague.\n\n That is your view of evolutionary science. I accept that it is your view. But you state that as if it is a scientific fact. If it is, try the challenge that I have posed Mach; prove it by science.\n \n Maybe you see this problem with every aspect of science- if so lets hear why.\n\n I continually get the idea that no matter how many times I categorically state that I am not anti-science, people are just going to say that I am.\n \nThe reason you seem to take issue re: evolution is because science has strayed into a realm of consideration that has traditionally been the preserve of religion.\n\n Darwinism has indeed. And this is part of the reason. Another is that I don't find materialistic evolution to be very convincing.\n \nWhich brings us full circle once more- your fundamental objection to evolution etc. is not based upon an understanding of how \"right\" the science is, but on a point of philosophy based on your religious beliefs.\n\n Again this is something I keep stating. Somehow it's getting lost as it crosses the International Date Line.\n Part of the reason is, I believe, that people are so certain that their own philosophy of science is 'fact', rather than just one of many philosophies, that any challenge to it brings about a knee-jerk reaction. (Most people wouldn't even consider the various philosophies of science at all; to compare them; they are just taught one version of science, and accept that as 'it'). And as it is 'the truth' of science if you question one aspect of this scientific truth, then you must question all equally true aspects of science. \n It is why people have the greatest difficulty with my posts; the challenge to the fundamental assumptions of many people with regards science. This is not to deny that I have my own beliefs about science.\n I thank you for your lucid questions.",

I suggest a more subtle distinction- those scientists see a need to apply observational methods to that which is observable, while being able to intergrate the results of such enquiries with their spiritual sides.\n \n \nWhen I entered this forum, just over a year ago, the most common argument against religion was 'If religion is true; which one?\"\n Parallel to this was the idea that the mutually exclusive theories of religion diminished any notion that any of them were true.\n Thus I have endeavoured to apply the same arguments, against evolutionists.

Anyone with a rundimentary knowledge of world history will know that the manifestation of such differences in opinion have yielded very different results. \n \n Once again you overstate the differences in opinion that exist between workers in the field. Your general frame of mind must make it very difficult for you to accept many things in the world around you as real- you constantly refer to \"truths\" and allude to that which is a certainity. These are concepts that are very difficult to apply to the real world in terms of science. We cannot prove a great many things but we can eliminate the unlikely and far-fetched.\n \n \nIt's akin to holding to seemingly (to me) opposing views at the same time.\n 'We are certain that evolution happened.'\n 'This certainty is based on proofs that themselves are uncertain'.\n\n \n As I said above, you are uncomfortable with concepts that are not clearly and precisely defined. Thats not a critiscsm, but an observation. I have met many people who have a like outlook, and when combined with a strongly held religious belief it makes something like the science of evolution seem rather untidy, incomplete and thus unworthy of acceptance. Well, I agree- if you take the absolute truth of a spiritual origin and put it against the fragmentary history that evolution provides it must look less appealing to someone who is wanting a definate truth behind why they are here. I suppose it depends if you can accept the uncertainty that goes hand in hand with the real in evolution.\n \n \nThat is your view of evolutionary science. I accept that it is your view. But you state that as if it is a scientific fact. If it is, try the challenge that I have posed Mach; prove it by science.\n\n \n Until we are in possession of a way to quantify the supernatural, such a view of evolution is the only view that can stand any form of rigorous testing, and as such is the only form that is of use as an explaination of the \"how\" of the evidence we have.\n \n \nI continually get the idea that no matter how many times I categorically state that I am not anti-science, people are just going to say that I am.\n\n \n Fair point and thanks for the clarification, but bear in mind some of the reasoning you use to argue against Darwinsim can be applied to much of science as a whole, so you can unwittingly come across as being against general scientific method. \n \n \nDarwinism has indeed. And this is part of the reason. Another is that I don't find materialistic evolution to be very convincing.\n\n \n Would you think the latter if it were not for your belief in the former (by which I mean Christianity?).\n \n \nAgain this is something I keep stating.

He can't, he uses philosophical arguments to prove that his philosophy of science is science; but irony is lost on him.\n \n He also argued with regards truth that this comes from science; for him the proof of the truth that there is no God is that there is no evidence for him; by this he means scientific evidence. So again, his notion of science, must, if it were true, need be proved by the only test he seesm to accept; his notion of science. Any evidence I put forward to God, Mach always retorts by asking how can it be tested by science (his version of it). So, again, his version is the ultimate test for the interpretations of evidences.\n \n IF he accepts other tests, then he lets open the door for me doing the same.\n He has already made done this, but won't admit it. He complained about me placing religion before science, or as he terms it, using irrational argument over rational argument. (He believes all people who are religious, are by that 'sin' alone; irrational; or at least their arguments are - again emphasising for him the import or his version of science)\n \n He later admitted that although he believes the experiments of the Nazis was good science, he would not support it, because it disgusts him. Thus, he is willing to subordinate science to feelings, or, in his own terms, to subordinate a rational argument by an irrational one. Yet he still attacks me for the same 'crime'.\n \n Sorry that you've not picked up on this before now. We've only been debating it several weeks over several threads.",

But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.\"\n Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", p12.\n \n \nhere is an example taken from \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html\n \n Karl Popper [note 3] to put forward his own way of telling apart science (of which the exemplar was the new physics) from pseudoscience (of which the exemplars were Marxism and Freudianism).

I find the statement \" What scientists do, or even what they say they do, is in the end very little affected by a priori philosophical prescriptions. Darwin was right to take the approach he did.\" unsupported. I have in the past stated a large number of studies into this subject, and in fact have been criticised because of the size of the posts!\n \n The main thing I like about this is you introduce a defence of science from a philosophical debate. The philosopher you rely on here has been refuted (in a philosophical sense).\n \"All shared the same views of the rejection of positivism and how the inductivist accounts of science. The priority of theory over observation statements. The need to have a background context in order to understand the interpretation and acceptance (or rejection) of an observation and experimental data.\n \n Both Kuhn and Lakatos had the advantage of time over Popper. Popper had first published in 1939 in German and then translated in English in 1959. However, his works were in the public domain for debate and examination. Giving time to both Kuhn and Lakatos to see what affects Popper&#8217;s falsification had on science.\n \n Kuhn took issue with Popper&#8217;s view of theory testing through falsification. Kuhn stated that it is \"incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that define the puzzles that characterize normal science.\" If we follow as Popper suggested, then if we fail a theory, then all theories would be rejected all the times.\n \n With Lakatos being the more recent of the two, his &#8216;research program&#8217; is the most advance of the three. He retains a form of falsificationism in some form, while incorporating some of Kuhn&#8217;s aspect. For example, Lakatos introduced &#8216;research program&#8217; instead of Kuhn&#8217;s &#8216;paradigms&#8217;. Nevertheless, Lakatos rejected Kuhn&#8217;s relativism.\n \n Another advantage that Lakatos gives the philosophy of science a way to understand what is meant by the term &#8216;science,&#8217; and methodologies (research program) by which we can look back into the history of science to understand it better.\"\n http://tedlee.tripod.com/new_page_1.htm\n \n But your version of science is dominated by materialism\n Carl Sagan recognises that there is materialism there, so does talkorigins - it defends it! It would in fact have saved you a lot of embarrassment had you actually read that. But for those of you who missed it...\n \n Dembski made a claim that \"Evolution's materialism or methodological naturalism denies a role for God. \"Methodological naturalism asks us for the sake of science to pretend that the material world is all there is.\" Instead of denying that evolution is materialistic, talkorigins.org simply say that, even though it is materialistic, this does not mean that there's room for God.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601_1.html\n \n \n \n Further...\n \n \"Materialism has been the foundational philosophy of many scientific geniuses throughout history and is the one common thread that unites many of the world&#8217;s most significant scientific documents.\"\n \n http://members.aol.com/Dennis2020/Index.html\n \n \n \n \"The rise of science and advances made in chemistry, physics, and mechanics contributed to the strengthening of materialism from the late 18th century through the early decades of the 20th. The discovery of chemical elements led to the revival of atomic theory. The publication of Charles Darwin's works on evolution demonstrated the possibility that living organisms can be accounted for on a material basis without any need to refer to a biblical Creator or supernatural purposes. The invention of the computer in the later 20th century suggested to materialists that mind itself can be explained purely in terms of matter and of electrical connections within the brain tissue\"\n http://www.kheper.net/topics/worldviews/materialism.htm\n \n \"What Darwinism and scientific materialism have dismantled, intelligent design theory could help restore.\"\n http://www.speakout.com/activism/opinions/3116-1.html",

So if there's any confusion, it's because you've done another of your trademark posting an argument against one of your previous stances.

I don't hold to that philosophy.\n \nI claim love and ideas are entirely knowable, it's a consistent position.\n\n a) so you know everything about love?

   "No, I said \"God is knowable, just not in His entirety.\" You even quote me saying it. I even gave an analogy, such as I know something about you, from my experience with you. But that knowledge is limited. And even your mum will never know you like you know you; that is, in your entirety. Pity you ignore that and just plough on again.\n\n \nSo, \"part of God\" is not knowable.\n\n Yes, as part of you is not knowable.\n \nSo, logically, God is unknowable, and it's inconsistent. Do you disagree with basic logic?\n\n I disagree strongly with you that things can't contain elements of both. You fail to see that you too, are essentially unknowable to me, and I to you.\n \nHowever, you cannot make a clear definition of \"god\" in the first place,so you have no business claiming things about this undefined entity if you wish to debate rationally. By all means, give us a more clear definition that does NOT include the unknowable.\n\n By all means show me that all of the material world is knowable.\n \nBy your misapplication of logic you've just made evolution unknowable, because you say if any part is unknowable, then it's all unknowable. You have problems with thins that aren't black and white, such as the bit between 'faith' and 'reason' and here between 'known' and 'unknown'.\n \n \nMontalban, unknowable and unknown are two different words, with different meanings, do you know the words?\n\n Yes. You seem to think that one is either one or the other. If this were true, then you've got to categorise yourself as unknowable.\n \nEvery step of how evolution has changed life on earth is not currently understood, and may never be.\n\n Then you've just argued that the 'science' of evolution is unknowable. This should be the end of the matter.\n \n Similarly, the position of every atom in your body might never be \"known\", but it is certainly \"knowable\", even if it's based on probability, or if it's deterministic.\n\n And again, then you accept that something can be both known, and yet essentially unknowable. Pity you continue to argue against yourself.\n \nYou, on the other hand, speak of \"unknowable\", which is a contradiction. So no, they aren't the same, sorry.\n\n What a laugh. So, when you just described my self as 'unknowable, it's a different 'unknowable' from the word I use. LOL :) It's why you continue to be my favourite debater.\n \nIf you want to instead say that god, love, and ideas, are knowable, then by all means, clarify your position. Which is it? I would love you to tell us.\n\n I did state that they have aspects of both. That is in fact why I don't limit myself to the 'material' world, because there are things that exist both in, and outside of it; love is both knowable, and not.\n You have argued everything about 'love'. Both that it is non-material, and that science can find out about it. Depends which time of the day you are arguing, so it seems :)\n There are other examples of things that contain these seeming contradictions, not just 'reasoned faith'.\n Take your goodself. You change, but you are also unchanging. You are, always you. But what you are now, is different from the child you once were.\n God is both knowable, in that He reveals Himself to us - allows us to know of Him, but we will never know all of Him.\n \nYour problem here is you think that they are the same thing. See your own construct applied to evolution means that evolution is unknowable, because there are parts of it that are not known. It is a very novel theory you have. And again, you're in another bind of your own creation. \n\n \nsee above.\n\n Kudos. You present exactly the same argument I made, with regards the atoms of me. Yet you fail to see this.\n \na) so you know everything about love? (recall your own false construct that if you don't know something about it, then it's all unknowable)\n b) good for you, I never claimed that love is not real.\n\n \nUnknown and unknowable are two significantly different words Montalban, with different meanings. Perhaps that's part of your trouble with making sense.\n\n Really? Which is love?\n \n\n a) showing something that is non-material\n and\n b) real\n and\n c) not described by science.\n You've created this mess, yourself. \n\n \nc) not described by science? What strawman is this?\n\n Show me the science. Simple.\n \n- Science is merely the body of knowledge gained through reason. To suggest that something is not \"knowable\" to science is to suggest something is beyond the reach of reason.\n\n That's not true. Reason is not tied to science. Else, stay away from law courts. I imagine that you'd harangue a judge who accepted 'reasonable' grounds for your innocence, even though there was no science involved. You'd be protesting, \"You can't release me without science, how do you know I'm innocent\" What a laugh.\n \nThis puts you in the position again of claiming something can be unknowable, or admitting that god, love, and ideas, are all knowable, and therefore can be shown to be true or false through reason.\n\n How are these 'false through reason'?\n \n- Can you defined God for us, since you keep mentioning it?\n 1. knowable or unknowable?\n 2. If knowable, what qualities does it possess?\n 3. Infinite or finite?\n -Mach\n\n The simple answer is 'all of the above'. :) He is both infinite, and yet finite; in that He took shape as Man.

This is certainly true. I don't think anyone on the forum would or could argue the opposite.\n \n - If we had complete knowledge, we would not need science, we would be omniscient, which doesn't work with our physical universe, which is probably why we have science. \n \n - There is no evidence that we could not, at some point, be able to tell you exactly what you're thinking. \n \n We would need to show evidence to the contrary for it to even be suspected.\n Why?\n 1. I can't observe your thoughts right now, personally, but you can. If you have a thought, it's real. Same question as \"do I exist?\". Yes, of course, just by asking it implies existence. It would be self-contradictory to claim otherwise. Do your thoughts, as we define them, exist? Yes, it's self-evident.\n \n 2. Occam's Razor - A good starting point for ways to sift through possible explanations. Is there a NEED for certain things to be OUTSIDE of rational observation yet reside inside the physical universe? No, it's simply not needed to provide the explanation.\n \n 3. We cannot come up with any evidence, including a \"good' reason, to believe anything in the physical universe is somehow not ABLE TO BE KNOWN through reason.\n \n As Collegegirl points out, there are ways we could do this on a basic level. Monitoring which neurons fire, mapping it out. Then in theory you could view something hidden from the scientist, who, upon examining the brain scan, could match it to the same scans she got from previous testing when you viewed the monkey wrench. Yes, in theory, science could probably do this today (according to her).

(and why you claimed they were unknowable, then changed your argument).\n\n \nEasily ended, as I said, show me all of you.\n\n \nToo bad we're not running for public office, the media would have fun with that one \n -Mach\n\n In other words, although you might think that unknowable and unknown are two different things, you can't show me everything about you.

Your own inability to answer simple questions, or to meet challenges. Show me where is the manual for knowing everything about you, Mach. Show me how you are 'knowable'.\n\n \nRationally there is no other explanation. Nothing in the physical universe is outside the physical universe, by definition. Self-contradiction Montalban, how many times do I have to remind you of fundamental logic? <-- this is the evidence, and lucky for me, you cannot refute logic, rationally.\n\n Then rationally show me everything arbour yourself.\n \n: You believe this. \n\n \nNo, I know this to be true. As shown, over and over.\n\n No, you mean to say \"I know this to be true. As repeated over and over\"\n If you want to show that it is true; then answer my 'simple' challenge. You claim that something can't be both knowable, and unknowable.\n Are you knowable? I know something's about you. That is both knowable, and known. There are some things about you that are knowable, and unknown, such as where you live, what you look like. However, there's something's unknown and unknowable about you; such as the totality of you. You simply will repeat your beliefs again and again and again, but you fail every single time to meet an actual challenge.\n \nI did. Phew! Are you back to this \"I'll ignore what was said\" phase? Show me everything about yourself.\n You see, some of you is knowable, but some of you is unknowable. Like, why you continue to ignore these challenges, this is beyond understanding. \n\n \nYou're using strawman again, should I ignore your strawman? I'd prefer to, it wastes my time. You like wasting my time. So here is some wasted time just for you:\n\n When I challenge you, that's not using straw-man. If I re-worked your belief, that would be. Challenging you is just that; setting you a challenge.\n \nYou are arguing about unknown, yet you don't claim god is unknown, and I'm not debating the unknown AS I'VE CLEARLY SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN. \n\n As stated; if you think you are knowable; show me how we can know you, in your entirety...\n including how you think; how you feel, your memories etc.\n \nYou claim aspects of god are UNKNOWABLE. SO DO NOT QUESTION ME ABOUT THE UNKNOWN IT'S A STRAWMAN.

You've resorted to the weak tactic of claiming something was refuted somewhere else. It's easy enough to challenge. Talkorigins and others that I cited agree with me. You posted, as you do here, your opinion, and unfortunately, you equate that with 'fact'. And the irony is you undermined science by making evolution a 'just-so' argument.\n \n It's like your odd statement that creation belief is irrational, and then you don't even know that there's not one belief, but many. Your own outbursts based on how you feel about things seem irrational, in that they're devoid of rational evidence; other than your opinion re-stated over and over and over. You started the thread attacking 'creationism' as if it were homogenous, then you moved to admitting that there were other creation ideas, but you avoided the fact some of these are materialistic, therefore within the realm of your limited version of science.\n \n And of course, the funny thing (funny in a sad way) is that you also argue against arguments based on evidence - if I cite a dozen sites that agree with me, they pale into significance when compared to your own self-belief about the worth of your opinion. You have faith in your own ideas correctness. At least the bootfitter made a very vague reference to talkorigins site, and he was wrong for\n a) not realising what he stated did not contradict the idea of sub-theories\n and\n b) the notion of the truth of his version of 'scientific method' was based on a philosophy of science.\n At least he tried to suggest his opinion was backed by evidence. You don't. Do you still feel goaded? Or, am I at last breaking down those blinkers you're wearing? As I said above, if you don't think that there's anything unknowable, show me how you are knowable, in your entirety. What do you say folks? Will Mach maintain his avoidance of this challenge - because he can't do it? Will he merely re-state his opinion again?\n \n You live by the 'just-so'. What is the basis of your beliefs that you're correct; that you believe you're correct. I hope you are prompted (not goaded) into a positive action of attempting to back up your claims either\n a) with a demonstration that you are in fact knowable\n or\n b) offering some evidence, other than your opinion (which is still discredited).",

Read again what I wrote.\n\n You are wrong...You said no theory depends on other theories for support.

It would not be a valid theory if it did, since BY DEFINITION, a theory relies upon the evidence that supports it. When you attempt to argue this point, it becomes obvious that you do not understand the scientific method.\"\n\n You believe no theory relies on other theories for support. You in fact have a general theory about theories, and a specific theory about theories. We've just seen your general theory... no theory depends on another. You stated it here in black and white. You continue with this general theory of theories here...\n \nThe concept that I was attempting to communicate (though, evidently, I did not do so clearly), was that one theory does not RELY on any other sub-theories.

If you are aware of others, please share.\n\n Read your own citation that you vaguely referred to. It says that there are different ideas on it, one supported by Popper. Your cite continues to list other people who have different models of scientific method/philosophies of science...\"Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Kitcher, A. F. Chalmers, Wesley Salmon and Bas C. van Fraassen.\"\n You really need to read your own source. It is no wonder you gave no direct link to it, and even when you referred to it a second time, made an even more vague reference to having mentioned it some time earlier in some other post.\n This one explains two particular approaches...\n \"A. contrasts two philosophies of scientific method:\n 1. Inductive: that one begins with observation, experiment\n 2. (Deductive): that experiments are always preceded by some theory or idea (153)\n http://www.iit.edu/~schmaus/Philosophy_of_Science/lectures/Hacking/experiment.txt\n You can do studies on the differing scientific methods at university...\n \"In the twentieth century, &#8220;Science&#8221; and &#8220;Culture&#8221; are often presented as a dichotomy. In this class we shall be examining that dichotomy, attempting to explode it by showing that science itself has a &#8220;culture&#8221; and that science is very much embedded in culture. We shall investigate disputes within sociology and philosophies of scientific method, debates around the public role of science, and the recent criticism of science and its place in society by the powerful critiques of feminism and post-modernism. A strong emphasis will be placed on case studies and seminar presentation.\"\n http://www.registrar.dal.ca/calendar/class.php?subj=ctmp&num=3000\n If you had read your site, it talks specifically with the scientific method theory/philosophy of Karl Popper, and gives reference to other theorists. The idea that you don't need to prove your position is thus based on your own opinion\n \nMy opinion has no part in any of this. \n\n Yes, it does. It has no reliance on your own vague citation. You fail to understand the theory of science, by believing your version just is true. And like Mach, you just continually re-state your position and see no reason for it to be challenged.\n \nIf I state that A=A, then it is self evident that A=A. If I state that B=B, then it is self evident that B=B. And if I state that A=B, then it is self evident that A=B.\n\n That is a false analogy. Not only do your own references not exclude what I have said, they themselves point to other philosophies of scientific method; the one you keep repeating is one influenced by Karl Popper, and you make the mistake of assuming that this is it. Note, I am not here to debate the relative worth of the various models; merely to show that yours is not the only one as you falsely claim in an arrogant dismissal of seeking out evidence to back up your case. And I've done this by not doing what you do; stating an opinion as if it is truth, but referencing what I say to evidentiary citations. Despite your opinion that your opinion is not an opinion, but fact.\n \nI have given you the definition of the scientific method -- the process through which scientific theories are developed. It is quite well defined. In the definition of the scientific method (see here for a reference: http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physic..._www/node6.html) it is obvious that a theory does not rely on anything but evidence for its validity. It doesn't rely on explanations of the evidence, because the theory IS ITSELF the explanation. If the explanation (theory) does not coincide with the evidence, then the explanation (theory) is not valid. There is simply not room for any theory to depend upon, or rely upon anything but the evidence -- BY DEFINITION. (Not by my opinion or your opinion or anybody else's opinion, but by definition.)\n\n All you've done is referenced something that says the same as the talkorigns site, and it makes no exclusion or inclusion of sub-theories. It just doesn't support your case with regards sub-theories; which confusingly you both accept exist, and see no need for - for the over-arching theory should say everything by it.\n \nSo, we have the definition of the scientific method. That's what the scientific method is.\n\n It is not 'the definition' of scientific method. It is 'a definition' of scientific method. Read your own source.\n \nAnd, within that, we have the definition of a theory. The definition of a theory allows only evidence to validate the theory. Evolutionary theory is a theory that was developed by the scientific method.\n\n It has been developed by a scientific method. Creation science makes claim to operate by the same method.\n \nTherefore, evolutionary theory is subject to the same definitions as any other scientific theory arrived at by using the scientific method. As such, it is self-evident, by definition, that your original statement in post #4 of the other thread cannot be correct.\n\n If it is self-evident, then why does it need evidence to back itself up? The statement of the theory \"A=A\" is self-evident. What is self-evident about evolution? (see below for the theory stated by you and/or Mach)\n \nIf, by claiming this is a 'just-so' statement, you mean to imply that it is self-evident, then you are correct. 1+1=2. By definition. It is just so. Definitions do not need to be proved.  \n (emphasis mine)\n Another mistake that defies your claim to logic. Definitions do need to be proved. If I were to say to you I know what a giraffe is, and then state \"A giraffe is a ground dwelling marsupial, living in western Sydney bushland\" I have provided a definition that you would call into question. Why? Because your definition is different. Do we have definitive definitions? That's another debate. That is one issue, the other concerns the theory of evolution as your specific theory of theories; that evolution itself does not rely on other theories. This also has not been supported by evidence. My own evidence however, shows that evolution does use other theories. It depends/relies upon them to show how evolution works. That is the 'real world'\n \nAnd, just so you don't attempt to twist my words here, I will point out that I am not making a comparison that 1+1=2 and \"evolution is true\" are equal statements, but rather that 1+1=2 is on the same level as \"a scientific theory relies only upon evidence for it's validity.\" Because both of these statements are true, by definition.\n\n That is in fact exactly what you have done.\n You and/or Mach have stated this is the theory of evolution...\n Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n (this is quoted from Mach's post at #26; but you have not disagreed with it).\n As that sentence stands, what does it explain? That allele frequency has changed over time. For you then, it has proved itself, because you believe that this statement of a theory is all that is necessary to validate the theory. It has validated itself. How is it proven, or valid? For you, it just is, because it does not rely on anything other than evidence that supports it. How is that evidence used to support it? It matters not that scientists construct that evidence into various theories. It is, as I have continually suggested, reduced evolution to a mantra, a 'just-so' statement.\n The real world differs from your own false constructs. And worse still you've continually restated your own beliefs (both of you are guilty of this) with the arrogant positioning of 'we are right; being right we don't need to prove anything'\n For you 'evolution is the change of genes over time\" and that is 'the theory of evolution\".\n How is this supported by the evidence? In the real world, scientists then construct numerous theories to show how this happened, because as it happens, that theory of evolution is not self-evident. If it were, then that's all that would need to be taught in schools. I would have passed a biology elective by memorising a single sentence.\n For you there's no real world of science, because",

Oddly enough, you just complained about not wanting to retort me, now you do.\n \n1. show me all of you.\n\n \n Let's examine your hocus pocus:\n - Ask someone 4000 years ago to show you the earth was flat.\n They cannot, so your test categorizes it as unknowable.\n\n No, you make the mistake between what is unknown, and what is unknowable. I asked you also to show, if you couldn't show all of you, to demonstrate how you think all of you might be made known. Someone back then could offer an hypothesis as to how the earth could be shown to be round, flat or what-ever; such as \"Let's walk around it\".\n Give me your hypothesis as how you can be known in your entirety!\n \nYet we can...ahem, prove it's not flat today. So it is actually knowable. Which shows your test categorizes things as unknowable, incorrectly.\n\n No, it shows you working on a straw-man. You simply categorise something that was unknown as unknowable (falsely) and then show how that unknown is now known. And instead of doing it once, you prefer to repeat the same weird reasoning a few more times.\n \nLet's try again:\n\n Another one? Is this so your word count is higher? I think it's a compensation thing you've got going there!\n \n- Had we asked someone just 20 years ago to show you all of the genes in human DNA, you'd have gotten the answer \"we do not know them yet\". So you classify it as unknowable.\n\n There you go, assuming to put words in my mouth.\n Unless you can show a general body of science saying that it was unknowable, in an absolute sense; that it would never be known, then you've done another piece of illogic re-working.\n \nBUT HOLD EVERYTHING! OMG, in 2003 the approximately 30,000 genes in human DNA were identified. Holy mackerel Montalban! You mean the hard work of scientists using reason actually turned the UNKNOWABLE into the KNOWN? How is this possible!\n\n Don't you get tired of arguing against your own reconstructions? Silly question, of course not. Show me a body of scientists who said \"We will never ever know all the genes\". Pity you've confused yourself between what is 'unknown' and what is 'unknowable'.\n Show me where I have said it.\n If you think that, when I ask you to show all of you, that is stating that an unknown is actually unknowable, then as I said, show me how you can be known; that is the test. You've continued to fail to do so.\n \nIt's not, it's obvious your test is incapable of separating the knowable, from the unknowable, so why do you propose a bogus test? \n\n Propose how you can be known in your entirety. If you can't actually show how you might be known in your entirety, then you have shown that you are unknowable, not just unknown.\n I could propose about the flat-earth days by saying \"Let's test to see if the world is flat, let's set off due east and see if we don't fall off the earth\", maybe the technology wasn't available at the time to put the test into practice, but it was foreseeable. Let's see you do the same.\n \nAre you dishonest? \n\n Are you? You make a claim, offer no proof but re-working of ideas that scientists themselves would not make. You state that I would make some claim about DNA, and then argue against that. You do it all the time. You can't help it, you're compelled to argue straw-man. It helps you feel like you've argued, because you've debunked a statement; problem is I never made it.\n \n(corollary, why do I waste my time debating with your dishonest or irrational arguments?)\n\n a) you've asked this question about seven times now\n b) most the time you're not debating me, anyway... you debate re-constructions of what I say.\n c) you offer no evidence for support.\n \n Again you fail to meet the test. As predicted you have failed, and this is now a 'known'. There you go, more of what was 'unknown' about you, is known as time goes on.",

Why is a cubic meter of atmosphere in florida so different than a cubic meter atmosphere in mars? Because, things that are not identical, are different (!)\n \n \nDoes this mean that you're anti-religious because of genetics? \n\n Possibly, but probably not. Developmental psychology has plenty of evidence to support that knowledge is often impact by both nature, and nurture. I certainly make no claims with regards to that, so it's not relevant, unless you're just curious.\n \n \nThat is what you're arguing. I'd have said it was due to your personality, but you deny that this is 'real'... you are just responding to stimulii.\n\n No, that's what you're claiming I'm arguing.\n I do not deny personality is real, I define it as purely physical/inside the physical universe, and quite real. You do not, and make an irrational claim.\n \n Yes, am just responding to stimulii, both external and internal. \n \n \nOdd too that you'd condemn the great thinking in pyschology to 'hocus pocus', because psycholigists have many theories of 'self' and 'personality' not based on your idea of chemicals alone.\n\n \n Appeal to authority will not save your argument, as usual.\n \n I have studied psychology, I even brushed up on a college text a few weeks ago because science, as always, fascinates me and occupies much of my time. Have you? \n I was again interested in the studies that discuss people with \"split brains\", and how the communication between the left/right hemispheres works.\n \n But that's an aside. I think any psychologist who is rational will also tell you that psychology is primarily the science of behavior and mental processes\n \n My college text, sitting on my lap, seems to agree. David Myers (Psychology), 2nd edition.Worth Publishers, Inc.\n \n Looking up the entire chapter on personality, for instance, I see four very disupted theories that are discussed:\n \n Psychoanalytic: origins of personality arise in childhood sexuality and drive unconcious motivations \n \n Trait theory: Identify specific dimensions of our distinctiveness and consistency\n \n Humanistic: Focuses on our capacity for growth and self-fulfillment.\n \n Social-cognitive: we are shaped by our interaction with the environment.\n \n None of which I contradict by claiming that everything in the physical universe, is indeed, in the physical universe (not supernatural, divine, or otherwise, non-existent).\n \n Regardless, because of the lack of sufficient evidence to prove or disprove any one of these beyond a reasonable doubt, psychology does not claim to have found the \"black cat\". Unlike you, who \"knows god exists and is love and is real and is truth\". Certainly some scientists, including some that study psychology, DO think we have souls and other such nonsense. But they can no more provide evidence of this than you can, and thus, aren't of much interest to those wishing to understand the workings of the physical world. We could post 494949 psychologist theories and still not have a shred of evidence that souls exist, or that personality is \"not part of the functioning of the human brain\".\n \n So, as I said, I have clearly provide a hypothesis that can describe \"self\", and we can even test it by giving a person an injection that has a chemical reaction with their physical brain, and thus, kills \"them\". You, however, cannot show us how personality, ideas, or anything associated with the human condition, is somehow not part of the physical universe, or associated in any way with divinity (which is irrational in premise anyway).\n \n -Mach",

It's not really 'you' that is more rational, but the alignment of atoms\n \nSeriously, why is a rock on one side of the world so different than another rock?\n\n The difference between rocks of the same type, and the difference between you and I; there's no comparison\n \nWhy is a tree so different from another tree? Why is a cubic meter of atmosphere in Florida so different than a cubic meter atmosphere in mars? Because, things that are not identical, are different (!)\n\n SO, they just are!\n \nDoes this mean that you're anti-religious because of genetics? \n\n \nPossibly, but probably not. Developmental psychology has plenty of evidence to support that knowledge is often impact by both nature, and nurture. I certainly make no claims with regards to that, so it's not relevant, unless you're just curious.\n\n So then you're not just atoms and reactions to stimuli. I wish you'd make up your mind.\n \nThat is what you're arguing. I'd have said it was due to your personality, but you deny that this is 'real'... you are just responding to stimuli.\n\n \nNo, that's what you're claiming I'm arguing.\n\n Wrong again! You said Post #153\n \n Personality is just response to stimuli, be it internal/self-stimulus, or external. It's entirely determined by our brain functioning, which is entirely a physical process.\n\n \nI do not deny personality is real, I define it as purely physical/inside the physical universe, and quite real. You do not, and make an irrational claim.\n\n Ah, so you're back to atoms again! Please make up your mind, or arrange your atoms better! What a hoot!\n \nYes, am just responding to stimuli, both external and internal. \n\n Then you are nothing but atoms arranged differently.\n \nOdd too that you'd condemn the great thinking in psychology to 'hocus pocus', because psychologists have many theories of 'self' and 'personality' not based on your idea of chemicals alone. \n\n \nAppeal to authority will not save your argument, as usual.\n\n I've already gone over this on another post, but think I better do so again here, just in case you miss it.\n You cited (an authority) on appealing to authority (ah irony!) at\n http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html\n And this doesn't support your case because it says...\n \"This sort of reasoning is fallacious when the person in question is not an expert. \"\n (Ibid). Thus, the people I would quote, would be experts. You, a non-expert dismiss all authority (now; but you also have argued for evidence)\n \nI have studied psychology, I even brushed up on a college text a few weeks ago because science, as always, fascinates me and occupies much of my time. Have you? \n\n So, you see yourself as an authority? So, your question is whether I'm an authority! Ah irony again!\n \nI was again interested in the studies that discuss people with \"split brains\", and how the communication between the left/right hemispheres works.\n\n Good for you.\n \nBut that's an aside. I think any psychologist who is rational will also tell you that psychology is primarily the science of behaviour and mental processes\n\n Really? You referred to it before as hocus pocus. When I questioned this statement you misquoted an appeal to authority to dismiss an appeal to authority, now you're back to supporting it, because you study it! What a hoot. Your argument is so skewed!\n \nMy college text, sitting on my lap, seems to agree. David Myers (Psychology), 2nd edition.Worth Publishers, Inc.\n\n Is that an appeal to authority? Sorry, I can't help but laugh.\n \nLooking up the entire chapter on personality, for instance, I see four very disputed theories that are discussed:\n Psychoanalytic: origins of personality arise in childhood sexuality and drive unconscious motivations \n Trait theory: Identify specific dimensions of our distinctiveness and consistency\n Humanistic: Focuses on our capacity for growth and self-fulfilment.\n Social-cognitive: we are shaped by our interaction with the environment.\n None of which I contradict by claiming that everything in the physical universe, is indeed, in the physical universe (not supernatural, divine, or otherwise, non-existent).\n\n Leaving aside your claim to authority (which is valid, even though you argue against it a few lines above)... So personality is real, in a physical sense, then. Where is it located in the brain?\n \n Regardless, because of the lack of sufficient evidence to prove or disprove any one of these beyond a reasonable doubt, psychology does not claim to have found the \"black cat\".\n\n Interesting analogy, since you refer to it as hocus pocus.\n \nUnlike you, who \"knows god exists and is love and is real and is truth\".\n\n Yes, I have made this claim\n \nCertainly some scientists, including some that study psychology, DO think we have souls and other such nonsense. But they can no more provide evidence of this than you can, and thus, aren't of much interest to those wishing to understand the workings of the physical world. We could post 494949 psychologist theories and still not have a shred of evidence that souls exist, or that personality is \"not part of the functioning of the human brain\".\n\n No where have I stated that personality is not connected to brain function. It is you who have stated that it is brain function.\n \nSo, as I said, I have clearly provide a hypothesis that can describe \"self\", and we can even test it by giving a person an injection that has a chemical reaction with their physical brain, and thus, kills \"them\". You, however, cannot show us how personality, ideas, or anything associated with the human condition, is somehow not part of the physical universe, or associated in any way with divinity (which is irrational in premise anyway).\n -Mach\n\n There you go again with your atomist theory; which by the way, the Ancient Greeks came up with. When you decide\n a) whether to appeal to authority or not,\n and\n b) whether you are more than just atoms or not\n get back to me :)\n Split-brain! What a hoot.",

Darwinisn has not been proven and it is pure speculation.\n\n What do you mean by Darwinism? Are you equating the term 'Darwinism' with the theory of evolution? IF that's what you're doing, it is inaccurate to do so, as they are not equivalent concepts.

Natural selection is at least one 'force' behind evolution. \n \n \nFact 4.

I am entertaining a compromise.\n \n \nI don't know what they're made of. They are non-material.\n\n \n So. You don't know what \"non-material\" is, other than to claim it's the opposite of something \"material\". I define that as \"not real\". Unless you can back up the claim, your left with \"non-existent\" claims of self.\n \n \n \nIf it's not made of material, then it's non-material and visa versa.\n\n This tells us nothing of what it is, only what it isn't. Which gets you nowhere. In this case, same as above, \"not material\" is \"non-existent\". Note: We are not talking about \"not matter\", we are talking about all known components of the known universe, matter/energy, etc.\n \n \nThe notion that I have a notion of my self suggests that atoms are not all there is\n\n That's fallacy, unfortunately, cause/effect. In fact, not only is there no evidence to suggest that a notion of self isn't entirely a result of atoms, but there is also, as expected, only evidence that supports atmos as being the fundamental building blocks of the brain, which gives rise to the formation of memory, and results in the perception of \"self\".\n \n \n \n. I have a personality. I am unaware of anyone proposing that if they could duplicate my atoms, they can duplicate my personality.\n \n Now you can say you are \"aware\" of such a person.\n \n \nI can cherish a concept; such as freedom above the material needs of my being.\n\n ...and you can do so from an entirely \"materialistic\" body.\n \n \n \n There are many people throughout history that have fought, and died for non-material things; one of your arguments against religion shows this\n.\n You mean to say they have fought and died for things that do not exist? That's probably true, why would I need to disagree with that? One's belief does not determine existence, you're on the wrong track here, it will just burn your time without getting you closer to any conclusion.\n \n \n Ideals are non-material. \n \n And ideals do not exist, per se. They are concepts, which, while the act of thinking of the ideal is a purely physical process, the object of the ideal is non-existent. An easier example to see clearly since I know you'll freak at that is:\n A square circle.\n \n This concept, while formed through the interaction of entirely materialistic processes, refers to a concept that does not \"exist\". \n \n \nMorals are non-material. We believe in 'freedom'. And, we have 'free will' to act beyond the mere reaction to chemical stimuli. Leibniz argued that freedom to act is real. If you believe that a freedom to act is any less real than an mere alignment of atoms, you need ask yourself what chemical mix compels you to argue that you're a chemical mix.\n\n Same as above, but note too that quantum mechanics cannot yet show if interaction is probabilistic, or deterministic. The jury is still leaving room for your notion of \"free will\". \"free will\" can also be a relative term, and you are just as incapable of proving it, as our current argument, so we can stay on track.\n \n \nWhat evidence - please give my own words.

Whales have bigger brains, and show no signs of being self-aware.\n\n No. I mean please read whatever source you like, and ponder through any number of replies. But when you do reply, do so in your own words, you know, like, in your own words.\n \n #1 you'd need to define \"self-aware\", then set out to prove whales are not, but this alone would only help us understand \"Self aware\", and which animals we define as such. This as no bearing on our discussion.\n \n #2 Being \"self-aware\" has no direct correlation with \"atom count\". A mountain has more atoms than my brain, yet I am \"self-aware\", and a mountain is not capable of processing information. Could it be that it's the organization and composition of the brain? Of course it could be, and likely is.\n \n We are way off track there, none of these help your case of proving that personality, ideas, etc., are non-existent, (you use \"non-material\", but we have not arrived at existence of that yet).\n \n \n \n\"Is naturalism true?

If it's outside of this, in concept, than it cannot be known, and to suggest existence or non-existence is NOT RATIONAL. The author above, unfortunately it's not your words, that a [materialistic] notion of the unvierse DEPENDS on a contradiction to be shown to be true or false, in order to be considered true.\n \n He/she starts with an irrational premise, then proceeds to attempt logic, based on an illogical premise. A very common mistake, I'm sure I do it as well, but fallacy just the same.\n \n Let's read it again substituting the appropriate definitions to show, how I read it, as entirely absurd:\n \n \nNaturalism's truth would presumably depend on the existence of a [by definition, something non-existent].

The agnostic world-view is a joke, and we can devote an entire thread to the subject on the philosophy forum.\n \n Reason begins with the premise that we exist. This is the first, easiest, and most discussion-ending refutation of the agnostic world-view which utimately claims \"we cannot know anything for certain\"...i.e. \"we cannot know if we exist\".\n \n To claim we may not exist, is a contradiction, as you well know, since any \"question\" posed about existence implies existence.\n \n Lucky for us, we exist, and the agnostic view results in logical absurdities.\n ===============\n personal note: You seem hung up on your feelings and how you feel ideals are worthwhile, and people die for them, and emotions are \"real\", etc., etc. Science can no more prove non-existence of things that exist, than faith can prove things that don't exist, exist. Your feelings, love, hate, ideas, etc., are yours, regardless of the underpinnings, nothing will change. Don't feel so threatened about those things in particular, when the knowledge of why/how they work, will not change my feeling, for instance, when I drink a chocolate milk-shake. If you allow your fear to interfere, you will end up making conclusions based on something other than reason. If you \"feel\" something is important, it is.

And you refuted this, based on your assumption that you were just right.\n You stated in post #144 (emphasis mine)\n \nI have given you the definition of the scientific method -- the process through which scientific theories are developed.

It is certainly possible to start with an inaccurate understanding of a particular word or phrase or concept.\n\n And that's what you did. You assumed your definition of scientific method just was it, and then you argued you'd no need to prove it, because common sense and logic just said that it was.\n \nIn order to have an intelligent debate or conversation, it is essential for all parties involved to be using the same definitions. Once a definition is established in the context of discussion, then it is established. It does not need to be proven, because it is already accepted. \n\n And I didn't accept your definition. And you in effect argued that your definition was beyond argument. And when I appealed to reason that this was not beyond dispute, you made a 'just-so' statement that it was, BECAUSE it was a definition.. Hence I showed for example that even a definition such as 'evolution' itself can be disputed. And this is, even though you probably don't intend it to be, arrogant, and because of that, frustrating.\n \nFor a simple example, consider this... We could define a bicycle as \"any non-motorized vehicle that has two wheels and is powered by a rider whose pedalling motion turns the wheels and propels the vehicle forward.\" If we see Lance Armstrong riding in the Tour de France, we can confidently say that he is riding upon a bicycle. By definition. Once this definition is established and agreed upon, then it does not need to be shown to be true. It is accepted as true.\n\n But this is nothing to do with your argument.\n According to you, you gave THE definition of 'scientific method'. You just assumed that this was beyond dispute, and as such my arguments that it wasn't was met with 'just-so' statement.\n \nIf I interpret your comments correctly, you do not believe that the definition I posed of the scientific method is the only definition that can be considered. If my interpretation is accurate, then let's take a moment to come to an agreed upon definition of the scientific method for the purpose of our discussion.\n\n This too is superfluous. Your definition is accurate by the rules of the philosophy of science that defines it that way. What is in dispute is that this is THE only definition of scientific method, and it isn't. It is not beyond dispute.\n \nWhat do you propose as a definition of the scientific method?\n\n This is again besides the point. I don't propose that this is a definitive definition of scientific method. I propose that there are many definitions, dependent on your philosophy of science.\n \nHere's my question for you: Are you aware of a fundamentally different explanation of the scientific method? If so... please share. I certainly don't consider myself a science genius. I welcome the opportunity to learn more and expand my horizons. It is entirely possible that my understanding of the scientific method is not complete.\n\n The key word here is 'fundamentally', we could argue for a while on this, but I don't suspect you placed it there as a trap.\n The summary of this is\n You gave a statement of certainty about what is scientific method\n I disputed this saying that it was but one based on the philosophy of science as supported by Karl Popper\n You said it is beyond dispute, because it just is the definition.\n I suggested it was 'a' definition, and gave you other definitions of it.\n You then argued that you can't argue against definitions, because definitions are by definition, definitive (phew!)\n And this too, is not beyond dispute.\n Now you ask me to give 'a' definition of scientific method, which no doubt you'd argue against, and thus show that definitions aren't definitive.\n In shorter form, you were wrong to take a position of certainty, on these issues, and to argue that therefore your position was beyond dispute.\n \n And, we've not even got onto the idea of 'sub-theories', which your argument rests on the notion of what 'scientific method' is. This all stemmed from a post about multi-regional theory, which I stated evolution depends on. You claim it doesnt'. This lead to a conflict over what sub-theory is, and then what scientific method is. Where would you like to continue from now?\n Thank you for your patience :)",

If this is what you are attempting to communicate, you are barking up the wrong tree. I understand you to claim that there are multiple versions of the scientific method itself. This you have yet to show.\n \n Remember that by presenting an alternative definition of the scientific method, you are not stating that it's a definition you agree with. You are merely presenting evidence to show that there is, in fact, an alternative definition. If there are as many multiple definitions as you seem to claim, then it should not be an issue to present one or two here.\n \n \nNot only that, your version does not preclude sub-theories at all.\n\n Let's address the issue of scientific method and come back to this point.

These choices differ among the scientific fields, and consequently, there is no one scientific method\"\n http://www.law.umich.edu/thayer/panel.htm\n \"The Journal of Mind and Behavior... is based upon the premise that all meaningful statements about human behavior rest ultimately upon observation &#8212; with no one scientific method possessing, a priori, greater credence than another. Emphasis upon experimental control should not preclude the experiment as a measure of behavior outside the scientific laboratory.\"\n http://www.ume.maine.edu/~jmb/about.html\n \n \n...I have stated that there are several, you assume one to be 'it'. And it's not 'it' except within the framework of your particular philosophy of science. ... I can look for a non-materialist scientific method. \n\n \nYou have stated that there are several, yet you have not put any forth.\n\n Yes, I have. I did so, then I repeated the reference, then stated again where I stated it. It is madness to say that I haven't. It borders on dishonesty.\n You made a claim that your citation of a scientific method was THE scientific method. I disputed this. You said it was beyond dispute. So, I published a citation that shows at least two different methods of approach; two different scientific methods. You not only refused to comment on it, you pretend now (twice) that I've made no such citations.\n Here it is again:\n Induction and Deduction (152)\n A. contrasts two philosophies of scientific method:\n 1. Inductive: that one begins with observation, experiment\n 2. (Deductive): that experiments are always preceded\n by some theory or idea (153)\n http://www.iit.edu/~schmaus/Philosophy_of_Science/lectures/Hacking/experiment.txt\n Your step-by-step process follows a particular method. These citations show that it is not the only method! You are wrong. Not only are you wrong, but you were wrong to suggest it was beyond refutation, and now you're wrong to say I've not made such evidence available.\n I also suggested that you can study such at university...\n http://www.registrar.dal.ca/calendar/class.php?subj=ctmp&num=3000\n \nPlease do look for a 'non-materialist scientific method' and provide a link or copy it for us to see.\n\n Why should I? You made a statement \"this is THE scientific method\" and then I refuted it by showing that there are others such as above. Inductive, and deductive. Instead of acknowledging this, you pretend that I have not done so, and ask me now to find evidence of something else. It is quite dishonest. You made a claim, you've been refuted.\n AND the worse thing for you is that your interjection to a particular knowledge of scientific method still does not refute the use of a theory depending on other theories. It is an attempt at the great red herring. Now you don't want to acknowledge that there are different scientific methods, but you want to shift the goal-posts and dispute if there are not non-material methods, which is superfluous to the fact you're wrong. It doesn't matter if there are two scientific methods or twenty-two, the fact that there are more than your 'one', refutes you.\n \nIn our exchange below, you are claiming to put forth a different definition of the scientific method to show that there can be more than one. Yet, your reference simply suggests that there are different approaches that can be taken toward the scientific method\n\n That is not so. You gave a version of the scientific method that follows a particular path. You claimed 'this is it', beyond debate, or refutation. What do you think a method is, if now you recognise (by another shift) different 'approaches'. They are different methods.\n It is in fact un-scientific (again one of your 'just-so' assumptions)\n \"There is no such thing as \"the\" scientific method. Science uses many methods. There will never be a pat answer to the question \"what is science\". The very notion that there could be a pat answer bespeaks an attachment to rote learning that is incompatible with scientific thinking.\"\n http://www.av8n.com/physics/scientific-methods.htm\n As I stated, your own talkorigins citation suggests others. Your particular one is based on that of Karl Popper.\n Not only is your assumption not based in fact, but on some novel idea that 'approach' and 'method' are vastly different terms. And you gave a specific model.\n \n. It can be seen from many different perspectives. Individuals can have many different ideas about how it can or should be applied.\n\n No, you're making another mistake. You're mixing up different ways of applying one rule, to applying different rules.\n \n But I cannot find anywhere that your references suggest that the scientific method is anything other than the four basic steps of Observation, Invention of Hypothesis, Make Predictions based on Hypothesis, & Testing the validity of Hypothesis by Experimentation or further Observation.\n\n Then you've not read the citations I made.\n Albert Eienstein had no means to test his hypothesis. That he did not, and therefore could not follow a step in your method does not mean that his theory was un-scientific because it didn't follow your particular method. It is a nonsense to suggest otherwise. It didn't only become science later on. That is the whole basis of hypothetical and theoretical sciences; much of the work not testable. For you, because it didn't follow the step-by-step process in its totality (which for you is 'the' scientific method), then it's not science.\n Read \"The Scientific Methods of Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon\" at\n http://www.thingsrevealed.net/dscrtbacn.htm\n \nBootfitter: And now I'm allowing you to put forth a different definition of the scientific method to show that there can be more than one. \n Montalban: I did that, at the top of post #175, which is a repeat of a previous post, so in fact I've done it more than once. See that post, there's two other citations about other definitions. Both you and Close_slave_can missed it!\n\n Yes, you've simply consigned a huge slab of science to non-science.\n \"In the case of scientific theories, the basic logical empiricist approaches were variations on the idea of instrumentalism, the view that scientific theories were predictive instruments and that the knowledge they represent is limited to what they predict about the observable properties of observables. In the case of scientific methods, strategies for rational reconstruction have not been so easy to formulate. Here's the problem. Almost all of the methods scientists actually use in conducting experimental or observational studies are theory dependent: they depend for their justification on knowledge reflected in previously established theories. Kuhn's (1970) discussion of \"normal science\" makes this point especially clearly, but all of the logical empiricists were acutely aware of it. Moreover, in sciences like physics, chemistry, molecular biology and astronomy, almost all of those methods seem prima facie to rest on knowledge of unobservable phenomena (just think about the presuppositions of the design of any experiment in chemistry). What the project of rational reconstruction must show is that (almost) all of these methods can be reconstructed in such a way that their application, as guides to the identification of empirically adequate theories, does not require positing knowledge of unobservables.\"\n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/\n There's an on-line book...\n 1. Introduction \n Overview\n 1 Thumbnail History of Scientific Methods\n 3 Myth of a Scientific Method\n 12 Scientific Methods\n In which he states\n \"We scientists can abandon the idea of &#8216;the scientific method&#8217; but still embrace the concept of &#8216;scientific methods&#8217; -- a suite of logical techniques, xperimental techniques, principles, evaluation standards, and even ethical standards. Unlike Francis Bacon and Ren\u00e8 Descartes, modern scientists can select from this suite without rejecting the constructs of those who choose to use different methods. We must, however, know the limitations of both our methods and theirs.\n http://www.mines.utah.edu/geo/people/faculty/jarrard/Text/booktoc.html\n \n Here is a summary of this argument, begun on the Out of China thread... of 'the path of the great red-herring'\n Montalban: posts links on multi-regional theories, invites comment on the theory\n Mach and the Bootfitter: what's the point of this?\n Montalban: It's one of the theories used to 'prove' evolution\n Mach and the Bootfitter: not theory rests on another theory, evolution is true based solely on 'the evidence', and it goes to show you know nothing of science.\n Montalban: What about sub-theories which are used to support evolution? You've consigned the work of scientists in the various fields; by which they endeavour to show evolution at work, as largely superfluous; ironically you are arguing against the very work of these scientists.\n the Bootfitter: no theory rests on another theory, to say such contradicts THE scientific method\n Montlaban: There is more than one scientific method\n the Bootfitter: No, there's only one... this is it [gives examples]\n Montalban: Not only does that citation not refute the statement about theories using other theories, it's not even THE scientific method.\n the Bootfitter: Yes, it is, it's just based on common sense, irrefutable, and doesn't need proof, and it goes to show you know nothing of science.\n \n It could be argued that your method is 'the' method of choice.\n Further, even those that accept your one 'method' such as wikpedia (below), or concentrate on one method, such as talkorigins, accept the idea that it is driven by philosophy\n \"The study of the scientific method is distinct from the practice of science and is more a part of the philosophy, history and sociology of science than of science itself. Such studies have limited direct impact on day-to-day scientific practice.\n \n The material presented below is intended to show that, as with all philosophical topics, some of the issues surrounding the scientific method are neither straightforward nor simple.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\n \n I have often stated that you pro-evolutionists place scientists on a pedestal.\n \"Paul Feyerabend, may be science's most vocal critic (5). He considers science to be an anarchist movement. He points out that since there is no one scientific method, hence no consistency in science, the success of science must depend not only on logic but on persuasion, propaganda, subterfuge, and rhetoric\"\n http://www.grisda.org/origins/17003.htm\n \"Persuasive communication involves [1] gain the person&#8217;s interest. [2] create a need. [3] show how that need can be satisfied. [4] Help the receiver to visualise the satisfaction of that need. [5] Encourage the action that will lead to the need satisfaction.\" (see M. McWalters (Ed.), (1993), Understanding Psychology, McGraw-Hill; Sydney, p296ff.)\n This is what your version of science does for you. I have been at pains to stress the socialising nature of education, and how it breeds assumptions as to what science is. Not only have I, in the past, quoted from Wolpoff, to this effect, but a number of other sites.\n \" The rediscovery post-Merton of the social nature of science has thrown eternal Scientific Methods out the window, but that doesn't mean that science is no longer distinguishable from non-science. It just isn't as easy as one would like in an ideal world. Last I looked, it wasn't an ideal world, anyway.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html",

   "1. Carbon dating is not accurate.\n\n A statement based on ignorance. Carbon dating is quite accurate. Some years ago it was accurately calibrated back about 11,000 years using dendrochronology. Prior to 11,000 years the error bars on dates became larger and larger. However, in 1998 carbon dating was calibrated back to about 45,000 years, essentially the entire useful life of the technique. \n Here's how it was done. Sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Suigetsu in Japan were taken. The bottom of this lake is characterized by alternating light and dark layers - these are known as varves and one light and one dark layer is deposited each year, depending on the season. You see, the light layer is caused by the annual algae bloom. As the algae die, they settle on the bottom and form the light layer. The dark layer is made up of clay that settles as silt on the bottom during the winter. That this is true is a matter of observation - the varves are still being deposited each year and there is no discontinuity in the core that indicates that it has been otherwise in the past.\n \n At any rate, the varves were carefully counted back to about 45,000 years ago. Samples of known age were carbon dated. Thus, by comparing the apparent age of a carbon dated sample to the actual age counted from the varves, the technique of carbon dating was calibrated for essentially its whole useful range.\n \n You were aware, weren't you, that radio-carbon can only be detected for about 50,000 years? With more sensative instrumentation it has been detected in samples thought to be about 70,000 years old, but it isn't useful for age dating.\n \n I don't understand why it is that if carbon dating were not useful it would matter to evolutionary theory. Does this mean that the carbon dating used by archaeologists to date artifacts in the Holy Land are wrong? Does this mean that the Dead Sea Scrolls aren't about 2,000 years old? If carbon dating is unreliable, I don't understand why Biblical scholars would make such extensive use of in in attempting to support the Bible.\n \n2. Do a search on google and you'll find the information pertaining to the universities in question.\n\n I'm unclear what you are talking about.\n \n3. \"Natural selection\" is not a \"force\" behind evolution. \n\n Not sure what you mean. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations. Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics. There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity, and, of course, there are mechanisms that tend to increase it.\n \nYou do not have to believe in creationism, however, trying to convince people that your opinions are correct when they're based upon an unfounded theory is ludicrous!\n\n Those who refer to scientific theory as unfounded only make themselves look ignorant. In science, the word theory means that it has been tested. For example, there is the theory that the earth is a sphere. There is the theory that the planets orbit the sun. There is the theory that matter is made up of atoms and that the atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. There is the theory that by striking certain isotopes of uranium with high energy neutrons that the nucleus will split and release energy.\n \nYou can theorise all you want but, in the end, it is all pure speculation.\n\n It seems strange to hear someone claim that it is speculation that the sun is at the center of the solar system. I guess it is also speculation that germs cause disease. It seems funny that ships of the Navy would put nuclear reactors in ships based on mere speculation that they can get power out of them, or speculation that they won't explode.",

Secondly, faith takes a back seat to \"pure speculation\".\n \n speculation :to take to be true on the basis of insufficient evidence \n \n This is indeed NOT what a theory is. A theory does not claim certainty or truth. Reason implies justified by evidence. The nature of the evidence determines the degree of certainty. \"I exist\", self-evident, and certainly true. A theory about past events, is supported by the evidence gathered, in the case of evolution, without the evolutionary process, no evidence supported explanations can be given that explain observed life. Evolution, on the other hand, fits quite nicely, and is the only credible theory supported by biologists, based on the EVIDENCE. Without evolution as a theory, there are no explanations for what's observed of life. It's like saying the theory of gravity is bogus, there is a \"better\" explanation that doesn't encompass the current theory of gravity.\n \n In contrast, your bible claims truth, based on no evidence, or based on \"Faith\" (does not require evidence).\n \n So, in general, a well-supported theory like the theory of evolution as it relates to life on earth, vs pure speculation, vs faith, is in that order with regards to supporting evidence.\n \n Most evidence: Self-evident claims (?)\n Overwhelming evidence - < Evolution\n Very little evidence - < Pure speculation\n No evidence, by definition - < Faith\n \n So, if you'd like to suggest that some claim based on \"no evidence\", is somehow more reasonable to believe in than a well-supported theory, by all means, go right ahead.

The fact that you have called me one on four different occasions, as well as the fact you've constructed several threads directed solely at creating ad hominem might off-set this somewhat. :)\n \n I also have a strong feeling that manners are important.\n\n I take it then, calling someone a liar with no intention of proving this, is considered 'polite conversation', in your culture.\n \n I used to think there was a slight probability that you were not being malicious and hence the apologies. I really regret making the apologies because you have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that you deliberately twist peoples words. \n\n SO, your attack here is STILL not based on anything specific, and is akin to every other time you've made this generalised and ad hominem statement. I expect next you'll be creating a thread direct wholly and solely at attacking me hoping to drum up support; and with no real attempt to debate.\n The last time you accused me of this was when you made a false statement re: Galileo, and then you howled that you'd not put into the post what you really wanted to say.\n You stated on the \"Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution.\" thread\n \nHere are some links about the catholic church torturing people for denying the earth was flat.\n\n This was changed to (Post #52)\n \nI honestly don't understand you. Bruno was tortured and Galileo was totured for proposing models where the earth is not stationary. If you think that shows I moved the goal post to make a claim that was not true please give more details.\n here are some more links if you want...\n\n I refuted this in post #55 and #56\n This then caused Occams' Razor to start a thread just on the issue of the church and these men\n \"Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei: were they fairly treated for their views?\"\n Post #4 you continued your attack on the Catholics\n \nIt is called being diplomatic. I hope you don't find out why I have to choose my words with such care. The spanish inquistion used to shove a towel all the way down peoples throats wet it so it woud expand and then pull it out. They certainly tortured people at the drop of a hat however maybe they were not that upset by the heliocentric model specifically maybe it was because some people supporting the heliocentric model claimed the concept of life elsewhere.\n\n I continued to refute this in post #5\n Your words were to make a generalised attack on the church torturing anyone over the flat earth, then specifically Galileo et al. I showed this was wrong, and you admitted it in post #8, but then you also accused me of 'twisting your words' and you created a whole thread to state this.\n Now there's the difference between you, and I when making an accusation. I show what was said, and where it was said, and people are free to check it, and then to agree or disagree based on evidence.\n You are content to make a generalised slur with no intent of doing anything other than making ad hominem. And despite your opinion of yourself in regards to making such slurs, you've not just done it once with me, you've now done this fact-less attack four times\n \n As for my final statement not making sense. I will try to rephrase it. I have sometimes make a point along the lines that you cannot test evolution in exactly the same way as theories about gravity.\n\n I agree.\n \n When I make these points people accuse me of being a liar with a creationist agenda because I act (like?) you and you are a well known liar.\n\n Oh dear, you revert to ad hominem attack again. If you persist in calling me a liar, without any attempt to verify your slur with fact, then you have shown what exactly you 'do' stand for. Note to other readers, I have not complained about this to admin despite his slurs every month. I have just accepted these as part of Close_Slave_can's monthly ordeal.\n \n Your behaviour is more to blame than the unfair snap judgements of others.\n\n There are two things here.\n a) you show how other evolutionists behave; that the moment the awful truth of their own a priori notions are questioned, they jump to blaming everyone a creationist. I am, as it happens, but others such as some in the ID theory, are not.\n b) you too are subject to this 'craze' as you regularly call me a liar, but never once have you offered any proofs to this. You've done this repeatedly for several months now.\n \n In short, when many evolutionists are questioned on their core beliefs they oft behave as if they are religious zealots. You in your own way, post these slurs.",

He is not a evolutionist so he is hardly qualified to comment on the detail of the theory. However, his \"qualification\" in this instance lies in his creationist beliefs, as he made clear at a recent Bible Rally .\n \n So our \"expert\" here is a young earth creationist, and it is those views that drive his opinion on evolution.

You stated this is the Scientific Method. But, once again you're going for the old red-herring and making another diversion. You fail to deal with the wealth of citations I provided that show that there is MORE THAN ONE scientific method.\n I showed more of these in post #182.\n \n All you do is highly select which parts of a post you want to debate, thus when I showed you twice sites that refute you, you just say \"I have yet to see any proof\". See again #182, for more proof, which you still seem to have missed\n \nThis seems to be the crux of your argument, that the steps can be performed in a different order. \n\n No it isn't. However, what do you think a method is?\n \n If you have a recipe that says\n 1. Mix water with flour\n 2. pour into baking tin\n 3. set in oven at 'x' degrees Celsius for 'x' minutes\n that is a method.\n For you to suggest you can do this in order 2-3-1 would be possible, but pointless.\n \n Your own site suggests\n 1. Make observations. \n 2. Form a testable, unifying hypothesis to explain these observations. \n 3. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis. \n 4. Search for confirmations of the predictions; \n if the predictions are contradicted by empirical observation, go back to step (2).\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html\n This of course reduces the purely hypothetical sciences to non-science! On the issue of 'order doesn't matter' what person makes searches for predictions that they haven't predicted?\n \n However, you are now attempting to divert from the real issue, which is\n a) there is more than one\n b) your version is based on a particular philosophy of science\n Your own site suggests this, not only that, I've already pointed this fact out to you already, and you just ignore this as you scoot around looking for more side-issues to debate.\n :What is the scientific method? This is a complex and contentious question, and the field of inquiry known as the philosophy of science is committed to illuminating the nature of the scientific method. Probably the most influential philosopher of science of the 20th century was Sir Karl Popper. Other notables are Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Kitcher, A. F. Chalmers, Wesley Salmon and Bas C. van Fraassen. This is not the place to delve into an explication of the various philosophies represented by these scholars;\"\n (Ibid)\n This suggest\n a) the scientific method is based in philosophy\n b) Karl Popper has heavily influenced this\n c) there are other philosophies of what is scientific method.\n \nThis doesn't fly, as I've already admitted that they can be in a different order... and used with different motivations or from different perspectives, etc. The point is that these four steps are always present in any 'version*' of the scientific method. (I'm using this word for your benefit, in the sense that I believe you to be using it when referring to different versions of the scientific method... Inductive vs deductive, etc.)\n\n No, this is not true. If it were, then there would be only ONE scientific method, and there isn't, as evidence by my proofs, and not rebutted by your continual 'just-so' argument.\n I've already suggested how you've continually side-tracked the \"Out of China\" debate, and you've attempted to do so again, twice by\n a) debating the order, which of itself is a side-issue, of which you're still wrong\n and\n b) an attempt to get me to show non-materialistic scientific methods, which is superfluous, because I've already shown several 'other' methods which refutes your notion that there's one, only, and several sites that suggest that 'one' is a nonsense anyway, and this still doesn't help you on the theory of sub-theories.",

This is in part due to the socialising process of education where people are trained into thinking that what they are taught is normative.

   "Hello pandion:\n \n \nA statement based on ignorance. Carbon dating is quite accurate. Some years ago it was accurately calibrated back about 11,000 years using dendrochronology. Prior to 11,000 years the error bars on dates became larger and larger. However, in 1998 carbon dating was calibrated back to about 45,000 years, essentially the entire useful life of the technique. \n \n \n Believer's statement was partly correct. The Carbon dating method is accurate to about 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. If you try to measure anything older than that, then you have to take into account the effects of the global flood of Noah's day. This would have caused massive changes in the carbon and radio-carbon levels in the Earth and atmosphere through the processes that would have come along with the Flood, such as volcanos errupting, etc. Evolutionary scientists do not take these changes into account when they try and project back into the past for rocks older than a few thousand years and as a result, they get figures in the tens of thousands of years range, as opposed to figures closer to 4,000<x<6,000 years range which is where many of these rocks are most likely found assuming the Bible to be true.\n \n The leaving out of the changes caused by Noah's Flood is a grave mistake and thus causes inaccurate dates being produced. Alternatively, other assumptions about the original amount, has the carbon decay rate always been constant, etc., may also be out which further inhibits the accuracy of the date.\n \n \nI don't understand why it is that if carbon dating were not useful it would matter to evolutionary theory. Does this mean that the carbon dating used by archaeologists to date artifacts in the Holy Land are wrong? Does this mean that the Dead Sea Scrolls aren't about 2,000 years old? If carbon dating is unreliable, I don't understand why Biblical scholars would make such extensive use of in in attempting to support the Bible.\n\n \n Since all of those things you mentioned are after the Flood, than the carbon dating method would be reliable. But if we were trying to measure an object before the Flood, the date we would recieve would be very inaccurate because the evolutionary assumptions do not include the effects of the Flood on the Carbon and radio-carbon levels.\n \n \nNot sure what you mean. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations. Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics. There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity, and, of course, there are mechanisms that tend to increase it.\n\n \n I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to \"evolve\" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations. \n \n Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.\n \n Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes:\n LL - Long fur.\n Ll - Medium fur sizes.\n ll - Short fur sizes.\n \n where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.\n \n Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes:\n LL - Long fur.\n \n We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.\n \n Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome.\n \n \nThose who refer to scientific theory as unfounded only make themselves look ignorant. In science, the word theory means that it has been tested.\n \n \n Now, friend, how can you test the big bang that happened over 15 billion years ago? Or how can you test or observe, life coming from lifeless chemicals eons of years ago? How can you test the progression of simple life evolving into complex life over however many years it is said to have happened? We do not even see this happening today! How can you observe, test, experiment and repeat any of these events when they occurred eons of years ago in the past? You cannot. Science is not a tool for investigating the past, as it is ill-equiped to do so. Anyone who has any respect or knowledge about science would not claim other wise. This is because science deals with problems and things now in the present, by way of observations, experimental validity, repeatability, and so on. You cannot do any of these on things in the distant unobservable past, let alone prove them to be true! All the evidence a scientist has to work with exists now in the present, e.g. fossils, planets, stars, etc. Evolution, like creation, are both stories to try and explain how the evidence of the present originated. So to assert that evolution is scientific and creation is not is absurd and ignorant. They are both belief systems about the past.\n \n \nFor example, there is the theory that the earth is a sphere. There is the theory that the planets orbit the sun. There is the theory that matter is made up of atoms and that the atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. There is the theory that by striking certain isotopes of uranium with high energy neutrons that the nucleus will split and release energy.\n\n \n There is no theory that the Earth is a sphere. This can be proven, observed. It then becomes not only common sense but general knowledge. It is no longer a theory (if it ever was one!). The Bible claimed several thousand years ago that the Earth was round without any scientific evidence to back it up, i.e. observation, and it was correct.",

AiG is a group that exists to publicise the belief that a literal reading of the story of Creation in Genesis is a vital and only interpretation of the origin of our world. This underpins everything they have to say and is the reason the organisation exists. They also see how pervasive and penetrating an empirical look at the world has become and want to counter this as they see it as undermining the Christian faith and the moral underpinnings of society.\n \n To this end they have become widely read in general science relating to such matters as the Age of the Earth and evolutionary theory. Knowing the authority the writing style and approach of science carries in the Western world they then write their own version of events to fit their beliefs derived from Genesis, in the said style used in \"mainstream\" scientific material.\n \n However, this resemblance is only skin deep as it is mostly aimed at people who are not scientifically minded and without a knowledge of what science has to say. They do not conduct science that holds up to independent academic or professional scrutiny but create material that makes sense to those looking for something solid to support their belief that the world is about 6000 years old etc. \n \n Contrary to what you said, I actually view the people behind AiG as being highly intellectual and educated- their method is very clever, quite neatly exceuted and very impressively marketed. In the same light though, this intellectualism makes their deceit of the uniformed reader even more grave.\n \n You see this is what it really comes down too- AiG's works are so encompassing now that it is possible to find a Genesis-view article on most subjects relating to natural history. Without a wider background a reader could have the wool pulled over their eyes by this material and think they have an explaination that is (i) real science and (ii) covers everything. No real attempt is made to encourage the reader to see what ideas actually lead us to the concept of evolution or why we think the earth is so incredibly old. Even Talkorigins.org, a site that defends evolutionary science provides links to webpages such as AiG ans ICR making it clear to the reader there are other viewpoints around. Does AiG offer such a magnanimous acknowledgement of what else is out there on the of chance the reader might  want to make their own mind up after reviewing all the evidence? No.\n \n I hope you enjoyed reading about my \"mindless\" objections to AiG and the way it operates.",

I had to bleach my eyeballs after that one.\n \n \nIn this post you said it in black and white!

No, the truth is far from it. As Christians they are bound by God's Word, which says not to lie. They would be hypocrites if they did. God also tells us not to force or decieve others into believing in Him.\n\n \n I will elaborate on my use of the word deceit as it appears to be causing misunderstanding here. When I used deceit I did so in the manner in which I read from my dictionary- that is to decieve the observer. My reasoning is this deception is the mis-representation of science on the issue of evolution and the age of the earth. Now, that is not to deliberately lie- for example if AiG was saying X fossil had been hidden away because it compromises evolution with regard to X creatures when no such fossil existed. However, they are very adept at quoting out of context and omitting/changing interpretations that compromise their views. Oh, finally, they are the paradigm of how to teach the controversy :p\n \n \nYes, AiG does defend the Bible from the very first verse.\n\n \n Well, at least we are in broad agreement here.\n \n \nEvolution is no more scientific than creation:\n They believe that the Bible is the Word of God and that everything written in it is truth - a rational and logical starting assumption. They base all of their science on this Biblical framework. For example, they interpret the evidence in a Biblical framework. An atheistic evolutionist, however, has a different starting assumption to the Christian creationist. The atheistic evolutionist believes that there is no God and that the books of the Bible are just the uninspired words of men, and hence, not \"truth\". Therefore, everything that happens must be explained naturally. This forms their world view or framework. All of their science is built upon this world view and any interpretations over the same evidence as creationist would be totally different and be explained for naturalistically.\n\n \n That is all very well, but you present two extremes of a spectrum of opinion on the matter, not all evolutionists are atheists or even agnositics, and likewise not all Christians are young earth creationists.\n \n If I can use a personal example, I was talking about AiG's new muesum with my wife during the drive home from work this evening. Now, I would consider my wife to be an enthusiastic Christian who is committed to her faith. At the same time she is a geophysicist who accepts evolution and the old earth as a fact. She is distinctly unimpressed by the material AiG advocates and, to use here exact words is \"disappointed in them as Christians\" with regard to the organisations leaders. She sees them as failing in their responsibility to other Christians because they are respected teachers and they are using their position to create division as opposed to finding the common ground that does exist.\n \n From my point of view I don't really care what Genesis has to say on evolution in terms of me not being a Christian- my objections are philosophical in nature. My interest in evolution etc. is quite separate from that and I imagine would exist regardless of my religious outlook.\n \n \nWe both have the same evidence, for example it may be fossils, the red shift, the Earth's magnetic field, rocks, etc., it just depends on what our starting assumptions are or our starting faiths (belief systems) are as to what conclusion we will draw from the evidence:\n Creationist: evidence + Biblical starting faith interpretation --< evidence for Bible.\n Atheistic evolutionist: evidence + atheistic (anti-God) starting faith interpretation --< evidence for evolution.\n\n \n The history of the subject of evolution (and the modern scientific method in general) reveals a different view. Evolution arose out of empirical examination of the world around us and attempt to explain what was seen. There were no preconceptions as to what was going on- as the evidence was found explainations where devised to explain it. AiG's work is a reaction to such findings, an attempt to mimic the scientific style under religious auspices.\n \n \nEven though it is the same evidence, both sides use it as evidence for their world views. There is no tampering of the evidence or any change in the evidence; the different interpretations of the evidence (depending on the starting belief system) are the only thing different between an evolutionist and a creationist. None is more or less scientific than the other. Both are belief systems about the past that cannot be proven by science.\n\n \n AiG's work is not scientific I'm afraid. This premise underpins it: conclusion-< evidence -< analysis. The only thing here is this is largely an area of intellectual endeavour so their is no pressure to test it in a way that most other science gets subjected to. However, if you were to forward AiG's ideas on sedimentation models to hydrocarbon exploration deptartments at Esso, Exxon, BP etc. as data on which to locate oil and gas they would be sent straight back with a post-it note saying \"these do not work\".\n \n \nI wouldn't say this, did you even look at their bios through the link I sent you? Dr Humpreys work has been readily accepted by evolutionary scientists, regarding atmostpheric work. Dr Stephen Taylor, holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering (who is also a creationist) has written over 80 scientific articles, and is a reviewer for the journals \"IEE Electronic Letters\", \"Solid State Electronics\", \"Journal of Applied Physics\" and \"Applied Physics Letters\"; Dr Robert Eckel (Medical Research) has published more than 80 research papers, 17 book chapters and recieved 20 research awards.

There are many more such examples of where creationist's work is readily being accepted by the evolutionary scientists outlined in the book \"In Six Days: why fifty scientists choose to believe in creation\" edited by John F. Ashton Ph.D.\n\n \n I'm well aware of the way AiG touts is champions. There are alot of people with good standing in their fields of research. However, you can count on one hand the number of individuals with a doctorate and active research interests in an aspect of geology, paleontology, geochronology, geochemistry, sedimentology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary genetics and so the list goes on. I'm still waiting to see AiG material in Science, Nature, New Scientist and other popular journals. If we move to specialised publications like the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Tectonophysics and The Journal of the Geological Society of London you can forget it. None of this stuff gets to conferences like Pet-Ex or the annual meetings of EAGE and SEG. Why do you think this is? these are all part of a huge atheist conspiracy?\n \n \nThe rest of your quote has already been covered above by the \"evolution is no more scientific than creation\" section above, i.e. same evidence - different interpretations of evidence that are based on our starting faiths or beliefs.

As to TalkOrigins it is not infalliable. Its a very good resource that is available outside of paid for journals, but they do caution the reader about the material in the site. While they try to appraise material, it is not subject to the typical peer review science demands and for the fullest view consult the published references they typically cite.\n \n \nOkay, so may be that word was not needed, sorry. Other than that, yeah, I thought that your argument was well thought.\n\n \n And I thank you for your polite responses.",
