   "The Great Escape (excerpts, with occasional emphasis added)\n \n In addition to his role at Focus on the Family (FOF), he serves as chairman of the board of Exodus International...\n \n In other words, he's a PROFESSIONAL \"ex-gay\"... which might actually be a good thing, from his perspective. In the notorious Spitzer survey, something like 75% of the allegedly \"successful\" respondents reported that they had spoken publicly about their \"transformation.\" I take that to mean that if they were not actually employed in the \"ex-gay\" industry, then they at least appeared on behalf of \"ex-gay\" groups or their proponents.\n \n Furthermore, in the more reliable Shidlo and Schroeder study: \"Only 6 (3%) achieved what the researchers considered a heterosexual shift.\" But here's the kick... ALL SIX of them were employees of the \"ex-gay\" industry! NOBODY else was \"successful!\"\n \n So there seems to be a very high correlation between employment in the \"ex-gay\" industry and \"ex-gay\" \"success.\"\n \n Of course, considering the unbroken history of high-profile \"ex-gay\" failures and defections, even being a professional \"ex-gay\" is no guarantee.\n \n Well, at the age of 11, life began to blossom for me. There was a man that worked for my father who took me to Disneyland. He taught me how to surf. He invested in my life. And all of a sudden, I thought I was important to a male figure. The problem was, a couple months into the relationship the attention turned sexual. From the ages of 11 and 18, I was a victim of sexual abuse. But to this 11-year old little boy, it didn't feel like abuse.\n \n Haley has already begun to play psychiatrist here. (Anyone have his bio? Is he qualified?) Truthfully, it's regrettable that he was victimized in this manner and that he did not have a loving father. HOWEVER, these things do NOT \"make\" a homosexual.\n \n There are plenty of men (perhaps MILLIONS) that were molested and/or had terrible relationships with their fathers who are NOT homosexuals. And there are plenty of homosexuals (perhaps MILLIONS) that were NOT molested and/or DID have GREAT relationships with their fathers.\n \n Haley is walking you down his primrose path here, but it's NOT leading toward a homosexual orientation. Notice that he's carefully avoiding mentioning that he did not experience what virtually EVERY gay man and lesbian has experienced... a SPONTANEOUS attraction to same-gender relationships.\n \n It is well known that, if left untreated, the trauma of child sexual abuse (CSA) can result in \"sexual confusion.\" The symptoms of sexual confusion are NOT a naturally occurring sexual orientation (homo-bi-hetero).\n \n Watch what he says:\n \n  And I was so starving for male affirmation and attention that, when this man offered me the bitterness of sexual abuse, it met a need in my life. [...] Now mind you, this was happening to me from the age of 11 to the age of 18. I was growing up in the church. As a matter of fact, I was that kid in the youth group that every youth pastor would have wanted. But it was a very confusing time for me. The problem was, the attitude from the pulpit of the church that I was raised in was there was a hotter place in hell for gays and lesbians. So church began to become a very uncomfortable place for me as a young boy that was struggling with same-sex attraction. \n \n See what he's doing? For the FIRST TIME in his missive, the term \"same-sex attraction\" gets just tossed in. Being MOLESTED is NOT THE SAME THING as \"same-sex attraction.\" However, he wants you to BELIEVE that \"same-sex attraction\" is a direct result of \"sexual abuse.\" But for the overwhelming majorities of homosexual (and bisexual) persons, that's absolute hogwash.\n \n Well, at the age of 16, I sought a counselor at the school and shared with her what I was feeling. And she said, \"Mike, from everything I understand about the issue of homosexuality, this is how you were born. This is how God has made you, so to live a healthy productive life, you're going to need to embrace that.\"\n \n But did he tell her that he was being ABUSED?!!! Did he tell her that he \"desperately wanted to know that [he] fit into the man's world?!!!\" Or did he just say: \"I'm having sex with this guy and I like it?\" Considering his admitted reluctance to speak about what was going on in his life, I have to wonder just how open and honest he was with this counselor. HAD he told her that he was being molested since age 11, it would have been criminal for her to respond like that. But clearly, Haley wants us to believe that the scientific/medical establishment \"steered\" him into \"homosexuality.\"\n \n So I decided that I would test the gay community; I went to a gay bar for the very first time at the age of 16. [...]\n \n First, that was a personal decision.\n \n Second, Haley's defamatory stereotyping is getting really tiresome. There's a heck of a lot more to the \"gay community\" than \"gay bars,\" but you wouldn't know it from what he says.\n \n Third... what the heck is he doing going to ANY kind of bar at age 16?! Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that the drinking age has ever been below 18 years old (in this time frame). He allegedly spent 12 years \"doing the gay thing,\" and has allegedly been speaking against it since 1992. That means this was 1980 or earlier. I was 16yo in 1976 and at that time, the drinking age (in NY) was 18yo. This suggests to me that Haley either lied about his age, or looked older than 16yo.\n \n [...] I'll never forget that first time I walked into a gay bar. I felt like I had come home.\n \n Really? The first time that I walked into a gay bar, I was afraid that someone would see me.\n \n Here were people that understood me. Here were people that didn't judge me. Here were people that didn't ridicule me.\n \n Here were people getting loaded, listening to pounding disco music, and trying to get into your pants. Should've tried the Youth Center instead, Mikey.\n \n It was very different than what I felt as I sat in the pews of church where I felt as though I didn't fit in.\n \n ***pffft*** No [kidding], Sherlock.\n \n One of the things that I did when I was involved in the gay community is I looked for that long-term monogamous relationship that the gay community often promises. I wasn't finding it.\n \n Who the heck \"promised\" you a \"long term relationship?\" Gay or otherwise? That's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.\n \n Yanno... it's a good thing that I wasn't in the audience when Haley was spouting this ****. I'm the kind of person that hollers at the television, and I don't think there's any way that I could have kept silent or still in the face of such nonsense.\n \n [...] I went through relationship after relationship. I continually thought that I could find what would make me happy. [...]\n \n You mean like every other socially active single person in the World? What's wrong with that? There are very few \"eureka\" moments in intimate personal relationships... and even those are usually misguided. Finding a \"soul mate\" takes a lot of work... and we already know that Haley was (most likely) \"looking for love in all the wrong places\"... but that's nobody's fault but his own.\n \n So far he's tried to blame: his father, his molester, his church, his counselor; and, in some obscure way, the \"gay community.\" \n \n Ever hear the phrase \"personal responsibility,\" Mikey? 16 plus 12 equals 28, and by the time you're 28 years old, you're supposed to take responsibility for yourself. Okay, you're still suffering from the trauma of your molestation... sorry to hear it, but don't try to blame the \"gay community\" for that. Now it's YOU making choices.\n \n I didn't believe there was anything else because I had bought into the lie that I was born gay.\n \n You mean that counselor that you (most likely) were not completely open and honest with? Her fault again? Stop blaming others for YOUR \"acting out.\"\n \n And that was the problem. There was no possibility of change for me.\n \n Oh, there was AMPLE opportunity for change... starting with YOU deciding to go to a QUALIFIED mental health professional and being honest about your history and demeanor. They COULD have helped... if you had only made that choice.\n \n So it was very difficult. I would go home to visit my family during these times because I wanted to be around my family. But I couldn't stand them because they were Christians.\n \n And I'm sure that the audience was just eating this up... \"Oh yes, the gay people hate us Christians... we suffer so from their animosity, amen.\"\n \n The detestable hypocrisy is that Haley is now EMPLOYED by so-called \"Christian\" organizations that ATTACK gays at every turn... and Haley is part and parcel of that. Just look at the title of the original article: VICTORY over homosexuality by Jerry Falwell... the guy that blamed gays for September 11.\n \n It's so OBVIOUSLY adversarial that ANY attempt to seem caring or loving of gays should be quickly dismissed.\n \n [...] And I didn't want to be around them too long because their light shined on my darkness. [...]\n \n In other words, your \"Christian\" family did not accept you. Is that it?\n \n [...] So I'd go home for my sisters' weddings or I'd go home for the birth of a newborn niece or nephew and I'd hold those nieces and nephews in my arms and my heart would just break because I desperately wanted what I saw in the lives of my sisters. [...]\n \n Oh, REALLY?! Heterosexual procreation seemed very appealing to you?\n \n Michael Haley... you were NEVER gay. You were most certainly traumatized, abused, and confused... but you were never gay. And therefore... you cannot be \"ex-gay,\" since you were never gay to begin with.\n \n Now tell us how confused you were...\n \n [...] I was doing injectable steroids. I was bulimic because I had to have the perfect physique. And I lived on that treadmill. It was very tiring. [...]\n \n All (misguided) personal choices that have nothing to do with a sexual orientation.\n \n [...] But I became a gay activist and began to fight for the rights of \"my people.\" [...]\n \n And now you are a shill for fighting AGAINST the rights of gay people.\n \n Thanks for NOTHING.\n \n [...] If you ever want to find a group of Christians, all you have to do is show up at a gay pride parade. [...]\n \n Yes, these so-called \"Christians\" are remarkably confrontational. Ever hear of Fred Phelps? Steve Bennett? Michael Marcavage? Those two guys that tried to waltz around at the Rhea County \"Gay Day\" festival with TEN FOOT TALL CROSSES? (Etc, etc, et al.)\n \n One of the most blatant hypocrisies is when these so-called \"Christian\" activists claim to be \"non-confrontational\"... especially when bearing such False Witness is what they would call a SIN... one of the \"Big Ten,\" if you know what I mean.\n \n Haley is doing quite a lot of presenting such False Witness in this diatribe... clearly implying that his exceptional experiences and choices are somehow emblematic of gay folks everywhere.\n \n I wonder what kind of salary he pulls down from FOF and Exodus... Paulk was reportedly getting about $65K per year when HE got caught frolicking in a gay bar...\n \n [...] Play it ahead a few years. I'm in my late 20s now. One night, I found myself in a gay gym in Southern California. I was headed toward an illicit situation with another man. We got out to his car and he said, \"I'm sorry that I've led you on but I'm a Christian and I'm trying to walk away from this.\" And I just unleashed venom on this poor guy, and condemned Christianity. [...]\n \n Actually, you would have just gotten out the car and gone home, like every disappointed \"date\" would have done... but your story is just so unbelievable and non-representative that you may as well just go with it...\n \n But he said, \"Would you just get in my car and listen to what I have to say?\" [NO, YOU FREAK! would be the typical response.] So by this point, I had nothing else to lose. [Having already lost your mind?] I got into his car and we began to drive around and he started talking about the root cause of his same-sex attraction, how he too had not bonded with his father, how he too had been ridiculed in high school and called \"***\" and \"*****\" and \"sissy.\" And he explained that he too had been sexually abused.\n \n Amazing... you hop into a stranger's car for some hot, sweaty man-sex... you STAY there even after immediately learning that you're not going to GET ANY... AND this random stranger has a story remarkably similar to your own.\n \n Let's see how far you can stretch the boundaries of credulity...\n \n We pulled into a parking lot and he was going on and on about this man that was counseling him; this man's name was Jeff Konrad. And all of a sudden his eyes got really big and he said, \"Oh my goodness, there's Jeff right now!\" [...]\n \n In other words, Haley was most likely \"set up.\" He got caught in a \"Christian\" \"sting\" operation, but has convinced himself (and is trying to convince his audience) that it was all some kind of cosmic coincidence...\n \n (Give him a break... he's paid to do this...)\n \n Yanno... even if it WAS a cosmic coincidence... this just reinforces the fact that Haley is IN NO WAY representative of the gay population at large. His story seems exceptional because it IS exceptional.\n \n [...] He brought Jeff over and that night started a five-year godly mentoring relationship with this man named Jeff Konrad; he would not leave me alone. He committed to me for five years even though I continually tried to escape him. [...]\n \n That's usually called \"stalking\"...\n \n [...] I packed up every earthly belonging that I owned in a little white convertible Cabriolet -- couldn't have been a \"gayer\" car! [...]\n \n Mazda Miata... Chrysler Sebring... the \"New Beetle\"...\n \n In December 1989, I left homosexuality.\n \n In other words, you stopped having gay sex... since you were never gay to begin with... well, good for you.\n \n [...] I'd be dealing with some issues, my sexual abuse issues, some of my father wounds.[...]\n \n Which have nothing to do with being gay in the first place...\n \n [...] Well, often on the way home from counseling, the only way that I knew how to comfort myself was through a sexual encounter. So often on the way home from counseling, I would engage in a sexual encounter. [...]\n \n This guy is a John Paulk or Mike Johnston in the making. If he really IS gay, then he's just deluding himself about \"changing\" his sexual orientation. Sleeping in a garage does not make one an automobile.\n \n [...] It's not a whole lot different from what happens to someone that has any other coping mechanism, whether it is alcohol or drugs. When they are uncomfortable, they don't know what to do, they go back to that which is familiar. And homosexual behavior was familiar for me and that's what made me feel comfortable. [...]\n \n There's a good little sock-puppet... here's your check.\n \n [...] Well, finally Jeff said to me, \"Mike, there's a conference that I want you to go to. This conference is called Exodus. The year was 1990, and I went and I will never forget it as long as I live. [...]\n \n Considering that you're now employed by Exodus... here's another check.\n \n [...] Remember me talking about the feeling I had the very first time I walked into a gay bar? How I felt that I had come home? [...]\n \n Yup... I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now...\n \n [...] Well, multiply that by about a million and this is what I felt in this room. [...]\n \n With Exodus... upon which your financial well-being now rests... yeah, right, whatever.\n \n See... at this point we are about neck-deep in ****. This is past hip-boots, it's past life jackets... only Coast Guard helicopters can save you from Haley now...\n \n [...] Here was a room of 800 people that knew how much they needed the Lord. They had same-sex attractions that they didn't want. [...]\n \n And about 798 of them got ripped off...\n \n [...] They knew that those attractions had led them into things that they ultimately couldn't justify with their faith. And when you take a group of people like that and you offer them worship, it is worship like you have never experienced in your life. [...]\n \n Mike Haley, Steve Bennett, Warren Throckmorton (etc, etc)... \"worship\" CDs available from Time-Life and Columbia House... everyone's making a buck on \"faith\"... (even though \"worship\" is one of the most hugely PIRATED artistic forms... once again belying the fabricated and commercial nature of \"traditionalism.\")\n \n [...] Well, I later got accepted into a Christ-centered residential program that helps men and women walk away from homosexuality. [...]\n \n So you stopped having gay sex... what do you want, a medal? (Or a free CD?)\n \n Dude... your story is quite remarkable... and it STILL has absolutely NOTHING to do with folks that are genuinely gay.\n \n [...] One of the first Sundays that I was there, the pastor took 21 of us and stood us up in front of the congregation and said, \"These are the individuals that want to walk away from homosexuality.\" He got back in the pulpit, crossed his arms and said, \"And what are you, as a congregation, going to do about it?\" People got out of their pews. They came forward. They laid hands on us. [...]\n \n That's just creepy...\n \n [...] Soon, I had gone 365 days sexually sober. [...]\n \n Better than going decades deluded...\n \n [...] because two years before I left homosexuality I was arrested for prostitution. [...]\n \n See, these are common denominators in the \"ex-gay\" movement... Molestation, familial abandonment, rebellion, delusion, deception, drug and alcohol abuse, poor self-image, poor self-confidence, an overwhelming desire to \"belong\"... steroids, prostitution, lying... all sorts of nasty stuff... these are just NOT healthy people.\n \n I'll readily admit that \"finding Christ\" is apparently a good thing... for THEM...\n \n But when they try to imply... and especially when they GET PAID to imply... that ALL gay folks are somehow like THEM... I must vociferously protest.\n \n Because these people are freaks... RECOVERING freaks perhaps... but freaks nonetheless...\n \n [...] When they find a sexual arrest on your record, they tend to not want to let you be around kids. [...]\n \n So Mike Haley, spokes-model for the \"ex-gay\" industry, is a registered sex offender? Why am I not surprised?\n \n [...] So nine months later I was a youth pastor! [...]\n \n Again... Why am I not surprised?\n \n [...] A couple years later I got a call from Focus on the Family. And they said they had a job for me. And I thought, [...]\n \n \"... you'll PAY ME for this?!\"\n \n [...] All those years as a gay activist, I hated Dr. Dobson and Focus on the Family. I hated Dr. Jerry Falwell. [...]\n \n \"Oh yes, the gay people hate us Christians... we suffer so from their animosity, amen.\"\n \n [...] So I turned the job down three times. But I began to realize that I needed to apply for the job. And I took the job at Focus on the Family. [...]\n \n Because you needed the money?\n \n [...] We moved to Colorado Springs. [...]\n \n And joined the Colorado Colon Clenchers...\n \n \n \n \n Look... I simply cannot take this guy seriously. \n \n First, I don't think that he was ever gay.\n \n Second, if he was... then he still IS... and he'll then be another dramatic failure, just like almost everyone else that tries to go \"ex-gay.\"\n \n Third, he's getting PAID to do this... just like OJ Simpson was paid to do commercials for Hertz.\n \n Finally... regardless if he was or was not gay... he is oh so OBVIOUSLY NOT REPRESENTATIVE of the gay population at large... even though THAT is the clear implication of his anecdote, and of the political motivations of his employers.\n \n Everyone should give him a couple of air-kisses for procreating... and then move on to some REAL issues...\n \n I just don't feel like dealing with an infomercial today...",
