   "Last night Sinjin called me a Andy Warhol Catholic, I think he nailed it perfect. I have a problems with my religious beliefs because one I married a atheist, two I dabbled in so many religions I had a chance to like something from all of them....\n But what I really love is anything that shall we say sticks it to the Catholic religion the most. Now don't get me wrong if I were to convert to any religion right now it would be Catholic, I was baptized Catholic but never confirmed.\n let me give you an example.... The movie Stigmata.. I loved it, I loved the ending and the message, to me that was so powerful. I also like the whole stigmata thing, if that were even true, and I have a hard time believing it.\n I like all movies that bring out the weirdness in the religion... The Exorcist has to be the greatest all time horror flick and I think Pezuzu is cool. OK I am demented I know this. \"The Body\" with Antonio Banderas was also cool just because it gives that \"what if\" scenario.\n Now don't laugh... But Jesus Christ Superstar is an all time fav of mine. I have the soundtrack in my car and can be often heard on the 405 singing it as loud as I can. hmm maybe that's why traffic sucks ;) \n I like all the Saints, Gods, Goddesses, and just about any deity you can think from just about anywhere.. If you were to come into my house, Everything is represented. I sort of have little shrines to everyone..\n I would dare to say I like the \"romance\" of religion but those of us who read a certain thread know that will stir someone's pot a little too much (insert sarcastic grin here)\n So is there anyone who feels this way or am I just a freak?\n I live morally, ethically, love my fellow man, do good deeds for others etc etc but I cant get a hold of immaculate conception, babies born as sinners, my cats will not go to heaven etc etc.. So I how can I embrace the Catholic religion and not really believe everything it stands for..\n Would it not be fair for me to take my first communion if I did not hold these things to my heart, and why do I need to embrace it in the first place.\n so with all that\n Is religion a hobby?",

By practicing it, people get different sorts of outcomes and feelings from it. Some go to church because they were brought up doing that, and feel out of their \"skin\", if they dont continue going to church. Others go to keep a social status or \" appearance\" and to put themselves in a better \"light\" among their peers. ... \n \n Others go purely for the sake of seeing to it that their children will at least be given a exposure to religion, and as their kids grow up, they will have at the very least, a basic understanding of religion. Then, those same kids that grew up, can rationally make their own choice to live , or not live , the religion they grew up in. Then, there is the best category of them all, the ones I like the best, the true believers, the ones that know in their heart their religion, they feel it, are committed to it, and really have no appearances to keep up, no peer pressure being felt. They go because of the fellowship they will have with the other true believers in their faith at the church. They go to church because the Body of Christ will be present, to nourish those that came through the doors heavy in spirit, and laden with the past weeks trials, yet will leave light hearted, and with renewed inspiration. ... \n \n I personally beleive that receiving Communion as a agnostic, will not leave burns on your tongue in the shape of a cross. :) When I was dating my fiance back in 1975, I went to church with her and her family on Easter, and they were Catholics. (I had to keep the brownie count up , ya know :) ) I was 23 at the time, was raised a baptist , and had never set foot in a Catholic church. As I sit thru the whole ceremonial thing, and it just seemed like hours of watching nothing but the preist put a white dolly over a glass of wine . Then he would wave his hand across it, uncover it, then drink it, a LOT of drinks as I recall. :)\n \n All of a sudden the theme changed , and people started standing up, and going single file to the altar. I started thinking to myself, nope , I am not going up there , because I dont know what they are doing up there. I was seated between my future bro -in laws , so the older one kneed me, and nodded for me to get up. So I went, fell in line and marched up to where they were headed. Then I watched as people would stand in front of the preist, then he would make a cross at them by air sketching, then stick something on their tongue, then the tongue stuck person would exit stage right. By this time I was ready to haul butt, but was between bro -in laws in line. I made peace with myself thinking, what the heck, maybe his hands are clean, and a nabisco cracker might be good about now...\n \n \n So I got up to the preist, he airsketched crossed me, I stuck out my tongue , ready for that salty Nabisco, but whoa !, it was a styrofoam wafer !!!. I just about barfed on the stage ! I made a hasty retreat out to the side door, and spit the thing on the ground. My gal told me later that I should not have gone up to the altar, because they were taking \"Communion\" . I told her I didnt know what they were doing , I just knew a knee prompted me to get up and go at the time... \n \n I told her that it looks like if the preist didnt drink so much wine, the church might be able to afford real Nabisco crackers. Well, after that statement there was no parking in the moonlight for me with her that night. :( And also, I didnt get scars on my tongue for being a Baptist taking Communion in a Catholic church. :) P.S. This post is NOT a slam at the Catholic religion, just a true story of a ignorant redneck boy that, at that time, would do ANY thing for the love of his life, :)",

   "I don't think it's a hobby, not in the purest sense of the word. If I were to play psychoanalyst--and I'm very bad at this--I'd call it a fascination with an element of human psyche you're no longer relating to. \n \n If this is true, why on earth would you consider receiving first communion? That practice is the most intimate of all to religious-minded individuals, and if I remember correctly, Catholics believe it is the real flesh and blood of Jesus that one has just consumed. Since I shed my faith, I cannot even watch the practice without it giving me the willies. Even listening to the congregation in unison repeat, say, the Nicene creed has a zombie-like feel to me. \n \n Continuing with my analysis, I will venture to say the shrines you adorn your home with will become less important over time as you continue your journey, in your own way, to truth. I'd say you're on the path, and that's the most important thing.",
