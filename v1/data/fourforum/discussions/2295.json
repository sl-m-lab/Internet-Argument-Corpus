I can never recall hearing one Jew call the other Jew something dealing with the Holocaust. That's absurd. Slavery was totally different than the Holocaust. Slaves were taken, not so we could kill them because we hated blacks, but rather to work on farms and help with physical labor. The Holocaust occurred because a group of people hated Jews and decided to round up all of them in their own country and kill them, often brutally. I don't know the exact number, but I know there were not even close to 6 million slaves killed by our hands. And slavery existed for over 100 years. The Holocaust existed for a few years, yet over 6 million Jews and millions of others were killed only because of their race or color. I can't believe you would make that terrible comparison to a Jewish person like that. \n \n Well if blacks can call each other niggers because they are the same color and it reminds them of slavery, how come a black person can call a white person a \"honky\", \"redneck\", and \"cracker\" (which could offend a white person whose ancestors may have been one of these) and it's ok? You never hear white people calling each other crackers, but you hear blacks call each other niggers. Hypothetical situation. If a white person killed a black person because he called him a cracker, Jesse Jackson would be all over the news bitching about how he was discriminated against because he's black. Turn the table and let a white person call a black person a nigger. The black guy shoots the white guy and it's ok because \"nigger\" is a defamatory word and it reminded the black guy of slavery. I don't understand this. Is it okay for minorities to offend the majority just because of something that our ancestors did over 150 years ago? I don't think it is.",

   "its never good for anybody to be racist, ryan, and hauling. i agree with both of you on that. but the thing is that blacks in general dont perceive the use of the word as racist, unless its from white people in particular. that indeed is reverse racism, and personally i wouldnt mind if everybody in the world were free to use it. but the majority of black people disagree, so thats why my advice was to simply stay away from the word\n \n its like the word \"stupid\". it would obviously be offense, even abusive to call a small child stupid. however, teenagers compliment each other with that word, since it means they are radical or cool. the word itself is not the problem, but the meaning in the context used.\n \n like i said, to me, if someone says \"nigga/nigger\" to me, it depends on how they say it and in what context that i would take it as offensive, but not solely because of the race of te person that said it. but thats just me\n\n \n \n \n \n I didn't know you could possibly call someone stupid, but yet be using it to comment them. \"Hey, great job on that test stupid @ss.\" I don't agree with you at all. If blacks don't like it when people use the word nigger, maybe they should stop saying it and other people will take notice and do the same.",

My best friend is black, and me being white, I was mystified about a few things in black culture. I asked her why it was that black people will call each other nigger. She told me that they used it sort of as a way to demean the word itself. It had been used as an insult by whites against blacks during slavery and during the whole period of segregation, and now they are sort of reclaiming it and turning what was a verbal weapon into a sort of joke.\n I can see how that works, but I mean, really, if such a nasty word had been used towards me or my ancestors, I think I would not want to hear it again.",

Blacks use nigger between each other as a commonality with their past and backgrounds of being \"set apart\" from other people, it is a kinship word, sorta. \n \n Rappers notoriously say nigga, to put out the harlem, ghetto, rough life and law evading aspect that many blacks have lived.
