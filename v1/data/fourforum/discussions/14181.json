   "I just came across this document written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr....\n very interesting.\n \n \n 'Prior to 1989, American preschoolers generally received only three vaccinations, given in up to eleven injections: DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, and MMR (measles/mumps/rubella). In the early 1990's, public health officials dramatically increased the number of thimerosal-containing vaccinations, including hepatitis B, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) and Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae type b), without considering the cumulative impact of the mercury load on developing brains.20 Federal officials instituted a requirement for a hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth when a child's brain is most susceptible to toxic effects.21 According to Professor Dr. Boyd Haley, the chair of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky and one of the world's leading authorities on mercury toxicity, an infant receiving the hepatitis B inoculation would have to weigh 275 pounds to bear its mercury loading at \n EPA's safety standards.'\n http://www.robertfkennedyjr.com/docs/ThimerosalScandalFINAL.PDF",

Ok ok, it has words in the video but still you are better off asking me to watch and read. Anyway, pointing me to a conspiracy theorist video doesn't really help your cause. \n \n Now I'm not one to totally dismiss a scientific claim simply because it is in the minority but in this case we have the benefit of being able to test the hypothesis and see a conclusion fairly conclusively. From what I have seen their is no evidence Thiomersal found in vaccines causes autism. Furthermore, they have been out of vaccines for some time yet autism rates are going up at an even higher rate. Finally, the first person cited in your biased, no factual video is Mark Geier who is the ONLY one (that is relevant) to have a study suggesting a link and is the ONLY study that has been basically discredited for poor scientific skills. \n \n This isn't evolution or global warming...this theory is easily tested and the results are in...you fail.",
