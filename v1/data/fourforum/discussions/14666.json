   "The butchery began with Columbus. He slaughtered the native people of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) by unimaginably brutal means. His soldiers tore babies from their mothers and dashed their heads against rocks. They fed their dogs on living children. On one occasion they hung 13 Indians in honour of Christ and the 12 disciples, on a gibbet just low enough for their toes to touch the ground, then disembowelled them and burnt them alive. Columbus ordered all the native people to deliver a certain amount of gold every three months; anyone who failed had his hands cut off. By 1535 the native population of Hispaniola had fallen from eight million to zero: partly as a result of disease, partly due to murder, overwork and starvation.\n\n Avatar: A Chilling Metaphor For European Butchery Of The Americas < NewHeavenNewEarth\n \n Happy Christopher Columbus Day!",

   "Very nice technique Easy. \n \n Can't kick the ball through the uprights from mid-field with your SCOTUS nonsense, so you run up to the endzone and throw it over with your \"well I think it is\" argument. \n \n Bravo. \n \n According to the Council for Secular Humanism (a farily reliable source on what secular humanism is):\n \n \nSecular humanism is a comprehensive, nonreligious lifestance incorporating:\n \n >> A naturalistic philosophy \n >> A cosmic outlook rooted in science \n >> A consequentialist ethical system \n Let's examine these items one by one:\n \n A comprehensive, nonreligious lifestance.\n Secular humanism is comprehensive, touching every aspect of life including issues of values, meaning, and identity. Thus it is broader than atheism, which concerns only the nonexistence of god or the supernatural. Important as that may be, there's a lot more to life ... and secular humanism addresses it.\n \n Secular humanism is nonreligious, espousing no belief in a realm or beings imagined to transcend ordinary experience..\n\n Council for Secular Humanism\n \n While the 9th Circuit may have stated that those espousing a secular humanist philosophy deserve the same protection and rights under the constitution as do religious groups, it in no way states that secular humanism can or should be classed as a religion.",
