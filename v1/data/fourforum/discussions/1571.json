I consider it bad form to pose such a question as this and not provide your own viewpoint.

Please provide your contentions to this thread. My own contention is that the steriotyplical roles that men and women hold in this world is the main contributory factor in who commits certain crimes. I do agree with Epaphras that crime is not entirely a male event, however it is more skewed towards men, especially the crimes you mention. However, there are certain crimes more skewed towards women, look up the statistics. The gender role that we assume from birth makes one particular sex more prone to certain types of crime (not to say that some people don't go against the norms).

   "To ensure demand for its product, the system of sexual exploitation strives to make its businesses attractive and accessible to its potential customers, almost entirely men and male youth. It appeals to their conflicted sexual desires with a variety of images of its \"commodity\": some people paint a picture of glamorous, harmless, uncomplicated fun among consenting equals; others speak to the excitement of crossing forbidden boundaries, to becoming or being \"a man,\" or to sexual addictions and aberrations (such as child pornography, pedophilia, bestiality, sadomasochism, or orgies). It offers a hierarchy of providers for different budgets. It provides videos for hotel rooms and \"call girls\" for the traveler, establishes its businesses near military bases, entices customers to exotic places for \"sex tourism,\" and offers \"mail-order brides\" who often end up in prostitution or as personal sex slaves.4 The system of sexual exploitation makes its products known through ads in city and community newspapers, telephone directories, sex guides, flyers, and by word of mouth, and has found in the Internet an effective new tool for advertising. In a sex-saturated culture where the media celebrate casual sex, featuring increasingly explicit sex scenes, and advertisements sell products through the allure of sexuality, the system of sexual exploitation thrives and flourishes...http://www.elca.org/dcs/commercial_sexual_exploitation.html",

My first post answered the question you desire to know, but you're not searching deep enough. \n You're also trying to make comparisons between two completely, entirely different genders. We both have different chemistry and different things drive each sex in a different fashion. Women naturally have no interest in pornography, or they do, but they're not as acclimated to it as men are for their usual role in sex and the fact that they usually don't desire sex as much as men do.\n Instinctively, men strive to procreate; it's natural for a man to get aroused or to have his desires escalate as it is our reason for existence. We're here to reproduce and the bearer of the seed is the man. We simply have to plant it, but many women don't wish to carry children.\n The answer's simplistic and even the most juvenile could discover the answer to such a foolish question. Men are targetted in this area because they are susceptible to succumbing to their hormones. Women simply aren't as easily lured in to these things, hence, the companies aim to make men their customers. It makes perfect sense to me, since it is more natural for man to have his sexual tendencies ascend.",

Where males have higher rates of constant assaults on children, If  not  the Sex, Sex, Sex, Sex, Sex....... what is it? woo me with your deepness\n \n \n \nWomen naturally have no interest in pornography, or they do, but they're not as acclimated to it as men are for their usual role in sex and the fact that they usually don't desire sex as much as men do.\n\n \n \n \n Yeah right.. Eve introduced sex to we mammels, don't ever forget it\n \n \n \n \n \nInstinctively, men strive to procreate;it's natural for a man to get aroused or to have his desires escalate as it is our reason for existence.\n\n \n \n \n Likewise the female\n \n \n \n We're here to reproduce and the bearer of the seed is the man. We simply have to plant it, but many women don't wish to carry children.\n\n \n \n So what's the alternative?\n \n \n \n \nThe answer's simplistic and even the most juvenile could discover the answer to such a foolish question. Men are targetted in this area because they are susceptible to succumbing to their hormones.\n\n \n \n You mean weakminded? Would you say this was justification for the sex devils the sex industry{ the breeder) creates\n \n \n \n \nWomen simply aren't as easily lured in to these things, hence, the companies aim to make men their customers.\n \n \n \n If only temptation was a sexist pig?\n \n \n \nIt makes perfect sense to me, since it is more natural for man to have his sexual tendencies ascend.\n\n \n Descend, more accurate, and to what degree? Promiscuity to the infinity? \n \n Simple degradation-that makes perfect sense",

There are som falsities in it and there were some erroneous translations. You also must consider it was likely concocted to keep order and build a social infrastructure into society.

Men are prone to sexual acts because we're naturally more aggressive. Many of our problems can be ascribed to over-active instances of testosterone and other distinctions in our chemical build up. You don't understand that biologically men are NATURALLY more aggressive, and you can't refute that with empty claims your Bible makes. These devious acts are attributed to our natural buildup. You'll find that many female participants in nature are also unwilling, because in many species the male is naturally more aggressive.

Would you say this was justification for the sex devils the sex industry{ the breeder) creates\n\n \n Yes, men are weak-minded because we are unable to coax innate hormones into submission. It's not something easily controlled for some men, especially men with imbalances or who grew up receiving haughty abuse from their parents. Sadistical and abusive parents create rapists, perhaps that's the point you should be arguing.\n Another thing you might want to note is that many times in the Bible women were slain for their deviousness.

I'd say commercial sex's role in these atrocities is minimal. I'd put a lofty portion of the crimes committed on fear in society and physically degrading punitive actions. Violence creates a load of fear which over the time - if un-counseled - can turn into wanton, vengeances where the victim plays out a sort of scenario that resembles how it played-out when he/she was the victim. \n Commercial sex is international, and I'm certain there are many countries that have a prevalency of commercial sex and still maintain a low crime statistic. Many countries live without censorship or with loosely enforced censorship. I think you're barking up the wrong tree and making inquiries as to the origin of these problems. It's not just commercial sex, it's got a lot to do with domestic problems that weren't averted in childhood or a rough, turmoil-filled upbringing. Most psychiatric evaluations do not connect commercial sex to their problems, but rather past incidents that circumstantially brought about their murderous acts.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I'm not personally a proponent of things that objectify women at the expense of horny men, but to divest them of this right would be unconstitutional and interference of basic rights.",

   "\n AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF COMMERCIAL SEX IS ABOUT PROCREATION?\n\n \n You're obviously very clueless here. Procreation is basically sexual intercourse, the act of copulation. I'm asserting that these acts of incest and rape are not in fact products of commercial sex, but innate desires. Please stop with the misconstrusions.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Better than Sexual lust without boundries? And you refered to males as weak-minded or was it MEN?,.... Alhemizers kicking in?\n\n \n I didn't declare men weak-minded. You construed my words in a way that suited you and told me what you interpreted - which was incorrect. You're acting very feeble-minded and your comprehension is protrusively very bad.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI DON'T SEE Rape/Paraphilia in the animal kingdom. Monkeys raping giraffes?\n\n \n What the hell? Who said anything about sexual desires breaching the species' boundaries? You're so psychotic.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI wonder why? Imagine how kids must be feeling, perhaps they should determine the penalty of their victimizer?\n\n \n Perhaps not. As an ardent, fervent Christian you should be condemning punishment and allow man to absolve himself through redemption or repenting to God. If you want people to conform, then go do it. Punishment has been existent for thousands and thousands of years. If it's so successful then why are crimes of cruelty still so prevalent? It's indubitably our methods and arbitrary means of punishment.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If I was.. would that be better or worse than being a sex addict?\n\n \n It depends, a sex addiction can generate the apex of gratification, without too many side-effects so long as the participants are careful.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe government creates its own problem by legalizing Sex, yet, when kids/women become prey to sex addicts, the laws are ineffective...\n\n \n The laws for sex-offenders are very harsh and severe. In Florida you can be put to death for sexual offense, in most other countries you can be locked away for decades as a minimal charge after conviction. You're trying to tie in commercial sex with the misfortunes that plague our culture, but as I've reiterated several times it is not producing these crimes. Please stop going back to your faulty, unfounded arguments that have no real premise.\n \n \n \nPerhaps the weakminded homosnakenins might evolute when the genitalia is on the chopping board? \n\n \n You're foolish if you believe that duress is an acceptable method of foiling sexual deviations, because it doesn't. Fear tactics really don't work, and they usually increase the crimes committed rather than act as a deterrent. Your mind is very discombobulated, perhaps you should sleep?\n \n \n \nThe weak minded might actually[/b] think before they act?[/b] It's not that hard to grasp\n\n \n Yes, and that holds true in states that exercise the death penalty. If you study it meticulously you'll conclude that states exerting the death penalty also have a substantially higher number of annual homocides. This proves coercion is not successful, and when we finally reach that catalyst of alteration in style of punishment these crimes will, perhaps, abate.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJust name all  bad that will befall us from abolishing commercial sex? Plagues, Curses, ect....... \n\n \n Masogynism may actually heighten if we did this. Although women would be emancipated from objectification men would have to resort to other methods of releasing their desires - especially the aggressive men. Women would be worse off if commercial sex was abolished.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So tell me this, before you go, does the devils who sell Sex, Sex, Sex, contribute funds to the Medical Community / Scientist/ for risking their health? While dealing with all the disease acquired from all that Sex, Sex, Sex?\n\n \n There are forms of contraceptives that can act as prevention to any possible disease or ailments that can come from sexual intercourse, but other than that, no. They're very corrupt, but it's not really a direct link so there's no way to prosecute them. We have the choice to invest in the paraphernalia they sell.\n \n \nIs it a mind boggling mystery why AIDS is highest amongst the male gender?\n\n \n The rectum is not an organ of copulation, therefore it is no large wonder that this part of the body is not an intended recipient of semen. It's not hard to figure out; God didn't plant seeds in the buttocks of homosexuals as punishment.\n \n I'm mentally fatigued from \"arguing\" this. Your endless retorts that almost always come in the form of some question or useless conjecture really destroys the whole point of debating. I'm out of this, as you're both incoherent and inattentive.",

   "Males commit sexual perversion more often than females, because sexual perversion is basically just a euphemism for sodomy. It is physiologically impossible for females to sodomize. A female can resist being sodomized, but to not resist is not so much a sign of selfishness as weakness. All the bad things you mention involve sodomy to a large degree, and at any rate, are bad mainly to the extent they involve sodomy. Theoretically, I suppose prostitution could be selfish for a female, but because sodomy pushes so many females into it and makes for so many diseases, it rarely if ever is.\n \n I don't think it is wrong for a male to have sex with many females the way it is wrong for females to have sex with many males. Obviously, there is a biological difference. A male can get a female not his wife pregnant without putting hardly any effort or time into it. Pregnancy is a big deal for a woman, though. Theoretically (assuming child support or common-law marriage is not enjoined), a man won't be hurting his wife present or future by having real sex with females who really love him, the way a wife would be unjustly hurting the male she loves best by having sex with lots of males.\n \n Female selfishness tends to take the form of prudishness, and not excess desire for sexual pleasure. A male is more likely to be selfish if he values sexual pleasure above material pleasure. A female is more likely to be selfish if she values material pleasure above sexual pleasure. The selfish female is not likely going to be the one who gives up a chance at a comfy marriage because she wants sexual pleasure too much to limit her sexual choices by greatly valuing wealth and commitment. No, the selfish female is the one who has the greater likelihood of choosing wealth or commitment over sexual pleasure. Indeed, giving a male sex for procreation without requiring commitment of him is probably going to be especially pleasing to him sexually (he will still have his resources to encourage a more well-loved female into sex), and thus since good people like to please those they love, you would expect good females to more willingly give sex without attaching responsibilities.",
