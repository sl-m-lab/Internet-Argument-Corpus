   "A common Creationist argument is that 'macro'evolution is not 'micro'evolution (quotes included to indicate semantic argument). To paraphrase - 'dogs have adapted, have been bred differently, but have always remained dogs'.\n \n The common response is that the argument is semantic - 'micro' and 'macro' are just labels used by creationists and animals don't change 'species' because hiumanity has labelled them as such. There also hasn't really been time for a 'macro' change to occur. Some animals also have (superficially) changes species - eg wolves to dogs. Finally, fossil records show clear evidence of 'macro'evolution.\n \n However, there is an extra argument, using the Bible. If animals can 'micro'evolve, then assumedly so can humans. However, God has created man 'in his own image'. Given that the 'image' of man has potentially changed drastically over time (compare different breeds of dogs, or of horses), what is the 'true image' of man? It's almost certainly very little like we are today...\n \n In short, even adaptability and 'micro'evolution can provide as much of a scriptural headache as dino-birds and Omphalos, if you assume that the 'image' of man has not changed, or that todays man is in God's image. Any opinions?",

   "Some animals also have (superficially) changes species - eg wolves to dogs. Finally, fossil records show clear evidence of 'macro'evolution.\n\n \n I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species. The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.\n The evolution of the domestic dog \n The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.\n \n In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

   "And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?\n\n The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)\n \n A small exerpt:\n \n \nPlesiadapids: Gingerich (summarized in 1976, 1977) found smooth transitions in plesiadapid primates linking four genera together: Pronothodectes, Nannodectes, two lineages of Plesiadapis, and Platychoerops. In summary: Pronothodectes matthewi changed to become Pro. jepi, which split into Nannodectes intermedius and Plesiadapis praecursor. N. intermedius was the first member of a gradually changing lineage that passed through three different species stages (N. gazini, N. simpsoni, and N. gidleyi). Ples. praecursor was the first member of a separate, larger lineage that slowly grew larger (passing through three more species stages), with every studied character showing continuous gradual change. Gingerich (1976) noted \"Loss of a tooth, a discrete jump from one state to another, in several instances proceeded continuously by continuous changes in the frequencies of dimorphism -- the percentage of specimens retaining the tooth gradually being reduced until it was lost entirely from the population.\" The Plesiadapis lineage then split into two more lineages, each with several species. One of these lineages shows a gradual transition from Plesiadapis to Platychoerops,\"where the incisors were considerably reorganized morphologically and functionally in the space of only 2-3 million years.\"\n\n I think you've never grasped one utterly fundamental point: in evolution there's never been any such thing as a creature that's 'between' species. And if you think that means I'm saying there are no species-to-species transitions, my point is proved: you don't get it.\n \n It's like the seasons: we talk about spring, summer, autumn and winter, but these are just arbitrary discrete terms applied to a continuous phenomenon: the orbit of the earth around the sun. And although you could easily describe a textbook summer day, or a textbook autumn day, and they would be very distinct, not every summer's day is hot and sunny, and not every autumn day is cool and crisp, particularly at the extremes of the seasons.\n \n Similarly, when you demand a fossil 'between' species, it's like you're asking for a day 'between' summer and autumn. It just doesn't work like that. What you actually find is something that could be described as a cool summer's day, or a warm autumn day - in other words, you find days with characteristics that lie somewhere between the stereotypes of summer and autumn. But that day is still a day in its own right. Thus every fossil we find belongs to a species because, at any given moment in time, a species is a particular group of living, successful animals.\n \n What the excerpt above describes - and there are several more in the page I linked - is direct fossil evidence of gradual change, from one season to another as it were. The example of discrete change, where a tooth is lost for instance, still exhibits gradualism: for an extended period the species was dimorphic (like the human race with its brown and blue eyes), with the genes favouring the loss of the tooth slowly prevailing within the population. A bit like seeing the incidence of sunny days decreasing as summer turns into autumn.\n \n Hope that helps!",
