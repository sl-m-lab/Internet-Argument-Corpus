   "Here's a new challenge. You can have Song titles, Album titles, Movie titles, Book titles, Musical titles and TV show titles. It's okay if one has been done a second time, but don't link two titles together a second time. It doesn't matter what genera you use but type it in the title just so we know (There are a few that have a title in more than one genera like Jurassic Park (a book, movie, and a song.)) I'm going to ask that you try and avoid soundtracks for albums. I'll start to make sure everyone knows what I'm talking about. \"The\" \"A\" and \"An\" work as wildcards. You can use them if the previous one ended with A or T but if they didn't, type the title without The/A/An and then type \",The\" or \", A\" or \", An.\" Also, try to avoid greatest hits album titles unless they have a title other than \"Greatest Hits\" or \"Hits\" or \"Very Best Of\" or \"Essentials.\"\n \n TV Show (This would go under Title)\n Quantum Leap",
