   "http://volokh.com/posts/1152293891.shtml \nA commenter on the Usage and Marriage thread perfectly illustrated what I see as the One True Inherent Meaning error as applied to sexual practices. Someone else had written, \"I think that gay sex is in fact natural for gay people. Therefore, I think that gay sex, and gay marriage, would not violate natural law.\" The commenter responded, \"You are simply wrong based on human biology. Tab P goes into slot V not slot B.\"\n \n Well, tab P goes into slot V, except when it doesn't. My guess is that, as a purely descriptive matter, tab P goes into the P-owner's hand many more times, on average, than it goes into slot V. If the most common use (i.e., the norm) defines the One True Inherent Use, then any sex other than masturbation is unnatural.\n \n Ah, the commenter might respond, but that's not the purpose of the penis. The purpose of the penis, either in the sense of what its biological function is, or in the sense of how God designed it (I don't know the commenter's philosophy, so I'm not sure which he'd focus on), is to be inserted into a vagina so as to procreate.\n \n But biology doesn't have \"purposes,\" except in a metaphorical sense. Biology has developed the penis into a multi-functioned organ - it can be used for urination, for sexual pleasure, for emotional bonding, and for reproduction (I list these in what I guess to be decreasing order of actual frequency of use). Likewise for the multi-functioned vagina, though replacing urination with delivery of babies. More broadly, the sexual act is likewise a multi-functioned act. Likewise, biology has developed the mouth into a stunningly multi-functioned organ: It can be used for (among other things) breathing, communicating, consuming sustenance-producing substances, tasting substances to see whether they are wholesome, expelling vomit, kissing, licking stamps, and at least four different kinds of production of pleasure in oneself and others - singing, eating tasty food, stimulating others' nongenital erogenous zones, and stimulating others' genitals.\n \n The anus is a less multi-functioned organ. Still, it can be used not just for elimination of wastes, but also for prostate exams, for gynecological exams, for the administration of medicine to people (often babies) who can't easily keep it down when the medicine is administered orally, and for the relatively accurate determination of body temperature. The latter four functions are of course artifacts of modern medicine, but I doubt that any of us would condemn them as violations of natural law, especially since learning, thinking, and developing new processes is natural for humans. Likewise, the anus can be used for sexual pleasure, and has been used that way by humans for millennia (and is used that way by some animals). Why then treat the anus, the mouth, or the penis as having One True Inherent Purpose rather than recognizing that they can be used in multiple ways, each of which is fully consistent with our biology.\n \n Likewise if one sees the human being as part of God's design, and tries to deduce proper conduct from such design. (I set aside the separate argument that proper conduct should be deduced from supposedly authoritative religious works, such as the Bible - that's not the argument I'm responding to here.) God seems to have designed the human body in such a way that the penis, the mouth, and the anus can be used in lots of different ways; why should we infer, simply from the fact that one use (penile-vaginal sex leading to reproduction) is so important, that it's the One True Proper Use of genitalia? Likewise, God has designed humans in a way that allows some of them to be attracted to members of their own sex; even if you believe that this preference isn't innate, but is caused in part by upbringing or by personal choice, it's clear that the possibility of this preference is indeed present in humans (and, as I said, other animals). This too casts doubt on the theory that penises or the sexual act have One True Inherent Purpose or One True Inherent Mode Of Employment.\n \n Words can have many functions (in the sense of many meanings). Institutions, like marriage, can have many functions. Parts of the body can have many functions. Human practices can have many functions. One can certainly argue that some functions are beneficial and some are harmful. But I see little reason to assume that there can only be one true inherent metaphysical natural function, or to infer that just because one function is very important, all other possible functions are improper or violations of natural (or linguistic) law.\n \n I also commented on the broader \"unnaturalness\" argument three years ago, here: http://volokh.com/2003_03_23_volokh_archive.html#200055515\n",

In real life, I have never known anyone claim being gay was \"unnatural\" who was not also an anti-gay bigot. I have never known anyone accept gay people as equal human beings who also called homosexuality \"unnatural\". The correlation is overwhelming. After all, why claim gays are \"unnatural\" unless one's intent is prejudicial and pejorative?\n \n It's a fact that homosexual behaviour occurs throughout the animal kingdom -- in some species, it's almost a dominant behaviour.

That is a bigoted reason. \nThat is not the only reason...and it is not bigoted. See the threads on that subject elsewhere in this forum.\n \n \n You also said you accept gay people. You cannot explain why anal sex, something directly perceivable in the natural world, an objective reality, is unnatural.\nI have already. You're just not listening.\n \n The fact that animals behave in certain ways does not justify man's similar behavior....else we'd all be justified in killing and eating each other.\n \n A common-sense look at the human body and those of most all the animals pictured in the \"let's follow their lead\" link will, if confined to nature's intended use of body parts lead a sane person to the conclusion that the anus is intended for occasional use as a dump port for materials deemed not suitable for assimilation into new living cells.\n \n Look at the bodies of mammalian creatures. You will find great similarities among species. Males have one penis, intended to be used for urination and sex. Females have one vagina, intended to be used for urination, sex and childbirth. Males and females each have one anus, intended to be used as a gate for release of built up waste materials.\n \n \nA larger percentage of heterosexual participate in anal sex than gay men, fyi. In some catholic countiies anal sex is a birth control method. Teenagers are also known to enjoy anal sex because they don't think of it as intercourse.\nIf a large number of people do it, it must be natural.emoticon_rolleyes \n \n What an idiotic argument.\n \n ...and preteens now think oral sex is not sex...thanks to Slick Willy and his ilk.\n \n Anything involving sexual stimulation is a sex act, baby.\n \n Perhaps the misguided teenagers should look up the definition of intercourse.\n \n BTW, if you respond to me, we're having verbal intercourse. Can you imagine having intercourse with a straight man?\n \n \n \n\n Perhaps some who've never tried anal sex should grant themselves the opportunity to do so. http://www.aneros.com/\nPerhaps some who haven't the will power to overcome hedonistic, animal urges should spend more time reading the classics.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs others have already pointed out, all you are saying here is that you claim to be not anti-gay, just against equal rights for gays (how those aren't the same, I will never know - it is often very hard to twist one's mind to understand what those of your ilk are thinking). And as to the \"I have gay friends so I aren't a biggott, hyuk!\" card, I've got some swampland in Florida to sell ya.\nAsked and answered. You need to get my claims right before you try to rephrase them. It appears often that some posters here do nothing more than learn from each other how to misrepresent someone else's argument. You move to the front of the class.\n \n I am not anti-gay. Gays can have more rights than I for all I care. I've not claimed that gays should have fewer or different sets of rights. They can be had without changing the definition of marriage. This thread is not about marriage.\n \n \n\n First of all, what does my age have to do with anything?\n \n For the record, I'm 47 years old. How old are you?\nIt has to do with what you have experienced to date. There's no need for me to expect you to be as aware as I am of things that happened before your birth. There's no reason for me to expect a pimply-faced teen to understand things that only time will teach them.\n \n It's good that you're 47. I'm 64.\n \n \nWhen you give the impression of it, how is anyone suppose to tell? \nIt was you that created the impression...a strawman tactic used quite frequently by those who really have no sound argument to present.\n \n \n \n\n No, I'm wasting your time because you don't want your sole reason against gays to be stripped from you. \nI have no 'sole reason against gays', whatever you think that is. I have nothing against gays.\n \n \n \n\n Is something that is found in nature without human interaction natural?\n \n Normal people would say yes\n \n \n \n That was pathetic. Even for you. \n \n \n \n You're seriously relying on that? I take back the photoshop response. THIS ONE IS TRULY PATHETIC\n \n You won't admit that things found in nature aren't natural because you know you have nothing else\n \n CRACKPOT ARGUES NATURAL THINGS HE DOESN'T LIKE ARE ACTUALLY UNNATURAL, STAY TUNED MORE AT 10\nAre all of your reactions extreme?\n \n Regarding the animal pictures, some are likely real. I have seen some brilliant taxidermy wherein three rabbits are posed similarly to the deer. Set them in a field, take a snapshot...you'd swear it really happened.\n \n That's all beside the point that JUST BECAUSE ANIMALS DO IT DOESN\"T MAKE IT NATURAL!!\n \n \n\"How dare you call me a homophobe!? I'm not anti-gay! I just don't think gays should have the same rights I do! Some of my best friends are gay, and they know their place!\"\n \n Sheesh.\nQuite catty...and misleading. I've answered this above but will do so again for the benefit of the dense.\n \n Gays are entitlted to every right granted any other citizen...IMHO!!\n \n \nI wonder whatever happened to that thing called the \"golden rule.\"\nIt is alive and well in the hearts of compassionate mankind.\n \n \nIt depends on how they make the argument, with what purpose, and where they take it. In real life, I have never known anyone claim being gay was \"unnatural\" who was not also an anti-gay bigot. I have never known anyone accept gay people as equal human beings who also called homosexuality \"unnatural\". The correlation is overwhelming. After all, why claim gays are \"unnatural\" unless one's intent is prejudicial and pejorative?\n...and I have not claimed that gays are unnatural. I have claimed that anal intercourse is unnatural.\n \n \n\n It's a fact that homosexual behaviour occurs throughout the animal kingdom -- in some species, it's almost a dominant behaviour. Yet only humans are prejudiced against homosexuals. Animals don't seem to care. What does that make homophobes? Natural or unnatural? Or is the question irrelevant, as I believe it to be? So why use the argument from \"naturality\" at all?\nYou can't say for certain that animals don't care. For all we know they may have the same social problems we do.\n \n \nThere is only one reason, because alleged naturality or otherwise is being used as a justification for prejudice, often legal prejudice. Many anti-gay laws have been couched in those prejudicial terms of \"unnatural behaviour\". Natural in this case only means socially acceptable, but the appeal is made to nature to make arbitrary social acceptability seem like a natural law.\n \n I kind of object to that. Nature makes me gay, therefore it cannot be against natural law for me to be or act gay. Anyone who claims it does is, ipso facto, a bigot.\nYour being naturally gay does not make anal intercourse natural...just your gayness.\n \n \nI came back to Britain for this? Oy veh! I have yet to see anyone refer to gays as unnatural who is not also a bigot. Do you have an example of such a specimen?\n \n Second, a bigot is what a bigot does, and that's to denigrate gay people because they are gay, and to oppose equality under the law because they are prejudiced.\n \n Capisce?\n \n Finally, what is \"unnatural\" about gay people? After all, we are only following our instincts, and all instincts are natural.\nThat argument could be used to justify murder.",

The only people contesting this are the people who use the natural argument, which in itself is asinine. The fundamental of your argument is that unnatural = bad. What you fail to recognize is that many things we do to do, are unnatural as they are not found in to occur naturally.

The source and meaning of values are often if not always controversial - especially in postmodern thought.\n\n \n This is not something we disagree on. \"Natural\" seems to mean whatever the user wants it to mean. It's a Humpty-Dumpty word. However, I've rarely heard the word \"unnatural\" used in the context of a discussion of sexual orientation without it being meant pejoratively.\n \n \nAccording to you, anyone who does not agree with your evaluation of homosexual behaviour is a \"bigot\".\n\n \n I come to certain conclusions, and again, it's an issue of seeing if the cap fits. I do think they need to examine their conscience carefully. It's like \"disagreeing\" with the colour of someone's skin. \n \n \nIn other words, no disagreement from your opinions is permitted, whatever the grounds, on pain of being denounced as a bigot. You make no allowance for the regular disagreements about values which is mentioned above. This isn't a reasoned argument but an emission of poisonous gas that is discharged in order to silence criticism.\n\n \n You can't have a \"regular disagreement\" over something as basic as someone's sexual orientation, because it's as personal as one's ethnicity, skin colour, handedness, or any other innate feature. It's not an issue one can distance one's self from such as disagreement over economic policy or religion, say, and it is wholly disingenuous to pretend it is.\n \n The people emitting the poison gas are those \"disagreeing with homosexuality\". They aren't participating in \"reasoned argument\", they are being irrationally judgemental. If they can't figure it out, maybe they should get their empathy meters recalibrated, and check their consciences again.\n \n \nThere are usually some behaviours in everyone's private life that some people would not approve. Human conduct is extremely variable and the best we can insist on is that its lawful diversity will be tolerated. If I were to publicize my way of life (as you do yours), doubtless certain aspects of it would be censured. However, the principle of tolerance is probably an essential attribute of civil society and provided that principle is extended to my thoughts and activities, I have no right to demand approval of them. And neither have you.\n\n \n This is wholly disingenuous. First, straight people publicise their love all the time -- it is hardly appropriate to criticise gay people for doing so as well.\n \n Second, gay love is not just any sort of behaviour, even sexual. It's not just a sex act. You can disapprove of sex acts in public if you like; you can disapprove of divorce or adultery; you can disapprove of polygamy. All these are mere public behaviours which are not essential to anyone's intrinsic happiness or well being. They are not sexual orientations, they are not basic instincts.\n \n When someone condemns gay love, they are condemning the person for being who they are, and true to themselves. And that, mate, comes under my definition of bigotry. You can defend these sorts of people if you like, but I don't care to mince words.\n \n Capisce, James?",

   "Oh, and BTW, what exactly is meant by \"tolerance\"? If a society \"tolerates\" gay people by treating us equally and without prejudice under its laws, then this is doing the least it has a responsibility to do. We can say then that we live in a tolerant society, and that's the most gay people can reasonably require.\n \n Still, if some preacher takes it on himself to preach against gay people, that is not a persuasive exhibition of personal tolerance, not even if the preacher refrains from advocating anti-gay laws, which relatively few avoid doing. Most preachers who preach against gay people are adamant that civil laws should reflect their prejudice.\n \n It is true that gay people cannot demand that others approve of us, merely that society in the shape of the government does not publicly practice prejudice against us; we don't expect the same courtesy of individual people, except where it would infringe laws requiring equal treatment. Acceptance, however, would be a reasonable hope for the future, and a step beyond mere tolerance.\n \n When \"tolerance\" is used to mean \"suffer to live and be free\", then this is just the bare bones of tolerance; it's a grudging tolerance that merely admits there are limitations in a constitutional republic to putting one's prejudices against others into practice. Yes, I suppose it is tolerance of a sort, but it isn't one to let gay people rest easy in their beds. \n \n We can't ask for miracles in people putting their prejudices behind them, but we can expect them to recognise and rise above them. Is every person prejudiced against a group of people a bigot, even if they allow their government to tolerate their lives, freedoms and equality? I suspect non-bigots do more than just tolerate; they accept. \n \n There seems to me to be a spectrum of feeling here, from outright hostile bigotry, through grudging tolerance, indifference, to welcome acceptance. Where one draws the lines in naming categories of feeling is up to the individual. It further seems to me that a truly or fully tolerant person will not even express disapproval of someone's \"lifestyle\", whatever it may be, even if they feel uncomfortable with it. They certainly won't condemn it outright.",

   "Oh, and one last thing. People have a free speech right to call gay people any names under the sun they please, unnatural, perverted or whatever their lurid fancy takes them. They have a right to their personal opinion and prejudice. No-one is trying to take these rights away. It is unworthy of gay equality opponents here to accuse equal rights supporters of trying to stifle free speech.\n \n However, they do not have the right not to have their opinions and prejudices criticised, even with the same fervour and bluntness of speech that they use against gays.

   "And that makes it unnatural? \nWhat makes anal sex 'unnatural' (not within the intent of nature's design of our bodies) is that the anus is patently obviously intended to serve the sole purpose of releasing :xcensored when necessary. It is not intended for insertion of the penis. The penis is to pee through and insert into the vagina. That is what makes anal sex unnatural. \n \n You push this silly argument that I have claimed homosexuality to be unnatural. I have not. I know full well that some people are born with an attraction to same sex people. That is not unnatural.\n \n \n \n\n You are stating that homosexuality, which occurs naturally in over 450 species, is actually unnatural. Is that not what you are saying? \n Exactly! That is NOT what I am saying. I don't know that it occurs in over 450 species, but I do know it occurs naturally. It's the anal sex part that I consider unnatural and driven by apparently uncontrollable 'animal' urges.\n \n \n \n\n Do you see a logic problem here?\nNot on my end.\n \n \n \n\n Action A occurs normally and naturally\n You state action A is abnormal and unnaturally and provide no argument other then I say so.\n \n How is that logically? \nStudy in detail what I said...and don't change a word of it when you reply.\n \n \n \n\n Funny, that's what everyone thinks of you. \nI actually care not what you or anyone else thinks of me.\n \n \n \n\n Hardly. Natural is obvious: the world outside of the interference of man. Behaviors in the state of 'nature.' The only people contesting this are the people who use the natural argument, which in itself is asinine. The fundamental of your argument is that unnatural = bad. What you fail to recognize is that many things we do to do, are unnatural as they are not found in to occur naturally. If we ban homosexuality, we must ban human flight as both are 'unnatural' according your asinine belief system. \nI've not claimed that 'unnatural=bad' or that 'natural=good'. You are yourself falling into a logic trap, the door of which may soon close on you.\n \n You seem to be arguing that anal sex is natural therefore okay or good. Is that a correct assessment?\n \n \n \n\n True, but not here. You're trying to change the subject.\nNo, I'm merely reiterating the folly of this thread. It is based upon a poorly put question, the poorness of which is precipitated by the wide variations in the meaning of 'natural' when taken outside the context of a highly specific sentence. The OP is totally unspecific, referring only to the definitions of 'natural'.\n \n Most of the definitions listed in GiantOreo's visit to various dictionaries have little or no impact on this dialog. \n \n \n \n\n Except you have done no such thing, relying upon a insane idea that behaviors that are done outside of human interference are in fact unnatural. \n Geological formations occur without human interference. Therefore according you to, they are unnatural. Water flows downstream without human interference, therefore that is unnatural according to you. Anything that occurs outside of human interference is unnatural according to your logic.\n \n Please tell me how those can be natural but anal sex which occurs in hundreds of species outside of human interference is unnatural. American Bison have been observed engaging in anal sex. Bonobos are also another species that freely engages in this. A small portion of rams do this as well. I could go on and on listing species that engage in anal sex, but it's damn clear you don't care about facts. \nGod only knows how you managed to misrepresent my argument so well. You have turned the tables by claiming I said things I haven't. Try to stick to what I say and not rephrase things. You display a lack of understanding when you do that...or a deliberate attempt to wriggle out of an argument by making false claims about what your opponent has said. People don't want to reread all this to verify the truth and you know that. That's why you do it. Stick to YOUR argument and stop trying to restate what I think...you mess up just about every time.\n \n Basically, what you need is a study of Boolean logic. There are four logic gates. AND, OR, NAND and NOR. Learn what they mean. \n \n \n \n\n There is more to life then just bodies. Has the concept of bonding mean anything to you?\nDuh!\n \n That has nothing to does with the intended purposes or appendages and orifices on our bodies. Bonding can happen without penetration of anything.\n \n \n \n\n That is the most illogical statement you have made here.\n \n Just because action A occurs in nature outside of human interference doesn't make it natural? \n \n What kind of logic is that? \n \n Action A that happens in natural without our messing with it isn't natural? That's insanity.\nLet's see...the statement you claim to be illogical was: \"Just because it occurs does not mean it's natural.\"\n \n It occurred once that man made a diamond in a machine. It is an unnatural diamond. Natural diamonds are made within the earth.\n \n \nLet's see, shall we?\n \n \n \n {various definitions}\n \n \n If you continue this claim or yours, you lose ALL credibility - you're no better than Archangel if you continue this.\nPlease indicate which of the above definitions you believe to apply to an argument regarding the naturalness of anal sex. Most of them do not apply. Let me know which one(s) you're banking on.\n \n \nOreo, if they actually believed the filth they were preaching, they'd vote. \n \n Notice they haven't. Jim knows better then to actually stand by his position when he has nothing more then semantics.\nThe question is too poorly put to justify a vote. It means nothing except to print all your names in a list.\n \n \nThis is a typical left wing style poll question. Ask a question that one answer defines you as a XXXXX. The other traps you into agreeing with a subjective claim. No vote here. \n Natural has little to do with what is best for mankind. Mankind has decisive powers that allows them to defy animal instincts when he knows they are no benefit to the species.\nExactly!",

Secondly, if you want to argue \"intentions\" of nature, you shouldn't be doing it on a computer, as a computer is \"unnatural\" (shouldn't ride a bike, train, plane, or car either - nature did not \"intend\" any of these).\nMy, my, oh you drift into erred thought so easily. In the course of evolution, animal's body parts develop to fulfill their intended purpose. This is nature in action. Fish's pectoral fins are intended to aid their swimming by providing a method of propulsion..forward or backward. Fish's dorsal fins aid them in stability. Fish's tails are intended to provide propulsion and decoration. Some fishes have developed little fins they use to walk on the sea bottom..the intended function of the fins being to provide propulsion much as our feet do. Ducks have webbed feet lest the water slip between their toes. The intended function of the webbing, designed and implimented by NATURE, is to propel the duck while floating or diving. Nature's intent for the teeth in a lion's mouth is to kill prey and tear food. Nature's intent for the teats on a mammal is to provide an outlet for mother's milk. Nature's intent for the eyes of all animals that have them is to transform light received into a mental recognition of what is in front of the eyes. Nature's intent for the ears of all animals who have them is to transform pressure changes into a mental recognition of sounds approaching the ears. (Though not nature's intent, the ears also provide for the unnatural support of glass's temples and the sporting of earrings.) Nature's intent for fingers and thumbs is to provide grasp to the user for handling various objects. Nature's intent for the arms of humans is to put the hands where they need to be. Nature's intent for the nostrils is to guide air to and from the body, to filter said air. (As a fringe benefit, man uses the nose for the unnatural support of glasses frames.) Nature's intent for the bladder is to store urine for excretion at an opportune time. Nature's intent for the lower colon is to store solid waste, extract the last bit of usuable chemicals and wait for the signal to contract in a BM.\n \n Surely, you don't think all these functional parts happened to come about accidently and without the intent of the designing force...nature.\n \n The intent of nature is often quite easy to discern. Granted it is far more difficult or indeed impossible to figure out how nature works to produce the various body parts (Have you ever seen a fish with a pole and lure capable of being dangled and wiggled right in front of its mouth? Nature's intent there was to provide the fish with a lure to aid in attraction of and ultimate swallowing of smaller fishes...so nature put said equipment on the fish by 'letting' it grow right out of the fish's head.) (Have you ever seen the back of a speckled moth designed by nature to look like the face of a much larger animal for purposes of discouraging bug-eaters from attacking the moth?) (Have you ever seen a bird who's beak nature designed to fit precisely into a single flower that exhibits the same compound curve?) (Have you ever doubted that the intent of nature's design of insect wings is to enable flight?)\n \n I don't know how many examples it would take to convince you that nature's intent regarding body parts is somewhat easy to get a grip on.\n \n \n \n\n Doh, I don't know, maybe the ones that I BOLDED and ENLARGED? :xbanghead emoticon_rolleyes\nYou bolded many of them. Some of the ones you bolded also do not fit into this discussion. Please pick one or two that you believe adequate to apply to the naturalness of anal sex.",

   "Gay marriage is simply your definition of a sexual association between men.\n\n \n Do you ever listen to your prejudiced self? Do you not know that lesbians exist?

Obviously you can't stand gay people, so quit the pretense. \n \n \nMy equals in what respect? Equality is a meaningless concept unless you can say in what respect the term applies. I suppose this sloppy thinking passes for debate in your book. \n\n \n We are not your equals because we do not stand in the way of anyone's right to be treated equally under the law. We are your betters. We do not judge you because of your lifestyle, but you would judge us because of what you feverishly imagine is our lifestyle. That makes us stand head and shoulders above those who would set themselves up in ignorance as judges.\n \n \nWell, Lesz, it's pretty obvious that had you been able to subject my commentary on tolerance to a reasoned criticism, you would not have tried to dismiss it as \"mindless clich\u00e9s\". \n \n James.\n\n \n I've decimated your commentary.

   "What makes anal sex 'unnatural' (not within the intent of nature's design of our bodies) is that the anus is patently obviously intended to serve the sole purpose of releasing :xcensored when necessary. It is not intended for insertion of the penis. The penis is to pee through and insert into the vagina. That is what makes anal sex unnatural.\n\n \n Then why do numerous species freely engage in it? Natural is merely anatomy? Please say yes, I'd love to hammer you there. \n \n \nExactly! That is NOT what I am saying. I don't know that it occurs in over 450 species, but I do know it occurs naturally. It's the anal sex part that I consider unnatural and driven by apparently uncontrollable 'animal' urges.\n\n \n How does uncontrollable animal urges make it unnatural? Isn't animal itself a state of nature? Therefore aren't the urges that come with that state natural?\n \n \nNot on my end.\n\n \n Not surprising. \n \n \nStudy in detail what I said...and don't change a word of it when you reply.\n\n \n That is effectively what you are saying outside of anatomy, and you're deliberately ignoring natural animal behaviors. \n \n \nI actually care not what you or anyone else thinks of me.\n\n \n Hence why you don't go over what you post before posting it. \n \n \nI've not claimed that 'unnatural=bad' or that 'natural=good'. You are yourself falling into a logic trap, the door of which may soon close on you.\n\n \n Not at all. I've already stated several times natural =/= good and given numerous examples of natural occuraces that are bad for man kind (eating one's own children). Your implicit argument is that since anal is allegedly unnatural, it's a deviant behavior and deviancy is inherently wrong. \n \n \nYou seem to be arguing that anal sex is natural therefore okay or good. Is that a correct assessment?\n\n \n You're not right in anything. I'm not saying it's good or bad. I'm just critiquing the asinine logic that things that occur in nature are not natural. \n \n \nNo, I'm merely reiterating the folly of this thread. It is based upon a poorly put question, the poorness of which is precipitated by the wide variations in the meaning of 'natural' when taken outside the context of a highly specific sentence.\n\n \n You have to be a idiot not to understand the obvious definition here. Or you don't want to admit your argument is ####. \n \n \nMost of the definitions listed in GiantOreo's visit to various dictionaries have little or no impact on this dialog. \n\n \n Because.....\n \n \nStick to YOUR argument and stop trying to restate what I think...you mess up just about every time.\n\n \n You haven't dealt with a single argument I've given. You are deliberately ignoring ever increasing amounts. \n \n HOW IS A BEHAVIOR THAT OCCURS IN NATURE NOT NATURAL? \n \n I gave you examples of ANIMALS THAT ENGAGE IN ANAL SEX IN THE NATURAL WORLD. \n \n Are you SERIOUSLY saying that those behaviors which occur IN THE NATURAL WORLD by ANIMALS are in fact NOT NATURAL? \n \n \nBasically, what you need is a study of Boolean logic. There are four logic gates. AND, OR, NAND and NOR. Learn what they mean.\n\n \n Facts and you don't mix do they? \n \n \nThat has nothing to does with the intended purposes or appendages and orifices on our bodies. Bonding can happen without penetration of anything.\n\n \n For us perhaps. Your egocentric view is rather disturbing. But that's perhaps what you're like AA in complete disregard of facts. \n \n \nIt occurred once that man made a diamond in a machine. It is an unnatural diamond. Natural diamonds are made within the earth.\n\n \n Now you do what you accuse me of doing. I obviously made it clear that natural was in the context of lack of interference by man. You yourself quoted that. Now you are ignoring what I wrote to defend your asinine logic.\n \n please pay attention to what I actually write instead of fabricating bull****\n \n \nPlease indicate which of the above definitions you believe to apply to an argument regarding the naturalness of anal sex. Most of them do not apply. Let me know which one(s) you're banking on.\n\n \n \"Please tell me how those can be natural but anal sex which occurs in hundreds of species outside of human interference is unnatural.

If you actually believed that unnatural things were bad and wrong and should be stopped, you'd be railing against most things we do in life on a daily basis. I don't see you saying flying is bad, or deep sea diving is bad or wiping our butts with 2 ply as bad. \n \n \nso you can claim that anal sex among humans is natural....so you can justify your deviant behavior....so the world will accept you as readily as it does heterosexuals.\n \n What a crock!\n\n \n Hardly. I agree that anal sex is disgusting. I just don't agree with your method of arguing against it.

They all effectively say the same thing. \n \n \nI've explained this above.

   "To jyoshu: If someone disagreed with your right to exist... would not you fight back? You're not doing a very convincing job at turning this argument. I think it was your foot you just shot.\n\n \n I think they are being more subtle here. The stance is that although gay people have the right to exist, and even have some rights under the Constitution, we shouldn't be so uppity as to think our loving relationships are equivalent to those of straight people. \n \n This is cloaked in a \"defense of marriage\" smokescreen, but what is being defended? The institution of marriage? Hardly. They aren't proposing penalties for adultery or banning divorce. Saying that gays can't marry isn't going to \"protect\" any straight couple's marriage, nor shore up an institution that straight couples are avoiding and undermining without any help from us. Is it to protect a dictionary definition? What is the point of attacking equal rights for that? A tradition? But traditions (including marriage!) get changed to suit the needs of the day all the time. Marriage in 2007 is not what it was in 1907, and that wasn't what it was in 1807. Is it to protect children and families? But gay couples have those, too.\n \n So no, the allegedly reasonable arguments do not hold water, and one is left with the conclusion that what is really being defended is a subtle anti-gay prejudice. They aren't \"defending marriage\", they are \"defending marriage from gay people who are attacking it!\" It isn't a hostile, violent or savage bigotry, but it is insidious in its own way because of the message it gives gay people: \"We are still better than you, whatever you dare think about it!\" The \"separate but equal\" mantra exists only to emphasize separateness and inequality, as it did in the case of black Americans. I think it is so subtle that even the proponents of this gentle anti-gay argument don't realise its causes and effects. Or at least refuse to admit them.",

   "You are misusing the word \"intent\". Intent requires an intention by something - nature is not living, nor is it conscious or aware, and thus is unable to have an \"intent\".\nAre you saying that everything was created by accident?\n \n \nSorry Jim's, but it is YOU that much pick the definition, as it is YOU who are claiming that gay sex/anal sex is \"unnatural\" so it is YOU who must convince US that it is \"unnatural\". So sorry, bub, but the burden of proof is on YOU.\nNot so. This thread was started in hopes of having everyone agree that \"everything that occurs\" in nature is natural...whereupon the justification of anal sex would lie as evidenced by the various pictures of animals humping each other. The word 'natural' has so many connotations under various definitions depending on to what the descriptor is to be attached that it is useless to have serious discussion without first agreeing on the definition to be used in application to the acts being performed by said animals.\n \n I have contested the statement made in the OP that everything that occurs in nature is natural. It is up to your side of the question (the one arguing for the premise) to clarify which definition of 'natural' is incorporated into the premise. It is not up to me to guess.\n \n I suppose you're having difficulty agreeing to identify the definition intended because none of them actually fit well.\n \n Pick one that you think fits.\n \n \n\"I have already answered that.\"\n \n You haven't answered jack ####, all you've provided is a mightily subjective opinion. As for the claim that somebody is entering their penis into the wrong hole, then tell that to the thousands and thousands of people who commit to oral sex. That's what I meant by the mouth is only biologically suitable for breathing and eating and regurgitating and what not, yet with that in mind, your definition means that kissing is not natural. Since you'd like to establish this imaginary line of what is natural and what is not, well by our means, let's play the game!\n \n Kissing\n Spooning (oh, do creatures other than homo sapiens do that? OH my!)\n Licking\n Sucking nipples\n oral sex\n anal sex\n watersports\n \n Is there anything I'm missing? Of course, we could add bondage, because I'm not conscientious of any animals that actually use their imagination to intensify their sexual activities! They usually simply do it and get it over with! That must mean that sexual fantasies are unnatural, huh?\n \n So please, divide up these activities listed above, tell me which ones are natural and unnatural, as I've attempted to list them based on popularity...although granted, if you happen to like doing something far down the list more so than spooning or sucking nipples, gosh, you must be an absolute freak!\n \n By the way, jim's trucking, you're banned from kissing. That hole isn't for intimacy, the only hole must be on a woman. Don't abuse your mouth!!! You inhale and exhale every single day, and you eat every day! But one does not kiss everyday, that's simply unnatural! Ewwwww kissing!!!!!!!!\n \n I must be asexual, then....but geesh, that must be unnatural, too, because everyone is suppose to have sexual intercourse, and to jim trucking's liking!\nYou are fast proving to be not worth conversing with.\n \n The uses of the mouth do not apply to this discussion. A digression to that topic is your method of splintering the thought process concerning anal sex. I haven't revealed much of my thoughts on the mouth and its use in intimacy. Likely you missed where I've already said that oral sex and rim jobs are not outside the bounds of nature's intent. Gentle caressing with fingers, lips and tongue all over the body is part of love-making.\n \n \nAnd what makes you so profoundly knowledgeable about what nature's intent is? Did you ask nature? Do you have long conversations with it? Does it speak to you in riddles?\nObservations, readings, listenings, common sense and logic. \n \n \n \n\n Damn. You would have paid dearly for saying yes. \nBut it was such a stupid, rhetorical question...I had no choice but to say, \"No.\"\n \n \n \n\n Again, what makes you so much of a expert upon the intent of nature? This does appear to be a fallacy of authority/expertise, where you have none.\nThen contradict what I say. Tell me how the intended use of the anus different from what I said. \n \n \n \n\n How do you know that anal is not a form of animal bonding? Did nature tell you it wasn't? \nI didn't say it wasn't a form of bonding. It is quite obvious that it is a form of bonding, just as having sex as intended by the body design. It's just not within the bounds of nature's intent.\n \n \n \nYour argument relies upon proving the intent of nature when none of us can even begin to do that. Your argument is effectively begging the question. You must prove nature's intent before you can prove anal is unnatural. Good luck with that as nature is hardly the easiest thing to confer with. Perhaps you should ask some of the Pagans? \nIt appears I may be conversing with Pagans.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n I'm not going to concur because I'm not arrogant like you in assuming I know the intent of Nature. I go on what I can observe from occurances in the natural world ie, multiple species engaging in anal sex and over 450 in homosexuality. I, unlike you, don't rely upon a completely unprovable argument, aka, intent. I made a gag on you, specifically about every things in nature having a convention in the dimensional rift about the intent of nature for the next year. Obviously you missed it. \nIt doesn't matter if you prove to me that every mammal on earth has experienced anal sex and liked it a lot. It would still be against the intent of nature's design of our bodies.\n \n \n \n\n Prove what nature's intent is. Merely saying that nature doesn't intend this, does that or whatever doesn't mean you are correct. Did you talk to nature? How can you speak for what nature intends when you haven't asked it? \n...Study anatomy paying close attention to function. (...he says as he beats a dead horse.)\n \n \n \n\n Then why do you not call for all other unnatural things as wrong and to stop?\n Because you're a hypocrite and unnaturality is not a problem to you, you just don't like gays. If you actually believed that unnatural things were bad and wrong and should be stopped, you'd be railing against most things we do in life on a daily basis. I don't see you saying flying is bad, or deep sea diving is bad or wiping our butts with 2 ply as bad. \nThere you go again...changing what I say. What a frickin' strawman you are.\n \n I haven't called for anything to stop. You can cornhole each other 'til you have calluses all over your asses...I don't care. It's just not within the bounds of nature's intent.\n \n I haven't claimed not to like gays. I haven't claimed that gays are the only ones who engage in anal sex. I haven't asked anyone to stop doing it. I've simply said that anal sex is not within the bounds of nature's intent. It's not natural.\n \n You claim that it is but you can't seem to clarify what you mean by 'natural' by choosing which definition you intend to apply to the question.\n \n \n \n\n Hardly. I agree that anal sex is disgusting. I just don't agree with your method of arguing against it. It casts you as a giant hypocrite and quite a foolish one as well. \nPerhaps you do not understand the English language well enough to discern what I'm saying. I am not arguing against anal sex except to say that I think it is unnatural in the sense that it is not within the bounds of what I perceive to be nature's intent.\n \n \n \n\n It doesn't matter which of Oreo's we go with. They all effectively say the same thing.\nThen my assumption that you do not understand English is correct. \n \n \n \n\n And you constantly fail to prove you know and can prove what nature's intent is. Begging the question. \nMust I repeat myself....again...and again....and again?\n \n \n \n\n ...\n \n Any one of his bolded are fine.\nIf I'm not mistaken, you started this thread with a claim that all things that occur in nature are natural. To believe this, you must be considering a definition of natural. To apply it in an argument with me against my posture that anal sex is not natural (unnatural) (outside the bounds of nature's intent) you must state which definition you are applying to the question.\n \n \n??? I just don't see a single post here arguing that Lesz, you or anyone else shouldn't exist, or shouldn't have the right to exist.\nYou are right. There are also none that call for stopping of any behavioral patterns either. There are just opinions on the topic of nature's intent, what some animals do and what we think 'natural' means.\n \n Obviously, all of these thoughts are vindictive attacks on the gays here.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Whew, jyoshu, no kidding...I can't believe that jim's trucking believes that anal sex is just wrong no matter what the circumstances or intentions in human nature. It's all right or wrong, or black and white...whatever he does in his mundane life constitutes normalcy, and everything else is thrown out the window. I'm a huge advocate of those who pursue watersports, but it sounds like they are way down the bottom of the list based on jim's trucking's guidelines, so we'd better banish them from this dimension for their abnormal behaviors. He certainly needs to lighten up!\n \n Oh yeah, jim's trucking, I get along with GiantOreo and obvious_child just fine, but I do have difficulty making conversation with irrationality, not to mention little sense of humour.\nYou are not the only sick little puppy that has come this way lately.\n \n It's really cute how you take drivle that you print and present it as if someone else said it. I didn't respond to your 'watersports' issue so you have no idea what I think of watersports. It does not matter. We were discussing anal sex and the unnaturalness thereof.\n \n BTW, in order for me to agree with you about watersports, you'll have to clarify what you mean by watersports. I am NOT into golden showers. That too is unnatural.\n \n TTBOMK, my only use of the word 'wrong' has been when I said 'wrong hole, Bubba.' There has been no claim that anal sex is wrong...it's just not within the intent of nature's design. What you and a lot of others appear to use a lot is the technique of rewording the statements made by expanding them into what you perceive as an attack on your personal behavior. As I've said many times, what you do is your business. I can have an opinion on it without demanding that you stop. I don't care who you screw or how you go about it. Anal sex is unnatural.

   "Observations, readings, listenings, common sense and logic.\n\n \n All which don't prove you know what the intent is. So no, you haven't actually asked nature what its intent is. How do you know there isn't something else? Furthermore, why after billions of years of evolution that very complex organism engage in it if it is not nature's intent? Would it not suggest that based upon common sense, observations and logic that if a behavior that was detriment to a organism was constantly practiced that organism would be removed? Therefore that behavior must at least be neutral or even beneficial in some unforeseen way. That would imply that the behavior is indeed the intent of nature as it was favored or at least not discriminated against over the course of the evolution of various organisms. Gotcha. \n \n \nThen contradict what I say. Tell me how the intended use of the anus different from what I said.\n\n \n Bonboos regularly engage in copulation with both sexes as a form of bonding. Anal penetration is one way of forming stronger communities. You haven't even tried to address the natural animal behaviors of various examples. \n \n \nI didn't say it wasn't a form of bonding. It is quite obvious that it is a form of bonding, just as having sex as intended by the body design. It's just not within the bounds of nature's intent.\n\n \n Again you know nature's intent? Please share your long conversations with us. I'd love to hear what Gaia has to say. And you are saying that bonding is not within nature's intent. Do you stand by that? \n \n \nIt appears I may be conversing with Pagans.\n\n \n It doesn't matter. No one here except YOU made the argument that it was not within nature's intent. I don't know what nature's intent is. I DO however, know that if organisms engage in a behavior outside of human interaction on numerous occasions, that the behavior is a natural one. Therefore it cannot be unnatural as you claim. \n \n \nIt doesn't matter if you prove to me that every mammal on earth has experienced anal sex and liked it a lot. It would still be against the intent of nature's design of our bodies.\n\n \n And you know the intent of nature? You haven't proven this. Your argument relies upon the fallacy of begging the question. That anal sex is wrong because it's against nature's intent all assuming that nature actually intends that. Your entire argument is fallacious. \n \n \nStudy anatomy paying close attention to function. (...he says as he beats a dead horse.)\n\n \n You yourself stated that anatomy wasn't everything. Now you are. So nature has nothing to do with anything outside of genetics? You are trapped and you know it. \n \n \nThere you go again...changing what I say. What a frickin' strawman you are.\n\n \n Your argument is nothing but a strawman. \n \n \nIt's just not within the bounds of nature's intent.\n\n \n All without proving what nature's intent is....\n \n You are effectively saying A is wrong because of unproven claim B. How do we know what B is? Can we limit B to just one thing? You need to fix that before you go anywhere. \n \n \nIt's not natural.\n\n \n Then why do you even care if you're not against the practice of unnatural things?\n \n \nYou claim that it is but you can't seem to clarify what you mean by 'natural' by choosing which definition you intend to apply to the question.\n\n \n I already stated any of the bolded ones Oreo posted were acceptable.\n Furthermore, I have clarified numerous times that natural meant occuring outside of human interference/interaction. You can say I never clarified but you'd be wrong. \n \n \nI perceive to be nature's intent.\n\n \n Finally. you get around to saying YOUR opinion of what nature's intent is not THE ABSOLUTE truth of what Nature's intent is. That's fine. You can believe whatever you want. You're still a hypocrite. \n \n \nMust I repeat myself....again...and again....and again?\n\n \n Until you prove what nature's intent is. Please provide a transcript your discussion with nature. \n \n \nIf I'm not mistaken, you started this thread with a claim that all things that occur in nature are natural. To believe this, you must be considering a definition of natural. To apply it in an argument with me against my posture that anal sex is not natural (unnatural) (outside the bounds of nature's intent) you must state which definition you are applying to the question.\n\n \n Again, any of the Oreo's are fine.",

   "All which don't prove you know what the intent is. \nNothing that I know of can prove to you that I know what the intent of nature is. I can't even prove that to myself. All I can do in that vein is to state my opinion as to what I believe to be the intent based upon my own observations and educational retainage.\n \n \nSo no, you haven't actually asked nature what its intent is. \nAbsolutely true.\n \n \nHow do you know there isn't something else? \nSuch as another designer of nature? After all, nature is the entire realm of this discussion as stated in the original premise.\n \n \nFurthermore, why after billions of years of evolution that very complex organism engage in it if it is not nature's intent? \nThat misjustification could be applied to any act of man.\n \n \nWould it not suggest that based upon common sense, observations and logic that if a behavior that was detriment to a organism was constantly practiced that organism would be removed? \nDid you mean to write \"...was a detriment to an organism was...\" or \"...was detrimental to an organism was...\"? It may make a difference later in the conversation.\n \n \n \nTherefore that behavior must at least be neutral or even beneficial in some unforeseen way. That would imply that the behavior is indeed the intent of nature as it was favored or at least not discriminated against over the course of the evolution of various organisms. Gotcha. \nI hardly flinched.\n \n You have erred greatly here, I suspect. Not only does that argument support anarchy, murder, robbery, rape and all sorts of crimes that are beneficial to those organisms we call criminals, a subset within the human race, the most highly evolved of all the animals you seem to want to emulate; it supports my belief that anal sex IS not within the intent of nature. I'll stand corrected if this paragraph is in error as I am writing from memory now. I recall that the spread of aids was enabled first by monkeys (was it your beloved 'Pygmy Chimpanzee' tribe?) and then by homosexual activities such as anal sex among humans. I believe it has been successfully argued on this site that the spread of aids {AIDS:a deadly, painfully cruel, costly thing.} was enabled (albeit not confined to) homosexual activity among human men. I believe it is true that HIV-AIDS is transferred from human to human through exchange of bodily fluids such as sperm, blood, spittle...(sperm being the operative word) and that sperm, along with the accompanying virus can be absorbed into the blood stream via the intended function of the lower colon which includes removal of liquids from the final vestiges of yesterday's meal before passing what's left back to the earth.\n \n So, your own argument should be a wake-up call.\n \n \n \n\n Bonboos regularly engage in copulation with both sexes as a form of bonding. Anal penetration is one way of forming stronger communities. You haven't even tried to address the natural animal behaviors of various examples. \nThat should justify it for humans? If they practice incest, sex with infants and sleep in a squirming pile of orgasmic organisms, is that intended by nature or whatever you will stipulate to have designed the creatures? Yours is definitely an argument for rampant debauchery, communal insanity and the subsequent need for more mental institutions.\n \n \n \n\n Again you know nature's intent? Please share your long conversations with us. I'd love to hear what Gaia has to say. And you are saying that bonding is not within nature's intent. Do you stand by that? \nStrawman...stupid, rhetorical question. Of course bonding is within nature's intent...not just sexual bonding either. There's no need of discussing the other forms of bonding here.\n \n \n \n\n It doesn't matter. No one here except YOU made the argument that it was not within nature's intent. I don't know what nature's intent is. I DO however, know that if organisms engage in a behavior outside of human interaction on numerous occasions, that the behavior is a natural one. Therefore it cannot be unnatural as you claim. \n...as you and 10 other screen names have voted. Again, citing the various definitions of 'natural' as I did in my first post in this thread, as GiantOreo cut and pasted from various dictionaries and as various others have interjected along the way, I believe the question is poorly put and intended only to support a future argument in support of all activities ever to have been observed by man while studying animals, including but not limited to anal sex.\n \n \n \n\n And you know the intent of nature? You haven't proven this. Your argument relies upon the fallacy of begging the question. That anal sex is wrong because it's against nature's intent all assuming that nature actually intends that. Your entire argument is fallacious. \nI am stating my opinion as you are. I don't know the intent of nature. I know that I believe it is based upon what I've seen and heard in past decades. I did not say that anal sex is wrong. I said it is not within nature's intended use of our organs. When I asked you to give me an alternate intended use for the anus, you replied that monkeys use it for bonding via anal sex. I contend that organisms discovered the pleasure of anal sex after their existence was established. (Refute that if you can.) Nature's intent was that orgasms give pleasure. When the little critters discovered they could feel good by humping another little critter's anus, they liked it a lot and kept repeating until it became somewhat of a standard behavior. Since man hadn't even appeared on the scene when this standard behavior was created, it must be classified as a natural happening...just as you claim. However, you are far from proving that this behavior was intended rather than a side effect grounded in the pursuit of animalistic pleasure.\n \n \n \n\n You yourself stated that anatomy wasn't everything. Now you are. So nature has nothing to do with anything outside of genetics? You are trapped and you know it. \nPerhaps you should remind us all of our entire previous conversation regarding anatomy. You are quite confused about what I actually wrote.\n \n \n We are discussing animals. Anatomy includes the study of animal's bodies. The study of bodies will teach you the apparent functions of various body parts. Pay close attention to what you see, hear and read concerning what mankind has already learned about bodies in nature and the various intended functions of the various body parts. Then come to a conclusion regarding specific body parts.\n \n \n \n \n\n ....\n Your argument is nothing but a strawman. \n \n \n \n All without proving what nature's intent is....\n \n You are effectively saying A is wrong because of unproven claim B. How do we know what B is? Can we limit B to just one thing? You need to fix that before you go anywhere. \nI repeat again for my strawman friend; I did not say it was wrong...or right.\n \n \n \n\n Then why do you even care if you're not against the practice of unnatural things?\nYou are assuming that I care about what?\n \n I am merely discussing a topic with you and your cohorts. As clearly put before you previously, I am not against you practicing anal sex (with another consenting adult). Have at it. What I hesitate to do is allow you to succeed with a pseudo-logical argument that it is okay (normal, natural, beneficial) for mankind to emulate animals just because nature allowed them to develop an activity without man's intervention/interaction.\n \n I will agree that anal sex between animals exists in nature without man's doing and is therefore a naturally occuring phenomenon. I will not agree that this 'monkey see...monkey do' ethic you embrace should set any kind of standard for our own behavior.\n \n \n \n\n I already stated any of the bolded ones Oreo posted were acceptable.\n Furthermore, I have clarified numerous times that natural meant occuring outside of human interference/interaction. You can say I never clarified but you'd be wrong. \nThat won't work either. (Actually, it might work to defeat us both.)\n \n If natural only occurs outside of human interference/interaction, then human interference/interaction is unnatural. Human interaction being unnatural (by your clarified definition) makes everything we do together unnatural...my heterosex, your homosex, all human sex. Surely, you can see your definition sucks.\n \n \n \n \n\n \n Finally. you get around to saying YOUR opinion of what nature's intent is not THE ABSOLUTE truth of what Nature's intent is. That's fine. You can believe whatever you want. You're still a hypocrite. \n \n \n \n Until you prove what nature's intent is. Please provide a transcript your discussion with nature. \n \n \n \n Again, any of the Oreo's are fine.\nYou should have known all along it's just my opinion.\n \n That copying animal behavior is natural is only your opinion...and you can't seem to define natural sufficiently to support your initial claim.\n \n I suspect this is a stalemate. You can claim to have won if you wish. I do not concede any points.\n \n \nWho is asking you to have or approve of anal sex? if you don't like it, don't do it, but stop whining about it. What does anal sex have to do with equal rights for gay people? This business of whether it is natural or not is just a red herring you've dragged into the discussion. You do lots of \"unnatural\" things all the time yourself, like wearing clothes or using computers, but I don't hear anyone lambasting you for it. Get with the topic, mate.\nNobody.\n \n I'm not whining. I'm discussing.\n \n Nothing.\n \n The question of naturalness of all things is posed in the OP.\n \n The naturalness of tangible objects, be they manmade of made by nature is not easily compared to or legitimately used in analogies concerning the naturalness of animal behavior. You don't hear people lambasting each other for wearing clothes and using computers because that would be a completely idiotic thing to do. Reread this thread and you will find some posters came really close to doing just that.\n \n \n \n \nOf course the question is inherently silly (and thanks for adding another voice of reason to these threads, BTW!). But that's the sort of silliness gay people have to put up with from the right-wing religiously self-righteous all the time. Gay people are forever caught in their Catch-22s: if we do as some animals do (have homosexual sex), we are sinful or bestial; if we don't do as other animals do (have heterosexual sex), we are unnatural. Our sex is sinful because we aren't married; but we can't marry to avoid sin. There is no pleasing them but to pretend to be straight and marry their daughters, which they wouldn't knowingly permit, either!\n \n Talking to these anti-gay moralisers is like :xbanghead\nMy, my! How we pat each other on the back. It makes me wonder how many different people are represented by the posted screen names.

   "Nothing that I know of can prove to you that I know what the intent of nature is. I can't even prove that to myself.\n\n \n Then if you claim to be a reasonable person, you should have never made the claim. Which points to the conclusion you are in fact NOT a reasonable person. \n \n \nAll I can do in that vein is to state my opinion as to what I believe to be the intent based upon my own observations and educational retainage.\n\n \n I can accept that. \n \n \nThat misjustification could be applied to any act of man.\n\n \n Man is quite irrelevant in this discussion. We are talking about lower animals, such as sheep, Bison and others who have been observed to engage in voluntary anal sex in the wild. Mankind, unlike other organisms has shown a ability to change the environment to suits its needs rather then change to suit the environment. This therefore removes man from the equation. \n \n \nDid you mean to write \"...was a detriment to an organism was...\" or \"...was detrimental to an organism was...\"? It may make a difference later in the conversation.\n\n \n Detrimental, and I don't see how it matters.\n \n \nNot only does that argument support anarchy, murder, robbery, rape and all sorts of crimes that are beneficial to those organisms we call criminals, a subset within the human race, the most highly evolved of all the animals you seem to want to emulate; it supports my belief that anal sex IS not within the intent of nature.\n\n \n You make no followable assertions. And even if it did, that would only apply to a few organisms. Obviously it would be detrimental to the rest of the population. And even so it's not even relevant. No one said that the behavior was good. And murder, robbery and rape are individually good for organisms who live in a environment free from retribution. As that doesn't occur you don't have a argument of any merit. That doesn't make them unnatural. Murder, rape and robbery are naturally occurring behaviors. Males murder the young of other males. Dolphins gang rape females. Bigger animals rob from smaller. Turn your TV on and you can see at least two of these on animal documentary shows. Therefore these are natural behaviors.\n \n \nI'll stand corrected if this paragraph is in error as I am writing from memory now.\n\n \n It is beyond error. And stupid too. \n \n \nI recall that the spread of aids was enabled first by monkeys (was it your beloved 'Pygmy Chimpanzee' tribe?) and then by homosexual activities such as anal sex among humans. \n\n \n You'd be wrong. HIV was spread from the infections from the African Bush meat trade. Hunters killing monkeys would often receive open wounds and cuts from their trade. In the process of skinning, gutting and preparing the meat for trade, they'd get infected. They then transfer this to their female partners. Homosexuality has never been accepted in Africa until recently and yet there are recorded incidents of it well before contemporary acceptance. \n \n \nI believe it has been successfully argued on this site that the spread of aids\n.\n \n No, that was the spread of HIV in American. Big difference, and BTW American infections are tiny compared to heterosexual transmissions in Africa. \n \n \nSo, your own argument should be a wake-up call\n\n \n That you're wrong? Not really. Perhaps if you had facts you'd get somewhere. \n Too bad that won't ever happen. \n \n \nThat should justify it for humans?\n\n \n I never said that. You are clearly using the fallacy of changing the subject. My entire argument revolves around what is considered natural. I have made it perfectly clear that what is natural is not automatically good and is in many cases BAD for humans. You yourself stated this as well. But Now you are clearly trying to change the subject away from what is natural to what is good for humans, which I clearly stated IS NOT the subject of this thread.\n \n Stop being dishonest. [u]Do that again and I will make a even larger deal of it.[/b]\n \n Here is your last warning. If you fail to remember this statement, you will automatically be labeled a liar in the future. \n \n Natural is not equal to good. Unnatural is not equal to bad. Many natural things are bad for humans. Many unnatural things are good for humans. That is a entirely different thread. This thread is purely about what is natural, no moral or ethical judgments nor any support or detraction. Get that through your dishonest head. \n \n \nThere's no need of discussing the other forms of bonding here.\n\n \n Of course there is. You yourself stated that anal was not nature's intent. I countered with sexual bonding with a specific species. As you stated bonding is within nature's intent. Therefore you are wrong. Failure to accept this means you are contradicting yourself and this will be broadcast. \n \n \nI believe the question is poorly put and intended only to support a future argument in support of all activities ever to have been observed by man while studying animals, including but not limited to anal sex.\n\n \n Except that it was made perfectly clear that natural is not equating to good. We have established that. Except you when facing defeat keep ignoring that stated issue. Go back to page one. It was already established that natural does not equate to good. \n \n \nI don't know the intent of nature.\n\n \n Then your entire argument falls apart as it relied upon you knowing what nature's intent was. You don't have a argument anymore. \n \n \nI said it is not within nature's intended use of our organs.\n\n \n You did not say that. \n \n \nI contend that organisms discovered the pleasure of anal sex after their existence was established.\n\n \n That doesn't make it unnatural. Furthermore you don't know if both developed at the same time. \n \n \nHowever, you are far from proving that this behavior was intended rather than a side effect grounded in the pursuit of animalistic pleasure.\n\n \n Just as you can't prove otherwise. And it doesn't even matter. Nature's intent is far more then just anatomy. \n \n If the behavior was not intended for nature why didn't nature stop it?\n \n \nYou are quite confused about what I actually wrote.\n\n \n You are confused about everything claiming that bonding is part, but not a part, but again is a part, but not a part. Perhaps you should clarify. When you keep changing positions it's hard to keep track. \n \n \nI did not say it was wrong...or right.\n\n \n Then explain this comment:\n \n \"Yours is definitely an argument for rampant debauchery, communal insanity and the subsequent need for more mental institutions.\"\n \n \nYou are assuming that I care about what?\n\n \n If you didn't care if it was right or wrong, why did you even bother to post? \n \n \nWhat I hesitate to do is allow you to succeed with a pseudo-logical argument that it is okay (normal, natural, beneficial) for mankind to emulate animals just because nature allowed them to develop an activity without man's intervention/interaction.\n\n \n What do you not understand about the following: \n \n natural does not equate to good. I have stated that at least 15 times already. You apparently seem to have ignored it every single time to suit your argument. I have even stated my own personal feelings about it which are INLINE WITH YOUR'S. \n \n \nI will agree that anal sex between animals exists in nature without man's doing and is therefore a naturally occuring phenomenon.\n\n \n Then you change your argument. Thanks for conceding the thread.\n \n \nI will not agree that this 'monkey see...monkey do' ethic you embrace should set any kind of standard for our own behavior.\n\n \n It's rather pathetic you keep ignoring my statements about what natural and good equate to. \n \n \nIf natural only occurs outside of human interference/interaction, then human interference/interaction is unnatural.\n\n \n I agree. Humans tend to add variables that result in unnatural outcomes. \n \n \nHuman interaction being unnatural (by your clarified definition) makes everything we do together unnatural...my heterosex, your homosex, all human sex.\n\n \n Not quite. Human sexual behavior existed prior to the starting of civilization. Man was in the 'state of nature' at the time period and did not change the environment to suits its needs. Modern man however, is quite different then 'state of nature' man. There is a key distinction between the two. The one that adds new variables or the one that simply plays by the rules. \n \n \nSurely, you can see your definition sucks.\n\n \n Not at all. One just needs the intelligence to differ early man from contemporary man. \n \n \nThat copying animal behavior is natural is only your opinion\n\n \n Please show me where I said this. I do recall stating that several species of spider naturally eat their young and that would be bad for man. How is that saying copying animal behavior [eating young] is natural and good for man and should be copied? Did the definition of 'bad' confuse you? \n \n \nand you can't seem to define natural sufficiently to support your initial claim.\n\n \n No, you just don't want to admit you have unsuitable reasons for disliking gays. \n \n \nI do not concede any points.\n\n \n yes you did. The thread was conceded by you the second you posted the following:\n \n \"I will agree that anal sex between animals exists in nature without man's doing and is therefore a naturally occuring phenomenon\"",

   "Interesting link, I wish it was supported with some actual peer review that you scientists place so much value on. It seems like one very gay guys opinion designed to support his very pre-determined point of view to me though.\n\n \n Homosexual behaviour is found throughout the animal kingdom, with over 450 species of bird and mammal reported to exhibit some to a lot of same-sex sexual activity. There are hundreds of peer-reviewed reports in the scientific literature. One example, gay rams, is even of so much agricultural concern there is considerable research going into what makes some 8-10% of rams solely interested sexually in other rams to the complete exclusion of ewes, which is an economic problem for sheep farmers. Here's the college website of one of the principle researchers in this field, Charles E. Roselli. Sample publication:\n \n Roselli,C.E., K. Larkin, J.A. Resko, J.N. Stellflug, and F. Stormshak. (2004) The sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area varies with sexual partner preference in sheep. Endocrinology 145:478-483.\n It took a little time for biologists to figure out that same sex sexual behaviour was actually vastly more common in the animal world than they had ever suspected, because they had always assumed, falsely, that if two animals were observed having sex, they must be male and female. Turns out this assumption, which arose in part because it isn't always easy to determine sex in the wild and because of unacknowledged biases, was in error. Same-sex pairs in swans, seagulls, penguins and flamingos have all been reported to result in the successful rearing of offspring. Eggs are either stolen from neighboring nests, or are laid by one or both of a female pair, or by a female who mates with one of a male pair and then gets chased away. The pair are usually also sexually active with each other, as well as forming long-term bonds that can last for years in species that pair-bond for more than a single season.\n \n What is natural is a little more complicated than your mind is intellectually prepared to handle. \n \n \nWhy does asking the question imply any fear of anything in your small mind lesz ? I didn't start this perverted thread after all. The fact that this type of sex is unnatural and abnormal isn't a question for me. It's a fact. I'm simply curious as to what extent this so called gay activity actually occurs in the Animal Kingdom.\n\n \n My little mind encompasses horizons yours doesn't even dream of, mate, slave to bible-worship that you are. Your opinions about gay sex are neither relevant nor interesting. They are just prejudice in action. You advertise your saintly Christianity by calling us perverts, abnormal and unnatural, then you wonder why we totally reject your vision of your deity. It's because it's a sick one.
