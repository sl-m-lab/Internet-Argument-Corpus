   "Jesus may have founded his Church, not the RC Church.\n\n \n Jesus did found his Church, we know that by Scripture\n \n \"I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\"\n \n but why do you dismiss the Catholic church?\n \n \"RC\" or Roman Catholic is not a Church only a Rite within the Catholic Church. I mean if we read the section where Christ talks about building his Church we find that he says to the apostle Simon that he will build his church on him, then he gives the primacy of authority to Simon, then under simon his apostles.\n \n So which church was founded on Rock, on simon the apostle, which Church can trace its leadership history back to Simon?\n \n Only 1 The Catholic Church\n \n \n \nThe core beliefs are true for all sects and many of them basically true for other faiths.\n\n \n The core beliefs are true for all sects... The Catholic faith dosnt have sects, we have rites... If you mean the Core beliefs are true for all three Christian Faiths... Protestant Faith, Orthodox Faith and Catholic Faith, then I have to disagree not ALL core beliefs are the Same, for example the Jehova Witness Sect of the protestant faith does not believe in the Trinity but still call themselves Christian.\n \n Then Again the Protestant faith in itself has different Core Beliefs to Catholicism and the orthodox faith in that its core belief is the doctrines of Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide, from their on in all sects of protestantism vary differently in their individual core beliefs to Catholicism and The Orthodox Faith. I do however agree that we do share about 95% of Christian doctrine. But not all Core Beliefs are ture for all Faiths or \"sects\" of protestantism\n \n Christianity is made up of 3 faiths.\n \n Catholicism\n Orthodoxy\n Protestantism\n \n \n Catholicsim is Made up of Christian Rites all of which are united as one under the Pope and the Holy See\n \n Orthodox is made up of individual Christian Churches under authority of of indivdual patriarchs\n \n Protestantism is Made up of individual Christian Sects under authority to individual pastors or monarch\n \n \n \nThe rest is liturgical mumbo-jumbo\n\n \n Same to with The book of Revelation?\n \n \nI didn't know that numerology was another Catholic superstition...\n\n \n Its not \n \n \nWhich sects have the truth?\n \n How many have between 30%-70% of the truth?\n\n \n I would say the protestant faith has about 95% truth over all but individual sects can vary even to the point dismissing the divinity of Christ.\n \n The Church that is the Church built up by Christ and founded on Peter... that Church is the pillar and foundation of all Truth... I read that somewhere\n \n \n \nCatholicism is linked to the governing body. You (if you're Catholic) believe that God separated Peter of all the Apostles, gave him alone special powers/rights and that only the bishops from only one of the Sees he was associated with (viz Rome) have the sole right to those rights.\n\n \n \nCatholicism is linked to the governing body\n\n \n Catholicism is a Faith, a faith that has a Governing Body. \n \n \nYou (if you're Catholic) believe that God separated Peter of all the Apostles\n\n \n Dont you believe that?\n \n Jesus Said it was so!\n \n \"who do you say that I am?\" Simon  (NOT ANY OF THE OTHERS) answered, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!\" And Jesus responded, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, (JC SINGLED SIMON OUT AND CALLED HIM BLESSED) because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father in heaven.\n \n (NOTICE JESUS SAYS THIS REVELATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SIMON (NOT THE ANY OR ALL OF THE OTHERS) IT HAS NOT BEEN REVELED TO SIMON BY ANY OF THE APOSTLES OR ANY OTHER MAN BUT BY GOD, (no one knows the son except the father) NOT BY HUMAN BEINGS, JESUS SINGLES SIMON OUT AND TELLS HIM IT IS BECAUSE GOD HAS REVELED THIS TO HIM)\n \n \n \n NOW BECAUSE OF THIS GIFT FROM GOD ALONE JESUS ALSO SINGLES HIM OUT AND GIVES SIMON NOT ANY OTHER APOSTLE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH, THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. \n \n And I also say to you \n \n NOTICE JESUS SINGLES OUT SIMON JUST AS GOD DID AND SAYS THAT HE IS GOING TO REVEAL SOMETHING TO SIMON JUST AS GOD DID: \n \n \"The Son is not able to do anything on His own, but only what He sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same way.\" \n \n \n FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVELEAD THIS TO YOU BUT MY FATHER IN HEAVEN AND I ALSO SAY TO YOU\n \n that you are Peter (PETER COMES FROM THE LATIN PETROS, JESUS WOULD HAVE SAID THE WORD CEPHAS OR KEPHA WHICH MEANS ROCK), and on this rock I will build My church, \n \n Jesus' Church, not Peters Church!\n \n and the gates of hell will not previal against it. \n \n I will give you  Simon who is now Called \"Rock\"\n \n the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\"\n \n \ngave him alone special powers/rights \n\n \n Powers & Rights - No!\n \n Not Quite. Jesus Who is God did Give Peter the primacy of Authority & infallibility among the apostles, but the apostles also shared in that Authority and infalliblity so long as they were one with Peter.\n \n I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers\n \n \nand that only the bishops from only one of the Sees he was associated with have the sole right to those rights.\n\n \n But Peter was the bishop of Rome, he was never bishop of Jeruselem or Antioch or any other localised group of believers.... in a World where the roman empire cntrolled the majority of the world the church who had branched out accross the whole of that empire used Rome as its headquarters... Peter was the bishop of Rome, He was Cheif apostle, when he died his office was vacant whoever became bishop of rome occupied the seat of peter, the primary office at the headquarters of the church.\n \n No other local authority in the church claims over all authority, neither jeruselem, antioch or any of the other local authorities linked to st peter.",

For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" \n (Matthew 8:5-10) \n \n Jesus heals a deaf Gentile:\n \n Mark 7:31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. 32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. 33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\"). 35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.\n \n Jesus witnesses to the Greeks: \n \n John 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. 21T hey came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" 22 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. 23 Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 25 The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.... 34 The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?\" 35 Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. 36 Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\"\n \n Jesus commands his disciples to take his Gospel to all nations: \n \n Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\n \n Elsewhere, Jesus heals the Gentile Woman's daughter (Matthew 15), appoints Paul as a witness to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), and suffers on the Cross of Calvary for the sins of all men (Jew and Gentile alike).",

Like so many other words, it has more than one meaning. Its strict biological definition is \"a change in allele frequencies over time.\" By that definition, evolution is an indisputable fact. Most people seem to associate the word \"evolution\" mainly with common descent, the theory that all life arose from one common ancestor. Many people believe that there is enough evidence to call this a fact, too. However, common descent is still not the theory of evolution, but just a fraction of it (and a part of several quite different theories as well). The theory of evolution not only says that life evolved, it also includes mechanisms, like mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift, which go a long way towards explaining how life evolved. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-misconceptions.html\n \n You two are the ONLY ONES :p who think \"evolution\" has one, simple definition.

Remember that Jesus did send the Holy Spirit to guide his Church.\n \n To say that the church is \"purely\" man-made is at best incomplete and at worst ludicrous. \n \n \nIn all my reading of the Gospels I see no hierarchy for a Church which Jesus set up. The later writings refer to what man did afterwards.\n\n Do you see any hint of hierarchy in John 21:15-19?\n \n What about in Matthew 16:19 cross referenced with Isaiah 22:15-25 in regard to the keys to the kingdom?\n \n Although Peter was not the first to be called, after being called he always seemed to be first. In Matthew 10 he is listed first in the list of the apostles. The Greek word protos is used to designate him. This word means \"foremost,\" \"best,\" or \"chief.\" Peter's name is listed first in every scriptural listing of the apostles and sometimes they are referred to as \"Peter and the others.\" (Judas is always listed last). Peter's name is mentioned 195 times in the New Testament, more than all of the other apostles added together. The next closest is John at 34 times. Jesus chose Peter's boat from which to preach and work miracles. Peter is the only apostle to be personally prayed for by Jesus (Luke 22:31-32) and he tells Peter to \"strengthen his brethren.\" The risen Christ appeared first to Peter (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5). Peter headed the meeting to replace Judas, he led the apostles in preaching on Pentecost and received the first converts, he performed the first pentecost miracle, inflicted the first punishment, excommunicated the first heretic, etc. Do you see any sense of hierarchy in these facts?\n \n \nI remember no ornate services, ceremonies of the mass set up by Jesus. and so on.\n\n But can you see the foundation of worship in scripture? It is not all man-made!\n \n Matthew 16:18 and 18:17 tell us that he established a church. It is important to read Matthew 16:18 in light of Matthew 7:24-27.\n \n Jesus also established sacraments, the foundation of worship: \n \n You acknowledge the Eucharistic Celebration ...The MASS...the worship of the Church: Matthew 26:26-28 \"Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, 'Take, eat; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.'\" Luke 22:19 \"...Do this in remembrance of me.\" \n \n Baptism: Matthew 28:19 \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. John 3:5 \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.\" John 3:22 \"After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there he remained with them and baptized.\"\n \n Confession: John 20:22-23\"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\"\n \n Marriage: Matthew 19:5-6, Mark 10:7-12, Matthew 5:32-33\n \n Anointing of the Sick: Mark 6:12-13 \"And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.\"\n \n \nCan you indicate one building that Jesus set up. Can you tell me one person he called Archbishop, Bishop, Deacon or Curate etc?\n\n Are you telling me that Jesus had a problem with buildings of worship? Do you not know that Jesus was used to worshipping in buildings? \n \n Was Jesus not presented in the temple (Luke 2:21-38)? \n Was he not found in the temple \"about his Father's work\" (Luke 2:41-52)? \n Did he not clear his Father's house of wrongdoing, declaring it a place of worship (John 2:14-17)? \n Did he not teach in the synagogues (Matthew 4:23 and 9:35, Luke 13:10)?\n \n Do you not think a physical church is a logical extension of Jesus' Jewish heritage that he willingly participated in?\n \n A person he called bishop, etc.? See the above concerning the designation of Peter as the chief shepherd of the flock in John and his designation of \"prime minister\" as Matthew 16:19 and Isaiah 22 indicate.\n \n \nJesus was after all a Jew and I suspect was all for reforming the Jewish faith and opening it for mankind.\n\n Indeed!",

   "Here's something Jesus didn't do: write any books. The Bible is a manmade creation! Yes, but divinely inspired, and for some reason many Protestants will not question it, even though it was put together after the Church (about 300 some years after the Church was founded, in fact). As regards to limitless \"interpretations\":\n \n In the U.S. we have a 200 some year old document that requires a Judicial branch to interpret it. Now, if we assume that human laws mirror divine laws, why would we not assume that there must exist a Church to interpret what a book (or set of books) assembled over 1600 years ago says? We can have only one answer, that such an interpreter MUST exist, and that is the Catholic Church. \n \n Quit hijacking the thread about whether or not so and so is a coward. Start another thread for that. I'd like to request the ad hominems get deleted so that the real discussions can continue. INRI is doing a wonderful job.",
