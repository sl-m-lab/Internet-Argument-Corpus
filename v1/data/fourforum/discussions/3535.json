Germany have had a general tax rate (total tax revenue as percentage of GDP) of no more than 38,2% (1995).

Out of these Asutria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxemburgh, Norway and Sweden had over 42% in 2001.\n \n The highest general tax rate, 54,2% is seen in Sweden during the year 2000. \n \n \n Their unemployment rate is over 10%, and yet those unemployed still receive paychecks from the government.
