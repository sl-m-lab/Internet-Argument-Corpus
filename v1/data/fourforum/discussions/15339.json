   "YouTube - The American Dream By The Provocateur Network\n \n Came across this in a chain email.\n\n Lol, that was actually pretty enjoyable. I could have done with less demonization of banks though. It is not the business model of a real bank that is the problem it is the legal exception that allows them in this case to do what would be theft or extortion for anyone else.\n \n The solution is simple and foolproof. \n \n A single pool of currency. Unchanging, and static.\n \n Deflation, of course but why is that bad? It reflects the nature of the market, wealth is increasing and so any given piece of the pie must also increase in value. There are no serious disadvantages but the benefit of leaving no weakness to exploit by future government decisions is immense. It is the only way a government can promise without reserve that it's currency is accurate, not to a specific amount of wealth but to a fraction of it.",
