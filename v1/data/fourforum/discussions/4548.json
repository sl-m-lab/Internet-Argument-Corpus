   "...from \"morallybankrupt\" on the NY Times Gay Rights forum:\n \n \n1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control. \n \n 2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children. \n \n 3. Obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. \n \n 4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful if Gay marriage is allowed, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful. Also, as further proof of this I have documented a long study which strictly proves that only heterosexuals are capable of upholding the sacred bonds of marriage that. Oh, wait, I'll have to get back to this later, \"Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire\" is on. \n \n 5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal and punishable by death. \n \n 6. Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities. \n \n 7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. \n \n 8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. \n \n 9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. \n \n 10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children. \n \n 11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to things like cars or longer lifespan. \n \n 12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a \"separate but equal\" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will. And let's not forget camps! If those homosexuals get too rowdy, we can always send them off to go camping for a bit. Just look at how it mellowed out the Jews in WWII Germany!\n",

   "First, let me say: \"SOMEONE UNCLEAR ON THE CONCEPT\" of satire. \n (Now let's get to the grit of mana'ia's comments)\n \n \n \n \nThere is a natural need to see clearly, wear clothes, and regulate child birth.\n\n \n It's natural to want to see clearly, but there's no law saying you have to, nor is there any law denying this from anyone. Clothes are not natural, if you really want to get picky. Cromagna man never wore clothes. Clothes are an invention of the concept of vanity. Regulating childbirth is also not natural, childbirth itself is natural, but regualating it isn't. Again, it's another concept of vanity. \n \n \nMarriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit.\n\n \n But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.\n Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No. \n \n \n \nIt is impossible to know if a heterosexual will give birth just the likelihood.\n\n \n Impossible? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nNo the agrument is misstated. Gay [parents] are not the optimal palce to raise a family. Gay parents can but the ideal place is a traditional family.\n\n \n Try reading reports done by the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) on gay parenting. \n Here's the link: \n \n http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/search?SITESECTION=policy_statement%2Cclinical_report%2Ctechnical_report%2Cpractice_guidelines%2Cparent_pages%2Cendorsed_policy_statement%2Cendorsed_clinical_report%2Cendorsed_technical_report%2Cendorsed_practice_guidelines&AAP_FLAG=CURRENT&datetype=rangedates&titleabstract=&fulltext=gay+parent&imageField.x=64&imageField.y=16\n \n (yeah it's a long one...)\n \n \n \n \nGay marriage will change the institution.\n\n \n So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage! \n \n Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it. \n \n \n Just becasue some [people] are bad at fulfilling something doesn't mean that others should be allwoed to corrupt the institution as well.\n\n \n Corruption and change are not the same thing.\n \n corruption\n \n n 1: lack of integrity or honesty (especially susceptibility to bribery); use of a position of trust for dishonest gain [syn: corruptness] [ant: incorruptness] 2: in a state of progressive putrefaction [syn: putrescence, putridness, rottenness] 3: decay of matter (as by rot or oxidation) 4: moral perversion; impairment of virtue and moral principles\n \n Hmmm... Seems \"some people are bad\" at understanding the meaning of the words they use.\n I hate to break it to you, but heterosexuals are corrupting marriage themselves. I really can't see how encouraging and extending marraige to a group who actually want it, who actively seek it, and who actually respect it can harm it more than you people already have. \n Acutally, I can't see how allowing gays to marry would have anything but a possitive effect on the institution, which obviously needs some change.\n \n \n [It's] like saying since many people default on student loans, then loans standards should be relaxed to accommodate other people who can as easily default on a loan.\n\n \n Nope, you're simply assuming that gays are anymore likely to default on student loans than are heterosexuals. Actually what is happening now is more akin to saying that because heterosexual students default on student loans then gay students shouldn't be approved for student loans because there's no evidence to show that gay students are anymore responcible than heterosexual students. \n What that is is an erronious assumption without any factual information to back it up. \n \n \n \nThose haven't change the institution of marraige just the legal ramification, parameters, and requirements.\n\n \n Gee, I don't know about the rest of the group here but changing the ramifications, parameters and requirements of an institution are indeed some major reconstrution vehicles. \n \n \n The concept still is the same.\n\n \n The concept being: Two Adult Human Beings entering into a legal contract which grants them certain rights, protections, priveledges, and liberties which are not granted to those citizens who choose to live their lives without a committed relationship. \n \n Extending this concept to include gay couples in NO WAY changes it. \n \n \n \n \nThe people should decide becasue that is democracy. There have been times which democracy has failed but when the courts intiate against the people. The people have the right to change the constitution when courts abuse their [powers]. They can't violate separation of powers and not expect the people to change it.\n\n \n Ah, but this is where you fail to understand the concept of a DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC! We are not a nation founded solely on Democracy or Republicanism. We are a unique blend of both concepts. Our countries political concept is infact an ongoing experiment. \n If it were not for the courts and their \"Liberal Judges\" we wouldn't have interracial marriage in the first place. \n \n \n \nDemocracy determines what is morally acceptable in this country. WE have prositution legalized in Nevada but other states do not accept it. That is democracy. The people decide what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" based upon teh criteria that is conforming to the constituion.\n\n \n Well on this one, I will just say: read jitobears responce. \n \n \n \nGay marriage will send the message that homosexuality is acceptable. [It] will enable many people to practice [it] more freely [instead]of seeking treatment.\n\n \n Treatment for what? \n Being homosexual? \n For loving differently than you? \n \n Being gay isn't a disease, it's not a disorder and it's not \"bad\". You may not like it. So what? I don't like your atitude about it, but am I saying you can't be heterosexual? No. \n Do I try to change your sexuality? No.\n What you do in the PRIVACY of your bedroom is really your business. I don't want to know. I don't have any issues which prevents me from being content in my relationship to the point where I have to stick my nose into other people's relationships in order to feel somehow superior. \n That's the real illness.\n \n \n \nHow can you draw a line where marraige will end? Polygamy, bigamy, underage people? Any argument for gay marriage can almsot be applied to those marraiges.\n\n \n Pish-posh! \n Get real. It didn't happen with women gaining the right to vote, it didn't happen with desegragation, it didn't happen with interracial marriage. \n It's a slipery slope falicy and you know it. \n \n \n \nThe argument is children are most successful in traditional families.\n\n \n Which has been disproven already. The research has been done, as well as the personal testimonials here. \n Jitobear's family doesn't quite fit the \"traditional\" definition, nor does mine. Our children are just fine. They are not sexually confused, they are not gender disphoric, they are not ill adjusted or have anykind of esteam issues. \n \n Heck, being that I only know my son, not jito's, I can say with all confidence that my son is not only \"well adjusted\" but actually one of the \"popular\" kids. Which for this area is quite an accomplishment. But I do not feel the need to qualify this for you. You will indeed have to take my word for it. \n \n \n \ncars address the needs of transportation. The need for transportaion has always existed.\n\n \n But the modes have changed, grown and expanded with time. First it was the FEET, then the wheel was invented. Not the other way around. There is a wide range of choices when it comes to transportation. Cars are not the be all and end all. \n \n \n \n[Longer] lifespans have been around before.\n Before what? \n \n \n We are adapted to living longer.\n\n \n No, we have adapted, but we are not intended to do so. Just look at the soring needs of the elderly. The millions of dollars spent on drugs, just to keep people alive but for what? Just to need even more drugs as they get older? \n That's not really what I would call natural, but it is the current norm. \n \n \n \n \n \n Civil unions is a copmpromised offer to no recognition. We are saying you ahve the irght to enter the marraige institution but oif you want to enter a different institution this is what we are willing to offer.\n \n It's like saying you have the right to cross the stree at the cross walk.\n \n Gays say that crosswalk isn't appealling to me. I want to cross right here. We say fine you can have a cross walk right there but we won't put a light to regulate it.\n \n Do you have every right to cross at the same cross walk?\n \n Why do you want a different crosswalk because the other one is appealling?[/QUOTE]",

   "In terms of minorities rights we refer to indivdiual rights. behavior isn't what the consitution meant to protect as a minority. It was meant to apply teh alw evenly to everyone and protect everyone's rights based ont eh individaul not because of behavior, hence the penal system.\n\n \n This does not make sense to me. The Constitution protects minorities in three ways: First, it spells out the powers of the government, and any powers invoked by the government that are not listed in the Constitution are unconstitutional. This means that since the Constitution does not list many powers of the government to take away freedoms, the government does not have that power. Second, it lists specific rights held by all individuals that the government is not entitled to take away. This includes freedom of speech, religion, the right to bear arms, the right to a fair trial to determine a crime, and others, each of which protect the behavior of individuals. Third, all governmental power is not given directly to the majority; it is dampened because officials must make decisions, it is an indirect power. The most prominant protection for minorities comes in the form of the judicial system, which is neither elected by the majority or held accountable to the majority or mob-rule in any fashion. Certainly the judicial system is able and intended to protect the minority when the majority is annoyed with their behavior.\n \n \nSince we are a republic then representatives vote on our behalf.\n\n \n As described in the Federalist papers, elected officials are intended to vote in such a fashion that benefits everyone; they are not intended to vote along the lines of the majority vote.\n \n \nThere are reports that dispute that. The report focuses on gay parenting being good. If you understood that the AAP members disagree with their own boards decisions then you'd understand how much credibility the report has. Also it focus on the need for children to have two parents. it does not state that it is the optimal place for children.\n\n \n No study or report is going to prove the optimal environment for children, but there is no reason to believe that two parents of different gender should be better than two parents of opposite gender. The only reasonable argument I have heard which suggests that this might be the case is that a child needs to learn from the experiences of both genders, for each gender holds a different role in society. Yet this argument is flawed in that teaching a child which role each gender holds in society limits that child's potential only to those roles, and I do not see how this can somehow be construed as a good thing.\n \n Even if there were a way to prove which set of parents were optimal, it would make absolutely no sense to deny marriage to the group less optimal. What if it were that same-sex parents are more optimal than opposite-sex parents? Does it then make sense to deny marriage benefits to opposite-sex parents? What if it could be shown that Muslim parents are more optimal than Christian parents? Would it then make sense to deny marriage to Christian parents. What if it could be shown that black parents are more optimal than white parents? Surely one must be more optimal than the other in every case. We've seen that same-sex couples are capable of raising children well, and it is not now and never has been the place of the government to benefit it's preferred type of family over its less preferred type. Same-sex parents have the same needs as opposite-sex parents, and that's the bottom line; to deny them benefits is to promote the majority lifestyle over the minority. It is to promote tyranny of the majority.\n \n \nyou can have full and legal recognition if you marry a psermissble partner. It's like someone going to dinner and saying I don't like that because I'm not a vegetarian. You may not be a vegetarian but we aren't discriminating you, jsut your preference.\n\n \n So let's assume for the moment that it is a choice, that it is just like vegetarianism. Is it morally good to go out to dinner with your vegetarian friend, but to choose a restaurant with no vegetarian dishes? Can you then just say, \"Hey, sorry, you chose to be a vegetarian\" and not feel like a jerk?\n \n But we're not talking about dinner, we're talking about legal benefits under the law. Is it thus fair to deny vegetarians food stamps, then say, \"hey, sorry, you can choose to be something different.\" Of course it isn't; there is no reason to deny vegetarians food stamps; to do so is evil. It is nothing but evil to force someone to conform to your beliefs and your lifestyle, your \"preference\", before you grant them equal benefits under the law. It is tyranny.\n \n \nPost a statute that denies you rights as an indivdual and not your preference.\n\n \n I challenge you to post any law which denies rights or benefits based not on harm caused, but solely because of a different preference, lifestyle, or belief. Then tell me, is such a law not morally evil?",

   "The problem with trying to get as far away as we can from the idea of \"sexual preference\" and \"choice\" when it comes to homosexuality is that it leans too far into the thinking that we as human beings are slaves to our libido.
