Here is a copy of a letter I just sent to the local paper:\n A challenge for those who wish to proselytize through the Concord Monitor Letters: complete the exercises and readings on the website www.godisimaginary.com . For normal, intelligent people god is an imaginary creation of ancient Bronze Age cultures. The bible is collection of legends, myths, stories and superstitions of super natural beings not unlike the gods of ancient Greece or Rome. The sometimes barbaric rituals, like eating flesh and drinking blood, come from pagan rites as well. \n \n If we look at the history of our culture and the histories of other cultures, we quickly realize that religion has an evil element which has caused and continues to cause great death, pain and destruction. As Mark Twain once said, \"Faith is believing what you know ain't so.\" From Christopher Hitchens, \"Monotheistic religion is a plagiarism of a plagiarism of a hearsay of a hearsay, of an illusion of an illusion, extending all the way back to a fabrication of a few nonevents.\" god is not Great, How Religion Poisons Everything",

He needed to do a lot more and could have if his last 3 brain cells had been working.\n \n Merv had lots of problems coming out. He was from that Rock Hudson, damned if you're a XXXXX, era. An era of McCarthyism and \"arranged\" marriages. He was brought up to be in the closet and it worked for him financially. He was influenced by the conservative and not so gay friendly circles that he travelled in. It was a rough life for gays from the 40s to 60s. But, many of his closest colleagues didn't pay attention to it and deined it. Hey, some people choose to be activists, others choose not to. He just didn't want to be an activist. Activism isn't cut out for everyone.\n \n I don't think hollywood has changed that much. I mean, it's ok for straight actors to play gay characters... but if you come out... taboo! That would make a good discussion.\n \n I remember my brief encounter with Merv. He was a very funny and sweet flirtatous man. He was a bit queeny IMO. But so funny. Always had something good to say to whomever he met face to face.\n \n He sent me a bottle of champagne once thanking me for helping with the deal that he and his attorney were working on.

(Does anyone remember that's how Arthur Treacher (of fish and chips fame) introduced him on his talk show.) This is a guy who was not at all secret about his attractions within the confines of Hollywood. He surrounded himself with boy toys and did more than look. Yet to Mr. and Mrs. America he is completely mum about his sexual orientation and totally pretends he's straight, with a fake wife and all.

As long as Joe Sixpack continues to think that gays are this creepy aberration that only live in San Francisco and wear dresses, things cannot change.

   " Merv Griffin died a closeted homosexual\n \n By Ray Richmond Thu Aug 16, 11:49 PM ET\n \n LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Merv Griffin was gay.\n \n \n Why should that be so uncomfortable to read? Why is it so difficult to write? Why are we still so jittery even about raising the issue in purportedly liberal-minded Hollywood, in 2007?\n \n Griffin, who died of prostate cancer Sunday at 82, stayed in the closet throughout his life. Perhaps he figured it was preferable to remain the object of gossip rather than live openly as \"one of them.\"\n \n But how tremendously sad it is that a man of Merv's renown, of his gregarious nature and social dexterity, would feel compelled to endure such a stealthy double life even as the gay community's clout, and its levels of acceptance and equality, rose steadily from the ashes of ignorance.\n \n What a powerful message Griffin might have sent had he squired his male companions around town rather than Eva Gabor, his longtime good friend and platonic public pal. Imagine the amount of good Merv could have done as a well-respected, hugely successful, beloved and uncloseted gay man in embodying a positive image.\n \n I had more than a passing acquaintance with him, having worked on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" as a talent coordinator/segment producer in 1985-86 as the show was winding down. Around the office, Merv's being gay was understood but rarely discussed (and certainly never with him). We knew nothing of his relationships because he guarded his privacy fiercely, and we didn't pry.\n \n Merv's secret gay life was widely known throughout showbiz culture, if not the wider America. It gained traction in 1991 when he was targeted in a pair of lawsuits: by \"Dance Fever\" host Denny Terrio, alleging sexual harassment; and by assistant Brent Plott seeking $200 million in palimony. Both ultimately were dismissed.\n \n Over the past 16 years of his life, however, Griffin deflected the sexuality questions with a quip, determining that his private life remained nobody's business. He certainly didn't owe us an explanation, but maybe he owed it to himself to remove the suffocating veil he'd been forced to hide behind throughout his adult life. Then again, Merv carved his niche in the entertainment world at a time when being gay wasn't OK, when disclosure was unthinkable and the allegation alone could deep-six one's career.\n \n If you're Griffin, why would you think a judgmental culture would be any more tolerant as you grew into middle and old age? Even in the capital of entertainment -- in a business where homosexuality isn't exactly a rare phenomenon -- it's still spoken of in hushed tones or, more often, not at all. And Merv's brush with tabloid scandal no doubt only drove him further into the closet.\n \n While it would seem everything has changed today, little actually has. You can count on the fingers of one hand, or at most two, the number of high-powered stars, executives and public figures who have come out. Those who don't can't really be faulted, as rarely do honesty and full disclosure prove a boon to one's showbiz livelihood.\n \n Nonetheless, the elephant that was his sexual orientation never really stopped following Griffin from room to room. He could duck it for a while, but it would always find him. It's disheartening that Merv had to die to shake it for good.\n \n Reuters/Hollywood Reporter",
