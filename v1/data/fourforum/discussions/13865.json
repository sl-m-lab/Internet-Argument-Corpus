   "I just assumed a 'fundie' is a Christian that believes that the Bible is the direct word of God and is to be taken as fact.\n\n \n Ah, but there are LIBERAL FUNDIES too!\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism \n \n Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or one's neighbors. On the other hand, there's a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today - liberal fundamentalism. \n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love,\" illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong,\" and \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it \"feels good, let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their \"progressive\" mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is \"equality.\" The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom,\" liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n It is certainly arguable, then, that \"progressive\" liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. - Author Unknown \n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

I believe differently than many others who believe in the Bible, and because of that, there's the typical hostility toward those who don't \"fit the mould.\" Scorning somebody because they're different? Please assure me that's not what you are doing in your post.\n \n I really hope someday the world progresses beyond this kind of preemptive scorn. Ghandi once said, \"I like your Christ, but I don't like your Christians. They are so unlike Christ.\" I think this is the core of it: Christ preached unity, friendship and peace. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\" (Matthew 22:39) \"Love one another.\" (John 13:34-35) He didn't say, \"Love thy neighbor except the heathen.\",\" or \"Love one another as long as your they believe the same as you do.\"\n \n You could at least pretend to have respect for other people's deeply held beliefs, couldn't you? And btw, you're pretty far off on this comment. Forget about the God you've already decided that I believe in. Let me tell you about the God I actually believe in. He is the God of the Bible, an omnipotent, omniscient being who rule the entire universe (--not just some little acre. You might consider checking your sources). He is eternal. He created all that is and was. He loves us all unconditionally. He sent His only begotten Son to save us all from our sins. \n \n One can make anything sound nuts. Watch this: Christmas is a holiday where families sit around a dead tree in the living room eating candy out of decorative socks, and pull colored paper off of boxes. Weird.\n When you know more about it, it sounds much less weird. To you and me, it's a normal and integral part of winter, and celebrating the birth of Christ. \n \n We believe that His body was created by God. We do not believe that His being, His essence was created. It is eternal.\n \n I really hope I'm not coming off sounding harsh here. I'm so used to be reviled as soon as I post the words, \"I'm Mormon.\" I don't intend to spend a lot of time dwelling on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints here. (That's the real name of the church.) This thread isn't about us, and I don't want to detract from the topic at hand. I'm thinking of creating a new thread to clear up many misconceptions about my religion. I'll let you know when I do.\n\n \n From long debates on Bnet and CARM, and seeing responses of 'Mormons', what you are espousing that you believe is not what your Church espouses, so you may want to check that out.",
