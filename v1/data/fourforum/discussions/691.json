The wavelengths that get scattered most are on the blue end of the spectrum. So when the sun is more or less straight up, and thus it's light is travelling through the least amount of air, it's mostly only the blue light that gets scattered, and so the air looks blue. Basically, we have light that comes in at a bit of an angle, and the redder wavelengths go straight, while the bluer wavelengths bounce all over. Some of them hit your eye, and so you see blue in that direction. When the sun is very low, and the light has to travel through alot of air, the blue gets completely scattered, to the point where it's lost.

   "(The second link is actually a LOT more interesting if you go directly to it.)\n \n \n \n http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/bluesky.html\n \n A semi-detailed explanation\n By Matt McIrvin\n This is the original, linear version of my blue-sky explanation (apart from cosmetic changes, and some recent small changes in phrasing). The new version serves up essentially the same content in smaller chunks linked to a simpler overview, and may be more comprehensible to non-scientists; choose according to taste. See \"About the blue-sky pages\" for some history.\n Contents\n 1. The basic idea: dipole scattering \n 2. Retarded potentials \n 3. The potentials of an oscillating dipole \n 4. Radiation fields \n 5. The sky, the sunset, and a Martian postscript \n No other question so strongly evokes images of parents shrugging their shoulders in bewilderment when kids ask it. (It isn't the champion in the blushing and stammering category, but I believe it leads the pack in bewilderment.) Popular books on science often simply explain that air molecules preferentially scatter blue light from the sun, but stop there. I thought that it might be interesting to provide a more detailed, but not tremendously mathematical, explanation of why this is so.\n 1. The basic idea: dipole scattering\n Light is an electromagnetic wave. If you stand in one spot as a light wave passes by, there will be an oscillating electric field and an oscillating magnetic field, which are perpendicular to each other. If the light is in the range of frequencies that we can see, then the frequency of the vibration affects the color of the light. The color-vision receptors in our eyes, the cones, are of three types: \"blue\" receptors that respond to light over a broad range of high frequencies, \"green\" receptors that respond to medium frequencies, and \"red\" receptors that respond to low frequencies. The ranges of sensitivity of the receptors overlap considerably, but they have their maximum sensitivities at different frequencies. The perceived color depends (among other things) on the relative strengths of the signals from these receptors.\n Molecules are usually electrically neutral, but they are made of charged objects: their atoms consist of negatively charged electrons and positively charged nuclei. If there is an electric field at the position of an atom, the nucleus will move a short distance in the direction of the field and the electrons will move the other way, and the atom will become a \"dipole\": the positive and negative charge will be centered around different places. A molecule made of such atoms will acquire its own electric field, something like the magnetic field of a bar magnet.\n A dipole's electric field falls off more rapidly with distance than it would if the molecule had a net electric charge. This is because at large distances, the fields from the positive and the negative charge tend to cancel each other out, as the difference between their average positions becomes less important.\n However, if the dipole is made to oscillate-- that is, if the positive and negative charge wiggle back and forth, out of phase with each other-- then the molecule can produce electromagnetic radiation of its own, for reasons I'll explain below. This is how air molecules scatter light: the oscillating electric field of the incoming wave makes the molecules develop oscillating dipoles, which in turn give off radiation.\n The radiation destructively interferes with the incoming wave in the forward direction. The original wave is lessened in intensity, and new waves move out in all other directions, so that overall energy is conserved (this requirement is sometimes called the \"optical theorem\"). The net effect is that light energy that was moving in a straight line from the sun ends up traveling in some other direction.\n Since sunlight appears white but the sky is a robin's-egg blue, it must be that the scattered light excites our blue-sensing cones more, and our red-sensing cones less, than the original sunlight. The distribution of frequencies in the scattered light must be biased toward high frequencies. Why is this?\n Contents\n 2. Retarded potentials\n Scalar and vector potentials\n In the theory of electromagnetic radiation, it is not so convenient to work with the electric and magnetic fields directly, except for simple plane waves. It is more convenient to use the \"scalar potential\" and \"vector potential.\"\n You are probably already familiar with the scalar potential: in many situations, it is just the same thing as voltage. A 5-volt battery has a scalar potential difference of 5 volts between its terminals. The electric field, in static situations (given the usual potential conventions of electrostatics), is just given by the spatial rate of change of the scalar potential, and it points \"downhill\" toward regions of lower electric potential.\n There is also a \"vector potential\" that has to do with magnetism. This is a quantity with a magnitude and a direction: a vector. In static situations, the magnetic field is related in a somewhat complicated way to the rates of change of the vector potential in various directions: essentially, it has to do with the extent to which the vector potential swirls around a given point.\n If the potentials are changing with time, as in radiation, then the relation between the potentials and the fields is more complicated. But in either case, in size, the electric and magnetic fields are proportional to the rates of change of the potentials in space and time.\n Potentials, charges, and currents\n Now, if the potentials are defined in a certain way (what the pros will recognize as a \"covariant gauge\"), the potential due to a certain charge and current distribution is related to the charges and currents in an extremely simple way.\n Suppose there is a point charge somewhere in space, which moves around. Then the scalar potential at some other place is directly proportional to the charge, and inversely proportional to the distance to the charge.\n But it is not the distance to the place where the charge is now; it is the distance to the place where the charge was, at such a time that a signal traveling at the speed of light from the position of the charge is just now getting to the place where we're calculating the potential. The news about where the particle is travels at a finite speed, the speed of light. This is called a \"retarded potential,\" meaning \"delayed,\" because it responds to the charge's position with a speed-of-light delay.\n If there is more than just a point charge, then the scalar potential can be calculated by adding up the retarded potential of each little bit of charge.\n The vector potential is related in exactly the same way to the currents. Each little piece of current creates a retarded vector potential that is proportional to current and inversely proportional to distance, and the news about where the current is travels at the speed of light.\n Contents\n 3. The potentials of an oscillating dipole\n Now consider a molecule that is a dipole. For simplicity, model the molecular dipole as a pair of opposite point charges, separated by a short distance. (Really, the positive charge consists of a couple of nuclei and the negative charge is a spread-out cloud of electrons, and the dipole comes from the separation between their average positions; but idealizing the molecule as a pair of point charges doesn't change the analysis in any substantive way, as long as the molecule is small.)\n If the dipole is not changing, then at large distances, the scalar potential due to one end of the dipole and the scalar potential due to the other end will tend to cancel each other out, since the distance to the two charges is almost the same. So the scalar potential will fall off faster with distance than it does for a single charge.\n But the news about the charge only travels at the speed of light! If we are slightly closer to one end of the dipole than to the other, then the potential here depends on the charge at the near end of the dipole at some previous time, and the charge at the far end of the dipole a short time before that. So if the charges are moving back and forth at a high speed, the cancellation between the ends of the dipole will be less complete. For instance, the scalar potential here could depend on the charge at the near end at a time when it was positive, but the charge at the far end at a time when the negative charge had not yet gotten all the way there.\n If the dipole is much smaller than the wavelength of the light (and air molecules are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of visible light), the cancellation becomes linearly less complete as the frequency of the oscillation increases. So at large distances, where the scalar potential of the static dipole would be negligible, the scalar potential due to an oscillating dipole goes up linearly with the frequency.\n How about the vector potential? That's easier to figure out. It also varies linearly with frequency, because it's proportional to the current-- and the faster the charges are moving, the more current there is.\n The potentials that are produced reverse direction as the dipole reverses direction. If the dipole wiggles back and forth, then oscillating waves of potentials move out from the dipole at the speed of light, with a strength proportional to the frequency of the wiggle. The higher the frequency, the shorter the waves, because they have less time to get out of the way before the dipole changes direction.\n Contents\n 4. Radiation fields\n Now, the electric and magnetic fields are proportional to various rates of change of the potentials, in space and time. They get a factor of frequency from the sizes of the potentials; but they also get another factor of the frequency from the fact that the shorter a wave is, the faster it varies in space; and the higher its frequency is, the faster it varies in time. So the fields are proportional to the square of the frequency.\n But we are not done yet! The important thing is how much power is transmitted by the wave, and that is proportional to the product of the electric field and the magnetic field. So the power density in the wave goes up as the fourth power of the frequency.\n Therefore, the spectrum of the radiated light, and the scattered light from an induced dipole, will be very strongly peaked at high frequencies, or short wavelengths. There are things I have neglected here, such as the fact that sometimes, there are resonant frequencies at which the charge oscillates particularly strongly when driven by an oscillating field. These frequencies are determined by the quantum mechanics of the molecule. However, in this particular case, the effect of resonance is not a major contributor at visible wavelengths.\n A full analysis would also take into account the fact that the electromagnetic field is quantized; the energy comes in photons. But that turns out not to affect the fourth-power dependence of the spectrum on frequency.\n This sort of scattering is called Rayleigh scattering, after Lord Rayleigh, who first worked it out for a very small classical dipole.\n Contents\n 5. The sky, the sunset, and a Martian postscript\n If the dipole is a molecular dipole created by an electromagnetic wave from the sun impinging on an air molecule, then it is the higher frequencies that will be primarily scattered in different directions, and removed from the incoming wave. Lower frequencies will be scattered as well, but not as much; the scattered power goes like the fourth power of the frequency.\n The atmosphere does not absorb much light at visible wavelengths; the dominant effect is dipole scattering. The scattered light will be biased toward the high frequencies. If you look at a part of the sky where the sun is not, then your eyes are receiving the scattered light. That light excites the blue- and green- sensing cones in your retinas much more than the red-sensing cones (the largest amount of power is coming in at the frequencies covered by the blue cones, but they are less sensitive than the green ones). The result is the beautiful turquoise color of a clear sky.\n (A previous version of this page claimed that it was also responsible for the color of the Earth seen from space, but Phil Plait argues that the dominant effect there is the greater absorption of long wavelengths by the ocean.)\n The scattering is also responsible for the color of the sun at sunset. Since the emitted radiation removes energy from the incoming waves by destructive interference (thereby conserving the overall energy), the higher frequencies are preferentially depleted from the unscattered beam. At sunset, the sun is shining at a grazing angle through an unusually thick layer of air, so the depletion is particularly pronounced, and the sun appears yellow, orange or red rather than the usual blinding white.\n Notice that this argument depends very little on the composition of the atmosphere. Any clear atmosphere of more or less Earthlike size and density, lit by a sun whose light appears more or less white, would result in a blue sky.\n The color pictures from Mars Pathfinder are a spectacular reminder that the sky is not blue on Mars. Instead, it has colors that have been described as everything from \"orange-pink\" to \"gray-tan\", as was discovered in the 1970s by the Viking landers. This is because the atmosphere of Mars is very thin and dusty, and atmospheric light scattering is dominated not by the molecules of gas (in the case of Mars, mostly carbon dioxide) but by suspended dust particles. These are larger than the wavelengths of visible light, and they are reddened by iron oxide, like Martian soil. It's not just Rayleigh scattering, so the power spectrum is different.\n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html\n \n WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?\n by\n \n SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE\n \n Science Made Simple / Other Topics / Science in the News / Measurement Conversions \n \n COPYRIGHT \u00a91997 BY SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE, INC.\n PO Box 503, Voorhees, NJ 08043\n \n \n INDEX: Why is the sky blue? --- I Can Read \n Learn More about<b></b>: The atmosphere --- Projects \n \n \n On a clear sunny day, the sky above us looks bright blue. In the evening, the sunset puts on a brilliant show of reds, pinks and oranges. Why is the sky blue? What makes the sunset red? \n To answer these questions, we must learn about light, and the Earth's atmosphere. \n THE ATMOSPHERE\n The atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans. \n The composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot. \n The atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space. \n LIGHT WAVES\n Light is a kind of energy that radiates, or travels, in waves. Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. For example, sound is a wave of vibrating air. Light is a wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. It is one small part of a larger range of vibrating electromagnetic fields. This range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. \n Electromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec (186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light. \n \n \n The energy of the radiation depends on its wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance between the tops (crests) of the waves. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by each second. The longer the wavelength of the light, the lower the frequency, and the less energy it contains. \n COLORS OF LIGHT\n Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky. \n \n \n The colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. That means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, and lowest frequency and energy. \n LIGHT IN THE AIR\n Light travels through space in a straight line as long as nothing disturbs it. As light moves through the atmosphere, it continues to go straight until it bumps into a bit of dust or a gas molecule. Then what happens to the light depends on its wave length and the size of the thing it hits. \n Dust particles and water droplets are much larger than the wavelength of visible light. When light hits these large particles, it gets reflected, or bounced off, in different directions. The different colors of light are all reflected by the particle in the same way. The reflected light appears white because it still contains all of the same colors. \n Gas molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If light bumps into them, it acts differently. When light hits a gas molecule, some of it may get absorbed. After awhile, the molecule radiates (releases, or gives off) the light in a different direction. The color that is radiated is the same color that was absorbed. The different colors of light are affected differently. All of the colors can be absorbed. But the higher frequencies (blues) are absorbed more often than the lower frequencies (reds). This process is called Rayleigh scattering. (It is named after Lord John Rayleigh, an English physicist, who first described it in the 1870's.) \n WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?\n The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. \n However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \n \n \n As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white. \n \n \n THE BLACK SKY AND WHITE SUN\n On Earth, the sun appears yellow. If you were out in space, or on the moon, the sun would look white. In space, there is no atmosphere to scatter the sun's light. On Earth, some of the shorter wavelength light (the blues and violets) are removed from the direct rays of the sun by scattering. The remaining colors together appear yellow. \n Also, out in space, the sky looks dark and black, instead of blue. This is because there is no atmosphere. There is no scattered light to reach your eyes. \n \n \n WHY IS THE SUNSET RED?\n As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes. \n \n \n The sky around the setting sun may take on many colors. The most spectacular shows occur when the air contains many small particles of dust or water. These particles reflect light in all directions. Then, as some of the light heads towards you, different amounts of the shorter wavelength colors are scattered out. You see the longer wavelengths, and the sky appears red, pink or orange. \n \n \n Learn Science The Easy Way With \n Science Made Simple. \n Click here to try it now \n Completely Risk Free! \n \n \n \n LEARN MORE about<b></b>:THE ATMOSPHERE\n WHAT IS THE ATMOSPHERE?\n The atmosphere is the mixture of gases and other materials that surround the Earth in a thin, mostly transparent shell. It is held in place by the Earth's gravity. The main components are nitrogen (78.09%), oxygen (20.95%), argon (0.93%), and carbon dioxide (0.03%). The atmosphere also contains small amounts, or traces, of water (in local concentrations ranging from 0% to 4%), solid particles, neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, xenon and ozone. The study of the atmosphere is called meteorology. \n Life on Earth would not be possible without the atmosphere. Obviously, it provides the oxygen we need to breath. But it also serves other important functions. It moderates the planet's temperature, reducing the extremes that occur on airless worlds. For example, temperatures on the moon range from 120 \u00b0C (about 250 \u00b0F) in the day to -170 \u00b0C (about -275 \u00b0F) at night. The atmosphere also protects us by absorbing and scattering harmful radiation from the sun and space. \n Of the total amount of the sun's energy that reaches the Earth, 30% is reflected back into space by clouds and the Earth's surface. The atmosphere absorbs 19%. Only 51% is absorbed by the Earth's surface. \n We are not normally aware of it but air does have weight. The column of air above us exerts pressure on us. This pressure at sea level is defined as one atmosphere. Other equivalent measurements you may hear used are 1,013 millibars, 760 mm Hg (mercury), 29.92 inches of Hg, or 14.7 pounds/square inch (psi). Atmospheric pressure decreases rapidly with height. Pressure drops by a factor of 10 for every 16 km (10 miles) increase in altitude. This means that the pressure is 1 atmosphere at sea level, but 0.1 atmosphere at 16 km and only 0.01 atmosphere at 32 km. \n The density of the lower atmosphere is about 1 kg/cubic meter (1 oz./cubic foot). There are approximately 300 billion billion (3 x 10**20, or a 3 followed by 20 zeros) molecules per cubic inch (16.4 cubic centimeters). At ground level, each molecule is moving at about 1600 km/hr (1000 miles/hr), and collides with other molecules 5 billion times per second. \n The density of air also decreases rapidly with altitude. At 3 km (2 miles) air density has decreased by 30%. People who normally live closer to sea level experience temporary breathing difficulties when traveling to these altitudes. The highest permanent human settlements are at about 4 km (3 miles). \n LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n The atmosphere is divided into layers based on temperature, composition and electrical properties. These layers are approximate and the boundaries vary, depending on the seasons and latitude. (The boundaries also depend on which \"authority\" is defining them.) \n LAYERS BASED ON COMPOSITION\n Homosphere \n \u00b7 The lowest 100 km (60 miles), including the Troposphere, Stratosphere and Mesosphere. \n \u00b7 Contains 99% of the atmosphere's mass. \n \u00b7 Molecules do not stratify by molecular weight. \n \u00b7 Although small local variations exist, it has a relatively uniform composition, due to continuous mixing, turbulence and eddy diffusion. \n \u00b7 Water is one of two components that is not equally distributed. As water vapor rises, it cools and condenses, returning to earth as rain and snow. The Stratosphere is extremely dry. \n \u00b7 Ozone is another molecule not equally distributed. (Read about the ozone layer in the Stratosphere section below.) \n Heterosphere \n \u00b7 Extends above homosphere, including the Thermosphere and Exosphere. \n \u00b7Stratified (components are separated in layers) based on molecular weight. The heavier molecules, like nitrogen and oxygen, are concentrated in the lowest levels. The lighter ones, helium and hydrogen, predominate higher up. \n LAYERS BASED ON ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES\n Neutral atmosphere \n \u00b7 Below about 100 km (60 miles) \n Ionosphere \n \u00b7 Above about 100 km \n \u00b7 Contains electrically charged particles or ions, created by the absorption of UV (ultraviolet) light. \n \u00b7 The degree of ionization varies with altitude. \n \u00b7 Different layers reflect long and short radio waves. This allows radio signals to be sent around the curved surface of the earth. \n \u00b7 The Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis (the Northern and Southern Lights) occur in this layer. \n \u00b7 The Magnetosphere is the upper part of the ionosphere, extending out to 64,000 km (40,000 miles.) It protects us from the high energy, electrically charged particles of the solar wind, which are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. \n \n \n \n LAYERS BASED ON TEMPERATURE\n Troposphere - Height depends on the seasons and latitude. It extends from ground level up to about 16 km (10 miles) at the equator, and to 9 km (5 miles) at the North and South Poles. \n \u00b7 The prefix \"tropo\" means change. Changing conditions in the Troposphere result in our weather. \n \u00b7 Temperature decreases with increasing altitude. Warm air rises, then cools and falls back to Earth. This process is called convection, and results in huge movements of air. Winds in this layer are mostly vertical. \n \u00b7 Contains more air molecules than all the other layers combined. \n Stratosphere - Extends out to about 50 km (30 miles) \n \u00b7 The air is very thin. \n \u00b7 The prefix \"strato\" is related to layers, or stratification. \n \u00b7 The bottom of this layer is calm. Jet planes often fly in the lower Stratosphere to avoid bad weather in the Troposphere. \n \u00b7 The upper part of the Stratosphere holds the high winds known as the jet streams. These blow horizontally at speeds up to 480 km/hour (300 miles/hour) \n \u00b7 Contains the \"ozone layer\" located between 15 - 40 km ( 10 - 25 miles) above the surface. Although the concentration of ozone is at most 12 parts per million (ppm), it is very effective at absorbing the harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun and protecting life on Earth. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. The oxygen molecule we need to breathe contains two oxygen atoms. \n \u00b7 The temperature is cold, about -55 \u00b0C (-67 \u00b0F) in the lower part, and increases with increasing altitude. The increase is caused by the absorption of UV radiation by the oxygen and ozone. \n \u00b7 The temperature increase with altitude results in a layering effect. It creates a global \"inversion layer\", and reduces vertical convection. \n Mesosphere - Extends out to about 100 km (65 miles) \n \u00b7 Temperature decreases rapidly with increasing altitude. \n Thermosphere - Extends out to about 400 km ( 250 miles) \n \u00b7 Temperature increases rapidly with increasing altitude, due to absorption of extremely short wavelength UV radiation. \n \u00b7 Meteors, or \"shooting stars,\" start to burn up around 110-130 km (70-80 miles) above the earth. \n Exosphere -Extends beyond the Thermosphere hundreds of kilometers, gradually fading into interstellar space. \n \u00b7 Density of the air is so low that the normal concept of temperature loses its meaning. \n \u00b7 Molecules often escape into space after colliding with one another. \n \n \n \n \n I CAN READ\n \n Why is the sky blue?\n Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space. Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white, but it is really a mixture of many colors. The colors in white light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky. \n \n \n The sky is filled with air. Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff, like dust. \n As sunlight goes through the air, it bumps into the molecules and dust. When light hits a gas molecule, it may bounce off in a different direction. Some colors of light, like red and orange, pass straight through the air. But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions. In this way, the blue light gets scattered all around the sky. \n When you look up, some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky. Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \n \n \n In space, there is no air. Because there is nothing for the light to bounce off, it just goes straight. None of the light gets scattered, and the \"sky\" looks dark and black.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PROJECTS TO DO TOGETHER\n \n SAFETY NOTE: Please read all instructions completely before starting. Observe all safety precautions. \n PROJECT 1 - Split light into a spectrum\n What you need: \n a small mirror, a piece of white paper or cardboard, water \n a large shallow bowl, pan, or plastic shoebox \n a window with direct sunlight coming in, or a sunny day outdoor \n What to do: \n 1. Fill the bowl or pan about 2/3 full of water. Place it on a table or the floor, directly in the sunlight. (Note: the direct sunlight is important for this experiment to work right.) \n 2. Hold the mirror under water, facing towards the sun. Hold the paper above and in front of the mirror. Adjust the positions of the paper and mirror until the reflected light shines on the paper. Observe the colored spectrum. \n \n \n \n What happened: The water and mirror acted like a prism, splitting the light into the colors of the spectrum. (When light passes from one medium to another, for example from air to water, its speed and direction change. [This is called refraction, and will be discussed in a future issue.] The different colors of light are affected differently. Violet light slows the most, and bends the most. Red light slows and bends the least. The different colors of light are spread out and separated, and we can see the spectrum.) \n PROJECT 2 - Sky in a jar\n What you need: \n a clear, straight-sided drinking glass, or clear plastic or glass jar \n water, milk, measuring spoons, flashlight \n a darkened room \n What to do: \n 1. Fill the glass or jar about 2/3 full of water (about 8 - 12 oz. or 250 - 400 ml) \n 2. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (2 - 5 ml) milk and stir. \n 3. Take the glass and flashlight into a darkened room. \n 4. Hold the flashlight above the surface of the water and observe the water in the glass from the side. It should have a slight bluish tint. Now, hold the flashlight to the side of the glass and look through the water directly at the light. The water should have a slightly reddish tint. Put the flashlight under the glass and look down into the water from the top. It should have a deeper reddish tint. \n What happened: The small particles of milk suspended in the water scattered the light from the flashlight, like the dust particles and molecules in the air scatter sunlight. When the light shines in the top of the glass, the water looks blue because you see blue light scattered to the side. When you look through the water directly at the light, it appears red because some of the blue was removed by scattering. \n PROJECT 3 -Mixing colors\n You need: \n a pencil, scissors, white cardboard or heavy white paper \n crayons or markers, a ruler \n a small bowl or a large cup (3 - 4 inch, or 7 - 10 cm diameter rim) \n a paper cup \n What to do: \n 1. Use the bowl to trace a circle onto a piece of white cardboard and cut it out. With the ruler, divide it into six approximately equal sections. \n 2. Color the six sections with the colors of the spectrum as shown. Try to color as smoothly and evenly as possible. \n 3. Poke a hole through the middle of the circle and push the pencil part of the way through. \n 4. Poke a hole in the bottom of the paper cup, a little bit larger than the diameter of the pencil. Turn the cup upside down on a piece of paper, and put the pencil through so the point rests on the paper on a table. Adjust the color wheel's position on the pencil so that it is about 1/2 inch (1 - 2 cm) above the cup. \n 5. Spin the pencil quickly and observe the color wheel. Adjust as necessary so that the pencil and wheel spin easily. \n \n \n \n What happened: The colors on the wheel are the main colors in white light. When the wheel spins fast enough, the colors all appear to blend together, and the wheel looks white. Try experimenting with different color combinations.",
