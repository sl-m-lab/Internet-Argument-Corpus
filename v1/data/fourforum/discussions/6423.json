Administration officials also have been interviewed by a special prosecutor in his quest to determine who leaked Plame's covert identity to reporters.\n \n Largely along party lines, the House International Relations Committee unfavorably reported two of the resolutions on Iraq and one resolution on the Plame matter. Earlier, the House Judiciary Committee \"unfavorably\" reported a similar Plame resolution.\n \n Under House rules, the committees had to act on the resolutions within 14 legislative days of the resolutions' introduction. If not, sponsors could have forced the measures before the full House for a vote.\n \n But the votes Wednesday against the measures all but prevented them from ever being taken up by the House.\n \n Other Democratic-sponsored resolutions on both matters are in different committees. Those resolutions will be considered in the next few weeks; the outcome is expected to be the same.\n \n Republican leaders want to avoid the spectacle of either issue being debated on the House floor amid some fear that the measures could succeed if enough Republicans side with minority Democrats.\n\n \n This reminds me of what cops say when you won't let them search you or your car, \"If you didn't do anything wrong, then you've got nothing to worry about. What have you got to hide?\"\n \n So what is it that the GOP is trying to keep from the public?\n Surely, it's incriminating and I'll bet solid grounds for impeachment.",

   "As we approach another anniversary on October 23 of this year, let us remember Ronald Wilson Reagan:\n \n 20 Years Later: Nothing Learned, So More American Soldiers Will Die \n by James Bovard\n Today is the 20th anniversary of one of the worst \"terrorist attacks\" on American forces prior to 9/11. At 6:20 A.M. on Sunday morning, October 23, 1983, a lone, grinning Muslim drove a Mercedes truck through a parking lot, past two Marine guard posts, through an open gate, and into the lobby of the Marine headquarters building in Beirut, where he detonated the equivalent of six tons of explosives. The explosion left a 30-foot-deep crater and killed 243 marines. A second truck bomb moments later killed 58 French soldiers.\n \n The destruction of the Marine barracks was perhaps the abyss of Reagan's first term - the result of na\u00efvet\u00e9, righteousness, and boundless folly. Unfortunately, the Bush administration seems to have learned nothing from the Reagan debacle and is blundering towards a repeat. American soldiers in Iraq have thus far done a good job of preventing suicide bombers from wreaking great devastation among U.S. forces. (The UN headquarters and the Jordanian embassy have not been so lucky). But as the US occupation drags on and opposition spreads, the odds of a debacle rise. \n \n The road to the October 1983 suicide bombing began with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. The Israelis claimed the invasion was justified in retaliation for PLO attacks on Israelis. But, as New York Times correspondent Thomas Friedman noted in his book From Beirut to Jerusalem, \"the number of Israeli casualties the PLO guerillas in Lebanon actually inflicted were minuscule (one death in the 12 months before the invasion).\" Defense Minister Ariel Sharon told the Israeli cabinet that his \"Operation Peace for Galilee\" would extend only 40 kilometers into Lebanon. As David Martin and John Walcott noted in their 1988 book, Best Laid Plans: The Inside Story of America's War Against Terrorism, the U.S. embassy in Beirut \"sent cable after cable to Washington, warning that an Israeli invasion would provoke terrorism and undermine America's standing in the Arab world, but not a word came back.\"\n \n When Palestinians fought back tenaciously, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) responded with indiscriminate bombing. The Palestinian Red Crescent estimated that fourteen thousand people, mostly civilians, were killed and wounded in the first month of the Israeli invasion. (The Israeli government stated that casualties were much lower.) The IDF bombed the buildings housing the Beirut bureaus of the Los Angeles Times, United Press International, and Newsweek. \n \n The UN brokered a peace deal by which the United States and other multinational troops briefly entered Beirut to buffer a ceasefire to allow the PLO to exit to ships to transport them to Tunisia, which had agreed to provide a safe haven. The U.S. government signed an agreement with Arafat, pledging that U.S. forces would safeguard civilians who stayed behind. Once the PLO withdrew from Beirut, the U.S. troops were pulled out and put back on Navy ships.\n \n Shortly after the U.S. troops withdrew, Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel was assassinated. The IDF promptly invaded Muslim West Beirut, violating the fragile peace agreement worked out with Muslim forces and the government of Syria. The Israeli army encircled Palestinian refugee camps in the area and prohibited anyone from entering or leaving without its permission. As Thomas Friedman noted, \"Although the Israelis confiscated the arms of all of the Moslem groups in West Beirut, they made no attempt to disarm the Christian Phalangist militiamen in East Beirut.\"\n \n Sharon invited Lebanese Phalangist militia units trained and equipped by Israel to enter the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Sharon and IDF chief of staff Gen. Rafael Eitan met with Phalangist commanders before they entered the camp, and, as Sharon later explained, \"we spoke in principle of their dealing with the camps.\" \n \n The militia entered the camps and over the next 48 hours, more than seven hundred Palestinian women, children, and men were executed; many corpses were mutilated. Palestinian sources estimated that the death toll was much higher. Israeli troops launched flares over the camps to illuminate them throughout the night and provided the Phalangists with food and water during their respites from the killings. Palestinian women sought to escape the slaughter but \"the Israelis encircling the area refused to let anyone cross their lines.\" After the first day's carnage, a Phalange leader reported to the IDF that \"until now 300 civilians and terrorists have been killed,\" according to the Jerusalem Post. After the Phalangists finished, they brought in bulldozers to create mass graves. More Palestinians may have been killed at the two camps than the total number of Israelis killed by the PLO in the previous decade.\n \n The slaughter provoked outrage around the world. The government of Menachem Begin initially blocked proposals in the Knesset for a formal inquiry into the massacre; Ariel Sharon declared that his critics were guilty of a \"blood libel.\" An Israeli government commission concluded a few months later that \"Minister of Defense [Sharon] bears personal responsibility\" for the debacle. Sharon resigned as defense minister as a result of the commission report. \n \n The carnage at Sabra and Shatila threatened to plunge Lebanon back into total chaos, and Reagan quickly agreed to a Lebanese request to send US troops back into Beirut. Reagan repeatedly called for Israeli withdrawal from Beirut and declared: \"Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produced this tragedy.\"\n \n The massacres of the Palestinian refugees catapulted the U.S. much deeper into the Lebanese quagmire. As clashes continued between Israelis and Muslims, the situation became increasingly polarized in the following months. On April 18, 1983 a delivery van pulled up to the front door of the U.S. embassy in Beirut and detonated, collapsing the building and killing 46 people (including 16 Americans) and wounding over a hundred others. The embassy was poorly defended, despite earlier similar suicide attacks on the Iraqi and French embassies.\n \n On April 23, 1983, Reagan announced to the press: \"The tragic and brutal attack on our embassy in Beirut has shocked us all and filled us with grief. Yet, because of this latest crime we are more resolved than ever to help achieve the urgent and total withdrawal of all American forces from Lebanon, or I should say, all foreign forces. I'm sorry. Mistake.\" But the actual mistake was a U.S. policy that would cost hundreds of Americans their lives.\n \n As fighting between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon escalated, the original U.S. peacekeeping mission became a farce. The U.S. forces were training and equipping the Lebanese army, which was increasingly perceived in Lebanon as a pro-Christian, anti-Muslim force. By late summer, the Marines were being targeted by Muslim snipers and mortar fire. On September 13 Reagan authorized Marine commanders in Lebanon to call in air strikes and other attacks against the Muslims to help the Christian Lebanese army. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger vigorously opposed the new policy, fearing it would make American troops far more vulnerable. Navy ships repeatedly bombarded the Muslims over the next few weeks.\n \n The suicide truck attack on October 23 stunned the world. Yet, as Colin Powell, who was then a major general, later observed in his autobiography: \"Since [the Muslims] could not reach the battleship, they found a more vulnerable target, the exposed Marines at the airport.\"\n \n The Reagan administration sought to deflect blame for the attack with smokescreens of false statements and misrepresentations. In a televised speech four days after the bombing, Reagan portrayed the attack as unstoppable, declaring that the truck \"crashed through a series of barriers, including a chain-link fence and barbed-wire entanglements. The guards opened fire, but it was too late.\" Reagan claimed the attack proved the U.S. mission was succeeding: \"Would the terrorists have launched their suicide attacks against the multinational force if it were not doing its job? . . . It is accomplishing its mission.\" Reagan also said the United States was involved in the Middle East in part to secure a \"solution to the Palestinian problem.\"\n \n Reagan sent Marine Corps commander Paul X. Kelley to Beirut. Kelley quickly announced that he was \"totally satisfied\" with the security around the barracks at the time of the bombing. Upon returning to Washington, Kelley was summoned to Capitol Hill; Kelley inaccurately testified that the Marine guards had loaded weapons and that two of them had been killed in the attack. In 1983, as now, the issue of the security and survival of American troops was overshadowed by the flaunting of the feelings of high-ranking government officials. When congressmen persisted questioning, Kelley became enraged and shouted: \"We're talking about clips in weapons, but we're not talking about the people who did it. I want to find the perpetrators. I want to bring them to justice! You have to allow me this one moment of anger.\"\n \n Even though there had already been numerous major car bombings in Beirut that year and scores of other suicide attacks, Kelley told Congress that the truck bombing \"represents a new and unique terrorist threat, one that could not have been anticipated by any commander.\" Kelley denied the Marines received any warning of an impending attack. However, on the morning of Kelley's second day of testimony, the New York Times reported that the CIA specifically warned the Marines three days ahead of time that an Iranian-linked group was planning an attack against them. \n \n Top military officials brazenly denied that the U.S. government deserved any culpability in the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers. Vice Admiral Edward Martin, the commander of the Sixth Fleet, declared: \"The only person I can see who was responsible was the driver of that truck.\" Martin stressed absurdly in an interview: \"You have to remember that prior to Oct. 23, there hadn't been any real terrorism threat.\"\n \n The Reagan administration sought to distract attention from the military's appalling incompetence. For instance, the Marines failed to defend all approaches to the barracks. Thomas Friedman reported in the New York Times shortly after the bombing: \"The Marines almost never used the entry from the parking lot south of their headquarters, where the suicide bomber drove in. The area was blocked off to civilian traffic and was used only as a helicopter landing pad. Judging from conversations with marines and Lebanese Army officers, it is clear they thought that because they did not use that entrance no one else would think of it.\" The Marines also neglected to install the type of speed bumps and metal spikes around their barracks that the British used in Northern Ireland.\n \n (Continued)",

   "Shortly after the bombing, Reagan appointed a Pentagon commission headed by retired Admiral Robert Long to investigate. The commission concluded that military commanders in Lebanon and all the way back to Washington failed to take obvious steps to protect the soldiers. The commission suggested that many fatalities might have been prevented if guards had carried loaded weapons. The report stated that the only barrier the truck overcame was some barbed wire that it easily drove over. The commission also noted that the \"prevalent view\" among U.S. commanders was that there was a direct link between the Navy shelling of the Muslims and the truck bomb attack.\n \n The Reagan administration launched a preemptive attack to blunt the report's impact before it was released. The Washington Post reported that the White House \"delayed release of the report for several days, allowing Reagan to respond to its criticism before it became public, and then attempted to play down its impact by vetoing a Pentagon news conference on the document.\" The New York Times noted, \"A White House official said Mr. Reagan wanted his own statement about the report to come out first to deflect any criticism of the Marines. Mr. Reagan's announcement apparently caught senior officers by surprise as they were meeting to consider possible disciplinary action.\"\n \n On December 27 Reagan revealed that \"we have never before faced a situation in which others routinely sponsor and facilitate acts of violence against us.\" (Perhaps Reagan blanked out regarding all previous American wars). Reagan sought to make the report \"old news\" by declaring: \"Nearly all the measures that were identified by the distinguished members of the Commission have already been implemented and those that have not will be very quickly.\" Reagan announced that the Marine commanders in Beirut \"have already suffered enough\" and should not \"be punished for not fully comprehending the nature of today's terrorist threat.\" Reagan then effectively declared that no one would be held accountable: \"If there is to be blame, it properly rests here in this office and with this president,\" he announced, just before leaving Washington for a vacation in Palm Springs, California. Reagan may have acted to prevent the possibility of an embarrassing military court martial occurring while he was campaigning for reelection.\n \n A few months later, U.S. troops were quietly removed from Beirut. But the U.S. continued an aggressive posture in the area - as well as providing massive arms and aid to the Israeli army that was seeking to suppress and rule much of southern Lebanon. In September 1984, another suicide bomber devastated the new American embassy in East Beirut. \n \n The Beirut debacles turned the U.S. role in Lebanon into a flash point in the 1984 presidential campaign. Since the evidence of US negligence and bungling was overwhelming, preemptive smears were the tactic of choice. In the vice presidential candidate debate on October 11, George H. W. Bush denounced Democratic candidate Walter Mondale and his vice presidential pick, Geraldine Ferraro: \"For somebody to suggest, as our opponents have, that these men died in shame, they had better not tell the parents of those young marines.\" Neither Mondale nor Ferraro had said that the Marines \"died in shame.\" Bush denounced Mondale for running a \"mean-spirited campaign\": \"We've seen Walter Mondale take a human tragedy in the Middle East and try to turn it to personal political advantage.\" But Mondale's criticisms of the Reagan administration's failures in Lebanon were less strident than Reagan's criticisms of Jimmy Carter for the Iran hostage crisis during the 1980 presidential campaign. \n \n Reagan and Bush Sr. were able to play the 'patriotism card' against the Democrats. The Beirut debacles did nothing to deter Reagan's chroniclers from canonizing him. The U.S. intervention into Beirut did nothing to stabilize or pacify the region. \n \n Now, 20 years later, the main lesson that Bush seems to draw from Beirut is the need to \"be tough.\" Bush declared on September 7: \"In the past, the terrorists have cited the examples of Beirut and Somalia, claiming that if you inflict harm on Americans, we will run from a challenge. In this, they are mistaken.\" The issue is not whether the US runs from a challenge: but whether political leaders have any incentive to learn from the deaths of American soldiers. And judging from Bush's challenge to those who are killing Americans in Iraq - \"Bring 'em on!\" - there is scant hope for the learning curve of the current Oval Office occupant.\n October 23, 2003\n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig4/bovard1.html",

   "JPSartre12\n \n Sorry, but Clinton was not tried or even charged with perjury and everyone knows that. \n\n he was, indeed, charged with purgery in his impeachment hearing. Article One \".......On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a Federal grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate Government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.....\"\n \n\n He equivocated about sex with someone not relevant to the case. The judge did not find it rose to the level of perjury. The right wing tried him in the media. They lost.\n\n Clinton paid off Paula Jones and settled out of court. That's part of the record. He was found to have violated discovery rules and was found in contempt, fined and disbarred from practicing law in Ark.\n \n\n You can't be serious that you think that Nixon was impeached for breaking into somebody's office? Nixon was tried and convicted for obstruction of justice by obstructing a congressional investigation. Even Starr could find anything illegal with regard to the White House and the FBI files.\n\n No doubt Nixon was guilty of obstruction of justice, just as Clinton was guilty of it during the Jones trial. Where Nixon really went awry was paying off the burglars. In Clinton's case, we never discovered who the burglars were as well as who mysteriously found the subpoenaed Rose Law Firm papers that were \"found\" in the Clinton's living area sometime after the fact.\n But, if you want to argue Clinton's crimes vs Nixon's, start a new thread.

The reason is that Wahhabists want to rid the world of all infidels that won't submit to the word of Allah.\n \n\n What is the link between the twin towers of New York and the minarets of Mecca? The men who mounted the most devastating act of terrorism in modern times, the al-Qa'eda organisation for which they worked, and the Taliban regime that gave them sanctuary, all emerged from a single Islamic fundamentalist movement. That movement - Wahhabism - originated in Saudi Arabia. \n \n Until September 11, the Saudi connection was understood only by a few experts. Most Western leaders were still fighting the last war against terrorism. Ever since the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, conceptions of Islamic fundamentalism had been dominated by the revolutionary brand of Shi'ite Islam propagated by Ayatollah Khomeini and his successors. \n \n During the Cold War and even later, Soviet-backed secular Arab nationalists, from Nasser and Gaddafi to Saddam and Arafat, posed a greater threat to the West than militant Islam. Saudi Arabia, the richest and longest-established of the Arab states, was treated as a valued ally. American and European governments, accustomed to cordial relations with the Saudis, turned a blind eye to its state religion. \n \n Only after the September 11 attacks did the global extent of the Wahhabi menace become clear. From Algeria to Bali, from Tunis to Tel Aviv, from Moscow to Riyadh, Islamist suicide bombers left a bloody trail behind them. In the background lurked the shadowy network of Wahhabi influence. \n \n Through charities and schools, youth groups and private foundations, Saudi oil money has been deployed on a colossal scale to finance organisations such as al-Qa'eda and Hamas. Thus did Saudi Arabia emerge as the matrix of Islamist terrorism. \n http://www.lebanonwire.com/0307/03072202TGR.asp\n \n\n \n\n We can't even get Osama under W, think we're going to shut down a movement? The way to lessen ME hatred of the US is to stop letting business dictate our foreign policy .\n\n We can't shut down the movement alone. It requires all sane nations to do that.\n \n\n How many Wahabists have you actually spoke with? I'm just curious.\n\n \n None, but I've read and listened to enough of their propaganda to KNOW that they're a threat to freedom everywhere.

Some are simply angry about the US policy and go about their lives, others are angry about it and give support to radical elements and others are so angry that they join radical movements.

It can actually can be traced to the US support for Israel's Jewish state and the US bases in their holy land.\n\n \n Wahhabism has been around for a long time, true enough. But it began to gain a following in the 1930's, well before the state of Israel was created.\n Prior to the discovery and exploitation of oil, Arabs were still poor nomadic tribes and didn't have the funds nor ability to spread squat. Oil money funded and continues to fund the spread of radical fundamentalism. \n As for Arab sympathies for Palestine, it's hypocritical at best. When Palestinians were in search for a place to live, ALL of their arab brothers turned their backs on them. When 1,000,000 Palestinians immigrated to Jordan, fighting between them and the Hashemite state of Jordan occurred. Subsequently, Jordan has recognized the state of Isreal. The rest of the Arab states paid lip service to Palestine but little else. After all, they didn't want to **** off the goose that laid the golden egg(the US) too much. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Read your history. At the founding of the Jewish state of Israel, the Israelis (with the acquiescence of the UN) took land that Palestinians had lived on for centuries against the will of the Palestinians \n\n \n I would suggest that YOU read your history. Prior to the creation of Israel by the UN, it was a British Protectorate. In 1918, an agreement was signed between Emir Feisal Husseini and Dr. Weizman and in it contained the following:\n\n ARTICLE IV \n \n All necessary measures shall be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale, and as quickly as possible to settle Jewish immigrants upon the land through closer settlement and intensive cultivation of the soil. In taking such measures measures the Arab peasant and tenant farmes shall be protected in their rights and shall be assisted in forwaxiiing their economic development. \n\n \n Prior to the creation of the state of Israel by the UN, \"Palestinian\" was a term used for Jews and Arabs alike. It wasn't until later that the term \"Palestinian\" became associated with Arabs only. \n \n\n . In other words they were forcibly removed from their homes and Israeli families moved in. Not in the hundreds, not in the thousands, but in the tens of thousands. The taking of their homes was supported by the United States. Prior to that there was little US/Arab tension.\n\n \n Not true by a long shot. Almost continuously during the time that the British ruled Palestine (Palestine was split into Transjordan and Israel by the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Transjordan (which entailed 80% of the land) was the Arab state and Israel, bordered on the Jordon River, was the jewish state.), Jews were subjected to many massacres coming from Arab civilians AND adjoining Arab states. (Moderate Arabs who favored a peaceful coexistence were lynched or assinated by the more radical Arabs). The British Army worked full-time trying to keep the peace and attempted to restrict further Jewish immigration in order to reduce clashes. During WWII, Britian couldn't enforce its restrictions, so the population of Israel grew. The UN took control in 1947 because the British could no longer control Palestine. (Palestine was split into Transjordan and Israel by the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Transjordan (which entailed 80% of the land) was the Arab state and Israel, bordered on the Jordon River, was the jewish state.) With increased immigration, Jews began to build their own army to defend itself against the Arabs. The Haganah became a powerful force to counter Arab extremists, hellbent on driving the Jews out of present-day Israel. \n \n\n If you don't think that having your home and land taken away and then seeing someone else living in it and farming it p****d people off, then discussion is useless. You may not like it, but Jewish People took land and homes from Arab people with the support of the US and that seems to me a pretty good reason for the Arab people to be p****d off at Israel and the US.\n \n\n \n Another myth. The land belonged to the Jews originally. In 587BC, Nebuchadnezzar's army exiled the Jews to Babylon (modern day Iraq), so the land belonged to the Jews way before Islam existed.\n They began repopulating the land from 538- 333BC, under the Persian Empire.\n Later, Alexander the Great allowed the state to rule itself. Still later on, there were a series of conquests by the Romans and later, The Crusaders and during the Ottomon Empire 1516 - 1918, Jews repopulated Israel once again.\n The day after the state of Israel was created, armies of five Arab countries, Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Lebanon and Iraq, invaded Israel. Not exactly a warm welcome from its neighbors, don't you think?\n \n And ALL of this occurred PRIOR to US' involvement with Israel. ",

It is a FACT that Palestinian People were forcibly removed from their homes and land by Jewish People as part of the creation of the State of Israel.\n\n Prior to the creation of the state of Israel, Palestinian INCLUDED Jews living in the UK/French creation known as Palestine. \n \n\n That you refuse to accept that is awe-inspiring. I simply suggest two books to you. One with an Arab bias and one with an Israeli bias: EXPULSION OF THE PALESTINIANS by Nur Masalha and INTERNATIONAL PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER THE ARABS OF PALESTINE by Chaim Simons. They both disagree with almost every point you make regarding the subject of Palestinian expulsion form their homes.\n\n When did I say that nobody was removed from their homes? I said that the Jewish state was created via the Balfour Declaration in 1917. I also said that Jews in, then, Palestine were subjected to violence both from within and from neighboring Arab states. Thge Balfour Declaration carved Palestine into two parts, Transjordan and Israel. Transjordan encompassed 80% of the former palestine, was designated as being the Arab state and is now called \"Jordan\". the remaining 20% was for the Jewish homeland Israel. From almost the beginning, Arabs living in former palestine attacked Jews living in the areas designated as THEIRS. \n And do you think that during this time no Jews were thrown out of their homes?!\n \n\n Arab Riots and Jewish immigration - In the spring of 1920, spring of 1921 and summer of 1929, Arab nationalists opposed to the Balfour declaration, the mandate and the Jewish National Home, instigated riots and pogroms against Jews in Jerusalem, Hebron, Jaffa and Haifa. The violence led to the formation of the Haganah Jewish self-defense organization in 1920. The riots of 1920 and 1921 reflected opposition to the Balfour declaration and fears that the Arabs of Palestine would be dispossessed, and were probably attempts to show the British that Palestine as a Jewish National home would be ungovernable. The major instigators were Haj Amin El-Husseini, later Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and Arif -El Arif, a prominent Palestinian journalist. The riots of 1929 occurred against the background of Jewish-Arab nationalist antagonism. The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigration and land purchases were displacing and dispossessing the Arabs of Palestine. However, economic, population and other indicators suggest that objectively, the Arabs of Palestine benefited from the Mandate and Zionist investment. Arab standard of living increased faster in Palestine than other areas, and population grew prodigiously throughout the Mandate years. (see Zionism and its Impact). The riots were also fueled by false rumors that the Jews intended to build a synagogue at the wailing wall, or otherwise encroach upon the Muslim rule over the Temple Mount compound, including the Al-Aqsa mosque. The pogroms led to evacuation of the Jewish community of Hebron. About half the 5,000 residents of the Jewish quarter of the old city of Jerusalem were forced to flee as well. The British responded with the Passfield White Paper. The white paper attempted to stop immigration to Palestine based on the recommendations of the Hope Simpson report. That report stated that in the best case, following extensive economic development, the land could support immigration of another 20,000 families in total. Otherwise further Jewish immigration would infringe on the position of the existing Arab population. However, British MPs and the Zionist movement sharply criticized the new policy and PM Ramsay McDonald issued a \"clarification\" stating that Jewish immigration would not be stopped.\n http://www.mideastweb.org/briefhistory.htm \n \n \n So, following WWI and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, France and England carved up the Middle East into British and French Protectorates. In doing so, the Brits created two states out of Palestine, designated one to be a Jewish homeland, Israel and the other to be an Arab state, Transjordan. Unfortunately, the Arabs living in the new ly created Jewish homeland didn't like the pln and attempted to take control of both the Jewish homeland AND Transjordan. Bottom line\" It didn't work. Jews immigrated into Palestine from all over the region and gained enough mass to protect itself against those who would force them out and have been asserting its birthright since. And I wouldn't **** with Israeli soldiers as most Arab terrorists found/find out. \n \n \n\n Just so you know, US President Herbert Hoover was a supporter of the removal of Arab citizens prior to WWII. So much for your statement in bold: And ALL of this occurred PRIOR to US' involvement with Israel. The US was involved PRIOR to WWII.\n\n \n I'm confused. How could the US be involved with \"Israel\" before Israel even existed? \n And just so you know, Wilson told France and England, who were both engaged in Imperialistic efforts to control of the ME, that the goal was the creation of independent states, not French or British terroritories. For once, the US was the \"good guy\" . :)",

You have steadfastly refused to acknowledge it. Instead, you evade. Here was you last response:\n \n \nI'm waiting for your example of an Israeli suicide bombers walking into Palestinian area and detonating themselves.

If I'm wrong, show me proof and I will retract my last statement.\nThere are plenty of examples of Jews bombing innocent Arabs, that does not mean that I deny Arab terrorism. It simply is a statement of fact.\n \n First check the FBI report on Haganah released under the Freedom of Information Act. In 1930's a faction of Haganah called the Irgun Zvai Leumi was sited in that report as follows: \"... group that advocated acts of violence, retaliation and terrorism.\" Note the use by our own FBI of the word \"terrorism\".\n \n http://foia.fbi.gov/haganah/haganah_part01.pdf\n \n You refuse to acknowledge that Jews forced Arabs from their homes and took their lands. So...\n \n Second, check out \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem\", by Benny Morris. He documents that the Arab inhabitants of 228 localities left because of attacks by Jewish troops, and in 41 cases they were expelled by military force. In 90 other localities, the Palestinians were in a state of panic following the fall of a neighboring town or village, or for fear of an enemy attack, or because of rumors circulated by the Jewish army - particularly after the 9 April 1948 massacre of 250 inhabitants of Deir Yassin, where the news of the killings swept the country like wildfire.\n \n Finally, here is some proof that you requested regarding Jewish terrorism.\n \n Though there are no recorded incidents of Israeli or Jewish suicide bombers, there are plenty of records of Israeli terrorism against Arabs and Brits: from the bombing of the King David Hotel to \"drive by\" bombings of Arabs civilians on the streets, to the bombing of Arab buses, to the kidnapping and murder of Brits who were supporting Arabs, including British officials.\n \n http://britains-smallwars.com/main/index1.html\n \n There are a myriad of documented acts of Jewish atrocities and terrorism directed at the civilian Arab population. Your fear of acknowledging that is puzzling. Will you acknoledge it now?",

(AI-Taubah 31).\n It is narrated that Ibn Hatim, who was Christian before becoming Muslim, once heard the Prophet, peace be upon him, reading that verse in Sura Al-Taubah. Ibn Hatim exclaimed: \"Messenger of Allah, but they (the Christians) have not worshipped their rabbis and monks\"? The Pro- phet, peace be upon him, replied,\n \n \"Yes they have.

But Bush cleared them nonetheless to receive limited assistance, for such things as combatting trafficking. In the case of Venezuela _ which has had a tense relationship with the United States under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez, one of Latin America's most outspoken critics of U.S. foreign policy _ Bush also allowed funding for strengthening the political party system and supporting electoral observation.\n \n In addition to Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Kuwait _ another U.S. ally in the Middle East _ were given a complete pass on any sanctions, Jordan said. Despite periodic differences, oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the United States have a tight alliance built on economic and military cooperation.\n \n That left Myanmar, Cuba and North Korea as the only nations in the list of 14 barred completely from receiving certain kinds of foreign aid. The act does not include cutting off trade assistance or humanitarian aid, Jordan said.\n \n The White House statement offered no explanation of why countries were regarded differently. Jordan also could not provide one.\n \n As many as 800,000 people are bought and sold across national borders annually or lured to other countries with false promises of work or other benefits, according to the State Department. Most are women and children.\n\n \n That's those \"moral values\" that won him the election shining through!\n \n And let's get this straight: There are other countries who had limited aid for things that favor US intervention (doesn't all foreign aid do that?), allowed as well, but Saudi Arabia is the only one that has all sanctions waived.\n \n If the Democrats politicked like Republicans you can bet this would be brought out and they would say that Bush financially supports human trafficking.",

   "Bill Frist just pulled a Martha Stewart (but will not be indicted or even investigated). Can't find any MSM story on the matter.\n \n Martha's stock was only worth about $150,000 but Frist's stock in his family's company is worth millions (but it's undisclosed).\n \n Also, the family business deals in abortions:\n http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=504\n \n http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/Archive/200212/POL20021220g.html\n \n\"He's made all kinds of strange statements,\" Brown said of Frist, \"and is a shareholder in a huge for-profit hospital company that does abortions.\"\n \n She is referring to Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). The senator's late father, Dr. Thomas Frist, Sr., and brother, Dr. Thomas Frist, Jr., founded HCA in 1968. The company merged with Columbia Hospital Corporation in 1994 to become Columbia/HCA.\n\n \n \n Surely, Bill Frist doesn't want you to know about \"The 12 things you didn't know about bill frist.\" which are posted on his website. If I were Frist I'd hide this.\n \n www.volpac.org\n \n http://www.volpac.org/index.cfm?FuseAction=Articles.Detail&Article_id=5\n \n My favorites are:\n 1) \"He can open a patient's chest and transplant their heart, yet nearly fainted when he had blood drawn for our marriage license.\"\n \n 4) \"His favorite female artist is Madonna.\"\n \n 6) \"He practiced his first surgical stitches on 'Teddy' (his stuffed teddy bear). He still has the bear to this day.\" (how sweet) emoticon_xlove \n \n and a couple of ones that scared me:\n \n 3) \"His first patient was his best friend's dog, \"Scratchy\", who recovered completely. (Bill had absolutely NO IDEA what he was doing, and is still a little baffled that the dog actually healed!)\"\n \n poor doggie, healed from what?\n \n 12) \"He would always operate wearing Dr. Scholls clogs, and play country music in the operating room.\"\n \n Jeez, I'd hope that I was under general when that XXXX was blaring.\n \n \n \n Some other facts that Frist WANTS you to know about.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Frist\n \n He wrote about this in his book:\n Transplant: A Heart Surgeon's Account of the Life-And-Death Dramas of the New Medicine\n \n\n While in medical school, Frist claims he experimented on cats as part of a project researching the use of drugs on the mitral valve, and obtained some of the cats from animal shelters by claiming them as pets. Although Frist's practice had been in the public eye for eleven years, the matter came to light again in a Boston Globe profile published after his election as Senate majority leader.\n\n \n The thirteenth thing you didn't know about Bill Frist.\n \nhe did not vote for the first time until he was 36\n\n \n And of course we all heard about his previous stock failures wrt his campaign finances:\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26558-2004Dec1.html\n http://tennessean.com/government/archives/04/11/62186658.shtml?Element_ID=62186658\n \n But he STILL championed the cause of funnelling social security money into the stock market.\n \n Maybe he learned his lesson from that and decided that inside trading with his stock in his family's company was the way to go this time.\n \n \n \n Just remember this during the 2008 primaries.",

   "JPSartre12:\n \n I am such and optimist. \"Hope springs eternal\" should be my theme song.\n \n I have been asking you to acknowledge that there have been acts of terrorism committed by Jews and Jewish organizations against Arabs. You have steadfastly refused to acknowledge it. Instead, you evade. Here was you last response:\n \n There are plenty of examples of Jews bombing innocent Arabs, that does not mean that I deny Arab terrorism. It simply is a statement of fact.\n \n First check the FBI report on Haganah released under the Freedom of Information Act. In 1930's a faction of Haganah called the Irgun Zvai Leumi was sited in that report as follows: \"... group that advocated acts of violence, retaliation and terrorism.\" Note the use by our own FBI of the word \"terrorism\".\n \n http://foia.fbi.gov/haganah/haganah_part01.pdf\n \n\n I read the first 12 pages and so far all I saw was Haganah's attempt to rein in the rouge Irgun Zvai Leumi which had BROKEN AWAY from the Haganah. That sounds like a noble cause to me. emoticon_confused \n [quote]\n You refuse to acknowledge that Jews forced Arabs from their homes and took their lands. So...\n [quote]\n Isn't this an acknowledgement? emoticon_confused \n \n\n Every civilization that I'm aware of was thrown out of somewhere at some point in time. What makes Arabs living in Israel any different, one might ask?\n While I agree that throwing people out of their houses isn't right, neither is sending your wife and kids laden with explosives into a civilian population center.\n\n \n\n Second, check out \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem\", by Benny Morris. He documents that the Arab inhabitants of 228 localities left because of attacks by Jewish troops, and in 41 cases they were expelled by military force. In 90 other localities, the Palestinians were in a state of panic following the fall of a neighboring town or village, or for fear of an enemy attack, or because of rumors circulated by the Jewish army - particularly after the 9 April 1948 massacre of 250 inhabitants of Deir Yassin, where the news of the killings swept the country like wildfire.\n Finally, here is some proof that you requested regarding Jewish terrorism.\n \n\n from http://www.deiryassin.org/mas.html\n \n\n The Haganah leaders admitted that the massacre \"disgraced the cause of Jewish fighters and dishonored Jewish arms and the Jewish flag.\" \n \n\n OK, a rouge, former branch of the Haganah, committed a terrorist act. That's ONE and not one sanctioned by the Haganah. \n \n\n Though there are no recorded incidents of Israeli or Jewish suicide bombers, there are plenty of records of Israeli terrorism against Arabs and Brits: from the bombing of the King David Hotel to \"drive by\" bombings of Arabs civilians on the streets, to the bombing of Arab buses, to the kidnapping and murder of Brits who were supporting Arabs, including British officials.\n http://britains-smallwars.com/main/index1.html\n \n There are a myriad of documented acts of Jewish atrocities and terrorism directed at the civilian Arab population. Your fear of acknowledging that is puzzling. Will you acknoledge it now?\n\n \n Again, you point ONLY to acts committed by an admittedly rouge, former faction of the Haganah, that the Haganah had attempted to stop. I'd have to be pretty foolish to not admit that NO Jew ever committed any act of violence against Arabs that were trying to kill them. My point is that terrorism isn't sanctioned by the Israeli government but IS sanctioned, encouraged and funded by the PLO. The Israeli government doesn't send women and kids out with bombs strapped to them; the PLO does.",

   "I was tryin gto give you an example of wahhabis NOT involved in terrorism. Who in fact, denouce Ossama.\n \n Eric Rudophe was a Fundamental Christian but not all of them advocate blowing up abortion clinics.\n\n \n Your point is well-taken and understood, but the fact remains that radical Wahhabists ARE the ones spreading terrorism throughout the world. I find little solice in the fact that not all Wahhahists are terrorist Wahhabists, personally. \n \n\n Egyptian Wael Al-Abrashi, deputy editor of the Egyptian weekly Roz Al-Yousef, wrote a series of articles critical of Wahhabism last year following the Riyadh bombings. According to Al-Abrashi: \"Saudi Arabia has become the biggest area for extremist ideology and [provided] the broadest scope for the development of its viruses.\"\n \n Since his articles were first released, al Qaeda has attacked Saudi Arabia multiple times, something Al-Abrashi warned would happen: \"...Although Saudi Arabia has adopted a strategy of exporting Wahhabism to the rest of the world ... Saudi Arabia created the monster, exported it abroad, and then lost control of it. Then, the monster turned on it...\"\n \n In an article in the Addis Tribune about the corruption of Somali Islam by Saudi Arabia, journalist Bashir Goth criticized the Saudis' spreading of Wahhabism to his country: \"It is a pity to see that, at a time when Saudi Arabia, the home of Wahhabism, is reassessing the damage that Wahhabism and extremism had done to their country's name and to the reputation of Islam all over the world, that Wahhabism has to find a safe-haven in our country.\" He also discussed how the Saudi-trained religious police have taken over Muslim towns: \"The most conspicuous foot soldiers of Wahhabism are the moral police known as Mutawiun, who roam in the streets like riot police and force people to perform rituals or adhere to Wahhabism's code of decency.... This is the Wahhabism that the Saudi-oriented clerics want to impose on Somaliland.... It is a closed [mindset] that turned Islam into a fragile creed that lives in constant fear of children's toys and games such as Barbie dolls and Pokemon...\" \n http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/stalinsky200406280902.asp\n \n",
