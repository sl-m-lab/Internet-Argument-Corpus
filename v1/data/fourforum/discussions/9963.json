The best that science will be able to do is show that the Divine is necessary or unnecessary.\n\n \n **\n That which is material, substantial, and corporeal has by definition, the quality of 'extension'. That is, it can be measured in terms of place, occupied space [physical dimensions], and time. Anything which can be measured wrt 'extension' is finite, because extension is a limiting quality. Anything 'infinite' cannot have 'extension', because extension is expressed in terms of its limits, its, 'finiteness'. And it should be noted that extension is always relative, as well.\n \n Now anything that has a beginning had a beginning to its own 'extension', and by definition anything with a beginning has extension which doesa not proceed indefinitel into the past, but stops at that beginning. Therefore anything with a beginning is by definition limited in terms of its past, and so cannot be infinite, wrt time, although theoretically it might be everlasting. But no matter how long it lasts, it will always be temporal, not eternal, simply because it had a beginning.\n \n Now a corporeal, substantial, physical entity cannot be said to exist unless it can be identified, and it can only be identified by its dimensions, that is, its form, as that form conforms to the quality of extension. Size, shape, weight, etc. That is, those properties accessible to our five senses and where necessary, our tools. If only one homogenous entity experienced a beginning, but was somehow sentient, it would know that it had a beginning, but it would know nothing else, because it would have nothing else to compare itself to. It would be neither finite nor infinite, so far as it could tell. But it two or more entities have beginnings, then, provided they are sentient, they could see, relative to one another, the boundaries of physical existence in terms of 'place', making that 'place' [eg., our universe] finite. That place would be confined, and therefore defined as the space 'extension' that contains corporeal entities that can be themselves defined in terms of extension as individuals with measurable properties that are comparable, hence relative.\n By definition these physical properties cannot be infinite, because if they were they would blend together in one single, indistinguishable, indefinite, corporeal, substantial, material mass in which they occupied the whole of everything that is. But we can see that that is not the case. Corporeal, physical entities are distinguishable from one another, and by that token alone they are finite, and the space they occupy, i.e., this corporeal universe, is finite. And solely because these things are finite, we can observe and measure them, time, space, velocity, and whatnot.\n \n Your opponent is right. That which has a beginning, and all that is physical,(and all that which is this corporeal universe had a beginning), is by definition, limited in terms of extension, hence finite.\n \n WRT \"the divine\", that which has a beginning could not poof itself into existence at its beginning, but had to be an effect produced by some other agency. Ex nihilo, nihil fit. For the same reason an effect cannot be greater than its own cause. Therefore the agency that generated this corporeal, physical universe is greater than this universe. How much greater is impossible to say with certainty, but if it is finite then it had a beginning and had to come out of something greater than itself, and on and on in infinite regression, making a mockery of limits, including the measurable limits science studies and measures in our world. Measurement and extension are rendered absurd. Therefore regression cannot be indefinite, and whatever agency generated a universe limited by 'extension' cannot suffer from the same limitation. But whether the agency that generated the limitations of our world, albeit free of those limitations, is in all other ways just as unlimited, i.e., is infinite in all respects, simply cannot be assumed. Because if it were infinite, it would, by definition, be perfect, because it would be all that it could be. It could not change, since to change perfection is to create imperfection. And because it could not change, it could not compare, and without comparison there is no identification, and without identification there is no knowledge, and no self-awareness. Therefore, contra most religious traditions, that which is the source of the physical universe, albeit vastly greater than the universe, cannot be limitless/infinite, and cannot be perfect, or it would never have begun the universe that we know.\n \n The paradox in all this is that an imperfect 'divinity', one limited enough to be capable of change and creation, is truly more perfect than a perfect than one that is infinite, hence 'perfect', hence incapable of change, creation, or even self-awareness. Also, one that cannot make anything possible, but establishes its own limits, so that there are only some things it can do, and others that it cannot, in order to imbue that which it can do with law, order, and reason.\n \n Just a few conversation starters from off the top of my head.",

   "Science can disprove individual theologies, whenever they make claims that are testable. Young Earth Creationism, for example, claims that Noah's Ark was real, but the scientific evidence has disproved that notion -- there was no single world-wide flood. That doesn't mean the legend of Noah didn't have some truth somewhere in it, but if so, it wasn't the global deluge claimed by Creationists. that's plain naive. Actually, it's stupid. So science has disproved Noah theology.\n \n Still, there are limits to what science can prove or disprove. It can't prove or disprove a creator, an originator of the universe, at least, not at present. It can't prove or disprove claims such as the notion that the universe was created with the appearance of evolution. It can't prove or disprove the notion that the universe was created last Tuesday, with all of us, our personal histories and memories intact, de novo. \n \n There are lots of religious claims that science can't touch, but that doesn't mean it is reasonable to believe them.

When your \"different things\" do not possess, singly nor in combination, any specific quality that becomes apparent, then, since it does not come from them which do not have it, it is said to arise 'ex nihilo'. Out of nothing. It arises out of that which did not and does not have it. Like really and truly pulling a rabbit out of a hat that did not have a rabbit in it. \n \n Life is the specific quality that is not found in, and is not possessed by matter, per se, no matter how many different kinds of, 'res differens', there are in this universe. Every single kind of matter is inanimate, at every level, from particle to complex compound. And every single living organism dies at some point, again becoming, 'non-life', but without becoming 'different things', that is, without losing any of the corporeal particles and mixtures and compounds and what not, that it had when it was alive. The \"stuff\" is still there, until decomposition moves it along, but the force, the life force, the vitality, is no more. Dust is dust, ashes are ashes, and life is something they simply do not have to give.\n \n Death is something that could not happen if 'the right stuff' was all that was necessary to life, because once you've got it, you've got it, and that 'stuff' can be replaced indefinitely. It works for machines, but not for lifeforms, which are big cut above machinery, even to the point of making their own.\n Why? Because qualities can be transferred from that which has them to that which does not, but nothing can transfer that which it does not have to anything else that does not have it, either. Something that does have it must intervene. Your simplistic, 'res differens', just doesn't fly.",

It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness.\n \n It was believed by others that this essence (\u00e9lan vital) could be harvested and embedded into an inanimate substance and activated with electricity, perhaps taking literally another of Bergson's metaphorical descriptions, the \"current of life\". The British biologist Julian Huxley remarked that Bergson's \u00e9lan vital is no better an explanation of life than is explaining the operation of a railway engine by \u00e9lan locomotif. However, Huxley himself subscribed to the notion of an \u00e9lan vital as may be seen from the following excerpt: \"When I was last in New York, I went for a walk, leaving Fifth Avenue and the Business section behind me, into the crowded streets near the Bowery. And while I was there, I had a sudden feeling of relief and confidence. There was Bergson's \u00e9lan vital - there was assimilation causing life to exert as much pressure, though embodied here in the shape of men, as it has ever done in the earliest year of evolution: - there was the driving force of progress\" (lecture 1, n.p., J.

The concept of \u00e9lan vital is very similar to Schopenhauer's concept of the will-to-live. Several other ideas throughout Bergson's works are reminiscent of Schopenhauer's thoughts.\n \n The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book Bergsonism, though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a mystical, elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the vitalist debates of the late 19th century, \u00e9lan vital in Deleuze's hands denotes a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.\n ========================================",

There is no law, and there needs be no law, that organisms composed of multiple cells, even billions of cells, must have each and evewry one of those cells die at the very same instant, otherwise the qualitative distinction between 'life' and 'death' is 'blurred'. That's simply irrational. The distinction between a live multi-celled organism and a dead one may appear 'blurred' and continuous because not all of its billions of cells die at the exact same instant, but that not where life and death reside at the qualitative level, as opposed to your emphasis on the collective, organismic, quantitative level. At the qualitative level, life and death are distinguished at the cellular level, and even there there is no law saying that the transition from life to death need be total and instantaneous.

You can adopt that metaphysical position if you like, but I won't.\n \n [quote]I've already pointed out that quantum reality has solved all of these Eleatic conundrums and paradoxes. In this instance, a 'pile' is when one quantum [a grain of sand]is plied upon another [grain of sand], and not upon a separate base. Once a 'pile' is achieved, it can get bigger, quantitatively, but it remains, 'a pile', qualitatively. Remove the grains one at a time, you still have a 'pile', quantitately and qualitately, until the last grain is removed from the top of another. At that point, even if you have thousands of grains, quantitatively speaking, still standing on your base, since noe of them are standing on another, you no longer have the qualitative state known as a 'pile' of sand. Same thing goes for space, time, velocity, and everything else in quantum reality, including life.\n [/INDENT]\n \n\n Sorry WW but LIFE is not a quantized variable nor is it a binary one. \n\n \n **\n Sez u. But for you to say that all the universe is quantized, save only 'life' excepted, is both pompous and absurd at the same time.\n \n \n\n Taxonomic categories like LIFE are fuzzy and inevitably so.\n\n \n **\n Life is more than \"a taxonomic category\". It's a real actuality, an empirically observable phenomenon. Stop hiding behind your phony semantic bluff. I've already called it.\n \n \n \n\n In your counter example there are many who would say that two grains of sand do not constitute a pile, or three, or even four.\n\n \n **\n There are madmen and true-believers galore out there in the world. But a fact is still a fact, and a grain of sand piled upon another is not the same thing as a grain of sand that is not piled upon another, but simply laid upon something else.\n \n \n\n And of course a pile of sand while quantized in that it consists of particles is at such a large scale that quantum considerations do not apply to a significant degree.\n\n \n **\n They certainly worked for me as an explanatory analogy. What genuine problem can you raise against it, in place of this hand-waving you've tried on so far?\n \n \n\n You might have a point if you could find a living organism the size of an atom or something like a living Bose condensate - but that seems very improbable.\n\n \n **\n Please. Drop the blah blah woof woof. You only make yourself out to be a supercilious clown.\n \n \n\"Fuzzy logic\"?!? In your case, voodoo logic. You need to work on your 'lateral thinking' skills.\n If you do not understand the application of fuzzy set theory and similar continual logic systems to taxonomic problems then you should introduce yourself to this school of thought.\n\n \n **\n If you still don't understand that the question of life and death is not a \"taxonomic problem\", but an empirical one, then you should introduce yourself to a qualified professional.\n \n \n\n It is as I have said repeatedly a taxonomic problem, a problem of classification. \n\n \n **\n You can say that a million times, but it still won't make it so. Not unless, as I said earlier, you metaphysically extend the notion of \"taxonomic problem\" to cover everything that can be symbolically represented, either in words or in mathematical signage. In which case your \"argument\" is hollow and worthless.\n \n \n\n It is such problems that are particulary amenable to fuzzy logic concepts and methods. If you don't understand why or how then read about it. You might learn more than you expect.\n\n \n **\n Better idea, stop hand-waving, use material from your insinuated sources and prove that life is nothing real, but only a \"taxonomical label\" that is \"amenable to fuzzy logic\", along with all the other pseudo-scientific guff you've been kicking up like dust in order to obscure a plain and simple issue.",

   "Wrong. Darwin simply replaced one mystical 'agency' with another. He called his, \"Natural Selection\". When it was pointed out that that mystical something or other did not account for origins, but only for statistical distributionb, he cribbed from Lamarck and called the new 'agency', \"Pangenesis\". Basically the Lamarckian idea that information acquired by the parent organism could be and is transferred to its offspring by communication between somatic and germ cells in the parent. Oddly, it was the neo-darwinian, Weismann, who went to great lengths with some poor mice to show that this was not the case. See also \"chemical affinity\", another idea 'borrowed' by Darwin.\n \n Nope natural selection is not agency. The term agency is reserved for purposeful, planned actions. Natural selection is not purposeful, nor intelligent. \n\n \n **\n As always, you are wrong. from answers.com (or any other dictionary you should have consulted before shooting your mouth off in ignorance)\n \n \"agency \n noun\n 1/That by which something is accomplished or some end achieved: agent, instrument, instrumentality, instrumentation, intermediary, mean, mechanism, medium, organ. See means.\n 2/A component of government that performs a given function: arm, branch, department, division, organ, wing. See part/whole.\n \n \n \n\n Of course if you wish to claim that all phenotypic variants have equal probabilities of survival and thus there is NO natural selection then I will gladly review your evidence.\n\n \n **\n Nobody claims any such thing, but then, only you think that survival causes evolution, instead of being the result of it.\n \n \n IAC, Darwin's ideas were dead in the water until Fisher, Haldane, Wright, and other statisticians invented the latest mystical 'agency', that is, \"Random, Accidental, Beneficial/Adaptive, Genetic Mutation\". Together or separately, both Darwin's \"NS\" and Fisher et al's \"RM\" are the mystical 'agency' that most of the world calls \"Lady Luck\". Only darwinists believe that they are talking 'science' when they use their mystical vocabulary.\n Nope. Variation is not an agency either, and its certainly not mysterious.\n\n \n **\n I really wish you'd get a new tutor who could teach you how to read. Scan what you quote one more time. See the word, \"variation\" anywhere? No, because it is not there, and never was. The word that you mistook for it is 'mutation'. And yes, if I had mentioned \"variation\" I would have pointed out that is an effect, not a cause, and that, as defined above, 'agencies' are causes, not outcomes.{BTW, according to you, organismic 'variation' is the effect caused by 'random genetic mutation.} Not only can you not read properly, but your tendency to 'non sequitur', 'red herring', and inability to stay on topic points to a limited attention span.\n \n \n \n\n And its not necessary that all possible variants be equally probable either which is what truly random variation would imply.\n\n \n **\n The darwinist principle, \"random wrt fitness\", is sufficiently random for our purposes.\n \n \n\n Its only necessary that the variation mechanisms produce a statistical distribution of fitness around the population mean.\n\n \n **\n \"Variation mechanisms\"?!? What would they be, pray tell? Random genetic accidents, perhaps? Luck? Mystical Mother Nature? All of the above?\n \n \n\n That distribution need not be randomly aligned with the optimal fitness vector and most likely will not be so aligned or biased.\n\n \n **\n Go play statistics with a census-taker. We're talking biological mechanisms for evolutiuon here.\n \n \n\n However IF it is biased it does not negate the equations of population genetics or NDS.\n\n \n **\n Why is that so unsurprising?

Two different versions of this gene exist, differing only at a single position. People with one version of the gene tend to score a little higher on self-transcendence tests. Although the influence is small, it is, Hamer claims, consistent. About half the people in the study had at least one copy of the self-transcendence-boosting version of VMAT2, which Hamer dubs the God gene.\n\n \n Why should there not also be genes for accepting the divinity of what one comes to believe?\n \n Or, you could go on with your rant about evolution from the view of the blind who refuse to read brail or listen to talking books and say things like that whcih appeared in quote above.\n \n Its your choice wascally. Either you have a position or evidence on whether there is scientific evidence for or against the devine.\n \n If not, the title is apt and our administrator should serious consider taking action against you.",

It is either mechanically pre-determined or it is teleological. Grinding beef into hamburger, albeit a mechanical process, is not mechanically pre-determined, and would never happen except that it is really a teleological process, not one motivated internally by the meat itself, nor even the grinding mechanism, but one driven by the motives of an external, intelligent and volitional agent, i.e., a butcher or a cook.\n \n Now, anyone who reads these threads knows that if there is anything you are incapable of doing, it is leaving the last word to someone other than yourself; so I know you won't be able to resist one more inane response in support of your patently silly argument.
