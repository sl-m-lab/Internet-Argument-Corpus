   "Most things in life are not black an white, and all too often discussions and arguments take place between two (types of) people who see the other person's argument as black or white, when in actuality almost no one actually has a stance that is so strong. \n \n With regards to taxes there are two extremes. 1) a liberationist ideal that has no government taxing scheme, and consequently no resulting social programs, and 2) extreme socialism where the wealth is collected, and redistributed so that everyone enjoys an identical standard of living, no matter how hard they actually work in reality. \n \n I personally lean towards lesser government taxes, and in turn having few to no social programs, however I can see the problems with every individual being left to fend for themselves. Some people simply can not get or find work. Some people simply NEED help to survive (and I do not mean survive in a hyperbolic sense; I mean they will literally die if they do not receive aid). \n \n It's a combination of certain people's helplessness and the effectiveness of governmental social programs that lead me to the conclusions that some social programs are required. These social programs, however, should not be implemented in a socialistic manner (redistribution of the wealth). \n \n The constitution outlines a method of taxation (direct tax) that falls upon each person equally. This method of taxation is much closer to American ideals than the more socialistic income tax. \n \n Under a direct taxing scheme (apportioned through the census) each person would pay the same amount to pay off an allotted sum decided by the government. For example if the government wanted $1,000 dollars to pay for a certain social program, and there were 100 people who lived in the united states, every person would pay 10 dollars. \n \n The problem (or simply just consequence) is that this would \"hurt\" people who had less money more. So to solve this \"problem\" something has to give. Either poorer people get to keep their social programs, and the cost burden must go elsewhere (analogous to the system we have right now), or poorer people would only elect officials that would keep social programs to a minimum, thus reducing the tax burden on themselves. \n \n In my mind shifting the source of income for social programs to people with more money is unfair. While this may benefit the majority, it is largely recognized that the personal rights of the few is not an acceptable pricetag for the greater good. \n \n I'm sure there are bigger battles to fight though. Few people are willing to rush to the aid of the victimized rich person when there are so much more noble causes out there.\n \n But suspending this one aspect of the situation for a moment, I would like to ask about the plausibility of the above paradigm shift. Specifically: 1) Do you agree that our current situation sacrifices individual sovereignty for the greater good? 2) Is our current form of taxation (in the US at least) a degree of socialism? 3) If we were to switch to a system that made use of only direct taxing, what social programs should we give up, and what social programs should be kept?",

But I guess you are right that it is some form of \"socialism\". But what I think you are missing is that the income distributional effects of taxation pale in comparrison to the income distributional effects of other governmental activities (like my example of laws against violence)\n \n \nIt could be argued that the social programs would be available to rich people incase they ever became poor, but then we start getting into the area of what minimum standard of living should the government provide to everyone. \n and the constitution outlines what role the government is supposed to fill.\n \n\n \n Ah, yes. Your constitution should of course ultimatly decide the actions of your government. But at the same time, the constitution can be changed, can`t it? So I think there is a point to discuss matters even if it breaches the constitution (besides, I know very little about the US constitution ;)). But anyhow, unless otherwise stated, I`m not refering to the US per say, but rather more in general. \n \n \nSo what problems do you potentially see with a government that only had a direct tax available to it? how would the US adapt to less available funds for social programs?\n \n\n \n I think a direct tax would be problematic both morally and practical. \n \n Morally; I simply don`t trust the market forces to create a fair distribution of income or wealth. A rough estimate or guidelines perhaps, but not the sole responsibility. As supply and demand decides your pay, rather than actual hard work, it is clearly an unfair system. However, I do not trust the government (or the democratic majority) to distribute fairly either. Therefor I think we need a mixed system of governmental distribution (through taxation) and wages determined by the market forces. The ratio of governemental distribution/market forces is an interesting question, but not one I could answer. Why taxes should be used (instead of other forms of distributional measures) is because I believe them to much more effective, than for example bans or regulations as they easily play alongside the market forces.\n \n Income distribution is also vital for equal oppurtunity. I sincerily believe that maximizing equal oppurtunity is one of the (if not \"The\") most important purpose of society and the state. \n \n Practical : Now, as I pointed out earlier, it is indeed possible to keep the level of income distribution without resorting to income distribution through taxes. One example could be minimum wage (and large unemplyment benefits) antoher could be caps n certain prices. I just find these measures to be impractical and a much heavier burden on the economy than income distribution through taxes.\n \n Another, more radical argument could also be the credability of the state. It can be argued that the state tries to maximize economic progress through certain legislation that will ultimatly distribute wealth and income to those who own the means of production. One example is the ability to turn a company into a legal person. Another is the fact that right to property clearly benefits the \"haves\" more then the \"have-nots\". It could also be argued that the same goes for most criminal law. To reduce credability of the state would cause the social disorder to rise... \n \n Disclaimer: I am talking about the federal govermnent and the state government interchangeably. But it could indeed be possible to isolate the federal government and argue that the state government should take care of income distributional question, whereas the federal governemnt should be financed by a direct tax.",

The ratio of governemental distribution/market forces is an interesting question, but not one I could answer. Why taxes should be used (instead of other forms of distributional measures) is because I believe them to much more effective, than for example bans or regulations as they easily play alongside the market forces.\n (emphasis mine)\n \n Eddie: I am curious. What do you consider fair? Is it that everyone receives the same thing? Is it that each according to their effort? Is it a fair opportunity? Why is it that you think it is fair to take the money I have earned and just shift it to another? Is it in order to be charitable? If that is the case then I vehemently disagree. Charity is not charity if it is obligated by the government. It is tax. I give liberally and sacrificially right now. I desire to do so. Others do not. It is wrong of me to impose my giving on others. You say taxes are much more effective. Effective for what? What is the goal? To make it so that others who want to lay about can and I do all the work and my money is given to them?",

But I would argue that the supply and demand of your individual proffession is still far more important when it comes to deciding your wage. Your skill and merit can only be defined by looking at your skill and merit in comparisson to others. What is worth to you is dependant on your options, and your options are dependant on the supply and demand of your proffession.

The context is created by your society and therefor your income is not only yours, but also \"everyones\". Just as the worker owes a part of his production to the capital owner that owns the machines the worker operates with, you owe a part of your production to the \"owner\" of the society you operate with. And the owner of our society is in a democracy everyone that operates within it.\n \n \nOur government is founded on many principles.

However i see the constitution as a little bit less fallible then laws in general for a couple reasons. 1) It was written by a group of people who were being oppressed by a tyrannical government. Basically they sat down and hammered out a set of rules for a government that would prevent the government from becoming too powerful (and in turn tyrannical). and 2) the constitution was ratified by all 13 of the original state, and to become a new state the state must also accept the constitution, and 3) changing pieces of the constitution are much more difficult than passing laws. \n \n The last part implying that for something to change about the constitution a large majority has to think it's a good idea. \n \n \nIn a capitalisitc economy, equal opportunity is much higher than in earlier feudal economies, but the ambition to skewer equal oppurtunity is still present.

As capital accumulation is based on capital accumulation in the past it leads to an aggregation (or concentration) of capital. The fact that most forms of capital is transferable from one generation to the next makes the capitalist system even more prone to unequal opportunities (ie; hinders equal oppurtunity)\n \n As for other personal rights.

It seems like you don't trust people enough for them to make a living on their own. \n \n\n \n This is true. Individuals tries to adapt to the supply and demand. This does not mean that they somehow can control the supply and demand in any way. All they can to is react to the market powers.

And by doing so, has the capability to distribute resources.\n \n And as I am assuming that we all live in (liberal) democracies, I believe we have the democratic ability to choose our own government (ie: the government represents the collective interests of the \"others\").\n \n \n\n and the protection the government supplies is paid for.\n \n\n \n This depends on how you mean.

   "but you do recognize that there are situations where the government can not be expected to provide both the freedom and the ability to recognize that freedom... correct?\n \n\n \n Of course, the practicalities around the whole issue would be a thread in itself. I`m not advocating equal distribution of resources as I believe that would both be unjust and very impractical. Besides, those who have the ability to act on their freedom benefit from the freedom regardless if the government provide anything, and everything else equal, this must be recognized as something positive. Allthough, I would argue that, everything else equal, substantial freedom would be *more* positive.\n \n \nno, because back then (you don't give a specific date or place so i'm just assuming the general past) it wasn't recognized that everyone should have these basic rights. \n \n\n \n And this is my point. It was not recognized that everyone should have the basic rights unless they earned it (through dominance, wealth or some other form of achievment). Today it is not recognized that everyone should have the right to own a car unless they earn it (through wealth or some other form of achievment). And if the right to live is dependant on your ability to pay for healthcare, the right to live is not recognized as a basic right that everyone should have unless they earn it.\n \n \nI think the problem is that while i consider the most important part of a freedom is other's inability to be able to limit that freedom, you consider the most important part of a freedom as the ability to actually realize and utilize that freedom. is this an accurate assessment?\n \n\n \n I think that is a very good assesment, but I think you must include violence (or force) in there somewhere, because current criminal legislation limits my ability to aquire a car through other means than purchasing it. \n \n And keep in mind that to be sure that someone can`t limit that freedom, you need the government to provide the protection. And then you have allready begun to allow the government to provide for your freedom (and consequently, extract resources to provide for this protection).\n \n \n\n and again, what it seems to come down to is i see freedoms as things that can not be taken away, while you see freedoms as something that must be given. \n\n \n Freedoms do not necesarrily have to be given IMO. They can often be realized by personal achievments, but in order for it to be meaningful to you, you must have the ability to act on your freedom (regardless if it was given or if you had the ability yourself).\n \n \n\n and in turn, that equates to how much you want the government to control or influence your life. i invest in health care so that if i do get sick i can take care of myself. i recognize that i am my own responsibility. \n \n There are tradeoffs. by expecting the government to take care of protecting it's citizens from others, as well as providing for them when they are sick, they must find a source for that care... and i know of no real life situation that actually provides that care in a fair and equal way. \n \n\n \n Yes, there is always trade-offs and those are very, very important. Which is why it is important that we allow ourself to control our own lifes through democratic means. Without democracy, we give up our ability to decide which substantial freedoms we should have. \n \n I don`t object to your democratic choice to not provide substantial freedom. I object to any notion that the people/government lack the democratic right to distribute resources to achieve substantial freedom. And I point out that if you want to \"maximize\" freedom, providing only formal (or negative) freedom don`t really cut it as it only applies to those with the ability to act on it.\n \n \n\n i have a holiday coming, so i may not respond for about a week.

There is no fundamental difference between using violence to pay for the upkeep of a military, and using violence to pay for healthcare. Why should one be more \"okay\" than the other?",
