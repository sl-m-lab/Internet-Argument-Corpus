It doesn't matter what time it is, or how fast we're going already or in what direction - that's what our acceleration will be. This allows us to work out our velocity at any given time after starting to fall: V = AxT, and the height we will have fallen, H = 0.5xAxT^2.\n \n These equations model the effects of gravity. If we change them, they no longer model gravity and don't work. We can change the units if we like, but the formula forces us to change them all together: we can't make seconds twice as long and still say freefall is 10m/s/s, unless we change how long a metre is too.\n \n Another equation related to gravity is attenuation: gravity decreases as you move away from a mass, varying according to 1/D^2.
