   "Should gun registration be mandatory ? \n \n http://www.youdebate.com/DEBATES/gun_registration.HTM\n\n \n NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future. \n P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!",

   "A report on military readiness is not the same as putting my name and address of a central database. My name and address in a central database does not serve the militia to judge military readiness. \n\n So you're saying that the modern day militia no longer utilizes privately owned weapons? In 1792 the militia made use of privately owned weapons and thus the federal government kept a record of privately owned weapons to determine its military readiness. \n \n \"These categories included privately owned small arms and accountrements to be reported to the federal government. These were, in most cases, individually owned private property....There was no outrage or even concern expressed then that an inventory of privately owned weaponry and accoutrements reported to the federal government would somehow 'infringe' on the right of the people,\"\n http://www.potomac-inc.org/milret.html\n \n \"The Militia Act was about military organization....The Militia Act of 1792 required the states to 'enroll'- that is, registered- gun owners for militia duty just as they had been registered for the King's militia. (See .../196gnd.html and Kates in .../196lrev.html). Registration of ownership and the reporting of private sales would shut down the illegal traffic in firearms and empower local jurisdictions to enforce their local rules and regulations. Registration also creates the mechanism to establish legal categories of gun ownership that could effectively disarm the lawless and the disloyal starting with the NRA's 'armed citizen guerrillas.' That is how we provide for our self-defense under law and government.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/398chest.html\n \n \n \nWhat the HELL IS GOING ON WITH THAT SIGNATURE. \n\n He, he.
