   "In her latest column, Janet Porter warns all those Christians who intend to vote for Barack Obama that they are willfully disobeying God and will be punished accordingly: \n  To all those who name the name of Christ who plan to willfully disobey Him by voting for Obama, take warning. Not only is our nation in grave danger, according to the Word of God, so are you ... [T]his election is not about race. It's not about the economy. It's about obeying God.\n \n ...\n \n Be forewarned: If you willfully disobey God on life and marriage because of race or false hope for the economy, you will usher in the kind of change that brought the Soviet Union to collapse.\n \n But the warning goes far beyond that. To those who think that God's grace gives them license to willfully disobey Him without consequences - think again:\n \n Not everyone who says to Me, \"Lord, Lord,\" shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, \"Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?\" And then I will declare to them, \"I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!\" (Matthew 7:21-23)\n \n That deals with your eternity.\n That's right - if you vote for Obama, you are going straight to hell. \n \n In Porter's view, you have a relatively simple choice: either vote for McCain or stop calling yourself a Christian:\n  To those who call themselves by the name of Christ who ignore what God says about life and marriage, who and are clinging to a fantasy of economic gain, think again ... Then obey Him in the voting booth and out of it. If not, do us all a favor and quit calling yourself a Christian. \n Vote for Obama, Go To Hell | Right Wing Watch\n \n And it's posted where????\n \n World Nut Daily...\n emoticon_rolleyes",
