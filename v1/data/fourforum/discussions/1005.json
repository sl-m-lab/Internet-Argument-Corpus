   "I knew this girl all the way since 6th grade, not personally. Well anyways I was amazed at the news at my high school when they said some girl that got pregnant at our school was going to be on Dr. Phil tonight. So like all of the rest of the school I tuned in to see who it was. And it was her. Alexander Stehl. A sophomore in my class of 2006 at Nease High school was on t.v. I was amazed that it was her. So I watched the program. (this was on yesterday 9/18/03) Well some of the facts were....twisted. She said she never knew that you could get pregnant from unprotected sex. Hmmmm....this was odd since we had a education program about it every single year all the way up to freshman year. Where was she? Odd.....a lie. I watched some more as they tried to make it seem as if it were not her fault. Well....I also know who the father is. Some guy from ROTC called J.J. Well.....he's not exactly the kind of guy who would take responsibility, and he didn't. (he does drugs....) And she said she thought he would? ???? This program was getting weirder and weirder. I don't know what else they said, cause I turned it off right then and there. This show was painting a portrait of lies. So today this show was the joke of the day, everyone laughing about it. you may think that's horrible, but it doesn't seem so bad. I mean she made a mistake, and stupid mistake, and she knew what she was doing, it wasn't like she was ignorant about the subject. So just thought you might want to know now that this program of Dr. Phil wasn't all truth.",

   "Of course it wasn't true Dr. Phil doesn't go for helping people. Dr. Phil goes for ratings, popularity and (occasionally) controversy. Of course, like most good psychologists (or pshychiatrists Depending) he's totally full of it. he's also just full of himself and like most narcissistic Americans he just LOVES to hear himself talk, and he loves to dilute himself into thinking that he has helped someone.\n \n \n \n I'm obviously not a fan.",
