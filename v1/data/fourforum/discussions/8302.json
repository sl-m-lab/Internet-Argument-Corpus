Denying marriage to gays does real, actual harm; social, finanicial, and emotional.

   "[QUOTE=jyoshu]That's odd because I NEVER hear Christians comparing gays to nazis, or saying gays should be exterminated.\n \n \n Many Christians do feel, however that they should definitely not be granted equality. Let them live, but not live as freely as we who are chosen can live. \n \n Perhaps you should review Matthew's comments on this forum before jumping to his defense.\n \n I come to his defense because I can understand how he, myself, and others like us have grown up in this world. I have written to him in private messages and he is very kind. He has a good sense of humor and a high level of intelligience. What he doesn't have very much of anymore is patience for people who think he deserves less in life then they do. People who cannot get it through their thick, selfish, skulls that their opinions and/or beliefs about who and what we are should not be effecting our lives. Unfortunately they do. I have had the advantage of an accepting family that sheilded me from the harshness of reality in regards to the way many people feel about the way both Matthew, myself, and many others are. Unlike Matthew, I have lived most of my life making excuses for the ignorance and prejudice that is a part of our daily lives. He has no room left for ignorance and prejudice. So he's throwing it back at those who thought they had a right and a reason to start throwing it at him. A few innocent bystanders are bound to get hit in the verbal crossfire. If they are truly innocent it won't harm them. Black people waited for equality for 100 years, 1865 to 1965. It wasn't until the race riots in the summer of 1965 that white America started to realize that treating people badly and legally oppressing them had severe consequences. \n \n \n If Matthew were really only interested in \"returning the treatment he recieves\" he would direct his vitriol at the few extremist voices out there in society that have make them, NOT religion in general.\n \n As I said above, the religious people who don't share the biggotry of the good book, should and would understand how those few extremist voices out there would tend to anger a person. \"A few extremist voices\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,are you for real? Well I don't hear many non-extremist voices speaking out to gay people and telling them to ignore what the few extreme voices are saying. Religion in general is a red flag for the most part. When you're gay you may not always be treated bad to your face by religious people, but 90% percent of the time,(if they are really religious) they will remind and warn you of your sin. Who needs it?\n \n There's no excuse for many of his comments, just as there would be no excuse if I heard someone make similar statements about gays. \n \n There is really no excuse for your comments against gay marriage, but you still make them. However, you don't need an excuse, it is the way you feel, and Matthews comments reflect the way he feels.\n \n By taking up those extremist statements or defending them, you and Matthew JOIN fundamentalists by taking their tactics.\n \n I am not taking up his statements or defending them, I am reminding you and others that think he is so out of line that he is angry and tired of your XXXX. You telling him he can't do this or that because YOU don't want it redefined. Obviously YOU feel that YOU matter. He feels the same way about himself. But you don't feel he matters not enough to include him in something that you feel in some way belongs to you, like marriage. It's like claiming that black people should be equal, but they shouldn't be allowed to live next door to me.\n \n Extremism such as recommending 'extermination' is bad no matter who it's directed at. Again, I hope it's the case that you just weren't aware of how bad his statements have been. His comments have been condemned several times by people who argue FOR gay rights, on the gay rights \"side of the fence.\"\n \n His comments and views are born of oppression. It is easy to see, at least for me, how frustration and humilition can lead somebody to that point. In the private messages I have written to him, I didn't give him any flack about his homosexuality, or tell him why I thought he shouldn't be allowed to get legally married. In return I got nothing but good dialogue from a nice person. I must ask why people think it is okay to deny fellow citizens equal treatment? Why is it okay to treat homosexuals the way YOU would NOT like to be treated? That's what it boils down to. Matthew hasn't figured that out yet, neither have the rest of us. He is just a bit more vocal about the way he feels.",

I think I recall you having a wife. I'm guessing you do these things with her. Now how about you take your closest male friend and do the same things. Notice you said intimacy and hugging don't have to be about attraction and sex. So if they don't, next time you're around a male friend, start hugging him and explain how this intimacy isn't about sex or attraction. I'm guessing he would be really freaked out (assuming he's married). Why would that be? (hint: it has something to do with attraction, even if not about sex).",
