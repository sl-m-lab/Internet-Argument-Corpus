   "It's funny you register that complaint.\n You claim to be supportive of gay rights, yet you spend THOUSANDS OF POSTS HERE COMPLAINING about gays...\n\n \n I think your problem (YOU--not \"gays\"--as in, plural, since you apparently don't get the difference) is that you're seeing any discussion that isn't eye-to-eye as \"complaining about gays\"; that's a GROSS over-simplification and inaccuracy. I could say you spend thousands of posts complaining about religion since most of your complaints involve religious people. When I comment on something pertaining to YOU or others in how they have LOBBIED as activists or individual actions, it's not a statement about gays in general. And to conflate the two is flat out dishonest on your part. Best to not throw deceitfully over-simplistic phrases out there like \"you spend thousands of posts complaining about gays\" out of context, and try to infer them as some kind of value judgment. If someone takes issue with activism that happens to be mostly comprised of people of a given trait, does that mean they're criticizing people BASED on that trait? No more so than one could say you're criticizing white people when you criticize the KKK.\n \n \nThe world has a LONG LIST of people who lie about gays in order to denigrate and marginalize them.

   "First off, I note the sheer inconsistency (hypocrisy?) of Foundit asserting to want the discussion to be about things related to the topic of the thread, and then putting a post up nearly 100% about the messenger rather than the message. But this sort of commentary is par for the course for him.\n \n \n... yet the majority of your posts are FILLED with disagreement... You claim you want gay equality, yet you complain like crazy when we try to achieve it.\n\n \n It's a debate forum. Disagreement is par for the course. Being for a given ideology doesn't require one to agree on ways it is fought for.\n \n \nYou claim that you think an example of anti-gay prejudice is bad (if you'll even drop that comment in the dialogue), but then you'll obfuscate the issue with \"but they really believe\".\n\n \n BLOWI. I've tried to show that sometimes intentions aren't evil when opposing gay marriage. What this is really about is that you don't want another angle of the issue given that doesn't present those you speak against in the worst possible light.\n \n \nYou try to turn the conversations into something they aren't.\n\n \n Translation: conversations don't always go in the narrow direction that Foundit wants them to.\n \n No doubt you get frustrated because I don't dehumanize and present in the worst possible light people who don't agree with you. It's hard to stand back and let you call people \"liars\" and bad things because I grew up around people like this--everyday normal people. (we're not talking about the Phelps' of the world here.) More than likely, people like that are your relatives, old friends, people that have cared about you. You're right, I DO take issue with a one-sided approach toward people that tends to wholly judge them over one issue. Opposing gay marriage doesn't make people evil.\n \n The irony here, though, is that you yourself have a habit of doing the very thing you accuse me of doing. You come into threads and when you disagree, you present a different way of looking at it. The difference is that I KNOW what you're doing and accept that. You on the other hand obviously can't handle it if a discussion evolves in any way whatsoever.\n \n \nInstead of looking at the thread talking about how wrong the anti-gay prejudice is, you'll fixate on trying to shift the issue to \"is it really hate?\"\n\n \n And that's just it--you want to replay the obvious over and over in the thread! EVERYONE KNOWS anti-gay prejudice is wrong, Foundit. You continually want the most obvious things harped on. It's like putting up a thread about a theft incident and expecting people to ONLY respond with ridiculously obvious moral statements like \"stealing is wrong\". And if they don't but decide to discuss the in's and out's of the issue, the moral IMPLICATIONS, the factors that cause it, etc. you get all mad and flabbergasted. \n \n Yes, of course, anti-gay prejudice is wrong!! Very wrong. So is stealing. So is prejudice over race. So is many things! How many times is it supposed to be repeated, F? Shall I add it to the sig as well? Let's see .... the sky is up, by the way. Birds have wings. Oh, and, elephants don't fly.\n \n NO ONE is going to say \"anti-gay prejudice is not wrong.\" Very few people would EVER disagree with your assertion that it's wrong. The clincher is ALWAYS how one defines prejudice. That's WHY getting deeper into these issues is important, Foundit. Do you really think it solves the problem of racism to bother with obvious statements everyone will agree with like \"racial bigotry is wrong\"? No. The issue needs to be what bigotry consists of. It needs to be about what is truly bigotry and what is not. P.ROBERTSON would likely tell you that \"anti-gay prejudice is wrong\". S.Hannity would likely tell you that. So would any number of people you'd probably consider \"anti-gay\". Does that solve anything? No. The devil is in the details, and you only EVER seem to want the forest commented on, instead of the trees. \n \n \nI am not Matthew. I recognize a difference between \"religious people\" doing something, as in abusing the religion to a certain prejudiced or bigotted goal, and the RELIGION ITSELF doing something.\n\n \n ... As do I recognize the difference between proponents of a rights issue doing something, and orientation of being gay!\n \n \nI wasn't using comments against me as a stereo-type against gays. For you to pretend I was is incredibly dishonest on your part.\n\n \n You clearly used the phrase \"complaining about gays\" when that's a misrepresentation of what's going on. You're playing word games at this point.\n \n \nI remember when I first got to this board you were complaining about gays coming to the Bush White House Easter event.\n They had tickets like everybody else, but they wore rainbow ribbons which you didn't like.\n\n \n See THAT'S a PERFECT example--exactly what I'm talking about.\n \n I have never cared one iota that gays go to the WH easter egg roll. It's like people (not just me, BTW) say one thing, you hear it/read it, and it goes through some filter in your thinking that makes it come out as something ELSE: in this example, points about people using an event unrelated to gay pride as an activism opportunity is misrepresented as \"complaining about gays coming to the Bush White House Easter event\". That's either a willful lie, or you have a SERIOUS problem with the way you tend to see things.\n \n \nNo. Instead you try to pretend I am the one not discussing it, when you were obviously the guilty party...\n\n \n The difference is that I don't go into a thread and start generating a bunch of posts or comments about the PEOPLE posting in the thread. I discuss the issues, but make no mistake, yes, I do and will comment on a different angle of things. YOU on the other hand create comments on the posters, rather than the issues. Now when a poster gives their opinion that's a different angle from the way you want the thread to go (e.g. repeating obvious statements about this-and-that being wrong or something), you have two REASONABLE choices in how to respond:\n \n A.) you can respond by either agreeing or trying to refute the point made, or\n B.) You can ignore it\n \n Instead, you're taking another option of attacking the messenger.\n \n Perhaps you should suggest to the admin(s) creating a forum heading devoted to discussing posters here. That way your desire to do that can be indulged, and it can be avoided for seemingly every thread becoming discussion fodder about given posters--whether it's me, Steeeeve, Phyllis, the AA's and EZ's, or whoever else you're disagreeing with at the time. What do you think? After you've had time to use it, it would be interesting to see the ratio between your posts THERE as compared to issues-related threads.\n \n \nSo I am talking about the NATURE of reparative therapy, which was the original point...\n\n \n So are you of the view then that the \"NATURE\" of RT hasn't changed since it's beginning, even though the examples you used haven't been used in decades? The problem is that psychological harm is far more difficult to qualify/quantify than physical harm. The APA says it's harmful. I don't disagree with that. But I still support the element consisting of religion trying to religiously and morally support gays who want to live in a different way than their orientation calls for, because I understand how serious religious belief is to many people. Sometimes peoples' religious beliefs outweighs the issue of harm. I would never, for instance, tell a person he shouldn't join the priesthood because he would have to be celibate. Even though one could conceivably argue he's being harmed by not being allowed to participate in romantic relationships. That's his choice and I would support a group that was dedicated to helping him cope with that.",

I just look at what WAS done.\n \n Here's the thing.\n Suppose we're in a court room. I'm trying to show the defendant DID something. That he violated the law.\n Jyoshu is running around IGNORING the question as to whether or not the defendant did that thing, and instead trying to obsess over the MOTIVE of the defendant. He will talk to the jury and try to distract them with \"but his motive wasn't evil\" or \"but he truly believes his religion wants him to be that way\".\n But Jyoshu will IGNORE THE QUESTION OF GUILT.\n \n In a court of law, and in the real world, the question of GUILT is much more important than whether or not the defendant is \"guilty\".\n \n \n \nThe irony here, though, is that you yourself have a habit of doing the very thing you accuse me of doing. You come into threads and when you disagree, you present a different way of looking at it.

That's WHY getting deeper into these issues is important, Foundit.\n\n And I have told you repeatedly how I define \"prejudice\".\n It involves a person believing that another group should be discriminated against or blatantly lying (or willful ignorance slurs) about that group. Plain and simple.\n \n But the problem with that is that it doesn't give you a way to DEFEND the people who commit this prejudice, so you try to change the subject to whether or not \"hate\" is involved or whether or not \"religious belief\" is involved... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nIt needs to be about what is truly bigotry and what is not.\n\n I have no problem discussing that.\n The problem is you habitually shy away from such conversations.\n \n Here's a challenge Jyoshu.\n Is it bigotry to claim that gays can \"change\" to \"ex-gay\" in grossly exaggerated numbers?\n \n Such a misrepresentation is frequently used by some people to help excuse discrimination and even to justify it. I have repeatedly gotten into conversations with people who claim that being able to change the characteristic in question PREVENTS that characteristic from being constitutionally protected.\n It also helps the religious anti-gay right to IGNORE the nature of homosexuality and the nature of their demands. If they can lie to themselves and tell themselves that gays can just change to straight, get married, and be happy, then it's much easier for them to deny equality.\n \n So, YOU want to talk about what is \"truly bigotry\"?\n Then let's do it!\n \n \n \nYou clearly used the phrase \"complaining about gays\" when that's a misrepresentation of what's going on. You're playing word games at this point.\n\n No. I am not.\n I will defend my assessment as valid and accurate, WITHOUT word games.\n What I think is REALLY going on is that you KNOW you're getting yourself back into a situation where YOU are the one playing \"word games\" with your reply, like when you tried to pretend gays \"force\" the religious anti-gay to do something just cause gays are given equal rights.\n \n \n \nI have never cared one iota that gays go to the WH easter egg roll.\n\n CLAFCLOW.\n Your complaint was over the RAINBOW ACCESSORIES they wore.\n Quit deceitfully obfuscating the issue.\n \n \n \nIt's like people (not just me, BTW) say one thing, you hear it/read it, and it goes through some filter in your thinking that makes it come out as something ELSE: in this example, points about people using an event unrelated to gay pride as an activism opportunity is misrepresented as \"complaining about gays coming to the Bush White House Easter event\".\n\n Beyond me correcting your above mischaracterization of my observation, you ALSO had the audacity to praise the religious right protestors for their \"restraint\".\n Which was funny cause the religious right protestors USED BULLHORNS in their protest at the White House...\n \n I can't help but think that if GAYS had used bullhorns to protest Christians wearing a christian cross on the white house lawn, you would pitch a fit over the \"prejudice\".\n But there you were. DEFENDING the protestors... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nThe difference is that I don't go into a thread and start generating a bunch of posts or comments about the PEOPLE posting in the thread.\n\n BLOWI, BLOWI, BLOWI, BLOWI!\n You did EXACTLY that in THIS thread.\n \n Let me quote to you a gem from your VERY FIRST POST in this thread...\n Jyoshu: \"(Not unlike Foundit and others driving some of the anti-gay trolling that we've seen of late.)\"\n \n You did EXACTLY what you just denied you do IN THIS VERY THREAD.\n \n \n \nI discuss the issues, but make no mistake, yes, I do and will comment on a different angle of things.\n\n Show me where you have ACTUALLY COMMENTED on the Masters and Johnson study.\n Wait. Let me guess.\n Another challenge refused... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nA.) you can respond by either agreeing or trying to refute the point made, or\n B.) You can ignore it\n Instead, you're taking another option of attacking the messenger.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Jyoshu, I can't help but wonder if you SERIOUSLY don't see how hypocritical you are in your accusations, cause this claim above is EXACTLY what you did in multiple threads.\n One prime example was the \"Ugandan reparative therapy\" thread, where you wandered in, started ATTACKING THE MESSENGERS by complaining they were bloggers and \"activists\", and REFUSED to do any research to figure out if the message was valid or not.\n \n As I pointed out, you even failed to even really READ the links you were complaining about.\n \n \n \nPerhaps you should suggest to the admin(s) creating a forum heading devoted to discussing posters here. That way your desire to do that can be indulged, and it can be avoided for seemingly every thread becoming discussion fodder about given posters--whether it's me, Steeeeve, Phyllis, the AA's and EZ's, or whoever else you're disagreeing with at the time. What do you think? After you've had time to use it, it would be interesting to see the ratio between your posts THERE as compared to issues-related threads.\n\n Tell you what Jyoshu.\n How about we actually DISCUSS THE TOPIC here???\n \n Cause like I pointed out, your VERY FIRST POST on this thread came out swinging at me, DIRECTLY \"discussing posters here\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nSo are you of the view then that the \"NATURE\" of RT hasn't changed since it's beginning, even though the examples you used haven't been used in decades?\n\n I am not of that view.\n Furthermore, after explaining the purpose of my pointing out the history to you TWICE now, I can't help but wonder how the heck you could be still confused on the issue...\n \n \n \nThe problem is that psychological harm is far more difficult to qualify/quantify than physical harm.\n\n Can we quantify it by suicides?\n Can we quantify it by alcoholism?\n Can we quantify it by a diagnosis of depression?\n \n I am more than happy to quantify / qualify WHY I assess \"harm\" in these cases.\n But I really don't think you want an honest discussion on that.\n \n \n \nThe APA says it's harmful. I don't disagree with that. But I still support the element consisting of religion trying to religiously and morally support gays who want to live in a different way than their orientation calls for, because I understand how serious religious belief is to many people.\n\n And as I have explained to you repeatedly, I ALSO support people being able to \"change\" if they want to.\n I think of it like plastic surgery. Unnecessary, but if the patient wants it.\n \n But like in plastic surgery, the surgeon WARNS THE PATIENT of the risks.\n The surgeon MONITORS the patient afterwards to monitor the success of the procedure.\n WHY doesn't \"Reparative therapy\" do that?\n \n \n \nSometimes peoples' religious beliefs outweighs the issue of harm.\n\n I can understand an INFORMED DECISION on that.\n But when the group in question REFUSES TO ADMIT the harms, then how can a patient \"weigh\" the issue of harm ???\n \n \n \nI would never, for instance, tell a person he shouldn't join the priesthood because he would have to be celibate.

   "How is that false?\n\n \n It's false because \"but what they really believe\" isn't even CLOSE to being the full story of the position I've taken.

That's exactly one reason I have no problem with the idea that one can oppose a gay right, and still not be wrong in doing so. \"Wrong\" (in the moralistic sense) depends on an outside standard of morality.

That he violated the law.\n \n In a court of law, and in the real world, the question of GUILT is much more important than whether or not the defendant is \"guilty\".\n \n\n \n Right there, your point fails. In a courtroom proof would NEVER rest on the scant evidence the article above presents. Yet you've already found them guilty at what's little more than the opening remarks.\n \n (Note: this is me discussing the topic of the thread. So stop putting forth falsehoods that I'm not. No matter that it doesn't fit your narrow view of what discussion should be.)\n \n \nJyoshu is running around IGNORING the question as to whether or not the defendant did that thing, and instead trying to obsess over the MOTIVE of the defendant.\n\n \n WOW!!! Apparently you don't realize that determining motive is ALWAYS a factor in determining guilt!!! emoticon_wow\n \n \nAnd when people like you try to MAKE EXCUSES for it, by telling gays that they can't wear rainbow pins, or that it's okay for anti-gay people to discriminate as long as they take a more creative measure like closing shop, that is SERIOUSLY a demonstration that you are providing an OUT for the anti-gay prejudice.\n\n \n a.) I have not told gays \"they can't wear rainbow pins.\"\n b.) I have not argued it's okay to discriminate via 'creative measure'\n \n You're batting a thousand on these argument misrepresentations today. Are you just not going to represent my points as I make them rather than the spin you try to put on things? It's pretty hard to take your complaints here seriously when you aren't even representing my arguments the way I've argued them.\n \n \nI can give you PLENTY of posters on these threads who BELIEVE that anti-gay prejudice is okay.\n\n \n No, that's not what I said.\n \n READ what I said. You're trying to jump the gate so fast you aren't even paying attention. \n \n \nThey believe SLURRING gays is okay. There's another active thread here where Archie is slurring gays.\n I can bring up Steeeeve's old posts and Ethmi's positions. Easyrider's posts.\n A LOT of people who SUPPORT various forms of anti-gay discrimination!\n\n \n That they \"support\": (or at least don't oppose) SOME form of \"anti-gay\" discrimination doesn't necessarily demonstrate prejudice, Foundit. Nor are prejudice and discrimination synonymous. (Before you CLAFCLOWN, I'm not saying you're saying whatever, so don't start that junk.) Prejudice can be ONE reason for not opposing discrimination. It's not the only one there can be, nor is it necessarily a reason at all. You ALWAYS seem to assume prejudice, never giving the benefit of the doubt on it if someone doesn't oppose discrimination. I find that fascinating.\n \n \nAnd I have told you repeatedly how I define \"prejudice\". It involves a person believing that another group should be discriminated against\n\n \n That's an awfully broad standard for prejudice. Because by it, people are prejudiced against 17 year olds by not letting them marry, as an example. If you're going to have that broad a standard, I'm not sure \"prejudice\" is the best term to use given the negative connotations our culture puts on the term.\n \n \nHere's a challenge Jyoshu.\n Is it bigotry to claim that gays can \"change\" to \"ex-gay\" in grossly exaggerated numbers?\n\n \n I'd say that could be the result of bigotry. Not necessarily bigotry itself.\n \n It seems you take ACTIONS and make them synonymous with terms like \"bigotry\" and \"prejudice.\"\n \n \nSo, YOU want to talk about what is \"truly bigotry\"? Then let's do it!\n\n \n I define it as an irrational view about someone based on a trait. And an intention of ill-will towards them because of something they can't help. That's what I'd consider bigotry. Note that it has nothing to do whatsoever with not opposing the issue of discrimination, because I am convinced that can be the case with or without bigotry.\n \n \nWhat I think is REALLY going on is that you KNOW you're getting yourself back into a situation where YOU are the one playing \"word games\" with your reply, like when you tried to pretend gays \"force\" the religious anti-gay to do something just cause gays are given equal rights.\n\n \n Where have I claimed you are forcing them to do something other than abandoning beliefs to accommodate you? And obviously, that's what would be required if someone's beliefs are that gay marriage shouldn't be legitimate. \n \n \nCLAFCLOW. Your complaint was over the RAINBOW ACCESSORIES they wore.\n\n \n Actually it was the use of the event as a mean to an end for activist purposes. But your characterization of it was \"complaining about gays.\" Glad you've at least changed it somewhat.\n \n Let me quote to you a gem from your VERY FIRST POST in this thread...\n Jyoshu: \"(Not unlike Foundit and others driving some of the anti-gay trolling that we've seen of late.)\"\n \n Well IMO what you did is a pretty big deal, after all. We're talking about a troll who had said some of the nastiest things about gays I've ever read on this forum. And yet you gave the troll more dialog than you are sometimes willing to do with people benign by comparison. Frankly, it's odd.\n \n Show me where you have ACTUALLY COMMENTED on the Masters and Johnson study.\n Wait. Let me guess.\n Another challenge refused... emoticon_rolleyes[/quote]\n \n I commented on it in post 10 of this very thread. That it's scant evidence of what you're accusing M&J of doing. (being liars)\n \n \nJyoshu, I can't help but wonder if you SERIOUSLY don't see how hypocritical you are in your accusations, cause this claim above is EXACTLY what you did in multiple threads.\n One prime example was the \"Ugandan reparative therapy\" thread, where you wandered in, started ATTACKING THE MESSENGERS by complaining they were bloggers and \"activists\", and REFUSED to do any research to figure out if the message was valid or not.\n\n \n Um, no. That's a COMPLETE spin in terms of relating IT to THIS. \n \n That was a case of looking at the people being reported on. It was taking information presented as evidence and ANALYZING it. Had nothing to do with attacking any poster here.\n \n I'm talking about you flat out attacking POSTERS in these THREADS. That's what you do. Not just what they bring forward (which would be completely appropriate). \n \n \nTell you what Jyoshu.\n How about we actually DISCUSS THE TOPIC here???\n\n \n Now you're getting it. \n \n \nI am not of that view.\n Furthermore, after explaining the purpose of my pointing out the history to you TWICE now, I can't help but wonder how the heck you could be still confused on the issue... \n\n \n Then please elaborate on why you brought up those two examples from it's decades-ago history. Because I fully admit I don't yet see your point.\n \n \nCan we quantify it by suicides?\n\n \n Not really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n \n \nCan we quantify it by alcoholism?\n\n \n Not really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n \n \nCan we quantify it by a diagnosis of depression?\n\n \n Not really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n \n \nI am more than happy to quantify / qualify WHY I assess \"harm\" in these cases.\n But I really don't think you want an honest discussion on that.\n\n \n Actually, I'd LOVE to see you explain why this issue is clearcut in terms of why you can attribute harm when most other cases aren't so cut and dry. I'd LOVE to hear where harm begins and where it ends, in regards to this issue. And why would you NOT want to do that? After all, it can only help people to know where to draw the line ...But suspect you can't qualify your subjective assertion with a non-subjective one; that whatever answer you give will STILL beg the question and won't have concretes. So go ahead--let's find out! \n \n \nAnd as I have explained to you repeatedly, I ALSO support pceople being able to \"change\" if they want to.\n \n But like in plastic surgery, the surgeon WARNS THE PATIENT of the risks.\n The surgeon MONITORS the patient afterwards to monitor the success of the procedure.\n WHY doesn't \"Reparative therapy\" do that?\n\n \n So that's it?? All it needs to do is add some warning about the matter and you'll no longer treat RT like it's some kind of Nazi-horror thing? You'll actually leave it alone, at that point??? If that's so, I wish more people in your movement were like you. Because it's tends to get the nasty \"venom treatment\" and well-poinsoning fallacy around here ...\n \n \nI can understand an INFORMED DECISION on that.\n But when the group in question REFUSES TO ADMIT the harms, then how can a patient \"weigh\" the issue of harm ???\n\n \n So if a patient finds that info in other ways (research, for instance), you would support their choice of being in RT? It's interesting, because I suspect most people aren't the out-of-touch simpletons on this issue that you must think they are. They know, deep down, this is probably not going to work the way they hope it will.\n \n \nTell me Jyoshu. If a person in your congregation told you that they were leaving your congregation and undergoing a risky procedure to \"fix\" something you knew didn't need fixing, would you stand by and do nothing?emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I'd respect their choice. And I probably woudn't go trying to dredge up things to use to call the doctors \"LIARS\", either.",

   "It's false because \"but what they really believe\" isn't even CLOSE to being the full story of the position I've taken. You're leaving out so much that it's basically a false claim in terms of what I'm arguing.\n\n 1) Thanks for another item I am bookmarking. It will be reassuring to use your own words to remind you to NOT leave out important details when pretending to summarize my (or other people's) position...\n \n 2) Please elaborate.\n When you start talking about \"but that's what they really believe\", what other significant part of the argument am I leaving out?\n \n \n \nIt's extremely relevant to some people.\n\n When it comes to the ACTION INVOLVED, it is irrelevant.\n Unless we're back to the approach where you try to give \"religious belief\" special privileges for discrimination...\n \n When it comes to discrimination against gays or Jews or blacks, it does not matter what the motive is. It is wrong.\n When it comes to lying about a group, it does not matter what the motive is. It is wrong.\n \n \n \nTo me, intentions are largely what make an action right or wrong.\n\n Can you elaborate?\n If a person wants to discriminate against gays, is it suddenly \"right\" if his motive is _____ ???\n I say no.\n The law does not care what the motive is when it comes to discriminating against gays just because they are gay.\n \n \n \nIt has to do with what's in one's heart on a matter. That's exactly one reason I have no problem with the idea that one can oppose a gay right, and still not be wrong in doing so. \"Wrong\" (in the moralistic sense) depends on an outside standard of morality. Nothing is \"wrong\" or \"right\" as an island. \n\n I can't help but laugh at this.\n Take your ten commandments. Does it matter what the motive is if a person worships another god in violation of the first commandment?\n Does it matter what the motive is if a person takes the Lord's name in vain?\n Does it matter what the motive is if a person bears false witness against a neighbor?\n \n You are talking about MORAL RELATIVITY, and I thought Christian conservatives were supposed to eschew that.\n Oh wait. I forgot.\n When THEY want to excuse THEIR OWN actions, that is when they employ it... emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nNo one's making you respond here. Believe it or not you always have the option of walking away from a comment/ignoring it..\n\n A pointless non-sequitur.\n \n \n \nRight there, your point fails. In a courtroom proof would NEVER rest on the scant evidence the article above presents.\n\n Wow.\n Talk about uprooting the goal-posts and moving them firmly to somewhere else...\n \n I was pointing out why your fixation on the MOTIVES was irrelevant, and you turn around and IGNORE my point and try to apply my analogy to something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...\n \n And the thing you fail to recognize is that it is UP TO THE PEOPLE MAKING THE CLAIM TO PROVE IT.\n Here, the people making the claim about reparative therapy ARE HIDING THE SUPPOSED RESEARCH PROOF which supposedly substantiates their claims...\n \n The people claiming M&J prove something about reparative therapy are the ones who should be providing THAT proof of the validity of M&J.\n And if the shoe were on the other foot, and this were an article regarding a \"religious\" issue, that is EXACTLY the approach you would be taking.\n But since it's a \"gay\" issue, you IGNORE the fact that the anti-gay position has refused to provide proof, and you instead demand the pro-gay position provide proof ... :xbanghead :xbanghead\n \n \n \n(Note: this is me discussing the topic of the thread. So stop putting forth falsehoods that I'm not. No matter that it doesn't fit your narrow view of what discussion should be.)\n\n Jyoshu, you are STARTING TO discuss this thread.\n When I made that observation earlier, it was ENTIRELY TRUE.\n Now, ON THE SECOND PAGE, after being dragged kicking and screaming to the topic, NOW is when you have started to talk about the topic. emoticon_frazzled0\n \n \n \nWOW!!! Apparently you don't realize that determining motive is ALWAYS a factor in determining guilt!!!\n\n You are incredibly wrong.\n Suppose Jack steals a $20 from a cashier.\n Does it matter WHY he did it to decide he was guilty?\n [indent]Proof of a motive is not required for the conviction of a crime. The existence of a motive is immaterial to the matter of guilt when that guilt is clearly established.[/quote]\n Criminal Law - Motives\n \n \n \na.) I have not told gays \"they can't wear rainbow pins.\"\n\n I never said you did.\n You complained about them wearing them nonetheless...\n Do you deny that you complained about gays wearing rainbow pins at the White House Easter function?\n \n \n \nb.) I have not argued it's okay to discriminate via 'creative measure'\n\n You're quibbling over semantics.\n You have stated you think it's okay to discriminate against gays in an action of closing down all service.\n Do you deny the accuracy of this summary?\n \n \n \nNo, that's not what I said.\n\n I am talking to a more important point.\n YOU want to fixate on a more general point, while IGNORING THE FACT that there are numerous people who support discrimination against gays.\n You would LOVE to fixate on the more trivial factors while ignoring the BIGGER PICTURE here...\n \n \n \nThat they \"support\": (or at least don't oppose) SOME form of \"anti-gay\" discrimination doesn't necessarily demonstrate prejudice, Foundit. Nor are prejudice and discrimination synonymous.\n\n And AGAIN, we're back to a realm where you try to EXCUSE anti-gay discrimination cause you want to obfuscate whether or not \"prejudice\" is present.\n \n Jyoshu, the law is clear.\n IT DOES NOT MATTER whether or not \"prejudice\" is present in order for this discrimination to be wrong!\n It has NEVER been required for black discrimination. For Jewish discrimination. Etc, etc, etc...\n So WHY is it important for \"gay discrimination\"???\n \n \n \nPrejudice can be ONE reason for not opposing discrimination.\n\n Wow.\n Talk about moving the goal-posts. AGAIN.\n I point out that members of this forum SUPPORT anti-gay discrimination, and Jyoshu tries to reword things towards \"not opposing discrimination\"... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nIt's not the only one there can be, nor is it necessarily a reason at all. You ALWAYS seem to assume prejudice, never giving the benefit of the doubt on it if someone doesn't oppose discrimination.\n\n Actually, Jyoshu, I FIND MOTIVE TO BE IRRELEVANT to the issue, much like the law does.\n So your claim as to what I \"always do\" is false, considering I am not the one who perpetually tries to drag the conversations towards \"motive\".\n That is YOU.\n \n \n \nThat's an awfully broad standard for prejudice. Because by it, people are prejudiced against 17 year olds by not letting them marry, as an example. If you're going to have that broad a standard, I'm not sure \"prejudice\" is the best term to use given the negative connotations our culture puts on the term.\n\n It's like groundhog day where I repeat myself over and over and over again.\n Part of the point of doing that is to IGNORE the \"negative connotations\", cause they are irrelevant.\n \n If a person thinks that dogs are good, finding a \"mean dog\" does not suddenly mean the animal is not a dog cause it's not good.\n In these discussions, it is shown OVER and OVER and OVER again people balking over admitting they are discriminating or have prejudice just cause they think they are doing a \"good\" thing by discriminating against gays, as opposed to doing a \"bad\" thing by discriminating against blacks. Their own ARBITRARY SUBJECTIVE OPINION is all that negates whether or not it is \"discrimination\" or \"prejudice\", which leads to a pointless standard.\n \n The connotations are MEANINGLESS.\n Furthermore, It is pointless to quibble over the motives, cause the LAW DOES NOT CARE on the issue...\n If you discriminate against a protected attribute, the motive is IRRELEVANT according to the law.\n \n \n \nI'd say that could be the result of bigotry. Not necessarily bigotry itself.\n It seems you take ACTIONS and make them synonymous with terms like \"bigotry\" and \"prejudice.\"\n\n The law doesn't care about the motive.\n You are using the motive as an excuse to ignore the fact that the act of discriminating against gays is wrong regardless of motive.\n \n \n \nI define it as an irrational view about someone based on a trait.\n\n Go figure.\n Cause defining it that way, you get to quibble over \"what is irrational\" and try to excuse discrimination against gays as \"not bigotry\".\n \n There have been THOUSANDS of people in U.S. history who have interpreted their religion (predominantly Christian) to mean that segregation and discrimination against blacks is religiously mandated.\n So in doing that, does it suddenly make it \"right\", since you judge the morality based on motive?\n \n \n \nAnd an intention of ill-will towards them because of something they can't help.\n\n Indifference and ignorance is just as bad as \"ill-will\".\n Just because a person is too ignorant to know what effect they are really having doesn't make it okay.\n It doesn't justify it under the law, and it's irrelevant here.\n \n \n \nNote that it has nothing to do whatsoever with not opposing the issue of discrimination, because I am convinced that can be the case with or without bigotry.\n\n That's contradictory.\n You just got finished trying to establish that \"motive\" was essential to the rightness or wrongness.\n Which is it?\n \n \n \nWhere have I claimed you are forcing them to do something other than abandoning beliefs to accommodate you?\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n I think you just proved my statement.\n And it's CLAFCLOW if you think I need to show what you asked...\n \n \n \nActually it was the use of the event as a mean to an end for activist purposes. But your characterization of it was \"complaining about gays.\" Glad you've at least changed it somewhat.\n\n You were complaining about what the gays were doing.\n Quit trying to take my statement out of context.\n \n And my assessment was accurate. And now you have backed away from it, ignoring the REASONS WHY it was brought up in the first place... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nLet me quote to you a gem from your VERY FIRST POST in this thread...\n Jyoshu: \"(Not unlike Foundit and others driving some of the anti-gay trolling that we've seen of late.)\"\n\n \nWell IMO what you did is ...\n\n And there Jyoshu goes.\n \n Let's recap, shall we?\n Jyoshu complains about what he claims I do.\n I prove HE DOES what he complains about.\n Then instead of denying it, he turns around and tries to JUSTIFY it, thus PERPETUATING WHAT HE COMPLAINED ABOUT in the first place...\n \n Hypocritical is the word you're looking for...\n \n \n \nShow me where you have ACTUALLY COMMENTED on the Masters and Johnson study.\n Wait. Let me guess.\n Another challenge refused... \n\n \nI commented on it in post 10 of this very thread. That it's scant evidence of what you're accusing M&J of doing. (being liars)\n\n So in the FOURTH POST on this thread, you finally get around to commenting on the point...\n \n Furthermore, I think you fail to recognize how things work in the SCIENTIFIC world.\n People claim to do research, yet they REFUSE TO SHARE that research, then they have shown nothing to prove what THEY CLAIM is true.\n \n Let's turn this around, shall we?\n Suppose M&J had claimed that there was a Ugandan conference where some statements were made.\n Another poster, let's call him Jyoshu, comes along and suspects their claims of being inaccurate.\n \n Would you then insist that this poster should have to PROVE that the claims were false??? emoticon_frazzled\n Yeah. You have BIG TIME double-standard problems...\n \n \n \nUm, no. That's a COMPLETE spin in terms of relating IT to THIS. \n That was a case of looking at the people being reported on.\n\n You were looking at the people DOING the reporting.\n NOT the people \"being reported on\".\n \n Nice attempt to completely spin things into nonsense... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nIt was taking information presented as evidence and ANALYZING it. Had nothing to do with attacking any poster here.\n\n You tried to attack their credibility by saying they were \"activist\".\n You WERE attacking the people making the report.\n \n \n \nNow you're getting it. \n\n Jyoshu, I HAVE BEEN TRYING to get you to discuss the topic.\n You did not even TRY until the tenth post into this thread.\n Your FIRST POST included an attack against me.\n \n I am \"getting\" that you started obfuscating the issue, and then tried to blame me for something YOU started...\n \n \n \nThen please elaborate on why you brought up those two examples from it's decades-ago history. Because I fully admit I don't yet see your point.\n\n Wow. Just wow.\n I have explained it to you TWICE now.\n And now you ask for a third time...\n \n Can you please take notes, cause me repeating myself to you is getting REALLY old.\n \n The point is to demonstrate the REAL INTENT and PURPOSE of reparative therapy. That \"gays\" are not at the root of the issue, and helping gays is not the primary impetus for the primary movement.\n \n \n \nNot really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n Not really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n Not really, because those happen all the time for many unrelated reasons.\n\n I think you're missing a HUGE point here Jyoshu, and I really don't find it surprising cause if this were a REAL therapy situation, the issue would be clear-cut...\n \n Suppose Jack is going to a therapist to get help.\n Jack develops depression / alcoholism / suicide.\n The REAL therapist would then try to HELP Jack.\n \n But with the \"reparative therapy\", the therapist is absent. The therapist refuses to address the issue as to whether his previous \"therapy\" lead to the detriment of the patient.\n Reparative therapy IS NOT THERAPY, cause REAL therapy puts the PATIENT first.\n Reparative therapy DISCARDS the patient out of convenience. \n \n I am reminded of the Zach Stark issue, where he was told by one of the counselors that the counselor would RATHER SEE ZACH DEAD than see him go back to being gay. \n \n A REAL therapist would have a problem performing a therapy AGAINST THE PATIENTS WISHES.\n \n \n \nActually, I'd LOVE to see you explain why this issue is clearcut in terms of why you can attribute harm when most other cases aren't so cut and dry.\n\n Is testimony from the patient sufficient for you to establish cause and effect?\n Is that enough for you?\n \n \n \nSo that's it?? All it needs to do is add some warning about the matter and you'll no longer treat RT like it's some kind of Nazi-horror thing?\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n How many times do I have to remind you that there are LAYERS to the issue???\n \n The therapists misrepresenting things by not informing their patients of the full problem is one of the bigger problems.\n \n With that eliminated, there are other issues like the therapists should not coerce their patients, or be a part of coercing their patients. The therapist should HAVE A LICENSE to practice therapy. \n There's a list here. I know I've mentioned this junk to you before.\n \n \n \nYou'll actually leave it alone, at that point???\n\n No. I never implicated I would.\n \n \n \nSo if a patient finds that info in other ways (research, for instance), you would support their choice of being in RT?\n\n No.\n Why are you asking me all these stupid questions, pretending that I only have \"one\" problem when I never pretended that there was ONLY \"one\" problem.\n It's a trick you keep trying, and it's really old.\n \n \n \nTell me Jyoshu. If a person in your congregation told you that they were leaving your congregation and undergoing a risky procedure to \"fix\" something you knew didn't need fixing, would you stand by and do nothing?\n\n \nI'd respect their choice.\n\n That's all you're going to say?\n Cause in the end, I would respect their wishes also.\n \n But there would be a lot more to the situation from me before that, out of an interest of a friend protecting another.\n I guess other people aren't as interested in protecting their friends...",
