   "The Democratic candidates are most a bunch of XXXXXX.\n From Al Sharpton - No political history, dropped out of college\n To Kucinich - Was against removing Taliban and says he would pull troops our of Iraq immediatley\n \n Wesley Clark has no real political experince. Being a good leader does not make you a good president. Just last April he was praising the Bush Administration.\n \n Deans anti war position as well as his comments about the Confederate flag and that Hammas were soldiers that were fighting in a war, he established himself as someone I would not vote for.\n \n Enough slamming the Democrats:\n Onto the good ones\n \n Gephardt - I have no problems with him. He actaully has political expereince.\n \n Lieberman - I support Lieberman above all. I agree with the majority of his policies from what I have seen. In interviews I have seen he is more straight forward than most politicans and I think he stands behind his policies not for political reasons but rather becuase he beleives in them. \n \n \n What are your thoughts? Who is best fit to become the next president of the United States? Who has the best bet at beating Bush?\n \n (By the way, I would vote for Bush probably over every candidate except Gephardt and Lieberman)",

I tend to like Lieberman and Edwards and I definetly think they have the best chance against Bush. Lieberman is a moderate and he believes in a strong defense which really resonates with the south, and John Edwards is southern. The last non-southern president was JFK, and that was a pretty long time ago if I remember correctly.",

   "As the mess in Iraq and the \"intelligence\" (or lack thereof) questions are answered, you are going to see more Americans, even republicans, starting to question the president. \n \n Howard dean was pretty consistent on the anti-war issue. Right from the start he called it a bad idea. Dean is also light on gun control (Look at Vermonts gun laws).\n \n I would have voted for Dean. Now my vote would have to swing back to Bush. Kerry is too \"progressive\", and he seems to have the same type of selective memory that Clinton had. \n \n I know that the media was pretty tough on dean over his excited speach after the primary. I know that particular speach scored him a lot of points with some folks. Maybe it is time to have a president with some personality who is willing (and actually able) to get excited.\n \n Abortion and affirmative action have kind of lost their wind. We (conservatives) lost. There are going to be bigger issues in the upcoming election. Right now, Kerry sems to be running a pretty good campaign ( based ont he poll numbers I just heard on MSNBC) based on his war record and by questioning bush's national gaurd service. Give it some time. Once bush actually goes on the offensive, there are too many chinks in kerrys armor for him to win.",
