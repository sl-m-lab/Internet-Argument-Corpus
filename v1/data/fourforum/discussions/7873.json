   "I think I've figured out why life has been so difficult lately.\n \n I'm struggling to keep a faith alive inside of me that has no reason to exist. I grew up in church, come from a strong Christian family, my mother was a church secretary for a total of 9 years at two different churchs, I've been to every kind of protestant church, retreat, sunday school, and everything. My father was semi-abusive to me verbally, mother and sister physically.....he always taught me to keep an open mind...and he hated church.. I've seen the dark side of churchs, the money thieving, lying, deceit, the bad things pastors have done.....manipulated.....I've been through divorce that was extremely ugly that left me with no one at all except a few friends and my mother for about 2 years....I've been through several suicidal phases, I've tried the cutting thing, I've gone through the partying, the girls, some drugs(marijuana), my friends I've picked up from beatings from their dads....a couple best friends to jail....best friends and DUIs.....a best friend committed suicide a couple months ago....and I've got a DUI a month ago...and all I ever see is a bunch of hypocrites in the church.....\n \n With all that said....I don't know.....faith is the foundation for a belief in God...I'm in college...and I've taken ancient History classes: How man created God......i've been through biology classes...man came from monkey.....and everything else....\n \n I have every reason not to believe in God and all the bogus politics behind it.....I hate organized religion because so many people corrupt it....especially some pastors I know...\n \n I don't know..maybe it has become so ingrained in me that I simply can't erase it......it would be a relief not to believe in God, Heave, Hell, and especially judgement......\n \n I know this isn't my own personal my space blog thing..but I just have to get it out...and be anonymous about it I guess....so many things can be explained away with out God in the equation.....except this....",

   "Sorry to here that BP. Sounds like you could do with some help. Have you thought about going to see doctor? I don't know much about mental health (though my wife suffers from clinical depression) but checking whether you need professional help won't hurt. If you have a pastor or priest you trust and can talk to, then all the better. I've always found university chaplains to be a good bunch, you might try one of them if your're in college.",

   "I don't blame you for feeling slicked over with the oil of religion. It's gotten out of hand, no doubt. But, like jyoshu, I've been there myself. It's not easy being on the downside of faith; living with the fact that if God really wanted to He could pull you out. After all, haven't you been more faithful than some folks you know that are apparently living well?\n But life is just life. What happens to us most of the time is what we've done or not done. We want to blame something or someone else, but in the end the mirror is the only way to find the culprit.\n \n Don't be so quick to look for something or someone else - look inside. Discover the source at its core, then deal with it from there. God is the greatest listener I know, but if you feel unsure, full of doubt and fear, then you can always consult a counselor of some type. Don't just let it fester, though, because the little things will eventually get to you.\n \n I sincerely hope you find peace.",
