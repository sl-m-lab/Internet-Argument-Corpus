   "Most of their mothers died giving birth or soon after - something that, in poor countries, leaves newborns at great risk of dying, too. The children are here just temporarily, to get a start in life so they can return to their villages and their extended families when they are 2 or 3 years old, well past the fragile days of infancy and big enough to digest cow's milk and eat regular food.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/africa/25orphan.html\n \n But they are not fetuses, alas, so who gives a damn?\n \nBEREGA, Tanzania - A handwritten ledger at the hospital tells a grim story. For the month of January, 17 of the 31 minor surgical procedures here were done to repair the results of \"incomplete abortions.\" A few may have been miscarriages, but most were botched operations by untrained, clumsy hands.\n \n Abortion is illegal in Tanzania (except to save the mother's life or health), so women and girls turn to amateurs, who may dose them with herbs or other concoctions, pummel their bellies or insert objects vaginally. Infections, bleeding and punctures of the uterus or bowel can result, and can be fatal. Doctors treating women after these bungled attempts sometimes have no choice but to remove the uterus.\n \n Pregnancy and childbirth are among the greatest dangers that women face in Africa, which has the world's highest rates of maternal mortality - at least 100 times those in developed countries. Abortion accounts for a significant part of the death toll.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/health/02abort.html\n \n But here we are talking about subhuman women whose only role in life is to serve as the vessel for the precious fetus.",

But in Tanzania, which has neither the worst nor best medical care in Africa, but is similar to many poor countries, everything is in short supply: doctors, nurses, drugs, equipment, ambulances and paved roads. By the time many women get to the 120-bed hospital here, it is too late to save them.\n\n Botched abortions are one of the causes of death, but the primary causes of death are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure and prolonged labor.\n \n And, if abortion were safe and legal and offered as an option during the early term of a pregnancy, particularly in the case of young girls, that cause of death would be dramatically reduced.",
