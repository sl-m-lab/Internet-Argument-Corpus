It's not as if we send over a check in the mail- \"pay to the order of- Iraq\" no, our government sets up and signs contracts with different firms and companies that will go to Iraq and ply their various trades. I might be able to get a breakdown of expenditures, ($10 billion in health care, $12 billion in telecommunications, etc) But where would I get a list of what contracts are up for bids, which ones have already been signed, what companies are looking to profit from this rebuilding effort? If anyone has a clue as to where (specifically) our tax dollars are going, I would be greatly interested.",

They know exactly where most of the money will go. :) As for those contracts which were \"bidded\" on it was open to only American companies so that should narrow it down quite a bit. All of the best deals went to Haliburton of course.",
