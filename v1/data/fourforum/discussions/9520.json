If the killing is the means of preventing the spread of immorality, then the killing is morally upstanding.\n\n Not necessarily.\n \n Lets put in terms of something that doesn't have moral weight-\n If your tooth is rotting and will cause other teeth in your mouth to rot, it is necessary to forcibly remove the tooth. Simply because it is the necessary course of action doesn't make it something the person wants to experience. They would just want to experience their teeth rotting out of their head less than a single tooth being removed.",

   "I'm not sure why you see a bigger problem. Understand, I'm not trying to claim that all moral decisions can be reached in an objective manner, that all moral questions have one correct answer. I'm saying there's an underlying principle which gives rise to a few absolutes. These give guidelines for determining the morality of something, and for providing common ground for discussion, but there's still plenty of grey space there.\n\n \n What's the point if we can't figure it out? I believe if there are moral absolutes, they are divinic and therefore we cannot know them. Thus our existance is based around relative morals. \n \n \nAnd as for whom something is good or bad for: people. I'm not sure where that isn't clear for you. If you're asking if certain groups of people should count differently, then the answer is no.\n\n \n But who's good do we use, that's my point. Most things in life are zero sum. Trying to determine a moral absolute based on that is quite impossible. How can we make absolutes when one will suffer and one will benefit? \n \n \nNet morally bad, you mean? Depends on how much evil. Killing to prevent jay walking? Bad. Killing to prevent genocide, good. In either case the killing, in and of itself, would be bad. But the morality of preventing genocide would make the later case net morally good.\n\n \n Then you admit we the moral absolute of not killing is not absolute.

Good. You don't, however, see any use to this concept. Let's see if I can change your mind. \n \n The reason I see value here is that it provides common ground for discussion. If you follow the relativist camp, then it's basically impossible to comment intelligently on anyone's morals. If someone claims that they're acting on moral principles, all you can do is shrug and say, \"well, if you say so\". The \"honor killings\" of the muslims was raised as an example of this. My instinct, and I doubt I'm alone here, is to say those killings have nothing to do with morals, they're just misogyny. Instinctively this makes sense, but without a real moral framework there's no way to show this. But if we acknowledge the basic principles of morality, \"help, don't harm\" and recognize that some actions are always wrong, and should only be performed when a greater good can be demonstrated, then we have a real basis for saying that killing a girl because you don't like who she's dating is not moral.\n \n These concepts can also be used to focus debate. NOT that I want to get into the debate here, but let's take abortion. I'm sure you've seen one side chanting \"pro life\" and the other \"pro choice\", and no actual progress being made in the discussion. That's because they aren't even talking about the same points. But if we apply the moral absolutes, it becomes a little clearer. We shouldn't kill, that's a given. So then the question becomes, are we actually killing? At what point does an embryo cease being a thing and start becoming a moral agent? Not something I want to go into here, but at least this allows you to focus the debate into a region where some progress might be possible.\n \n Bascially, what I'm trying to illustrate here is that acknowleding that there are some moral absolutes gives us a framework that allows us to discuss morals in a rational and meaningful way. Without some sort of common ground then the concept of morality is nigh on meaningless. If morals are relative, if there is nothing at all absolute about them, then anyone can call anything moral without any sort of backing; there would be moral chaos. The fact that people, for the most part, do have a lot of moral common ground indicates that this isn't the case; we do have a common basis for morality, at least to some degree. Exploring that common ground allows us to seperate the wheat from the chaff, the real morals from that which is merely posing as morality. The common ground does exist, and it didn't come from God. We developed it, and we can examine and analyze it. And by doing so we can, hopefully, become more moral.",
