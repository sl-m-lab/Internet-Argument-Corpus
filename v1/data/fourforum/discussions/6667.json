General Motors, Delphi, and now Ford are all in the same predicament. As to the issue of the Minimum wage, it's meant to be a starting wage, so that workers can advance. \n\n \n Wow, it would be nice to live in a such a simple world. \n \n If lgacy cost swere all that was killing Ford and GM, it would be simple. Break th unions back, make the cuts thsat have to be done, and let the halls run with blood. \n \n Unfortunatly Ford and GM are not just dealing with legacy costs. They are also dealing with stagnant product lines, a poor reputation for quality, and a nearly complete detachment from reality when it comes to their offerings. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is that for the last 20 years, while the japanese built a reputation ofr quality and longevity for their products, American companies were busy trying to figure out how to maximize their profits by selling garbage at inflated prices. The American public does not forget such things quickly. When polled about what brand of auto is the most reliable, over 80% of americans name either toyota or honda. That is a tough nut to crack, and that is 100% the fault of US automotive makers. In the last 5 years, they have made leaps and bounds forward in product design and have worked very hard to improve quality. In another 20 years, assuming they survive that long, they may be seen as the eqaul to the japanese makers in quality. \n \n Other industries haev the same problem. For machine tools, nobody looks to America for quality tools anymore. We look to europe. It kills me to have to purchase German Lathes and Italian milling machines, becuase at one time America made the best on the planet. In the modern world, the American machines are decidedly second rate and overpriced. Only a fool buys American made tooling anymore. \n \n The rediculous wage cost we see are (as Simone correctly notes) not just the result fo greedy workers, but an effect of padding the margins in our industry a little too well. When your compnay is runnign a 40% profit margin, you tend to gwet workers who want a little more, and a little more, and a little more. They need it becuase with all that money flowing into the country, real cost of living increases quickly (real world, bottom line....inflation in the US in the last 50 years is nothing to laugh at). That is just part of the process of a nation becoming wealthy. Unfortunatly, we are now on the backside of that, and our cost of living is essentially a set cost, but our companies are uncompetitive paying even the lower end of our wage scale. \n \n What it boils down to is that in order to be a leader in business, you have to be able to either provide better goods than the competition, or deliver them cheaper. Unfortunatly better goods requires signifcant outlay in capital for R&D and product design and development. We in the US chose not to make those investments, instead using that money to line our already bloated pockets. Since we are knocked cleanly out of the \"better product\" category, and not even able to touch the realm of \"more innovative product\", we are having to compete for producing the cheaper product, and with out standard of living, we are uncompetitive in that area. \n \n We are nto talking about needing somethign so simple as a minor wage adjustment. We are talking an across the board reduction in our standard of living. If a guy in india who does your job lives in a 1 bedroom apartment in a tenant slum, you should expect to end up in a 1 bedroom apartment in a tenant slum. We have managed to keep a false standard of living up through teh accumulation of debt, but that gravy train is derailing.",

Few Americans realize how rapidly our society is eliminating the middle class producers and replacing them with a middle class of bureaucrats who now have the most powerful US labor union. Wealthy folks aren't going to suffer, taxes are fine if they keep general society pacified and in control, so guess what's below the new middle class of tax paid employees? The low tier of society managed by the government. \n \n I recall Bassman stating he drives a truck as his contribution to the US economy. Looking at what a truck driver makes in other high population, labor competitive nations with service economies attempting to service abnormal government debt will provide a degree of focus for consideration.",
