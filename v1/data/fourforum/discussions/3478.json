   "Learn the facts about homosexuality and the Bible. The truth will set you free.\n \n John 5:39; 8:32: Jesus said, \"You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; but it is these that bear witness of me... You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.\"\n \n Jesus frequently showed how the Bible had been used incorrectly to hurt people. See Matthew 5:17-48. Here Jesus said that he had come to fulfill the Law, not that he had come to force you to keep the Law! In this passage Jesus corrected several mistakes in the Old Testament by saying repeatedly, \"you have heard it said, but I say unto you.\" Things that Jesus corrected were based on quotations from the Bible. Jesus corrected mistakes in the Bible. \n \n Jesus spent most of his time dealing with abusive and oppressive religion and showing how he had come to replace law with love. He taught his disciples to think objectively and logically about their relationships with God and with other people.\n \n The \"burden of proof\" concerning Bible condemnation and rejection of gay people is upon those who use incorrectly translated and out-of-context passages to hurt people who were not intended in the original texts. Frequently I have been asked to prove that the Bible does not condemn homosexuals. That question is backwards.\n \n No word for \"homosexual\" exists in biblical languages. No reference to sexual orientation exists in the Bible. The 6 Bible passages used against gays are either translated incorrectly or taken out of their correct setting of condemning idolatrous religious practices and applied incorrectly to people of the same sex who love each other. The Bible nowhere condemns love, affection or sex between people who love each other. No word for \"sex\" exists in the Bible. \n \n When the verses that are used to condemn people for their sexual orientation are examined carefully in context and with the accepted methods of academic research and logic, there is no evidence that the Bible says that homosexuals are evil and hated and rejected by God. No evidence exists in the Bible to prove God's rejection of gays. The case against gays and lesbians is \"dismissed for a lack of evidence.\"\n \n Jesus never mentioned homosexuals or any issue related to sexual orientation. If you follow Jesus, you accept everyone equally. Jesus is proof that God loves and accepts all people including you . \n \n \n Excert from: http://www.truluck.com/html/step_6.html",

However, I do not believe that engaging in behavior that is unnatural, immoral, and dangerous both to public health and to their own health is the best thing for people with same-sex attractions.\n\n \n There isn't anything that resembles love in any post about homosexuality or to homosexuals that I have seen of your's.\n \n It's not loving to misuse informationa and misinform. Promiscuity can lead health problems. If gayness alone were a health issue, lesbians would not be at the bottom of the STD and AIDS pile. (As in straight sex is more of a public health issue than lesbian sex...) If you want sex to not be a public health problem - encourage people to be safe - don't tell them who to sleep with.\n \n Nor is it loving to rant and judge when you are no better. It is not loving for you to tell them how they feel and why they feel the way they do (i.e., the idea that they choose these feelings). It is not loving to deny them secular rights based on faith they may not share. It will not win you brownie points in heaven to make them do what you think God wants them to do. It is up to them to take care of their relationship with God - or not. None of your business. If you feel they are a threat to your faith, then keep away. If you feel you should tell them what you believe the Bible says, that is fine as well. ANYTHING beyond that is WAY WAY WAY WAY out of line and comes from a place way darker than the word of God known as Jamaan's own personal prejudice.\n \n The most loving example I have ever seen in this world is gay man. He volunteers extensively, shares everything he has, helps anyone who asks, is always polite, will always listen, will tell you what he thinks - even if it's in disagreement with you - in a gentle and respectful manner. He never puts down those he opposes. He never yells. He never resorts to violence. \n \n In my life - he helps around the house, fixes my car, has given me open use of his cabin, got me a second job, buys my son whatever he needs, is there whenever I need him and has taken on the full responsibilities of being father to a fatherless boy. He exemplifies the true meaning of \"Love thy Neighbor\" better than any right wing, flag waving, gay-hating \"Christian\" I have seen.\n \n How dare you rant and then say it is out of love! Do you think people are stupid? Don't you think gay people know what love feels like? I know if I sat on the judged end of your posts, I would never believe you had anything but derision in your heart.\n \n Spend a day with my gay friend and you will actually learn what love means.",

   "joe, the bible does say that it is an abomination for a man to lay with a man as with a woman. this is precisely what homosexuality is\n\n \n Being gay is a man lying with a man, not a man lying with a man as he would lay with a woman. You're not having sex with a woman if you're a gay man, so you will not be laying with a man as with a woman. The verse could be saying not to lay with a man in the same way you lay with a woman. \n \n Some believe in selective principles\n By John Tally\n This article appeared recently in the Austin American Statesman. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n With publicity over gay marriages, the debate over homosexuality and the Bible once again fills the radio talk-show airwaves. \n \n Many of the hosts support gay marriages, but biblical arguments favoring the Christian fundamentalist cause go unchallenged. The debate usually goes something like this. \n \n HOST: So what's wrong with two loving, committed men or women being legally married? \n \n CALLER: The Bible says homosexuality is a sin. \n \n HOST: So you believe everything in the Bible is literally true? \n \n CALLER: Yes. \n \n HOST: Then you believe it's a sin to eat pork or shellfish, or for a man to shave his beard, and that those who work on the Sabbath should be put to death? \n \n CALLER: No, the coming of Jesus brought a New Covenant which freed us from those rules of the Old Testament. \n Score one for the fundamentalist. \n \n But with a few hours of Bible reading, the host could unmask the ever-popular New Covenant argument for what it really is: a justification for selective prejudice. \n \n HOST: But even under Christ's New Covenant, the New Testament is still the literal word of God isn't it? \n \n CALLER: Certainly. \n \n HOST: So you believe anyone who marries after divorce commits adultery (Mark 10:11); that women must remain silent, not teach, and have no authority over men (1Tim 2:11); and that slaves must obey their masters at all times (Col. 3:22). \n \n CALLER: Well . . . \n \n HOST: And if the New Covenant freed us from the regulations of the Old Testament, doesn't that do away with all three of its anti-gay passages ? \n \n CALLER: Um . . . no . . . the New Covenant primarily did away with the strict dietary and health rules, not the moral laws, of the Old Testament. \n \n HOST: So when Leviticus prescribes death for all adulterers and for all who curse their parents just before it prescribes the same penalty for any man who lies with another man, each of those moral laws applies to us today? \n \n CALLER: Well . . . I didn't say that . . . \n \n HOST: And when Deuteronomy prescribes death for nonvirgin brides shortly before it claims no homosexual shall be a son of Israel, you agree with both those moral laws? \n \n CALLER: Well, of course not . . . \n \n HOST: So you DO pick and choose which parts of the Bible to believe. \n Since fundamentalists are rarely confronted with these and other troubling Biblical passages, most sincerely think they believe every word of the Bible. \n \n When has Jerry Falwell called for the stoning for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Pete and Gayle Wilson, and everyone else who has remarried after divorce? \n \n When has the Christian Coalition ever organized to ban women from teaching positions and from elected office? \n \n No, it's selective prejudice and old-fashioned fear of the unknown that motivates fundamentalists to target gays and lesbians. Biblical principle has nothing to do with it. Take away the phony claim to a literal view of the Bible, and the religious argument against homosexuality falls like a house of cards. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n John Tally is a San Francisco attorney. \n \n This column was first published in the San Francisco Examiner.\n \n \n \nchristians are not taught to hate people, they are taught to hate disobedience to God's instructions. therefore they dont hate homosexuals, they hate homosexuality. there is a very distinct difference\n\n \n The key word from your perspective seems to be hate. You don't hate someone, you just hate everything about that person that makes that person, different. If homosexuals were straight, you'd have no problem at all.",

Frequently I have been asked to prove that the Bible does not condemn homosexuals. That question is backwards.\n \n No word for \"homosexual\" exists in biblical languages. No reference to sexual orientation exists in the Bible. The 6 Bible passages used against gays are either translated incorrectly or taken out of their correct setting of condemning idolatrous religious practices and applied incorrectly to people of the same sex who love each other. The Bible nowhere condemns love, affection or sex between people who love each other. No word for \"sex\" exists in the Bible. \n \n When the verses that are used to condemn people for their sexual orientation are examined carefully in context and with the accepted methods of academic research and logic, there is no evidence that the Bible says that homosexuals are evil and hated and rejected by God. No evidence exists in the Bible to prove God's rejection of gays. The case against gays and lesbians is \"dismissed for a lack of evidence.\"\n \n Jesus never mentioned homosexuals or any issue related to sexual orientation. If you follow Jesus, you accept everyone equally. Jesus is proof that God loves and accepts all people including you . \n \n \n Excert from: http://www.truluck.com/html/step_6.html\n\n \n \n I don't have a lot of time but the word \"homosexuality\" didn't exist until like the 1950's. I'll have to research it again. I know it is fairly recent by a scientist. So how can he use a word 2000 yrs ago that didn't exist? also Christ condemn people's ignorance of the law not the law itself. I'll get back on the rest later.",

I only use these examples to show that science, in my opinion, should not guide morality. Science should do what it does best--learn and discover about how things work.

What do you care if religious-based prejudice against gays results in discrimination against them or even violence?\n\n \n I take it you expect everyone to accept your view of what constitutes 'discrimination' against gay people. Are you open to any other ideas on that? I think I've made it clear here that I would be open to making sure you aren't discriminated against through civil unions, and I am certainly against violence against gay people or anyone else. Frankly, you seem somewhat hostile toward Christian thinking.\n \n \nI didn't claim it is. Morality, in my opinion, has to do with what harms or benefits society\n\n \n Ok, that's a valid standard and view of morality. But there are plenty of people that are not convinced that homosexual relations are not harmful to society. It seems that everytime homosexuality in our society is related to problems, the gay lobby tends to point to other things as the scapegoat, often even those that don't condone homosexuality. In the 80s, it was AIDS. Rather than simply accepting that homosexuality had a huge effect with this in the 80s, often \"homophobia\" is blamed or society at large for making gays prone to illicit relationships without exercising caution. Why should it have been Reagan's fault for not educating enough (for instance) when it quickly became obvious that gay people had the highest rates of AIDS? (They still do here in the U.S.) Why should gay people not be held accountable for things like that? Why pass the buck?",

Homosexuality itself isn't connected to AIDS and has no \"effect on it\", as you say. Unprotected sex is connected to AIDS, whether the partners are same or different sex. However, perhaps I misunderstood and you didn't mean it that way.\n \n There are many groups which would seem to statistically speaking, be at increased risk for AIDS in the U.S., such as those living in poverty or African Americans. Blaming the victims in one group for this awful disease, is not showing much compassion or much \"class\", if that is how you are saying homosexuality is harmful to society.\n \n There are many reasons why some groups may have higher numbers. We could look at self-esteem issues, and the supports or lack of, for gay people and gay relationships. If you're gay, and you grow up being taught that you are not accepted being gay, and God hates your being gay, how would you get the right information and make positive decisions about your gay life?",

Just because gay men have the highest numbers of HIV/AIDS infections doesn't mean that it only effect gay men. No one is immune to HIV, not even you. You may have a low risk factor, but you're not immune. \n \n It's just that sort of mentality which allows hatred to remain and gain momentum. \n \n Because society does indeed proliferate the idea that gay men and lesbians can't have lifelong loving, committed relationships is exactly why gay men and lesbians do. \n If there is no motivation to stop a kind of behavior that behavior will continue. Just saying \"because it's sinful\" doesn't do it. Too many other societally accepted behaviors are concidered sinful for that sort of attitude to have any affect at all. \n Insted, accept lifelong committed relationships, encourage monogomous relationships among gay men and lesbians. Accept and promote gay marriage. \n It's the ONLY way to make being overtly sexually active with a multitude of partners, seem out of fashion.\n Promote healthy relationships over risky behavior.\n It's really fairly simple.",

   "It doesn't seem to be working with gay men, given that they have, by far, the highest rates of HIV infection.\n\n \n It is among those gay men who lessen their risks. How do you feel about the heterosexual increases. How do you feel about the rapid increases among women I pointed to from 2001 to 2003? Heterosexuals are also less likely to be tested for HIV.\n \n \nIt would eliminate the biggest spreading factor here in the U.S. The statistics don't lie. Why would you not be in favor of saving lives?\n\n \n There are many factors, which have already been discussed, here and on other threads. Heterosexual numbers are catching up. It historically spread most in the gay male population in the U.S., because they were the most unlikely to use condoms. Condoms in the past were mainly used to prevent pregnancy. They still are largely used for this.\n \n \nAs you undoubtedly know, the problem ultimately is promiscuity and the fact that this is a major problem among gay men.\n\n \n I don't know that, neither do you. One could be promiscous and still protect one's self against HIV. One could be less promiscuous, and still get HIV by not using protection. Reducing the number of parterns however, is just one way to lower the risk. Many of the surveys which would seem to indicate promiscuity among gay men are taken among gay singles bar patrons. That isn't a representative sample.\n \n \nLike it or not, it seems that being gay includes, in many cases, a promiscuous lifestyle. You probably don't like to hear that, but it certainly seems to be the case.\n\n \n What I hear is my straight friends remarking about how my partner and myself have been together for six years, meanwhile they have had several relationships, and sometimes they don't use condoms. \n \n \nYou can go through the usual routine of blaming everyone but gay people (homophobia, society at large, parents of gay kids, etc.) but ultimately gay men are going to have to take responsibility for themselves and their actions.\n\n \n Every individual should take responsibility for his or her actions. However, neither does the individual live in a vacuum.\n \n \nIt's not rocket science. If I had a teenage son who I knew was risk to get HIV due to promiscuous sex, I would encourage him to not be promiscuous and stop this part of the gay lifestyle, rather than \"have all the promiscuous sex you want just try to remember to use some protection.\"\n\n \n It's still important for him to be educated about how best to have protected sex. I fear you are moralizing, and that won't necessarily protect him. You are also generalizing about the \"gay lifestyle\". There is no \"gay lifestyle\". There are many different lifestyles among gays, just as there are among straights. \n \n \nI would say that maybe marriage might be the answer, but gay people have had plenty of time to incorporate monogamy into their relationships, and they haven't for the most part.

You are trying to demonize gay men as dirty and immoral and promiscuos. Rates among gay men have overall actually decreased dramatically since HIV/AIDS first made its appearance in the U.S., due to increased condom use.\n \n Marriage and openly comitted relationships are also about social recognition and support, and about role models.

Those who say the Bible doesn't condemn homosexuality itself, are looking at the context in which certain specific acts of a same-sex nature are condemned. Such as those associated with rape, exploitation, prostitution, or idol worship. Such things are wrong, gay or straight. Paul chose not to use the commonly known Greek word for male homosexuals, which would have made a condemnation against homosexuality clear. Nowhere are loving, equal, comitted gay relationships condemned. Others may argue that it's ambiguous that the Bible supported such relationships, either. People didn't have the complex understanding of sexuality that we have today. They didn't have a complex understanding of many things, such as related to gender equality and slavery. \n \n Those who argue with your interpreation are also looking at the fact that there have been many different translations of the Bible.

He taught his disciples to think objectively and logically about their relationships with God and with other people.\n \n The \"burden of proof\" concerning Bible condemnation and rejection of gay people is upon those who use incorrectly translated and out-of-context passages to hurt people who were not intended in the original texts. Frequently I have been asked to prove that the Bible does not condemn homosexuals. That question is backwards.\n \n No word for \"homosexual\" exists in biblical languages. No reference to sexual orientation exists in the Bible. The 6 Bible passages used against gays are either translated incorrectly or taken out of their correct setting of condemning idolatrous religious practices and applied incorrectly to people of the same sex who love each other. The Bible nowhere condemns love, affection or sex between people who love each other. No word for \"sex\" exists in the Bible. \n \n When the verses that are used to condemn people for their sexual orientation are examined carefully in context and with the accepted methods of academic research and logic, there is no evidence that the Bible says that homosexuals are evil and hated and rejected by God. No evidence exists in the Bible to prove God's rejection of gays. The case against gays and lesbians is \"dismissed for a lack of evidence.\"\n \n Jesus never mentioned homosexuals or any issue related to sexual orientation. If you follow Jesus, you accept everyone equally. Jesus is proof that God loves and accepts all people including you . \n \n \n Excert from: http://www.truluck.com/html/step_6.html\n\n \n I thought I would go back to post #1 for this thread for my comments. I believe the bible does say that homosexuality is wrong behavior. It also says the same of lying, cheating, getting more for something than it is worth, etc. \n \n The bible is also extremely clear on this point, \"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\" Condemnation is not meant for the christian to engage in. EVER!\n \n Homosexual men and women have a tough enough time in this world without us christians dumping our brand of legalism and bigotry on them. A person who is gay will need love, comfort, and caring in this world.\n \n Does that mean that God says it is not a sin. NO. It means that God's son went to the cross because HE believed they were worthy. If there was one person on the planet, Jesus would have died on the cross for that person. It is the length, depth, breadth of His love. It is true whether that one person is gay or simply a liar. There are far more of the latter in the world than the former.\n \n EF",

Besides, it's one of those vague words that gets thrown around with no established boundaries of what it means with everyone.\n\n \n \n I don't mean to interupt here, but I just couldn't help myself when I read your second sentance in the above quote. \n If people care so passionately about \"the institution of marriage\" why work so hard to destroy it? \n Why work so hard to deny said \"institution\" to others? \n I really hate to break the news to you, but in all reality we're on the same team here. You want to promote healthy monogomous relationships as do I. I believe longterm commitment should be honnored and not trivialized, as I'm sure you do as well. \n But insted you and many others accuse the GLBT community of wanting to somehow destroy the \"institution of marriage\". \n Honey, I keep telling you. Only those who are married are able to destroy marriage. \n For centuries the straight community has done a bang up job at trivializing and making a mockery out of marriage. \n I can only assume that the straight community is quite proud of that longstanding tradition.\n \n \n Pitiful.",
