The only diffrence I see between Communism and Facsim is that one has a group of dictators the other has only one.\n\n \n Most leftists today are too dumbed down, or just willfully ignorant of radical islam's participation in the holocaust and violent opposition against the West during WW2. Here's an excerpt from the link which connects the dots of this evil relationship.\n \n \nHistory shows Al Husseini to be a brutal man with aspirations to rule a pan-Arabic empire in the Middle East. He rose to prominence by actively eliminating those Jews and Arabs he considered a threat to his control of Jerusalem's Arab population, and he heavily utilized anti-Jewish propaganda to polarize the two communities.\n \n In 1920 and again in 1929, Al Husseini incited anti-Jewish riots by claiming the Jews were plotting to destroy the Al Asqa mosque. The riots resulted in the massacre of hundreds of Jewish civilians and a virtual end to the Jewish presence in Hebron.\n \n The 1936 Arab revolt against the British is believed to have been at least partially funded by Nazi Adolf Eichmann, and Al Husseini again ordered armed Arab militias to massacre Jewish citizens.\n \n When British authorities finally quelled the rebellion in 1939, Al Husseini fled to neighboring Iraq and helped to orchestrate a 1941 anti-British jihad. As in Jerusalem, the British successfully put down the rebellion and Al Husseini fled to Nazi Germany.\n \n Al Husseini found the Nazis to be a strong ideological match with his anti-Jewish brand of Islam, and schemed with Hitler and the Nazi hierarchy to create a pro-Nazi pan-Arabic form of government in the Middle East.\n \n Dr. Serge Trifkovic documents the similarities between Al Husseini's brand of radical Islam and Nazism in his book The Sword of the Prophet. He noted parallels in both ideologies: anti-Semitism, quest for world dominance, demand for the total subordination of the free will of the individual, belief in the abolishment of the nation-state in favor of a \"higher\" community (in Islam the umma or community of all believers; in Nazism, the herrenvolk or master race), and belief in undemocratic governance by a \"divine\" leader (an Islamic caliph, or Nazi f\u00fchrer).\n \n The Nazis provided Al Husseini with luxurious accommodations in Berlin and a monthly stipend in excess of $10,000. In return, he regularly appeared on German radio touting the Jews as the \"most fierce enemies of Muslims,\" and implored an adoption of the Nazi \"final solution\" by Arabs. After the Nazi defeat at El Alamein in 1942, Al Husseini broadcast radio messages on Radio Berlin calling for continued Arabic resistance to Allied forces. In time, he came to be known as the \"Fuhrer's Mufti\" and the \"Arab Fuhrer.\"\n \n In March 1944, Al Husseini broadcast a call for a jihad to \"kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history, and religion.\"\n \n On numerous occasions, Al Husseini intervened in the fate of European Jews, most notably blocking Adolph Eichmann's deal with the Red Cross to exchange Jewish children for German POWs.\n \n Moreover, Al Husseini personally recruited Bosnia Muslims for the German Waffen SS, including the Skanderberg Division from Albania and Hanjer Division from Bosnia. The Hanjer (Saber) Division of the Waffen SS was responsible for the murder of over 90 percent of the Yugoslavian Jewish population.\n \n SS leader Heinrich Himmler was so pleased with Al Husseini's Muslim Nazis that he established the Dresden-based Mullah Military School for their continued recruitment and training. In 1944, Hanjer commandos parachuted into Tel Aviv and poisoned drinking wells in Jewish communities in an effort to stir up ethnic tensions.\n \n After the fall of Nazi Germany, Al Husseini fled to Cairo, Egypt in 1946 rather than face war crime charges for his actions in Yugoslavia. But he continued his operations.\n \n In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Al Husseini worked closely with a pro-fascist group in Egypt called Young Egypt. In 1952 Gamal Abdul Nasser, a prominent member of Young Egypt, was among military officers who seized control of the Egyptian government from King Fu'ad. Al Husseini is reported to have been responsible for bringing Otto Skorzeny, the Nazi commando once labeled by the OSS as \"the most dangerous man in Europe,\" into the employ of the Nasser government.\n \n Similarly, Al Husseini had a strong influence over the founding members of both the Iraqi and Syrian Ba'ath party. Strong evidence exists that al Husseini was instrumental in the arranging of Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner's employment as an advisor to the Syrian general staff.\n \n However, al Husseini's central role in the creation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964 is perhaps his most indelible mark on the Middle East today.\n \n The radical Imam was the spiritual mentor of the first chairman of the PLO, Ahmed Shukairi, and saw that much of his ideology was instilled in the organization. More importantly, Al Husseini used his extensive connections to recruit financial supporters for the PLO throughout the Arab world.\n \n Almost 30 years after al Husseini's death in 1974, the Palestinian people still revere him as a hero and embrace his radical theology. The \"Arab Fuhrer's\" close Nazi association and virulent anti-Semitism is perhaps the reason that Hitler's Meinf Kampf is ranked as the sixth all-time bestseller among Palestinian Arabs.\n \n Several of his descendants remain active in Palestinian affairs today.\n \n Al Husseini's grandson, Faisal Husseini, was part of the PLO since 1964 and served as minister without portfolio in the Palestinian National Authority, with responsibility for Jerusalem until his death in May 2001.\n \n The radical imam's nephew, Rahman Abdul Rauf el-Qudwa el Husseini, has been a major player in Palestinian terrorism for almost 40 years. He was the guiding force behind the merging of the Fatah faction into the PLO. In 1990, Rahman Abdul Rauf el-Qudwa el Husseini was responsible for the Palestinian community's support of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.\n \n Most Mideast observers today recognize the younger Al Husseini by the secular name he adopted as his own in 1952, Yasser Arafat.\n\n From Al Husseini to Hitler :Radical Islam and the Nazi connection - Pan Arabism to the PA - Militant Islam Monitor - Militant Islam Monitor",

You see that drawing has very little to do with reality since if you look at Communism, Socialism, Liberalism and Fasciam it's all about the state/ Government or a simple majority rule. And a Theocracy isn't much better than a dictatorship since it is one person deamed a divine entity to rule. Which history has taught is't any better of an idea. A true democracy is nothing more than mob rule 51% of the vote and you do what we say. Were as a represenative republic is diffrent and what does this is the senate and the constitution. The senate has two seats per state and has slimmer margins than the house, the house is set by population (the larger the population of a state the more members you have in the house)and wider margines. The house is more of a democracy since it is majority rule a hand full of states with large populations could take over the house and leaving states with small populations with out a voice in government. But the senate changes this since every state is equaly represented in the senate. \n \n The constitution sets rules and restrictions on government and recognizes the individuals inalienable rights. Where a real democracy does not since a simple vote of 51% can strip 49% of the population of it's rights where as in a representitive government you need 75% to change the constitution to strip 25% of the population of it's rights. Any way you slice it Communism, Socialism, Liberalism, Fasciam, and a Theocracy. The masses are governed by either the a few or a simple majority with no checks on that power. For Conservatives it's all about the individual and their rights and that no one person or government is allowed to take them away. You are free to exercise your rights as long as you don't infringe on someone elses free exercise of their rights. It's just that simple.",
