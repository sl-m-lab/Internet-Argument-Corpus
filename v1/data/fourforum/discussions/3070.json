   "This is a thread where I would like people to post quotes that they have researched from each candidate. There are a multitude of sources out there. The congressional record is an excellent objective source that has not been obliterated by the media. If you are pro Kerry or pro Bush, it does not matter. \n \n My preference is looking for contradictions. From both sides. Lets look at those eh? Here is my first listhKerry Quotes \n \n The site is anti-Kerry. Feel free to peruse and browse.\n \n Bush Quotes \n \n An anti Bush site.\n \n The big difference I see is that the kerry quotes show him flip flopping all over the place. The Bush quotes are inane and not the smartest of comments, but his policy never changes from moment to moment.",

   "Actually, it clearly shows Kerry's flip flop on several issues. Being for the war, then against it, then for it etc.\n\n \n I'm not seeing these flip-flops, any more on one side than the other. I think that's just republican propoganda. (Both sides use it).\n \n Regarding the war, \"for it, and against it\". How simple is that? Is your life simple? Are matters of the nation \"simple sound bites???\" Of course not, it's propganda.\n \n From what I've heard, just in passing, is that:\n \n #1 he voted specifically to allow the president the choice of going to war. He still belives in this, strongly. Sorry, that's not \"voting FOR the war\". Don't tell me you fell for that? :/\n \n #2 He specifically has said over and over:\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/article.aspx?docID=155\n \nKerry was referring to a measure he co-sponsored that would have provided the $87 billion while also temporarily reversing Bush's tax cuts for those making $400,000 a year or more. That measure was rejected 57-42.\n\n \n Then worse, it makes no difference because everyone, democrat and republican, supported funding the troops, only AFTER the republican run white house sent troops WITHOUT the equipment and planning needed to keep our troops safe.:\n \n \nAbizaid: Now, I can't answer for the record why we started this war with protective vests that were in short supply. But I can tell you that by November, every soldier that's serving in Iraq will have one. It's very important.\n \n \n Kerry: And I might add, that vote for the $87 billion, which was was a vote to change our policy and get other nations involved and get other people on the ground and take the target off of American troops by sharing the responsibility, it was also a vote that took place long after they already committed the troops, long after they should have had the equipment that they needed.\n\n \n Call it what you like, but it certainly doesn't sound like a reversal on a particular position.\n \n ===\n \n Here is some progressive site with a bunch of bush flip-flops.

He also voted against the funding for the troops after they got there. \n \n To me that is like saying, go to the lions den and once you are there, we are going to take away your whip and chair.\n\n \n The bill originally contained the provision for how it would get paid. Through repealing the tax cuts. He voted for it. They (since they are the majority) removed that because they wanted to put the country in debt rather than have to repeal their tax cuts for the (rich). \n \n He voted against it because they had no way to pay, other than making our kids pay (off the debt). He never, ever, ever supported never appropriating the necessary war funds. He didn't want to do it THEIR way. He should just roll over? And you did read that they had ALREADY sent troops to IRaq WITHOUT the appropriate body armor!! That's even BEFORE the vote! They were already there, sent by BUSH, without funding. Aren't you reading the same things the rest of us are reading??\n \n\n as for a specific flip flop \n \n Iraq Coalition Sep, 2002: \"If Saddam Hussein is unwilling to bend to the international community's already existing order, then he will have invited enforcement, even if that enforcement is mostly at the hands of the United States, a right we retain even if the Security Council fails to act.\" \n \n Mar, 2004: \"For a President, the decision may be lonely, but that does not mean that America should go it alone \n \n \n Entirely consistent and fairly well spoken view points. Not contradictory. Well, at least not people who comprehend. The republican party takes everyone for tragically poor at comprehending things..I think they hit the nail on the head. \n \n \nAbortion:\"It's a tragic day in the lives of everybody when abortion is looked on as an alternative to birth control or as an alternative to having a child. I think that's wrong. It should be the very last thing if it has to be anything, and I say that not just because I'm opposed to abortion but because I think that's common sense.\n ...

(\"John Kerry On The Issues,\" The [Lowell, MA] Sun, 10/11/72)\n \n \"The right to choose is the law of the United States. No person has the right to infringe on that freedom. Those of us who are in government have a special responsibility to see to it that the United States continues to protect this right, as it must protect all rights secured by the constitution\n\n \n I got no further than 1972. Over 30 years ago? You call that a flip-flop (even though its also not contradictory). I have changed views probably 3-4 times in my life (of 30 years), my lord if you think someone should be the same their entire flipping life!!\n \n \nGay Marriage:\n \n He voted against the Defense of Marriage Act because it would prevent \"federal recognition of same-sex marriages and give states the right to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages in other states.\" He also claimed that it \"bashed gays.\" \n \n \"I support equal rights, and the right of people to have civil union, equal partnership rights. I don't support (gay) marriage. I never have.\" (emphasis mine)\n\n \n Once again, not contradictory. Doesn't he think it's up to the state, and prefers union to marriage? But he's supposed to be OK with a federal ban on gay marriage? What else did the \"Defense of Marriage Act\" entail? \n \n Furthermore, he's a freaking senator, something bush has never been. Senators damn well better get some input from their constituency, and better not always vote their mind on issues, they better be getting input from the people, and the party. Senators statistically HAVE to have differing personal views than their voting record. Don't you see why it's just a catchy phrase to win the election? A good one, I'll give them that, it certainly plays to the lowest common denominator in this country.\n \n Kerry is religious, yet he won't vote to impose his religion on others, even atheists. So he SUPPORTs atheism? Give me a break, this is depressing.",
