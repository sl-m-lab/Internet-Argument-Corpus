   "From the \"What are you?\" thread.\n \n Ingus, you've directed some fairly bold, confident and challenging (confrontational?) comments towards me. \n \n \n... Q - Where is your documentation that a glob of cells has any rights? OK, now we'll be looking forward to your 'answer' emoticon_xbye ,... you have no facts to back up your rhetoric, and you have no facts because anti-choicers \"think\" emotionally, and not logically. Have a nice day :)\n\n \n \n,... I seriously doubt you'll say anything new that I haven't heard before in the last 20 years that I've been debating anti-choicers emoticon_xchicken You're not here to learn, you're here to feel good about your delusions. emoticon_xbye\n\n \n \n... really! Let me tell you what you're going to do, over the next few months you'll post the same old worn out rhetoric that every other anti-choicer has for the last several decades. You won't be able to back anything up with viable scientifically proven facts. You'll use words that the anti-choice movement has made up out of thin air, and you'll use your own \"unique' definitions for words that most 3rd graders know the real definition for. emoticon_xgood emoticon_xbye\n\n \n I asked you in that thread to open a new thread and challenge me to a debate on elective abortion (and whether or not it should be banned) but you (so far) have declined the opportunity to do so.\n \n I am struck (intrigued) by your comments regarding \"science, definitions and logic.\" (Three of my favorite aspects of the debate)\n \n I would much rather this be a formal (moderated) debate between just the two of us, Ingus. But, I don't know how to initiate one so this will have to do.\n \n If you accept this challenge, We will need a specific aspect or starting point for the debate. As I'm sure that you will agree there are many aspects to be debated. \n \n These are the three aspects of the abortion debate that I am interested in debating.\n \n 1: When does a human individual's (when does a person's) life begin?\n 2: When does a person's Constitutional right to their life begin?\n 3: What should the role of religion be in laws regarding abortion (sep. of church and state)\n \n EVERBODY, This challenge is to Ingus only. If others are interested, please wait until Ingus declines or otherwise ends his participation,... before you say so.\n \n Thanks.",

This one is open to all as long as the rules are not violated. To start a one on one formal debate you should first get someone to agree to debate you, then arrange a set of judges and a moderator, agree to the rules to be applied to the debate, then start debating. Try reading the sticky posted at the top of this forum. Go the the Debate Challenges forum to make your challenge to Ingus or whomever you choose to debate. You may then get a chance to debate in the Debate Tournaments forum...not the Formal Open Debate forum. \"Open\" here means open to all. Good luck.",
