   "Here's a New Year's ditty: a little Ode to Mr Bush:\n \n Oh for a plan cries Mr Bush\n (While Rummy murmurs, What's the rush ?)\n To bring the US army back,\n And stop my nonsense in Iraq.\n \n But every plan in Washington\n Is dreamed up by a neo-con, \n So every scheme must have in place \n A means of saving Dubbya's face.\n \n Now no one knows and none can say\n If Mr Bush will find a way\n Of contradicting all he's said,\n And end up standing on his head.",
