He is taking quotes out of context (which he accuses christians of all the time) and making them mean what he wants them to mean. In this case he is trying to say that the God of the new testament is not a God of love.\n \n If he looks at them in context he will find that what Jesus refers to are principles of relationship and not of actual violence. He (Jesus)is referring to the actual effects of a person believing and accepting christ which say things like that a son will find he is \"against\" his father because of it. \n \n The luke 14 quote is another reference to the 1st commandment \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\". The word hate there does not mean actual hatred but rather, in context, is a reference to placing God above others.\n \n The Luke 19 quote is actually from the end of a parable which Jesus is telling and is not Jesus actually saying those words. It is the landowner in the parable. This story does not mean that Jesus will kill those who do not bow down to him. A parable is a story with ONE point and only one point. All of the items are not allegorical only the main point is to be consider (it is where we get the mathematical term Parabola which is a curve with a single focus). The point of the parable is that REWARDS (contrast with punishment) will be given to those who have faithfully invested what they have been given. That refers to relationships not actual money. The parable is not talking about punishments but rather about what we do with what God has given us and how that will translate into the kingdom (heaven) to come. It is a story told to believers not to non believers. You note that Trebor conveniently left this information out of his quotes.\n \n The matthew passage I explained in the first paragraph.\n \n Trebor:\n \n If you are going to gripe and complain about christians taking things out of context (and don't make me post your posts where you do that) then you must make sure to keep it in context yourself.\n \n EF",

I agree with most things stated except that you state that god was different. He was not. God has always been and is and always will be a God of love.

If I am not angered by the fact that one of my closest friends chooses to use drugs much to his detriment, then I do not love my friend very much. God showing his anger is an indication of that which God loves. The old testament was intended to show God's love and specifically his love towards Abraham's offspring as was promised to Abraham. Jesus came as God in the flesh to demonstrate what love was really like. \n \n There are other things that I am not quite on board with. Not sure what you mean that christ did not die on the cross.

But making the assumption that the 5 churches at least at some point were equal in authority, or at least one not having authority over another, it would make sense since Rome being the capital when Constintine decreed Christianity as the state religion that Rome would gain some level of elevation of status if by no ther reason than it's close proximity to the emperor. Where the delima I think comes from is when Constintine moves the capital to Constantinople and decides to take church authority with him. That is when Rome begins to make it's claim of authority or maybe more accuratly it's refusal to accept the shift in power. It's hard to give credibilty to the claim of direct lineage to Peter when people who should have been considered were not. Any one of the 5 churches could have (or at least Constantinople) taken the same course of action as Rome, making the same claims, and following the same methods as Rome did to create the office of Pope. \n \n This is a good link that isn't tp lengthy, but gives a lot of information\n http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/westciv/papacy.html\n \n I mean back in the early days of the church, there was trouble in the church at Corinth, now the elders of the church sent for pope Clement I who was the bishop of Rome to sort out the matter even though St John the apostle (whom jesus Loved) was still alive and living much closer to Corinth than Rome, why would they bypass a living member of the twelve disciples to go to the bishop of rome if Rome did not have the authority to decide the matter, to me this is a clear indication that The bishop of Rome, the Pope had and still has authority.\n \n One has only to look at historical relations to rome, the writings of the early church fathers to see that the Church in Rome was always accepted as the ultimate authority, yes of course the churches themselves were a local authority, but rome was and always will be the centeral authority.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Well there is a historical list and if you go to the vatican you can see the tombs of the popes from St Peter himself upto JPII\n \n \n \n The Gates of hell shall not prevail against it?\n \n To you I give the keys to the kingdom of heaven?\n \n Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven?\n \n I dont think so!\n \n \n \n No the office of St Peter is the church, all other churches are churches that have emerged from the Early Church... The Seat of Peter, simple as!\n \n \n \n \n \n Jesus was a man yes, but he is also God\n \n \n \n the Church of England/Anglican Church is so far removed from Rome that Scholars agree, there is little to no hope of reunification and most importantly the eucharist is not is NOT Valid, If you dont have a valid eucharist, you have nothing. The eucharist is THE SOURCE & SUMIT of christian life, without that there is no life in you. Yes the Orthodox remain in union with us through the validity of their eucharist, Yes they are guarenteed to recieve Jesus Christ in the eucharist, A Anglican or any other protestant is not.\n \n so you can talk about the politics of the situation all you want, you can do nothing about that all you can do is try to have the best possible relationship with Christ and yes it maybe better than many catholics but that isnt the point...the point is you could have a much better relationship with christ by recieving a valid eucharist and there are only two churches you can with full assurance recieve christ in the eucharist, that is in the orthodox churches and in the catholic church, all you need to figure out from their is if you want to be taught the truth or THE FULLNESS OF TRUTH.\n\n \n I have a different understanding of events, but I am open to not being right.

   "Bradamante, I feel I summarized my basic arguments well in my above response to unkerpaulie, so please read that post.\n \n I will respond to the remainder of your post that I feel is not explained by the above. If you feel I avoided any particular issue, please include it in your next post.\n I have colored the most pertinent section of my post for emphasis.\n \n \n \nYou are basing your idea on a premise that is flawed; centred around, as it is, on the belief that God must not give us real choices if He values us choosing correctly\n\n No; as I explained above, I am basing my argument on the premise that the reason God doesn't zap evildoers is that God values choice (i.e. free will) over correctness. My argument also depends on the assertion that God punishes some people for a choice or choices that they make. If either of these two premises are incorrect, then my argument does not stand. However, if both premises are true, then my conclusion follows.\n \n To reiterate, it is not my position that God values anything over anything else. This argumentation simply tests the soundness of the assertion made. \n \n \nI was demonstrating that a number of choices all leading to the one conclusion is not a real 'choice'. It was to combat the objection that in effect says \"Why doesn't God just let us choose anything\"\n\n As best as I can tell, you are arguing that if God does not act based upon what we choose, there is no \"real choice.\" If this were true, then the only difference between a \"correctly\" believing person and an \"incorrectly\" believing person would be how God treats them upon their deaths. This is quite obviously untrue.\n \n \nYou then tried to say that I was saying that there's no real choice, per se. If you still don't want to admit you mis-read that, that's up to you.\n\n My only mistake apparently lies in assuming that you had some relevant point with the passage in question.\n \n \nIt's not ad hom when you yourself plaster your posts with so much ego-centric claims; like you'll kick my ar*e if I go to the evolution thread, or you'll crow triumphantly if I'm upset\n\n It's not a refutation of my claim that I accept the consequences of my actions to call me egocentric. (Furthermore, if it's nothing but unsubstantiated ego, why haven't I seen you in the Creation/Evolution forum?)\n \n \nIf I give you a one-question multiple-choice test where you can choose A, B, C, or D, I give you the test knowing that I will grade you based upon which answer you choose, not upon whether you use your free will to select an answer.\nFalse. The multiple-choice test is not given so the teacher doesn't mind which choice you make.\n\n Do I need to type more slowly, or is this some strange misunderstanding based on our flawed English language? Although I can construe it to mean something else, it appears to me that your statement is repeating what I said and then saying I'm wrong...\n \n \nThe teacher is not wanting you to choose the wrong. But they are indeed letting you choose.\n\n If it were more important that you choose the right answer, then God would reveal the correct answer. God does not reveal the correct answer, therefore it is not more important that you choose the right answer. (Modus tollens.)\n \n If the more important criterion is that you choose, God should penalize based on that criterion and not on what you choose. Instead, according to teachings, God penalizes based on what you choose. Therefore the more important criterion is not that you choose. (Modus tollens.)\n \n The first argument follows from the standard problem of evil.\n The second argument follows from standard religious teachings and your \"resolution\" of the problem of evil.\n The two arguments contradict each other. Therefore your resolution of the problem of evil (in the form of the thread's title) is unsound.\n \n \nTeachers want you to get the right answer. Thus they include the right answer within the choice. If they just wanted you to have choice, none would necessarily be correct. That is the flaw in your logic.\n\n For the actual concept in question, the truth necessarily exists, and therefore is a choice, whether evident or not.\n Furthermore, if you apply your analogy to the actual concept in question, it implies that God is withholding the correct answer. Certainly that's not what you believe...\n Most importantly, though, your points here do not undermine my argument in any way, shape, or form.",

I think you have some commonality with Objectivism.\n \n Given that you've already established that you're right, no amount of objections going to change this, as evidenced on the other thread where you conclude by saying I've not been as 'forthright' in quoting a guy, when you offered a site with NO COMMENT whatsoever. With no power of introspection (because 'forthright' would have meant you'd have provided your site with a rider saying it wasn't fully representative of the study) you'd have realised this. Later when you admit this, you still gotta insist me pointing this out is straw-man, or not being forthright. You don't realise how amazing this is.\n \n Let me put this another way. You cite a site that's not forthright. You are not immediately 'forthright' about it. I cite the author's words on the study to set the record straight. That is being 'forthright'. :) You instead spend days attacking this as a straw-man. Then you spend days arguing that I had other motives. Even when you finally admit that the original citation is not representative, you still accuse me, even now of being less than forthright - like an objectivist, once you've got an idea in your head that you've reached through some process, it's 'right'.\n \n But you're right (I can see the response) this is not the thread for a detailed examination of that particular set of points. So I'll bring this round to the topic at hand, which a little introspection might have also lead you to realise you'd been answered here too severl times.

Certainly that's not what you believe...\n Most importantly, though, your points here do not undermine my argument in any way, shape, or form.\n\n Simply put you miss the analogy because a teacher does not with-hold the answer. A teacher teaches the answer. Then he gives you a test to see if you've learnt the lesson. Maybe in your country teachers with-hold the answers until after the test and then teach the right way, I don't know what system you're living under.\n \n AND this is like an 'open-book' exam because you're able to reference what he teaches at any point during the exam. This nullifies your next 'point'\n \n \nIf it were more important that you choose the right answer, then God would reveal the correct answer. God does not reveal the correct answer, therefore it is not more important that you choose the right answer. (Modus tollens.)\n\n \n Even if you've never seen the book, you know the answes (see Romans 2). God is a god of love and is most fair. (and remember we're talking about the Christian concept of God).\n \n But I expect you'll go on\n a) claiming you've not been answered\n and\n b) that there's a difference between 'right choice' and 'right to choose'.",

Therefore your resolution of the problem of evil (in the form of the thread's title) is unsound.\n Please clearly state your problems with these arguments.\n\n I already have. God wants us to choose, and choose correctly. Neither are more important. They work together.\n \n Just as a teacher doesn't want you to fail (I hope). Maybe you expect a teacher to give you a multiple choice question where there's only \"A\", or \"A\" and \"B\" and \"C\" are correct. I must admit I have difficulty in understanding why you think God would not operate along similar lines to my 'good' teacher analogy, as I'm not aware of any teacher who gives you a question where all the answers are correct. Nor am I aware of those that give you only one 'choice' (negating again the idea of 'choice').\n \n A difference being that God loves us always, whereas a teacher doesn't. He gave us a choice. There is in fact in the end only two real choices. God, or not-God. Choosing not-God is to choose evil, which is that which is away from God. Choosing evil has its consequences, which is to separate oneself from God, which is hell, by its very nature. \n \n I know that some Orthodox Christians believe that heaven and hell are in the presence of God. That God's love is shinning forth continuously, but some have hardened their hearts to God therefore rather than feel His love as a glowing warmth, they feel it like a burning fire (in much the same way as the OT mentions that God hardened Pharaoh's heart) because it was the nature of his heart (full of evil) that when it experienced God it did this.\n \n\n I'm not arguing that if God gives us a choice, He must not care at all about which choice we make. In fact, I agree that \"the right to choose\" and \"making the right choice\" are (in theory) not mutually exclusive, so there is no dichotomy, let alone a false one. Instead, the argument is that it's incoherent for God to value choice more than correctness yet punish based on incorrectness.\n\n \n\n As best as I can tell, your counterargument seems to be, \"If there were no punishment for an incorrect choice, there would be no actual choice (because either choice has the same result).\"\n\n Not exactly. There's got to be real choice for the idea of there being choice being real. Sorry for the truism. Given that there must be 'real' choice, then because of the nature of this decision (The nature of this debate is not whether you choose a blue sports car over a white family mover. There are two very clear choices. God's love shines out all the time, whether you choose God or not is up to you. God's love is there no matter when you decide to turn to God) then there is a punishment for an incorrect choice.\n \n\n But both choices do not have the same results.\n\n Indeed. That's often what happens with choices.\n \n\n Having an identical result in one or many aspects does not negate having a nonidentical result in even a single aspect. We, presumably, have made different choices, and our belief systems differ because of those choices. God's choosing to \"zap\" neither, only one, or both of us will not change that fact.\n\n Do you murder people? Do you steal from people? How different are we???? Anyway Romans 2 offers some comfort whether you believe in it or not; insofar as you're presuming to know that the Christian idea of God would mean that I would feel that you are going to be 'zapped'. I make no judgment on behalf of God, so you not believing in God may not mean you are going to be zapped. I simply won't speculate any further on that (whether you will go to hell) as it's against my beliefs.\n \n\n Your objections aren't substantive at all. See above; you don't even know what I'm arguing. How can you address my arguments if you don't even know what point I'm making?\n\n It is difficult for me to understand why you think that there is a difference. See above.\n \nFine, call the analogy flawed. After all, a teacher doesn't have the power to magically have you choose the right answer, but God supposedly does. Why doesn't God do that?\n\n If God compelled you; then it's not a choice.\n \n \nSo I should believe what the Bible says because the Bible tells me to? Impeccable logic. Why doesn't God just cut to the chase and have people choose what He wants them to choose?\n\n It's irrelevant whether you do or not. This debate isn't \"Does the God of the Bible exist\" but rather \"If the God of the Bible exists, why is He a fair God\".\n \n \n\n What, you think that \"a right choice\" and \"the right to choose\" are identical? Then how do you think there are people who make \"incorrect\" choices?!\n\n I don't think that they are identical. But in the case of God they work together. They aren't separated. It's the same with the teacher giving you a quiz.\n \n They give you real choice \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\"\n Not all answers are the same.\n They want you to choose AT THE SAME TIME as they want you to get the right answer. But, there's a consequence for choosing the wrong answer*. If they didn't want you to choose, there'd be no choice; either only \"A\" would be there, or \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" would all be correct. If they didn't want you to get the right answer then all the answers would be wrong; neither \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" would be correct, and you'd have no other option. I don't know what schools operate the way you think God should, where either all the answers are the same \"correrct\" answer, or there's no correct answer, but they just value you 'choosing'.\n \n I am quite frankly perplexed why you think it must be one or the other.\n \n *Maybe you were schooled in a system that is foreign to my understanding. Perhaps a progressive school where there were no 'right' or 'wrong' answers.",

   "youre interchanging what god WANTS with what god ALLOWS.\n\n I am absolutely not. I recognize that the argument is that God wants for all people to choose, and that God wants all people to be correct.\n God allows people to be incorrect, but God does not allow people to be denied a choice, according to Bradamante's argument. My argumentation is in no way incompatible with these points; rather, my argument exists because of these points.\n \n \nactually, god zapping evildoers wouldnt affect free will at all.\n\n I guess my statement was easier to understand in context, unkerpaulie. I was saying that Bradamante's explanation for why God allows evildoers to do evil is because God wants and allows people to have choice in all cases.\n \n \neven if the consequence for doing evil was a celestial zap, the act of doing evil would have already occured, and the option to do evil would have existed in the first place anyway, making evildoing a matter of free will all the same\n\n Yes, I agree that God's waiting until death to punish evildoers, thereby exposing society to the whims of these evildoers for the duration, is a bit incoherent for a supposedly omnibenevolent being. Nevertheless, that's probably a different argument. More importantly, though, this doesn't counter my point.\n (I don't really understand your reason for bringing this up, unless you think I'm arguing that God doesn't give us free will.

People have been puzzled with the free will vs. automaton views for quite some time. In America we use phrases like 'freedom of choice' and 'independence' to give a sense of free will. We also use phrases like 'destined to fail' and 'natural born looser' to give a sense of fatalism or determinism. In psychology the debate has been over which is the predominate influencer in human behavior: nurture (with its slightly free will bent) or nature (with its heavy 'predestination' bent)? This question spans beyond theology.\n \n The traditional reformed theology comes down on the predestination side of this debate.\n \n The paradox you are describing was originally resolved through Anselm's work Cur Deus Homo  and was later developed by Aquinas, Calvin and many others. The paradox most simply stated is this: how can God both be just and withhold punishment? The answer was to say that God did not withhold punishment, rather God's just response to sin was taken vicariously by Jesus on the cross. God is allowing people to choose and forgiving them when they choose wrong while maintaining his just response toward evil.\n \n Many Christians do not buy Anselm's idea, though. Instead they will claim that this justice/mercy paradox is an antinomy--two contradictory rules apparently obtained by correct reasoning. They might compare this to the dual nature of light (which is it, a wave or a particle?) and say that we just don't know enough to be able to resolve it.\n \n Anyway, none of this is convincing unless you want to believe it.

A teacher, whilst having far more limited power doesn't use that power either... in the realm of choosing an answer to an exam question. I don't argue at all that a teacher uses or doesn't use his limited power in the realm of religious beliefs.

You have shown (above) that you have mixed up the analogy I was using.\n \nI can choose to be \"incorrect.\" \n\n Indeed. But underlying this are two factors\n \n Both the ability to choose (between correct and incorrect) and the realm of a 'correct' answer. You argued that God prefers us to have the ability to choose - if He did, then (as I exampled with a scenario) He'd simply give us 'choices' that are all not correct, or correct.\n \n I don't see how you can separate the two. But you can.\n \n In this case, choosing is not dependent upon being correct. \n\n It's dependent upon both choosing, and having a correct choice.\n \n\n Likewise, God could -- if He wanted to -- subvert choice and make one correct. Clearly, these are not dependent upon each other.\n\n If God subverted us choosing, then we'd not be choosing! That's the very point.\n \n I'll try again with my teacher analogy.\n \n If the teacher was simply concerned that we have a right to choose, in the question\n \"What is the capital of Australia?\"\n he'd offer\n a) Sydney\n b) Newcastle\n \n Giving you a 'right to choose'. However none of these choices is correct. He's championed your 'freedom' to choose, but to no avail because none of the choices was correct.\n \n However he offers both choice (two different answers) and correctness (one answer being correct)\n \"What is the capital of Australia?\"\n he'd offer\n a) Sydney\n b) Canberra\n \n You can't say that one is more important because they both work together, the very act of giving us a choice and giving us a correct choice. Because the teacher could force you to make a correct choice, but that negates 'choice... the teacher has the 'power' to force your hand into choosing correctly by offering the following\n \"What is the capital of Australia?\"\n he'd offer\n a) Canberra\n b) Canberra\n \n Where both choices are correct. This negates 'choice' in itself because you're being lead to pick an answer. You might think you're choosing, but you're not, because the results are the same. No teacher does this (that I'm aware of - even if it is in their power).\n \n You simply point out that God has more power. So what? Teachers with their limited power still do not use their limited power to the extent of forcing us to pick the answer that is correct (or incorrect).\n :xbanghead",

For Christians I guess it would be Jesus. When Jews experience God, Jesus is nowhere to be found. How can you expect to be taken seriously when your God (Jesus) is one of several? When dealing with the supernatural world, subjective proof holds no water. When Jews experience God it has nothing to do with Jesus. Why is it that when people experience God, it just happens to be the one that they believe in? For Christians it's Jesus. For Jews it's Yaweh, a confirmed old bachelor who hasn't the need to impregnate an engaged woman in order to have a son. For Islam it's Allah and the profit Mohammed. Three major religious groups all claiming that their God is the one true God. Go with your gut feeling, but please don't try to pass it off to others as some sort of fact or an obvious reality.

Is it the sinful world that your God created and placed us all in? If that is the case I would think salvation would be automatic, since none of us are here by choice. If everlasting life means eternity with your God, no thank you. I find the whole concept of salvation, heaven, and hell as unbelievable as the book it stems from.\n \n \n \n \n \n Your parents did not create the universe or create and sustain life.\n \n \n You are right, my mother was basically a housewife and my father was fireman. However they did create me and they did sustain my life. Unlike your God, I didn't have to learn about them from a book. I was never cast out of my home, nor was I left alone with talking serpents who could fool me into doing bad things. If I had been left alone with a talking serpent who fooled me into doing bad things, they would have removed the serpent from the garden, and told me not to listen to any plants, animals, or insects that don't normally speak. They found nothing positive in punishment of disobedience, they put their energy into finding out WHY I disobeyed. Finding out why a child behaves in a certain way is the key to correcting that child's behavior, if it is not proper. Adam and Eve were kicked out after their first mistake. Where would any of us be if our parents followed God's example on how to deal with disobedient children? \n \n \n \n \n In short, while your parents should be honored, they fall way short on numerous important and spiritual matters. \n \n \n \n \n \n They fall short only in your eyes, and in the eyes of what you think is the one true God. We are born into this world with a mind, not a bible. We are born into places in this world that have never seen a bible, places where bibles are forbidden, and places where other holy books render the bible false doctrine. That's fact and that's reality, your thoughts about God and spritual matters are considered beliefs. I believe there are still some dinosaurs running around, but until I come into town riding one they are just as extinct as your God.\n __________________",

The criteria is not perfect. We are humans after all, but we still trust that the message of God is communicated. The books that are additional to the catholic canon (the apocrypha) are just not considered \"inspired\" by the protestant church. They do have significant value none-the-less. It really does not change the message any. This is why the difference is negligible.\n \n EF\n\n I've never met a protestant who honestly thought the septuagint had any value, but that's beside the point. Why don't you explain to me the supposedly objecitive criteria for determining if something is inspired, especially the criteria protestants used to determine the septuagint was not inspired over 1000 years after it was written.",

   "I've never met a protestant who honestly thought the septuagint had any value, but that's beside the point. Why don't you explain to me the supposedly objecitive criteria for determining if something is inspired, especially the criteria protestants used to determine the septuagint was not inspired over 1000 years after it was written.\n\n \n Very well: We must consider the two portions of the bible. The first is the old testament.\n \n Jesus quoted from every Old Testament book but two, and effectively endorsed the Hebrew canon in Matthew 23:35 when He cited one of the first narratives and one of the last in the Scriptures of His day. Add to that the Jews were meticulous in their preservation of scripture and that vocers most of the canon of old testament. The apocrypha were never considered scriptures by the jews. \n \n However here is an explanation that is better than anything I would say. I accept it as written.\nThe Jewish use of versions. In the synagogue the Hebrew scripture itself was read from a scroll, followed by a translation into Aramaic or Greek given by the Methurgeman (translator). The translation was never read from a scroll, because the Jews were determined not to give any version such an illusion of authority; the translation had to be memorized or done extemporaneously. In the beginning the translations were not even written down. When they were eventually written down they were not made widely available, and were not \"authorized\" in any sense by the Rabbis.\n \n The Greek version of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint. About two hundred years before the birth of Christ a Greek translation of the Pentateuch was committed to writing in Alexandria, where many Jews only knew Greek. This version was later called the Septuagint because legend has it that the translation was done by seventy (Latin septuaginta) men. Gradually the other books of the Old Testament were also put in Greek. The Septuagint gives a fairly accurate translation of the Pentateuch, which was read most closely by the Jews, but for the prophetical books like Isaiah and Jeremiah the translation is often quite loose and even erroneous, and in need of correction.\n \n Apostolic use of the Septuagint. The quotations of the Old Testament in the New show that the apostles often used the Septuagint, because it was generally known to those in the Church and usually adequate for their purposes. Some people in looking at these quotations have been troubled by the fact that they are sometimes not very accurate translations of the Hebrew. Did the apostles not know their business? Of course they did. They did not concern themselves with corrections when the translation served well enough for their purpose, but when it did not they quietly offered their own translation of the Hebrew. Then they usually offered a better translation. The apostles did not see fit to produce a complete version of the Old Testament in Greek for the use of the churches.\n \n Extra books of the Septuagint, called the Apocrypha. It is inaccurate to talk about the Septuagint as a single book in apostolic days: the various writings existed as separate scrolls, and were not bound in a single volume until the middle of the second century, when the codex or physical \"book\" as we know it was invented. (1) People did not have bookshelves, but cabinets or large cans full of these scrolls. The codex was adopted by Christians who wanted a more convenient way of referencing Scripture, and so the Greek Old Testament was one of the first collection of writings to be put in this form. When this was done, certain writings (called Apocryphal) which were highly regarded by the Greek-speaking Jews and often studied by them were bound in the same volume as the canonical books. The apostles never quote from these writings, and there is no reason to believe that they regarded them as Scripture, or would have approved of binding them with the other books in a codex.\n \n Status of the Apocrypha in the early Church. Eventually the Septuagint came to be regarded as a kind of inspired paraphrase by teachers in the churches, mainly because the apostles had used it, and partly because they suspected that the Jews had deliberately corrupted the Hebrew text in anti-Christian ways since it was translated. Then the additional books traditionally included in complete copies of the Septuagint also came to be regarded as Scripture by some, especially in the West. This was a mistake, but it did little harm, because not much attention was paid to these books. At first the churches would not possess copies of the entire Septuagint, nor even all books of the Old Testament, but perhaps only separate codices of Genesis, Isaiah, Psalms; and they would gradually collect all the books. Copies of the entire Septuagint were very expensive. http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon.html\n\n \n That should cover the old testament. You will note in your reading that the septuagint is specifically covered.\n \n As to the new testament:\n \nGradual and independent definition of the canon by elders. In the year 367 an influential bishop named Athanasius published a list of books to be read in the churches under his care, which included precisely those books we have in our Bibles (with this exception - he admitted Baruch and omitted Esther in the Old Testament). Other such lists had been published by others, as early as the year 170, although they did not all agree. How did the men who published these lists decide which books should be called Scripture? Scholars who have studied this matter closely have concluded that the lists of books are merely ratifications of the decisions of the majority of churches from earliest days. We are able to prove this by examining the surviving works of Irenaeus (born 130), who lived in days before anyone felt it was necessary to list the approved books. He quotes as Scripture all of the books and only the books that appear in the list published on another continent and sixty years later by Origen.\n \n It is evident that the elders of each congregation had approved certain writings and rejected others as they became available, and it turned out, by the grace of God, that most of the churches were by the year 170 in agreement, having approved the same books independently. Prominent teachers were also influential in this process. About that time bishops began to prevail in the Church, as governors of groups of churches, and they simply ratified with these lists the results thus arrived at. The approved books were then called the \"canon\" of Scripture, \"canon\" being a Greek word meaning \"rod\" or \"ruler.\" These books constituted the standard rule of faith for all the churches. We must not imagine that the canon was imposed by ecclesiastical authorities. The canon grew up by many independent decisions of elders who were responsible for their congregations alone.\n \n The elders received apostolic writings as authoritative. Then we must ask, how did the elders of the churches decide which writings should be read in church as authoritative? The answer is simple: They received the writings of the apostles and their closest companions, and the writings endorsed by them. The entire Old Testament was received by the implicit endorsement of the apostles. The Gospel of Matthew was written by an apostle. The Gospel of Mark was written by the apostle Peter's closest disciple. The Gospel of Luke was written by the apostle Paul's close companion. The Gospel of John was written by an apostle. The Acts of the Apostles was written by Paul's close companion. Thirteen letters were received from Paul. The epistle to the Hebrews was received as from Paul. The epistle of James comes from the brother of the Lord, who exercised authority in Jerusalem with the apostles. The epistle of Jude was from another brother of the Lord. The two epistles of Peter are from an apostle. The three epistles of John are from an apostle, who also wrote the Revelation. We may ask, How did they know that these writings were not forgeries? The churches did not receive them from strangers. These documents were hand-delivered by friends of the apostles to elders who also knew the apostles personally. Forgeries would be obvious, especially if the writing promoted strange doctrines.\n \n Minor disagreements in earliest days. Some disagreements arose along with the rise of heresies. The elders of the churches became wary, and even began to doubt some of the writings they had formerly received as copies from other churches. Writings which came under question were Hebrews, James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and the Revelation of John. The reasons for doubt were various. The author of Hebrews does not identify himself. James was not an apostle, and his message seemed to contradict Paul's message. Jude was not an apostle, and he quotes books which the churches did not receive as Scripture. 2 Peter, it seems, was not widely distributed at first. The author of 2 and 3 John does not identify himself plainly. The author of the Revelation identifies himself as John, but does not say that he is the apostle John, and the style of the book is different from the Gospel of John. Nevertheless, the majority of churches received and used these books without questioning them, while vigorously rejecting all others.\n \n Universal agreement in modern times. Today we have no good reason for doubting the canon of the New Testament. It would be wrong for me to suggest that everyone needs to investigate these matters and decide for himself which books he will receive as Scripture, without any respect for the decisions of the early churches. We are not in such a position to judge as the early church was, and we are bound to respect the well-nigh unanimous opinion of so many Christians of the past. As Paul says to the Corinthian innovators, \"What! Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you alone?\" Against such presumption he recommends that which is done \"in all the churches of the saints.\" (14:33b-36). Recently some scholars have tried to promote strange doctrines by suggesting that some of our canonical writings are not genuine, and that other writings such as the Gospel of Thomas are equally valid \"interpretations\" of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. I have studied their arguments, and I can assure you that they are not worth listening to. (same source)\n \n\n \n EF",
