   "As I have shown before, the christian right will do anything it takes to oppress the gay and lesbian population from having equal rights. Including lie, twist the truth and use only exerts from studies and the bible to get make gays look bad. Funny enough they got caught by this researcher. I would be interested in knowing their response but I didn't find one.\n \n (New Haven, Connecticut) A child psychiatrist from Yale University is denouncing efforts by the Oregon group that opposes same-sex marriage, saying they are misusing his research.\n \n But backers of Measure 36, which would amend Oregon's constitution to ban same-sex marriage, said they believe Dr. Kyle Pruett's research shows that a child fares best growing up with a married father and mother.\n \n In its campaign fliers, the coalition writes that Pruett \"reveals that infants just 8 weeks of age can already detect the difference between male and female interaction. This further confirms that the role of a mother and a father are not interchangeable when it comes to raising children.\"\n \n \"I was quite surprised, even dumbfounded, to see my name listed as if it were a scientific support or consultant to this amendment,\" Pruett said in a telephone news conference organized by No on Constitutional Amendment 36.\n \n \"It couldn't be further than either my personal or professional position,\" he said.\n \n Actually, children generally fare better with two parents than one, even if the parents are of the same gender, Pruett said.\n \n \"There is to date no credible research that says children raised by gay and lesbian couples are at risk,\" he said.\n \n \u00a9Associated Press 2004",

They have nothing else to work on except a platform without facts and substance. \n \n If anyone remembers the report I linked, the American Sociology report, it stated there was no significent differences between straight and gay parentage to children.",
