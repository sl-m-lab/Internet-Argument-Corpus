This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666\"\n \n http://www.biblebelievers.com/jmelton/mark.html\n \n For one of many.\n \n Even Wiki mentions this 'rant' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast\n \n \n Also, why simply leave it at tracking? Why not code in the MARK?\n If pushing the MARK, whay not have the beast attach a tracking device so that his minions will know your movements?\n Arch, you're being foolish if you think it will stop at what you want.\n \n Remember Arch...slippery slope.\n 1st we get's you comfortable with the notion of forcing the predecessor of the Mark onto the least of your brethern for their 'crimes'. Then we scares you into getting them for your children...got to protect the children, no? Then they're proven to be sooo good, you take them.\n After all, you've taken soooo many numbers already. Just a little one extra won't hurt you.\n It'll even simplify your whole life and prevent ID theft by them 'godless' heathens. \n Heck, the potential is great for them.\n I'm also willing to bet that in a generation or 2...they'll be a fact.\n \n I'd also say the mark will be a mark...not a substitute like a card or a microchip. \n But, then again, that'd be a literalist view of scripture and not a private interpretation of scripture shoehorned into what I want it to be.\n \n So, yes Arch, I know my facts. I can also out conspiracy you any day. All your faith does is play into the hands of the Arch Enemy. While you're busy looking at the Catholics or the gays or any other outsider as the source of evil, 10 to 1 says your own pastor teaches apostacy and utters falsehoods. \n \n \n \nNo I am not. Archangel is suggesting doing exactly what he believe the anti christ will do. One wonders why? Is Archangel trying to bring about the rapture by setting presidence for chipping people? Of course at first it is only to protect children but once you start down that road there is no turning back.\n\n The answer is yes.\n For the fundamentalist evangelical pseudo-Christian, the desire to personally make conditions right for the 2nd coming is a mandate from God.\n I made this same accusation against EZ several months ago in the Religious Tolerance thread. Easy Rider NEVER denied it.\n \n If you think you can keep your gayness in check, I dare your to pull out the white pages and look up 'Word of Faith' or a Pentecostal (UPC) church to visit. Sit back and audit the messages spewed. Take notes, buy a tape or CD of the sermon (many of the pastors sell them)...then go home and be afraid...very afraid.\n If you do, I've found saying 'Peace be with you.' effective as you're glad-handed while trying to run for the door. It's polite and scripturally accurate and leaves many confused...emoticon_confused \n Also, do NOT give any personal information, address, phone number...even more than a 1st name. They'll more than likely sell the information to a mailing list company and fill your mail box with tree killing junk.\n \n If you want to be facitious, tell them you have a big pot of chopped weiners in sauerkraut waiting for you at home. ;)",

   "Scripture:\n Mark of the Beast\n Revelations 13:16-18\n \"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666\"\n \n http://www.biblebelievers.com/jmelton/mark.html\n \n For one of many.\n \n Even Wiki mentions this 'rant' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast\n \n \n Also, why simply leave it at tracking? Why not code in the MARK?\n If pushing the MARK, whay not have the beast attach a tracking device so that his minions will know your movements?\n Arch, you're being foolish if you think it will stop at what you want.\n \n Remember Arch...slippery slope.\n 1st we get's you comfortable with the notion of forcing the predecessor of the Mark onto the least of your brethern for their 'crimes'. Then we scares you into getting them for your children...got to protect the children, no? Then they're proven to be sooo good, you take them.\n After all, you've taken soooo many numbers already. Just a little one extra won't hurt you.\n It'll even simplify your whole life and prevent ID theft by them 'godless' heathens. \n Heck, the potential is great for them.\n I'm also willing to bet that in a generation or 2...they'll be a fact.\n \n I'd also say the mark will be a mark...not a substitute like a card or a microchip. \n But, then again, that'd be a literalist view of scripture and not a private interpretation of scripture shoehorned into what I want it to be.\n \n So, yes Arch, I know my facts. I can also out conspiracy you any day. All your faith does is play into the hands of the Arch Enemy. While you're busy looking at the Catholics or the gays or any other outsider as the source of evil, 10 to 1 says your own pastor teaches apostacy and utters falsehoods. \n \n \n \n The answer is yes.\n For the fundamentalist evangelical pseudo-Christian, the desire to personally make conditions right for the 2nd coming is a mandate from God.\n I made this same accusation against EZ several months ago in the Religious Tolerance thread. Easy Rider NEVER denied it.\n \n If you think you can keep your gayness in check, I dare your to pull out the white pages and look up 'Word of Faith' or a Pentecostal (UPC) church to visit. Sit back and audit the messages spewed. Take notes, buy a tape or CD of the sermon (many of the pastors sell them)...then go home and be afraid...very afraid.\n If you do, I've found saying 'Peace be with you.' effective as you're glad-handed while trying to run for the door. It's polite and scripturally accurate and leaves many confused...emoticon_confused \n Also, do NOT give any personal information, address, phone number...even more than a 1st name. They'll more than likely sell the information to a mailing list company and fill your mail box with tree killing junk.\n \n If you want to be facitious, tell them you have a big pot of chopped weiners in sauerkraut waiting for you at home. ;)\n\n \n So let me get this right. You're saying I feel it's my duty as a Christian to do whatever I can to assist satan in causing Armageddon ? I thought for sure, and would have bet money that Matthew is the craziest and most radical guy on this forum, but you just took first place by a wide margin to imply such lunacy. that is all I have to say about this subject if your and Matt's opinions are what I have to deal with.",

A little mark that's only usable by the wearer that protects him from ID theft, provided location finding information (in the event of a kidnapping or loss for other reason...weekly, I'm covering news of elderly dementia and Alzheimer's patients turning up missing...or even children kidnapped), also can provide detailed medical information too.\n Won't even need a powerful GPS device...just localized tracking...say by a hand held device carried by law enforcement or periodically placed tracking posts (HEY, how many cities besides Houston use red light traffic cameras to catch moving violatores?) so as to lawfully track IF NEEDED, the movements of people. Can even have them set up where those without permission set off warnings alarms if they cross a certain area...like that pedophile crossing over the boundaries into a playground, park or school!\n \n Man, the posibilities are limitless!\n \n You're lowering the resistance of believers and non-believers to be able to reject the Mark when it's finally presented.\n Like cell phones. From a simple phone to a MP3 player, digital camera, video camera, sex toy, internet ready computer and heart monitor all in one...or, and still makes calls...and text messages too. Who wouldn't want one?\n Especially if they're free (paid with tax money) for all an can have more functions...like being a debit and credit card and medication despensing device.\n \n \n Now, I would 100% agree with this idea...but, I'd also have different ways of handling the penal and judicial system.\n \n I'd put a chip in my kids in a heart beart if they did all sorts of cool things.\n I wanted one in my Great Dane puppy we just got...but they don't do microchipping at that vets office...and that was just for limited tracking.\n \n But, then again I'm NOT a believer as you nor even like Matthew.\n What I find hard to believe is that you would support such a move.\n \n That pentecostal lady at the BMV was a cook. I could easily tell from her conversation that she buys into the whole mark of the Beast thing and will see it in anything that's currently 'new'. I'd doubt she nor any of the thousands of other's you'd call 'evangelicals' would accept this.\n \n Of course, I forgot we're talking about 'going to hell in a hand basket sinners' who are convicted child molesters...\n \n Tell me Arch...how's your prison ministry going?\n Mentoring any good convicts?\n \n Of course, Here's one church that has rules on how to treat sex offenders.\n \n \n For what it's worth, Matthew is crazy.

   "First of all, I just want to say \"job well done\" on developing such a heated debate. Undoubtedly, any discussion on sex offenders in this day and age could potentially lead to blood shed.\n \n Now, I choose not to address any of the religious connotations that have been introduced in the thread. However, I do think that religious attitudes and beliefs have an impact on public policy issues, such as sex offender registries. In other words, religion is embedded in our culture, which is an entity that has a significant impact on our punishment practices (see David Garland's Punishment and Modern Society).\n \n This just so happens to be a topic that is currently one of primary research interests as a criminologist. Our criminal justice system has a history of focusing on one group of offenders over a particular period of time. This practice is simply part of the \"get tough on crime\" movement that was initially developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s; however, the Reagan administration is widely associated with its onset. During the 1980s, our CJ system was focused on drug offenders; hence the \"War on Drugs.\" During the early 1990s, our system began focusing more on juvenile violent offenders. More recently, sex offenders and terrorists (the \"War on Terrorism\") have become the primary targets. Sex offender registries do some good, I'll give them credit. There are some offenders who are very sick individuals and we need to keep our children away from them. In contrary, there are many more offenders who do not pose significant threats to the rest of society, but they still are placed on registries.\n \n Since its onset, the \"get tough\" movement has not had a huge impact on deterring crime or reducing recidivism. For the most part, registries simply net widen a system that is already overwhelmed with offenders. Policing sex offenders appears like it's reducing crime and preventing further sexual abuse cases. However, in looking at the big picture, which is difficult for a lot of policy makers to do, it's simply a fad and not serving as a valuable purpose in reducing crime.\n \n In my opinion, if we really wanted to adequately address sex offenders and sexual abuse in general, we must focus on prevention, treatment, and education. Educate your children at very young ages about \"good touch\" and \"bad touch.\" Don't be afraid to talk with them about the natural aspects of sex and sexual behaviors. We should also effectively treat sexual abuse victims and offenders. Recent research has shown that sexual offender treatment can work to reduce recidivism if delivered well and appropriately. As a former counselor, I have seen its good effects.\n \n Let me get off of my soap box here, but ultimately, we must rely more on informal social control rather than the police and the justice system to rescue us. We must strengthen our families and communities in order to truly prevent and reduce crime.",

In my line of work, most of the time I encounter measures that are deigned to protect privacy, they prevent me from finiding out things like who's trying to get social support without deserving it.

But I maintain my original argument that pedophiles, rapists and murderers should be tagged so that if a child in their area is found missing, their location at the time of the crime can be determined through GPS in order to determine if they are even possible suspects or not.\n \n If I were such a person but walking the straight and narrow now, I would welcome the non intrusive technique for eliminating me as a suspect without even inconveniencing me.
