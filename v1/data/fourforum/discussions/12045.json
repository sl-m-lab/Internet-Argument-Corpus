   "It is not my claim that religious belief is harmless. Quite the contrary!\n\n \n No doubt! You irrationally consider it guilty until proven innocent.\n \n \nThat's because I don't think there is any room in faith for reason. If faith were reasoned, it wouldn't be faith, would it.\n\n \n Again, you aren't taking into account that the two sometimes deal with concepts that don't overlap and don't pertain to each other. Faith isn't required to be reasoned, if it's an issue for which reason can't even address to begin with.\n \n \nIf they want to be reasonable, they would have to admit they have no logical or empirical grounds for their faith. They believe because they want to believe. It's an emotional issue.\n\n \n What can I say when experience tells me differently? It's like someone telling me a tree isn't in a given location when I've seen it with my own eyes. People do sometimes choose faith after weighing evidence. The idea that reason equates to non-theism and theism equates to nothing more than emotion is just down right prejudiced on your part!\n \n \nIt's pretty rich you referring to Gene Robinson! \n\n \n Well, he's yet another example that shows where your reasoning breaks down.\n \n \nI don't much care what reason they cite for their humanitarian impulses. \n\n \n Beside the point. When they cite their religion as a reason it demonstrates you are wrong here.\n \n \nObviously the lesson was lost on you, so let me repeat. Tutu compartmentalises faith and reason, as do all religious believers.\n\n \n Sure .... I guess that's why he credits his faith for the good things he does ... Either you're calling him a liar, or you're wrong.",

   "\"If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that is pleasing to him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such thing exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in Catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than love of God.\"Thomas Jefferson, letter to Thomas Law, June 13, 1814\n\n \n Of course, no one is arguing that acts of good only come out of religion. The need here is for anti-theists to see that good comes out of faith--faith--at all. When someone holds to the idea that faith is incompatible with virtue by way of reason, they certainly aren't being very Jeffersonian, who was tolerant of religion and didn't seem to hold to the idea that it is incompatible with reason. In fact, he worked closely with people for which is clearly wasn't, and he himself embraced elements of religion that were virtuous.",

   "Why do I suspect that \"major points\" are going to be ignored.\n Especially when your paraphrasement of my \"major points\" are going to get ignored, especially since you \"paraphrase\" my entire post down to a measly 36 words...\n\n \n If that's a concern of yours, then let me suggest that if you are going to add lots of stuff to whatever you consider your \"major points\" to a.) either say which points you consider major, or limit your posts TO the major points.\n \n \nNo. Not \"inconsequential\".\n THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE, which I was responding to, was an example of \"'separate' pieces of evidence for things\".\n I pointed out THAT was the flaw in your attempted analogy. Of course, when you just try to summarize my statement with one word of \"evidence\", that misrepresentation of yours was very easy, huh....\n\n \n You said yourself they were two different items of \"evidence\". No, evidence is just fine as an identifier. I think it better describes what we're talking about here than \"proof\", which is a more FINALIZED concept. Anyway, that there are two items of evidence is inconsequential to what anything *I'm* saying. Whatever issue you're trying to raise with that, you'll have to elaborate, because honestly I don't know.\n \n \nPeople used to think Halley's Comet was some sort of mystical occurrence.\n Before they knew better... The \"Rorschach and chicken bone\" examples are right on. \"Miracles\" are one of those great urban legends that get passed around, like that pesky \"They're going to / have removed 'Touched by an Angel' cause it includes prayer\".\n Why is it that independent and objective verification of these things habitually fails?\n\n \n Huh?? \"Touched by an Angel\", the old TV show?? \n \n I don't know anything about that, but re. miracles, look, people believe in miracles because they *experience* them, not because they don't. You just reject their claims of experience out of hand. If it helps you, then call it something besides a miracle. Call it \"unexplainable occurrence.\" The point is all the same, either way. There is no reason to not accept experience as evidence when there's no over-riding standard of what constitutes acceptable evidence.\n \n \n \n1) Don't move the goal-posts. Don't substitute \"spiritual\" when the issue is RELIGIOUS.\n\n \n Fine, use the term \"supernatural\" then. that's all I mean.\n \n \n2) Look up \"ergot poisoning\" and the Salem Witch trials.\n After that, look up \"schizophrenia\".\n After that, \"Jim Jones\" and \"cults\".\n\n \n Foundit, the presence of things like drugs and mental illness in SOME cases does not disprove miracles. They speak to THOSE cases only. What of all the cases where drugs aren't present and people are perfectly healthy and have religious experiences? (Let me guess, it's the ABS approach again--Anything-But-Supernatural.)\n \n \nThat question, in and of itself, is an oxymoron.\n \"Religious *experience*\" is not \"evidence\".\n\n \n Why not? Why is something someone experiences something you reject out of hand? The only reason you reject it is that it's being claimed that religion is behind it somehow. You say reason isn't behind it, but strange things happen, Foundit. I think sometimes if people just took the \"supernatural\" aura away from claims of God, suddenly all the resistance would change. Perhaps people just need to change their terminology--call it \"superior being\" rather than \"God.\" Call it \"unexplainable\" rather than \"supernatural\". I suspect the baggage that critics associate with it all would change dramatically.\n \n Take the whole concept of magic as an analogy. It's been said that any superior technology could appear magical to a society that has never seen or experienced the technology. If the super-technological culture CALLS what they are as magical, then skeptics in the technologically-inferior culture might say \"but there's no such thing as magic so all the experiences people are having of this aren't real. it's all due to drugs or something else.\" But in fact, the superior culture IS real, and because it's being CALLED something they consider \"not real\" to begin with, they reject it out of hand. I think that's what's going on here to some extent. I think God IS real, and if scientists DID somehow observe God, they would in fact acknowledge \"GOD\" was real. But they'd just qualify it by saying it's not really supernatural, just a superior being. But when it's all said and done, THAT distinction doesn't matter to religious people, IMO. They simply believe in GOD, and the idea of him being 'supernatural' is just another way of saying he's superior in a way that what we know of nature can't explain him.\n \n What I think you and others do is simply reject out of hand religious experience on no other basis than the fact it happens to be associated with religion. If it were ANY OTHER kind of experience, you probably wouldn't do that, and even if it were CALLED something else and the issue of religion was never stated, you'd be more open to it. \n \n \nDon't pull this lame junk where you whine and pretend it's an argument. You are JUST AS CAPABLE of providing your own definition of \"what counts as evidence\".\n\n \n Absolutely. The difference is that I don't reject out of hand evidence anyone gives when it's something they experience. YOU'RE the one taking the less accepting stance here, not me.\n \n \nI will consider that as evidence WHEN and ONLY WHEN you are able to say that, roll five times and it DOES NOT happen, and that makes you realize \"that's evidence that there is no God\"...\n WHY is it that ALL the \"evidence\" comes up as ACCEPTING the existence of God, but NEVER refuting???\n\n \n I believe I told you earlier that one person can see nature and conclude that it points TO the existence of God, and another that it points to God NOT existing. Or maybe it was Lesz that I said that to. Either way, I said it. I DO realize that, Foundit.\n \n \nAnd the other thing people like you don't seem to realize is that \"rolling snake eyes five times\" is just as possible as any other specific roll. That has the SAME probability of rolling a 2 and a 3, a 5 and 1, a 6 and 2, a 4 and 5, and a 1 and 3.\n\n \n No. Not when it's to be 5 of them in a row. Remember? I said in a row. One snake eyes, then another snake eyes, then another snake eyes, then another, and finally, yet another snake eyes. 5. In a row. That's not a claim of probability against any other SPECIFIC number. if you don't believe me, take some dice out and compare the amount of times you roll snake eyes in a row to the times that you don't. It's a claim that, quite simply, rolling 5 snake eyes in a row is extremely, extremely improbable, to the point where, if someone prayed for it and it happened, it OUGHT to raise some eyebrows.\n \n \nGetting hit by lightning is practically impossible.\n\n \n Winning the lottery is practically impossible.[/quote]\n \n But those are both things that can raise in probability depending on the actions the person takes. If person is standing on the top of a tall metal building in a thuderstorm, getting hit by lightning is NOT practically impossible at all. If a person buys up enough lottery tickets, the odds change to where winning the lottery is not so impossible. I'm talking about religious experiences for which there's really no other feasible explanation. NO history of drugs. NO mental illness. NO one playing a trick on them. Look, your propensity to take an ABS approach is just irrational. At the very LEAST, you should at least give religious experience consideration as anything else.\n \n \nJust as much \"loss of reason\" as to believe the flying spaghetti monster \"feetflower\" sneezed the universe out his nose.\n\n \n But no one ever claims to have Flying Speghetti Monster religious experiences, Foundit. There's not any narratives about the FSM or record of his teachings as evidence it at least existed in SOME form at some point. (even if just a human being.) There are no records of people of the FSM willingly putting their lives and livelihoods on the line for no good reason except that they experienced SOMETHING that makes them sure beyond doubt it's real in the 1st century. All these however, DO apply, for other religions. The comparison just isn't a very good one, and there's NOT equal weight of evidence.\n \n \nAnd more importantly, what Jesus said DOES NOT CHANGE THOSE OTHER PASSAGES.\n The passages I quoted (which you obviously ignored) came AFTER Jesus from Jesus's followers.\n How is it that they KNEW what Jesus said, and some of them HEARD his words (or knew people who did), and yet they came away with an entirely different interpetation?\n\n \n You miss the point, Foundit. Jesus' teachings were general, to where it WASN'T an interpretation. They just weren't making the connection to begin with. They were just acting within their culture, one in which these were not considered bad things. That's the GOOD thing about Jesus' teaching--it elevates Christianity to be applicable to such cases where people realize a given action is harmful, and therefore should be avoided. I fully realize that such is a changing-with-the-times concept, but I think that's part of the VALUE of Christianity, and part of Jesus' message.\n \n \nYour interpretation IGNORES sections of the bible.\n\n \n Again, you're holding up and emphasizing the' letter of the law' more than religious people even feel they have any need to.\n \n \nBut here's the thing.\n Who says that they were \"mistreating women\"?\n\n \n Yes, I have no qualms with that. Again, I think the beauty of Jesus' teachings is that we can realize they apply when it becomes clear to us a given action is harmful. No one ever said Jesus' teachings were a compendium of Don't-Do's, specifying every bad behavior imaginable. They are general teachings emphasizing treating others kindly.\n \n \nAre you admitting to Biblical self-contradiction?\n\n \n Admitting? I never said the Bible was without contradiction. To me the value of the Bible isn't in any sense of lacking contradiction. That it has contradictions is a red herring here.\n \n \nSimple.\n I hearby state that from here-on out, NO word shall be used that has the letter \"e\" in it.\n You hear me? NOBODY gets to use any word that has the letter \"e\" in it.\n \n See? Easy enough!\n\n \n But if you come back and change that, or indicate it isn't something meant to be a legalistic standard, it changes things in a realistic sense.",

   "First you try to tell me that because most people are religious, that means that atheism is wrong. \n\n \n Actually, no, I said no such thing.\n \n \nFinally you try to pull the fast one that Christianity is compatible with all the other religions, because there is no problem reconciling reason and faith!!!

Faith and reason are antithetical. No-one has ever reasoned their way to faith, they adopt faith because their reason fails.\n \n I look at the example of great fideists such as Martin Garner. Now, he's more a skeptic than I am and has made his living as a debunker of foolishness, yet he decided that when reason left him without recourse, he would make a leap of faith to some transcendental belief. I'm not sure what belief, but not one in your sort of a god. At any rate, more of a belief than I'd care for.\n \n Or let's take another example, a Catholic theologian, Hans K\u00fcng. He's spent his whole life trying to argue reasonably for some proof that god exists. Unlike many Christians, he is an honest man, and he openly admitted that there was no reasonable argument he could find to validate his faith. Everything he could think of had a counter argument or flaw in its logic. Yet, he said, he believes!\n \n Now, I can respect folk like Gardner and K\u00fcng, though I disagree with their leaps of faith. They feel they need to make those leaps of faith, coming from very different directions, but at least they have the insight and honesty to recognise their leaps of faith aren't based on reason. They are based on need and emotion. That, I can respect, though my emotional needs do not warrant such leaps of faith.\n \n Gardner and K\u00fcng are both eminently reasonable people, but both abandon reason when it no longers serves their purpose: emotional reassurance. Are they right? I don't think so, but at least they don't make a circus of trying to pretend their choices are based on reason.",

(You would actually have to specify which dice saw what for full math accuracy.)\n What you write down is JUST AS PROBABLE as snake-eyes five times in a row.\n \n If you were to roll five more times, what you wrote down would be just as likely as \"snake-eyes\" five times in a row.\n \n \n \nif you don't believe me, take some dice out and compare the amount of times you roll snake eyes in a row to the times that you don't.\n\n And you can do the same.\n Take some dice out, and see how many times you roll EXACTLY the sequence I named right there.\n It's just as probable.\n \n \n \nIt's a claim that, quite simply, rolling 5 snake eyes in a row is extremely, extremely improbable, to the point where, if someone prayed for it and it happened, it OUGHT to raise some eyebrows.\n\n And my other point is that when the prayer NOT being fulfilled is meaningless, the experiment holds no value.\n \n \n \nBut those are both things that can raise in probability depending on the actions the person takes. If person is standing on the top of a tall metal building in a thuderstorm, getting hit by lightning is NOT practically impossible at all. If a person buys up enough lottery tickets, the odds change to where winning the lottery is not so impossible. I'm talking about religious experiences for which there's really no other feasible explanation.\n\n Your own bible clearly states \"God sends rain upon the just and the unjust\".\n So when people who are not Christians wins the lottery, does that mean anything?\n When Christians pray for the lottery, multiplied by how many Christians do it and how many times they do it and fail, does THAT mean anything?\n \n You are only looking for AFFIRMING evidence, cause that's all you're willing to accept.\n \n And \"no other feasible explanation\" doesn't mean \"gotta be religion then\".\n Just because there is no CURRENT scientific explanation doesn't mean that science won't figure it out eventually.\n And there is no sense in assuming \"religion\" in the mean-time.\n \n Do you realize how much this game is rigged in your favor?\n You ONLY accept affirming evidence.\n You can claim \"religion did it\" whenever convenient and science doesn't have a good answer.\n And when science DOES eventually show what's really going on, you can simply claim \"oh. we were wrong\"\n The \"religion\" house always wins, cause everything works in its faith favor and nothing is accepted against it.\n \n \n \nBut no one ever claims to have Flying Speghetti Monster religious experiences, Foundit.\n\n How many people have seen God and said \"Yup! He's an old white guy in white robes with a beard\"?\n The fact that Christians picture God as the \"white guy in white robes with a beard\" simply demonstrates something about HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY.\n Your religion doesn't say anything about him NOT being a flying spaghetti monster, but for some reason (human psychology) he is pictured as NOT a flying spaghetti monster.\n \n \n \nAll these however, DO apply, for other religions. The comparison just isn't a very good one, and there's NOT equal weight of evidence.\n\n So, if we examine other religion's gods, like a skinny multi-armed chick, you'll accept that as a possibility for God?\n Or half man / half elephant?\n \n \n \nYou miss the point, Foundit. Jesus' teachings were general, to where it WASN'T an interpretation.\n\n I don't understand how you can actually say that last sentence.\n When directions are \"general\", without specifics, then all you can do is interpret.\n If God told you \"Go to Anchorage Alaska\", that would be fairly specific, for destination.\n But when would you get there?\n How would you travel?\n Would you step foot in the city limits, and then leave? Or would you spend some time there?\n This is all interpretation as to what YOU THINK \"go to Anchorage Alaska\" means.\n \n Christians in the past thought men and women had clearly different roles AS PART OF SERVICE TO GOD.\n After all, it was GOD who supposedly said these things, right? \"Divine inspiration\"?\n So they INTERPRETED ways of \"loving\" a person who was limited in their role in life.\n Heck. They even thought that men were \"similarly\" limited into a different role.\n \n \n \nThey just weren't making the connection to begin with. They were just acting within their culture, one in which these were not considered bad things. That's the GOOD thing about Jesus' teaching--it elevates Christianity to be applicable to such cases where people realize a given action is harmful, and therefore should be avoided. I fully realize that such is a changing-with-the-times concept, but I think that's part of the VALUE of Christianity, and part of Jesus' message.\n\n You still don't see this as \"interpretation\", even though God was EXPLICIT and on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS specified the misogyny in question?\n I guess the easiest way to refute this is to demonstrate \"love\" by putting gays with full equality, including marriage rights.\n \n \n \nAgain, you're holding up and emphasizing the' letter of the law' more than religious people even feel they have any need to.\n\n No.\n What I am doing is acknowledging the EXISTENCE of an explicit law, and not using some vague other law \"love thy neighbor\" to somehow ignore the first one.\n Otherwise, this tactic can be applied over and over.\n \n I understand the bible is against homosexuality.\n But, using your approach, I could just say \"you're emphasizing letter of the law\" and insist that the other bible passages are bypassable.\n After all, you can show \"love\" by \"accepting\", or at least \"tolerating\" other people.\n \n To some degree, I find it interesting how the people who HEARD the message could have gotten it so (supposedly) wrong, and when Jesus WAS THERE and saw his message applied, he didn't offer further guidance.\n But here we are a couple thousand years later, and we can see with crystal clarity words that the vast majority of people over that time somehow \"didn't get\".\n \n \n \nYes, I have no qualms with that. Again, I think the beauty of Jesus' teachings is that we can realize they apply when it becomes clear to us a given action is harmful. No one ever said Jesus' teachings were a compendium of Don't-Do's, specifying every bad behavior imaginable. They are general teachings emphasizing treating others kindly.\n\n To rephrase my point to match your rephrasing, \"Who says they were not treating women kindly?\"\n When they said that women could not be teachers or could not have authority, who is to determine they were not treating women kindly?\n \n \n \nAdmitting? I never said the Bible was without contradiction. To me the value of the Bible isn't in any sense of lacking contradiction. That it has contradictions is a red herring here.\n\n No. It's very relevant.\n The bible talks about God being unchanging, omniscient, and just.\n But then, he just changes the rules around? What was \"just\" one day, is not \"just\" the next?\n What happened?\n \n \n \nBut if you come back and change that, or indicate it isn't something meant to be a legalistic standard, it changes things in a realistic sense.\n\n We've got a situation where a \"king\" stated that people cannot work on the Sabbaoth.\n In a very clear historical example, he demonstrated what that meant.\n Then, many years later after the law had been applied that way, the king is busted violating the standard he set in that \"clear historical example\".\n Would it be seen as a matter of selfish convenience for the king? Or just indicating it was \"meant\" to be something else?\n \n I think the fact that we are talking about YOUR God is changing your response to the two situations...",

   "snopes.com: Petition to Ban Religious Broadcasting\n People start these e-mail rumors. Unless we're going to proclaim \"divine knowledge\" that was just plain false, somebody started by LYING about it in the first place.\n\n \n Not sure what an email rumor about a tv programming has to do with whether we should accept religious experience as evidence, but whatever.\n \n \nWe could say the same thing about some people regarding aliens or ghosts or the abominable snowman.\n They THINK they \"experience\" something that they assign the INTERPRETATION of \"miracle\" to.\n\n \n YES, we could. No problem there. If enough people say they have seen aliens, at some point it might be worthwhile to consider whether we are being visited by extraterrestials or not. At what point are you willing to EVER consider that ... where there's smoke, there may actually be fire?\n \n \nI reject it based on a lack of independent, objective corroboration.\n If you have a \"miracle\" you want to present, then please do so.\n Otherwise, you're proving just how ridiculously subjective this claim is.\n \n We are quickly moving to an area where you need to give an example.\n Something that has sufficient information to analyze, and not just \"A friend of mine had a sister who heard a co-worker who had...\"\n \n\n \n Is there really any point? Are you REALLY open to the possibility of supernatural miracles? Because I don't think you are. I think you'll assume ANYTHING ELSE as a possibility, no matter what, before you would give credence to the actual possibility of God having actually healed someone. Be honest .... it's true isn't it? \n \n \nI don't see how you can say that.\n \"unexplainable occurrence\" is the most accurate. And moreover, accurate FOR THAT TIME, because in the future it MAY BE explainable.\n\n \n That's fine, I have no problem with that terminology if it helps you get past the baggage the term \"miracle\" carries for you.\n \n \nSo PEOPLE TODAY who claim to have talked to God.\n You listen to them?\n You \"accept\" their claims as \"evidence\"?\n\n \n For evidence that the supernatural exists--God or whatever--? Why not? \n \n \nSaying \"supernatural\" essentially boils down to a phenomenon that has no current scientific explanation.\n\n \n Isn't that essentially what a 'miracle' is?\n \n \nLet me be more explicit.\n When something happens that is not readily explainable, and religion buts in and proclaims \"I know what it is because it is convenient for me to proclaim this as *religion*\", that isn't evidence.\n When there is just as much evidence saying \"God did this\" as an opposing view-point of \"The devil did this same exact thing\", then it's not really \"evidence\" at all.\n THAT is why I reject religious INTERPRETATIONS as evidence.\n\n \n I'm not saying we should take religious experiences as evidence that, say, Zeus is the defacto god. Or that the real God is Yahweh. I'm saying that I see no reason why religious experience shouldn't be taken into account in terms of the whole idea that there's something out there other than out natural world. That the supernatural exists. To disqualify a whole category of experience over this seems like an unreasonable approach to me. If you are going to disqualify such experience as evidence, then how do you account for it? Worldwide hallucinations? Nearly EVERYONE succumbing to wishful-thinking? I mean, come on. \n \n \nAnd my point is that if somebody can come along, with the exact same scenario, and replace \"God\" with \"Satan\" or \"flying spaghetti monster\", then you have just demonstrated why it is not proof of \"God\" at all.\n\n \n Except, again, people aren't claiming experiences from the flying speghetti monster, and when they claim experiences by 'Satan', it's usually rather negative. The weight of evidence for all these are far from equal.\n \n \nI reject religious \"experience\" when it is actually religious INTERPRETATION.\n\n \n This is the second time you've brought up \"interpretation.\" What do you mean by that? What makes an experience an 'interpretation' as opposed to NOT being one? And how is ANY experience not subject to interpretation anyway? As humans, we have to process what we experience. That's part of using our senses and experiencing things.\n \n \nYour own bible clearly states \"God sends rain upon the just and the unjust\".\n So when people who are not Christians wins the lottery, does that mean anything?\n When Christians pray for the lottery, multiplied by how many Christians do it and how many times they do it and fail, does THAT mean anything?\n\n \n The examples we gave were that someone PRAYED for something to happen and it then happened. Frankly, whether or not someone is \"Just\" (the passage you mentioned) seems irrelevant here--the validity of supernatural events and praying for something then getting it is a separate issue from whether someone is just or not. Are we to assume you don't think an UNjust person can pray for something and get it, but a just person can? I don't think so. The passage doesn't contradict anything. It just means an UNjust person may have their prayers answered TOO.\n \n \nAnd \"no other feasible explanation\" doesn't mean \"gotta be religion then\".\n Just because there is no CURRENT scientific explanation doesn't mean that science won't figure it out eventually.\n And there is no sense in assuming \"religion\" in the mean-time.\n\n \n And there's the bottom line, really.\n \n Who cares if people assume religion in the mean-time? It's not like reason has lost out, if science couldn't explain it anyway. What difference does it make? Who cares if people fill in the gaps with \"God\" when there's nothing else to fill in the gaps with? If science proves something else there instead, then the world will eventually come around. May take awhile, but they always do. What are you worried about? It's the whole idea that people put forth saying \"you can use ANYTHING but God\" when there's no alternative ANYWAY that I find unacceptable. \n \n \nDo you realize how much this game is rigged in your favor?\n You ONLY accept affirming evidence.\n You can claim \"religion did it\" whenever convenient and science doesn't have a good answer.\n And when science DOES eventually show what's really going on, you can simply claim \"oh. we were wrong\"\n The \"religion\" house always wins\n\n \n So what???!! Why is that a problem? Why does religion have to lose, in your thinking anyway? You said yourself that \"when science does eventually show what's really going on\". If science does that, then hey, what are you worried about?\n \n \nHow many people have seen God and said \"Yup! He's an old white guy in white robes with a beard\"?\n The fact that Christians picture God as the \"white guy in white robes with a beard\" simply demonstrates something about HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY.\n Your religion doesn't say anything about him NOT being a flying spaghetti monster, but for some reason (human psychology) he is pictured as NOT a flying spaghetti monster.\n\n \n See, this is a perfect example of the issue of consistence being used (by you) when it's convenient, but not when it's NOT convenient. You have no problem using the 'consistency' thing (that so many more have pictured God as an old guy with a beard) to show psychology, but you refuse to take that consistency into account when it comes to giving the experiences any validity. You play up the DIFFERENCES if it's something you don't want to give any validity to, but then play up CONSISTENCIES if you're trying to prove something ELSE. It's true that religious experience has many different ways of having seen supernatural, but at the very least, the ways which are widespread should be considered.\n \n \nYou still don't see this as \"interpretation\", even though God was EXPLICIT and on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS specified the misogyny in question?\n I guess the easiest way to refute this is to demonstrate \"love\" by putting gays with full equality, including marriage rights.\n\n \n Sigh. Does everything always go back to that one issue for you? Tell you what, if I said 'yes' that Jesus' teachings on love SHOULD mean we should give gays full equality and marriage rights, would you then stop trying to find anything you can grab onto here to play against Jesus' teaching on love? (Because you're always going to be able to find SOMETHING out there where people aren't living up to perfection. If that weren't the case, Jesus wouldn't have needed to teach that.) And would you stop taking moralistic issues and playing them against the teachings of Christ, as if loving people means we have to accept a given behavior and give up the view that it's sinful? \n \n \nWe've got a situation where a \"king\" stated that people cannot work on the Sabbaoth.\n In a very clear historical example, he demonstrated what that meant.\n Then, many years later after the law had been applied that way, the king is busted violating the standard he set in that \"clear historical example\".\n Would it be seen as a matter of selfish convenience for the king?\n\n \n Not if it was never meant to be taken so unbelievably legalistic to begin with. To the point of leaving the ox in the ditch. The referendum that Jesus was making was on the way that people had taken it TOO FAR, not on the law itself. That's why he said \"sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.\"",

Why not? \n\n Please reference MrWriteLA's article above and tell me whether or not YOU are \"open\" to believing it was truly God that spoke to him...\n \n \n \nIsn't that essentially what a 'miracle' is?\n\n No.\n miracle: an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs\n If \"miracle\" was the same as \"unexplained phenomenon\", then there is no religious claim to the issue.\n \n I see a serious problem in thinking that \"miracle\" is the same thing as \"unexplained phenomenon\".\n \n \n \nI'm not saying we should take religious experiences as evidence that, say, Zeus is the defacto god. Or that the real God is Yahweh. I'm saying that I see no reason why religious experience shouldn't be taken into account in terms of the whole idea that there's something out there other than out natural world. That the supernatural exists.\n\n Different terms are getting bounced around with different interpretations.\n \"Supernatural\" includes different definitions. supernatural - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n One establishes the involvement of a \"God\" or other religious figure.\n Another establishes \" departing from what is usual or normal especially so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature\"\n I use the term as the latter, which does not utilize any assumed involvement of God. And with the latter definition, I believe \"supernatural\" exists.\n \n But to assume that God or another religious entity is automatically involved? That is unfounded.\n \n \n \nTo disqualify a whole category of experience over this seems like an unreasonable approach to me.\n\n Okay. Enough of this.\n A \"whole category\" of WHAT experience?\n \n Can you tell me WHAT experience you are ACTUALLY referring to without having to resort to a Google search (or other search engine) in order to try to come up with something to answer that question?\n \n Cause to me, it looks like people talk about \"religious experiences\", but ALL of them are either hearsay, or just plain ASSUMED.\n \n \n \nIf you are going to disqualify such experience as evidence, then how do you account for it? Worldwide hallucinations? Nearly EVERYONE succumbing to wishful-thinking? I mean, come on.\n\n How can I \"discount\" what I haven't even been shown?\n \n You CLAIM \"experiences\" as evidence, but you have yet to SHOW ANY such experiences you would like to be considered as evidence. \n \n \n \nExcept, again, people aren't claiming experiences from the flying speghetti monster, and when they claim experiences by 'Satan', it's usually rather negative. The weight of evidence for all these are far from equal.\n\n Again, I reference Ergot poisoning.\n Add on \"power of suggestion\" and similar issues.\n \n And the \"weight\" of the evidence you have shown is zero, cause you have yet to show any.\n \n \n \nThis is the second time you've brought up \"interpretation.\" What do you mean by that? What makes an experience an 'interpretation' as opposed to NOT being one? And how is ANY experience not subject to interpretation anyway? As humans, we have to process what we experience. That's part of using our senses and experiencing things.\n\n Earlier you mentioned nature being both evidence FOR and AGAINST God.\n That's \"interpretation\".\n \n I am not criticizing \"processing what we experience\", but rather questioning the LEGITIMACY of a person's claim as to the interpretation of what the FACTS mean.\n If a doctor says \"you should have died\", the fact that his expert opinion concluded \"this patient should have died\" is a fact.\n Whether it means \"miracle\" is an entirely separate issue. Some may attribute it to a mind-body connection.\n \n There have been a variety of studies on \"prayer\" and well-being. One interesting thing observed was that it was the fact that the prayer OCCURRED which improved well-being, independent of WHO was prayed to.\n Praying to Satan or Jesus would give the same results...\n Indicates something about \"interpretation\", doesn't it?\n \n \n \nThe examples we gave were that someone PRAYED for something to happen and it then happened.\n\n Feh.\n NO \"examples\" were actually \"given\".\n Furthermore, what about the people who DID NOT pray, and still got better?\n What about the people who prayed TO ANOTHER GOD, and still got better?\n What about the people who prayed, AND STILL DIED?\n \n These are all things to consider.\n \n \n \nFrankly, whether or not someone is \"Just\" (the passage you mentioned) seems irrelevant here--the validity of supernatural events and praying for something then getting it is a separate issue from whether someone is just or not. Are we to assume you don't think an UNjust person can pray for something and get it, but a just person can? I don't think so. The passage doesn't contradict anything.\n\n The passage demonstrates a truth.\n People who pray to Jehovah and people who don't pray to Jehovah BOTH get what you would call as \"miracles\".\n THAT is the point.\n \n It gets back to the \"game is rigged for the house\" situation.\n If OVER and OVER again you assume \"evidence\" for the existence of God, but NEVER take into account the \"evidence\" AGAINST the existence of God.\n A person could HYPOTHETICALLY pray for snake-eyes five times in a row, and that would be \"evidence\" in your opinion.\n But when that person DOES NOT get snake-eyes, it's meaningless to you.\n \n \n \nWho cares if people assume religion in the mean-time?\n\n You've lost sight of where this conversation started.\n It's about the fact that REASON and FAITH are mutually exclusive.\n This is ALL a demonstration of how \"faith\" kicks \"reason\" to the curb.\n THAT is the point.\n \n \n \nIt's not like reason has lost out, if science couldn't explain it anyway. What difference does it make? Who cares if people fill in the gaps with \"God\" when there's nothing else to fill in the gaps with?\n\n Ask Galileo that question.\n Ask the people who could be helped by stem cell research, but religion impedes advancement.\n Today, we have medical cadavers that doctors and surgeons cut into to learn about anatomy.\n But in the past, \"religion\" told us that cutting dead bodies was immoral, and we didn't know much of anything about anatomy because religion impeded knowledge.\n \n And how many of those people who assume \"miracle\"? How many of them do you think are looking for the underlying issue going on?\n \n \n \nIf science proves something else there instead, then the world will eventually come around. May take awhile, but they always do. What are you worried about?\n\n Who says I'm worried?\n I'm just observing the nature of things.\n This whole discussion started on the mutual exclusivity of reason and faith. That difference was ALREADY ESTABLISHED BY THE DICTIONARY.\n Should I ask you why that mutual exclusivity \"worries\" you?\n \n \n \nIt's the whole idea that people put forth saying \"you can use ANYTHING but God\" when there's no alternative ANYWAY that I find unacceptable. \n\n I don't care what people use.\n I don't say what you said \"people put forth\".\n I put forth that it is more intelligent to say \"I don't know\" then to just assume \"God\".\n \n \n \nSo what???!! Why is that a problem? Why does religion have to lose, in your thinking anyway? You said yourself that \"when science does eventually show what's really going on\". If science does that, then hey, what are you worried about?\n\n Cut with the attempt to assign emotion to this. I am not worried.\n THIS is yet another demonstration of why there is no REASON to the \"faith\" based on \"miracles\".\n One part of the \"scientific standard\" is that a scientific theory must have the capability of being DISPROVABLE.\n \n If I were to say \"There is an invisible unicorn under my bed. If you try to find him, he runs away and returns when you stop looking for him\", that isn't a \"scientific theory\" cause it is untestable.\n If I call him, and a breeze comes by, I could call that \"evidence\" as he ran by really fast.\n If I call him, and no breeze occurs, it doesn't matter.\n \n REASON applies standards of logic and evidence.\n The reason I brought it up is because it is another demonstration of why \"faith\" and \"reason\" are mutually exclusive.\n \n \n \nSee, this is a perfect example of the issue of consistence being used (by you) when it's convenient, but not when it's NOT convenient. You have no problem using the 'consistency' thing (that so many more have pictured God as an old guy with a beard) to show psychology, but you refuse to take that consistency into account when it comes to giving the experiences any validity.\n\n Say whaaa?\n I point to a proven phenomenon to explain why a phenomenon happens. People even humanize animals with human emotions.\n You come up with an alternate explanation, with no real justification other than interpretation. I mean, it's not like anybody has drawn a picture of God FROM MEMORY.\n \n So I am baffled as to how this \"consistency\" is somehow meaning something when nobody has even seen God as this...\n Are you seriously telling me that you are trying to offer evidence that God is somehow an old guy in white robes with a beard???\n \n Another piece of evidence? How many people draw JESUS as a white guy, with a brown beard and long brown hair?\n WHERE is the evidence that Jesus was white???\n It's people drawing WHAT THEY WANT Jesus to be, and the consistency demonstrates the fallacy of what you want to consider as \"evidence\".\n \n \n \nYou play up the DIFFERENCES if it's something you don't want to give any validity to, but then play up CONSISTENCIES if you're trying to prove something ELSE. It's true that religious experience has many different ways of having seen supernatural, but at the very least, the ways which are widespread should be considered.\n\n A desire to interpret separate of reason is not evidence of anything.\n There are all sorts of COMMON superstitions, but we accept that they don't mean anything.\n Cultures have a long history of trying to discern meaning from the stars, but do we think \"God's placement\" of stars is somehow a \"divine message\"?\n \n \"Widespread\" is meaningless.\n Your \"God gene\" articles give a better explanation for WHY it could be \"wide-spread\" than anything else.\n \n \n \nSigh. Does everything always go back to that one issue for you?\n\n I see it as the most extreme inconsistency in Christianity today.\n Christ gives EXPLICIT guidance on divorce. Christians ignore it.\n Yet, there is a fixation on gay issues EXTERIOR to the lives of Christians.\n \n A Christian should be able to see the \"mote in the eye / beam in your own eye\" passage and come to a conclusion about how they should observe the Bible's standards on homosexuality and divorce in THEIR OWN lives.\n But instead, there is a large push to make OTHER PEOPLE THEY NEVER MET be restricted in their lives.\n \n \n [quoet=jyoshu]Tell you what, if I said 'yes' that Jesus' teachings on love SHOULD mean we should give gays full equality and marriage rights, would you then stop trying to find anything you can grab onto here to play against Jesus' teaching on love?[/quote]\n My issue is NOT \"against Jesus' teaching on love\", but rather the attempt to use it as an excuse for why Christianity supposedly developed to a place that CONTRADICTS other bible passages.\n It was good ol' REASON and SECULAR morality which got Christianity to contradict the ACTUAL bible passages.\n The apologetics came later.\n \n \n \nAnd would you stop taking moralistic issues and playing them against the teachings of Christ, as if loving people means we have to accept a given behavior and give up the view that it's sinful?\n\n Jyoshu, I am only talking about CONSISTENCY here.\n The bible CLEARLY establishes misogynistic standards for women.\n Yet today, Christians CLEARLY IGNORE those misogynistic standards for women.\n \n If you are using these SPECIFIC bible passages to VOID others, it is illogical to not do the same for other issues.\n \n Christians ACCEPT violation of the misogynistic bible passages.\n The truth is that I am not even asking for \"acceptance\", but rather just TOLERANCE so that other people (gays) can live their lives as they see fit.\n \n \n \nNot if it was never meant to be taken so unbelievably legalistic to begin with.\n\n So sayeth you.\n Like I said, Moses and Manna in the desert.\n It's an example you have not even tried to respond to.\n You're dodging the issue.\n \n \n \nTo the point of leaving the ox in the ditch.\n\n I acknowledge there are exceptions.\n As the Moses and the Manna in the Desert legal precedent established, gathering food IS NOT one of those exceptions.\n \n \n \nThe referendum that Jesus was making was on the way that people had taken it TOO FAR, not on the law itself.\n\n NO.\n NOT people.\n GOD set that standard with Moses and Manna in the Desert.\n \n \n \nThat's why he said \"sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.\"\n\n Which should be consistent with the PREVIOUS legal precedent of Moses and Manna in the Desert.\n (You get the feeling yet that you can't just ignore that integral part of the issue?)",

And there are aspects of religion that seem to go beyond the ascribed purpose of trying to explain nature--some 'doctrines' are, after all, quite complicated and don't seem to have anything to do with nature.\n\n \n Let's just take a look at this, for example. If all religions were independently sprung, then one might look at consistencies between them as being truly revelatory of some deeper meaning or belief. But this implies that religions come into existence in cultural vacuums, without any antecedents, which is clearly not the case. Christianity, for example, borrowed heavily from Hebrew and pagan faiths of its early days.\n \n In evolutionary science, biologists universally recognise that despite the occurrence of convergent evolution (think sharks and dolphins), such examples are relatively superficial, and on closer examination, deep similarities are the result of common inheritance. (Biologists would never conclude any close relationship between sharks and dolphins, despite superficial similarities, because the deeper differences are apparent on closer inspection.)\n \n Linguists observe the same phenomenon in languages, and there is a gratifying correlation between the distribution of gene pools and languages across the world. Deep similarities between languages are more often the result of common descent rather than remarkable coincidence. Unfortunately for linguists, languages change far more rapidly than gene pools, so it isn't possible to trace linguistic family trees too far back into human history.\n \n So why be too surprised to find commonalities in religions? Religions have a particular habit of schismatism, probably more prolific than that of languages, because languages in a geographical or cultural region tend to change relatively uniformly for the whole population, whereas off-shoots of religions happen within a population as believers disagree with each other about the \"true\" meaning of some piece of scripture. While all these changes need an isolation mechanism, this is probably less difficult for religion than for genetic or linguistic change -- two sets of believers just have to meet in two different buildings and rarely interact with each other. It's harder to prevent linguistic or genetic cross-fertilisation when there is free movement of people across a region.\n \n So the notion that consistency between religions reflects a deep truth about nature is not as solid as it might at first sight seem. Worse, any consistency not attributable to common descent might merely be reflective of a common human nature, rather than any deep truth about Nature with a capital N. Just because humans across the globe, with the noble exception of us atheists, agnostics and other free thinkers who buck the trend, tend to believe in some sort of deity in the singular or plural, is not obviously evidence that such deities are real. It may just be that human minds are predisposed to look to authority figures and explanations of the unknown, and confabulate them when they don't exist or cannot be seen.",

Folk like jyosh will never get it in a million years, because they've been taught to love religion yet respect reason. They can't question religion, so they cannot apply reason. Consequently, they do not understand the contradiction, because they have to be blind to it.\n\n \n I mentioned earlier Thomas Szasz' man talking to a lamppost. In terms of religious beliefs. I think a fertilized ovum -- nothing more and nothing less -- and the abortion \"debate\" -- is something like that lamppost. A person can go ahead and attribute something more to it -- and believe that this \"something else\" is from other than their own perceptions. It's when s/he wants everyone else to see their perceptions as the equivalent of empirical evidence -- or for everyone else to conform their behavior to ideas or morals reasoned on that basis -- that we have a problem. As long as people can distinguish between the map of evidence and reason, and a map of faith -- we're doing fine. \n \n Loss of that ability to distinguish between the two, though, doesn't seem to fall solely to persons overtly identified with a religion. That is, sometimes a person -- simply because they see themselves as non-religious, agnostic, or atheist -- may be even more prone to confuse the two. More seeped in denial. \"How can be I be unreasonable or faith-based? I'm not a religious 'believer'!\" This is the source of my dispute with Winston. A self-described agnostic emphatically concluding that a fertilized ovum is a \"nonsentient human being\". And that, abortion is a \"heinous crime\".

   "I mentioned earlier Thomas Szasz' man talking to a lamppost. In terms of religious beliefs. I think a fertilized ovum -- nothing more and nothing less -- and the abortion \"debate\" -- is something like that lamppost. A person can go ahead and attribute something more to it -- and believe that this \"something else\" is from other than their own perceptions. It's when s/he wants everyone else to see their perceptions as the equivalent of empirical evidence -- or for everyone else to conform their behavior to ideas or morals reasoned on that basis -- that we have a problem. As long as people can distinguish between the map of evidence and reason, and a map of faith -- we're doing fine. \n \n Loss of that ability to distinguish between the two, though, doesn't seem to fall solely to persons overtly identified with a religion. That is, sometimes a person -- simply because they see themselves as non-religious, agnostic, or atheist -- may be even more prone to confuse the two. More seeped in denial. \"How can be I be unreasonable or faith-based? I'm not a religious 'believer'!\" This is the source of my dispute with Winston. A self-described agnostic emphatically concluding that a fertilized ovum is a \"nonsentient human being\". And that, abortion is a \"heinous crime\". By all facts, a fertilized ovum is only that, and nothing more or less. So, it seems to me, attributing anything else is a kind of religious thinking.\n \n In any case, the person is no longer operating with the map of evidence and reason -- and, they fail to see it for what it is. They have confused the map with the territory.\n\n \n Just briefly, because I don't want to get into the abortion wars at the moment, I think that a mistake some folk make is to suppose either that it makes sense to draw a line in some continuum, e.g. the development of a fertilised egg into an adult, sentient human being, or to go to the opposite extreme and say that because we are dealing with a continuum, we must therefore plump for every stage of it as being either one thing or the other.\n \n This seems to me to be the allure for the dichotomous mind: everything must be one thing or another... nothing can be anywhere in between, because the middle is excluded by definition. While some aspects of nature can be regarded dualistically, e.g. the bits streaming through an Internet link always have value of 1 or 0, with nothing in between, because it is a binary system, more often we come across gradualist or multivalued systems, such as the development of an embryo or the turning of day into night.\n \n So it seems to me that demanding clear-cut distinctions between one moment of embryological development and another is pointless. This doesn't mean, though, that we are obliged to assume that because such a distinctive point does not, in fact, exist, because sentience probably emerges gradually rather than springing into existence fully formed, we have to treat all stages alike. We don't, anyway. We certainly don't treat born children the way we treat adults, for example -- they don't get to vote, apply for driving licenses, drink legally in public and so on. Rights develop with sentience, is my view, which is why I can regard the fertilised egg, or even first trimester foetus, as having many fewer rights than a sentient adult. I don't treat it in a dualistic way, however, nor do I have to specify at what specific point the \"magical\" transformation happens, because there is no such point that we have identified.",

Having decided some time back already, that the less we dialogue about abortion, the better. The fundamentalists -- self-professed agnostics (like Winston, as above) or not -- are not worth the effort. We're at a point in history where people are simply going to have to accept the law. And they will. They will adapt as the courts take on new judges who will reflect our more modern times and understandings.\n \n Sarah Palin was interestingly upset because, she said, freedom of speech around abortion was being quashed. I was intrigued by that remark because never before has there been so much dialogue and room for the anti-choice movement to discuss their ideas. But many people are losing interest in discussion, after going at it so much, and basically discovering one brick wall after the next. And she was now trying to make their group persecuted in some respect, because people just aren't that interested in talking to them about it anymore. That lack of interest represented, to her, their free speech rights being denied in some respect.\n \n Of course, these views are a good example of how religion and science simply are not compatible.

Partly because the faith based side of the argument, among anti-choicers, is not able to distinguish their views from the map of reason and empirical evidence.

She did all of us a favour by being refreshingly revealing about her vacuity. If we are really lucky, what is left of the GOP will turn her into their spokeswoman. The last nail in their coffin.\n \n It is fairly typical of fundy types to complain that when decent folk refuse to allow them to tyrannise others, they are being tyrannised themselves.

The ABR approach.\n\n \n As someone else has in their footy thingy, I'll go along with Mencken, a writer whose views I have mixed feelings about. But I can relate to this one in paraphrase: I respect someone's religious beliefs the same way I respect their opinion their spouse is attractive and their children intelligent. I'm not going to make a scene about your tawdry religion in your church, but don't expect it to get a free pass in a religious discussion forum.\n \n Yes, I have no intellectual respect for theism. I think it is truly flabby thinking. But your foolish accusation that therefore I am intolerant of religious believers is a plain lie on your part, and not the first heinous personal attack of yours on others. Of course, you wouldn't understand what tolerance entails: it does not entail agreement, it entails sufferance.\n \n We atheists are long suffering victims of religious ideologues. Most of the intolerance lies on your side. As for poor old Anthony Flew, it's no wonder you appreciate another flabby thinker. His problem is probably senility: what's yours?\n \n And as for theists questioning their religion, that's a laugh! Yes, they do question other people's religion, but like you, the vast majority of them get downright hostile if anyone questions theirs. \n \n Now, there are a handful of religious philosophers who have questioned their own religion -- usually to be repudiated by the churches they came from. Hans Kung springs to mind. You aren't one of them.\n \n I cannot prevent religion or entirely escape its dire consequences in its enactment by True Believers. What I can do is oppose it in the interests of truth and honesty. There is no reason in religion. It exists purely on emotional terms. It's like support for a sports team or nation-tribe: irrational and faith-based. I'll have no truck with that sort of thinking. I had enough of it when I was younger, and it's demonstrably damaging to innocents.\n \n Samuel Johnson famously remarked that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. Perhaps that's because religion is the first. Scoundrels hit all the emotional spots to gull people.",
