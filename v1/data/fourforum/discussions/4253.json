People selling the books to get rid of that syndrome have it, since they are trying to profit from others.. it is all about them.\n \n The ritualistic method of getting rid of the \"It's all about me\" syndrome might work for others,but won't change many, nor the cause of \"It's all about me\".\n \n Each person should have their own methods and paths to get rid of the 'It's all about me' syndrome. It is always going to be an on going process. People's ego will get in the way. Just as you start doing all the things the way you think you should, and you think you have it down pat, your ego will pop up, pat you on the back, and say \"Pretty good\", and you will have to start all over again.. since that will be about you.",

   "Good morning, Greg.\n \n You ought not to get all riled up over them yard birds... :) \n \n As far as \"turning someone on to God\", there has always been and will always be only one positive way: the Word of God via the Holy Spirit.\n \n I can't even imagine how many books, CDs, tapes, etc. there are out there that give their flavor of the Word or Its meaning, but as of yet been unable to do so. Why? Because the Bible contains the Living Word, i.e., instruction directly from God to us via the Holy Spirit. Each person under His guidance will benefit differently from a particular passage of scripture. That's the way it's intended and why the Spirit of God is required. But, preachers, ministers, priests, etc. are also required in order to teach us as a group, in order to keep us like-minded since we have no alternative but to live in the flesh. While still in these earthly bodies we have to contend with earthly problems and having someone to turn to here is a blessing, someone who inspires us to keep going - to tie a knot in the end of our rope when we are at the very end of it. In that way we not only have a relationship with God, but with our allies. While God can lift our Spirits our friends can lift our bodies; while God can inspire us to hold on, our friends can cheer us on. In this way love can thoroughly flourish and we can see and feel it.\n \n So, it's not always money-hungry fiends pushing religion on TV that can cause us to stumble, but, most of the time, it's ourselves failing to understand who the true Helper is and why He's always there.\n \n And another thing: Of all the \"power of positive thinking\" assumptions out there only one is truly positive - and that is Christ's Gospel.\n In 1 Corinthians 12 thru 16 we are told: We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the things freely given us by God. And we speak about them not with words taught by human wisdom, but with words taught by the Spirit, describing spiritual realities in spiritual terms. Now the natural person does not accept what pertains to the Spirit of God, for to him it is foolishness, and he cannot understand it, because it is judged spiritually. The spiritual person, however, can judge everything but is not subject to judgment by anyone. For \"who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to counsel him?\" But we have the mind of Christ. \n \n There is only one way to get the mind of Christ and that is to just let go of ourselves and allow Him to take over. In doing so we can discern any and all messages coming from man and/or the powers of darkness. In doing so we see, hear and feel what we need from Him and what He wants for us.",

   "trebor, what if they just give it away? the \"all about me\" syndrome talks about an attitude, not a result. even if i become a multi-millionaire through helping others around me, the \"its not about me\" syndrome is the internal drive, not the measure of the outcome. looking from an outward perspective, we cannot always judge someone else's motive. we might see a selfish result of someone's activity, but that doesnt mean the person is acting with a selfish motive\n \n and no, the belief in God is not necessary for this philosophy to work. many concepts in the bible hold true regardless of the context; religious or secular. helping others to get what you want will help you get what you want. but it wont work if you are driven by he desire to get what you want",

   "I think religion actually promotes the idea of \"it's all about me\". I mean they believe that this whole world was created for humans? It seems the bible addresses the rest of the planet just for us (please correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't read the bible). The other animals are just food for us. We were created by a supreme intelligence because \"we are too smart not to have been created by intelligence\". This is pretty close to an exact quote on another forum about creation. It is possible to worship god and not make it \"all about me\" but many use religion as an excuse to make it \"all about me\".",

   "Many zen teachings tell you that the world is a mirroe, how you treat yourself is how others will treat you. So having a little\"it's all about me is good\" When you treat yourself like you are worth something, so will others. When you lie to yourself others will lie to you. etc....\n \n So if things are all about \"me\" that is good as long as you are good to yourself honestly. If you are buying yourself a new shirt to be good to yourself, others will be good toyou. It was good you bought the shirt. If you bought the new shirt to impress others, then you weren't being good to you, you motive was outside you. So others will see through this and the shirt won't be a good thing. It is more complex than I have made it. In fact my example wasn't great, but I think you guys get the idea.",

I have my own belief, but look forward to reading other opinions ,\n\n \n Greg, you ask a very legitimate and valuable question. I think most people come to God initially to find out who they are. It is normal. The world suffers a terrible identity crisis. What they wind up finding is that who they are is intricately tied up in who God is. As they see him more clearly, they see themselves more clearly, and suddenly, they begin to notice that others exist in the world.\n \n Once I know that I am taken care of because God doesn't let anything slide by him to me, and even though it may feel like he is not there, when I know anyway that I am fully cared for, then and only then, can I truly look outside myself and begin to care for others. \n \n It starts slow at first and grows as you come to a greater knowledge, and emotional faith in Him.\n \n I think this is true of non christians who also know they are cared for (somehow) and it is what leads to something akin to altruism.\n \n This is my opinion.\n \n I would suggest a book called \"True Faced\" on this subject. You will find it highly instructional here.\n \n EF",
