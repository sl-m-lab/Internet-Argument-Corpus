   "Will California become America's first failed state?\n Los Angeles, 2009: California may be the eighth largest economy in the world, but its state staff are being paid in IOUs, unemployment is at its highest in 70 years, and teachers are on hunger strike. So what has gone so catastrophically wrong?\n \n .... But the state that was once held up as the epitome of the boundless opportunities of America has collapsed. From its politics to its economy to its environment and way of life, California is like a patient on life support. At the start of summer the state government was so deeply in debt that it began to issue IOUs instead of wages. Its unemployment rate has soared to more than 12%, the highest figure in 70 years. Desperate to pay off a crippling budget deficit, California is slashing spending in education and healthcare, laying off vast numbers of workers and forcing others to take unpaid leave. In a state made up of sprawling suburbs the collapse of the housing bubble has impoverished millions and kicked tens of thousands of families out of their homes. Its political system is locked in paralysis and the two-term rule of former movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen as a disaster - his approval ratings having sunk to levels that would make George W Bush blush. The crisis is so deep that Professor Kenneth Starr, who has written an acclaimed history of the state, recently declared: \"California is on the verge of becoming the first failed state in America.\"\n\n Will California become America's first failed state? | World news | The Observer\n \n Made manifest by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the anti-government economic policies of Grover Norquist.",

   "Norquist, along with Bill Kristol, Ralph E. Reed, Jr., Clint Bolick, and David McIntosh, is one of the so-called \"Gang of Five\" identified in Nina Easton's 2000 book by that name, which gives a history of leaders of the modern (post-Goldwater) conservative movement. He has been described as \"a thumb-in-the-eye radical rightist\", and \"Tom Paine crossed with Lee Atwater plus just a soup\u00e7on of Madame Defarge\". Norquist's page on the web site of Americans for Tax Reform includes a laudatory quote about him from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Indeed, Norquist was one of the co-authors of the 1994 Contract with America.\n \n In 1999, he was instrumental in securing early support for then Texas Governor George W. Bush, continuing a decades-long association with Karl Rove (\"The Wall Street Journal's John Fund dubbed him \"the Grand Central Station\" of conservatism and told The Nation: \"It's not disputable\" that Norquist was the key to the Bush campaign's surprising level of support from movement conservatives in 2000\"). After Bush's election to the White House in 2000, Norquist was the prime architect behind the many Bush tax-cuts (\"Grover Norquist: 'Field Marshal' of the Bush Plan\").\n\n Grover Norquist - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "Friedman is talking about Katrina:\n \nAn administration whose tax policy has been dominated by the toweringly selfish Grover Norquist - who has been quoted as saying: \"I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub\" - doesn't have the instincts for this moment. Mr. Norquist is the only person about whom I would say this: I hope he owns property around the New Orleans levee that was never properly finished because of a lack of tax dollars. I hope his basement got flooded. And I hope that he was busy drowning government in his bathtub when the levee broke and that he had to wait for a U.S. Army helicopter to get out of town.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/opinion/07friedman.html\n \n Friedman goes so far as to say this about Bush and Cheney:\n \nWell, if 9/11 is one bookend of the Bush administration, Katrina may be the other. If 9/11 put the wind at President Bush's back, Katrina's put the wind in his face. If the Bush-Cheney team seemed to be the right guys to deal with Osama, they seem exactly the wrong guys to deal with Katrina - and all the rot and misplaced priorities it's exposed here at home.\n \n These are people so much better at inflicting pain than feeling it, so much better at taking things apart than putting them together, so much better at defending \"intelligent design\" as a theology than practicing it as a policy. \n\n \"These are people so much better at inflicting pain than feeling it... \"\n \n Torture memos, anyone?\n \n But we must not forget the role that Norquist played in the destruction of California, August 7, 2008:\n \nAssemblymember Evans on the California Republican Budget Strategy and Their Grover Norquist Inspired Constitutional Amendment\n Nearly a month after the Budget Conference Committee concluded its work on a balanced budget for California, Republicans continue to hold the budget hostage by failing to state how they would create a budget for California. The following is a statement from Assemblymember Noreen Evans (D-Santa Rosa), Chair of the Assembly Democratic Caucus and Chair-designate of the Assembly Budget Committee, regarding the ongoing budget impasse and yesterday's introduction of Assembly Constitutional Amendment (ACA) 19 by Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines (R-Clovis):\n \"Republicans have taken the people of the State of California hostage and ACA 19 is their ransom note. While Republican Leader Villines represented ACA 19 as responsible budget reform, it is in fact much more. It is an attempt to do what their leader, DC activist Grover Norquist promised-to shrink government to the size it can be drowned in the bathtub. In ACA 19 Assembly Republicans are also demanding that AB 32 implementation be stopped in its tracks. Republicans are trying to stop local governments from making developers in their own communities address the impacts of their projects. They are trying to place a stiff spending cap on local governments. Republicans are redefining taxes to include an exaction or mandate of any kind, whether imposed by the state or by local governments. This is a 'Contract on California' and everything Californians care about.\n\n Assemblymember Evans on the California Republican Budget Strategy and Their Grover Norquist Inspired Constitutional Amendment - California Progress Report",
