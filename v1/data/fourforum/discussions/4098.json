   "Pentagon Sought 'Gay' Bomb \n by Paul Johnson 365Gay.com Washington Bureau Chief\n \n (Washington) The Pentagon tried to develop a bomb that would turn an opposing army \"gay\" according to newly declassified documents.\n \n The papers, obtained by the New Scientist and the Sunshine Project - an organization that exposes research into chemical and biological weapons - show that during the Clinton presidency the military attempted to create a series of non-lethal chemical weapons that would disrupt discipline and morale among enemy troops.\n \n One weapon that the Pentagon worked on is described as an \"aphrodisiac\" that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other. \n \n According to the documents the Pentagon believed that \"provoking widespread homosexual behavior\" among troops would cause a \"distasteful but completely non-lethal\" blow to morale.\n \n The papers which date from 1994 show that the bomb was being worked on by scientists at the US Air Force Wright Lab in Dayton, Ohio.\n \n The documents also show that the lab requested $7.5 million to pursue the bomb, but a Pentagon spokesperson told the New Scientist it is not known if the project ever went ahead.\n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/01/011405gayBomb.htm\n \n http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Gay-bombs-US-secret-weapon-plan/2005/01/14/1105582700951.html?oneclick=true\n \n _____________________________________________________\n \n This is really funny! offensive, but funny!",
