   "Huh?\n \n Let me rephrase that: If Action X can be proven to be absolutely and unequivocally harmless, even though much of the public believes that it is, I could agree with you.\n\n \n You could agree? I will suggest that you absolutely should agree to grant liberty and equal rights to people who perform an action that is absolutely harmless. What reasoning justifies the use of the word \"could\"?\n \n Anyhow, you mentioned that it can't be proven that legalizing same-sex marriage is harmless, but I don't think that is important. It can't be proven that many things are harmless, for example. It can't be proven that opposite-sex marriage is harmless, it can't be proven that alcohol use is harmless, it can't be proven that airbags or seatbelts are harmless, even. There might be some unforseen harm in same-sex marriage, but if that harm cannot be listed or spoken of, then we have no right banning same-sex marriage. Disallowing something based on the opinion that there is probably some harm, without actually listing that harm, is not an action of a free government, it is the action of a tyrannical government. This implies that the government has the right to ban things even if there is no speakable reason for banning them.\n \n What I mean is, I can argue that same-sex marriage brings no harm. In fact, I will state that right now. But such an argument is hard to make if no possible harms of same-sex marriage are listed. Without a list of possible harms of same-sex marriage, I'd have to go through an infinite list of harms and prove why each one does not apply to same-sex marriage. I'd have to assume that same-sex marriage causes every possible harm then prove that harm wrong. But a free society does not ban something until it can be absolutely proven harmless, a free society assumes that an action is acceptable unless a harm can be listed. In light of this, I would like you to list some possible harms of same-sex marriage so that this harm can be debated.\n \n Furthermore, even if same-sex marriage were not harmless (which I still claim that it is), that would not be enough reason to ban the activity. That harm would have to be weighed up against the many benefits of same-sex marriage to determine whether the harm outweighs the benefits or not. These benefits include:\n \n -Freedom of people to marry who they choose\n -Greater equality under the law\n -Better homes for children in adoption facilities\n -Eased financial burden on same-sex couples\n -Encouragement of family unit which provides emotional and financial support in times where one member is in need\n -Setting a precendent of preventing government from interfering in the personal lives of citizens\n -Expanding health care coverage partners of same-sex couples and their children\n \n If any harms of same-sex marriage could not overcome those benefits (and any others that might be brought up), then same-sex marriage should be legalized, even if it could not be said to be harmless.",

I think absolutely no reasonable argument can be made suggesting that same-sex marriage might cause any harm, and I think that no reasonable argument can be made which suggests that same-sex marriage will not help people.\n \n With respect to the examples provided above, I admit that we do not ban everything that causes harm, nor should we ban everything that causes harm. In the case of driving, for example, although driving is harmful to the environment, it improves the lives of people by allowing them to travel great distances. Often the benefits of something outweigh the harm that it causes.\n \n But if it can be said that something causes absolutely no harm, then there is absolutely no reason to ban or deny it, especially if that thing also helps many people. I challenge anyone here to explain to me a good reason that something should be denied that does not involve harm caused by something, beside \"my religion says people aren't allowed to do that\" for our laws should not be based on an individual nor even the majority's religion. Why do we disallow prostitution? We believe legalizing prostitution is harmful. Why do we have speed limits? We believe no speed limits is harmful. If I could truthfully say that gettind rid of speed limits caused no harm, then I would be morally wrong to implement a speed limit.\n \n So does same-sex marriage cause harm? No; I would say that every explanation for harm caused by same-sex marriage is untrue. I have heard that same-sex marriage would increase the spread of STD's, but this is untrue for it would likely not increase promiscuous activity, it would decrease it. I have heard that same-sex couples won't be as good at raising children, and even if every bit of evidence and reasoning we have didn't suggest that same-sex couples are just as good, it would be absurd to claim that a child is better raised in an adoption home than by two loving parents, even if those parents are of the same sex. One might make the claim that someone has to pay for the marriage benefits of same-sex couples, but because opposite-sex couples are already allowed this right, we would only be preventing the harm of same-sex couples paying for the benefits of opposite-sex couples. To make everyone pay the same amount to recieve the same benefits is not harmful.\n \n Look a few posts up for my description of the benefits of same-sex marriage.\n \n One might say that same-sex marriage might trigger some chain reaction that causes some person to do something harmful, and this could be true, but it is just as likely that it triggers a chain reaction that causes someone to do something helpful. Either way, the cause is not same-sex marriage, but something else which just happened to be triggered by a chance occurance. This indiciates that this harm can only be described as isolated cases with a cause other than same-sex marriage. \n \n Now my argument that same-sex marriage causes no harm does not indicate that if it did cause harm, we should deny it. Certainly if it did cause harm, we would need to evaluate the harm in comparison to the benefits, and it is very difficult to overcome the benefits of both freedom and equality. Even when we deny a right, we usually deny it equally or denying it does not deny freedom. When we are talking about denying both freedom and equality; we've got to be talking about something really harmful. Same-sex marriage is not at all harmful.",

A lot of people are uninformed or ignorant on the topic, and this leads them to misinterpret statistics. The truth is that gay sex is not the cause of the spread of STD, gay sex is completely safe unless used in an unsafe fashion, and the real cause is unsafe sex. Statistics never lie, but they never, ever speak for themselves. Look at unsafe sex ratings across those homosexuals with HIV vs. those homosexuals without HIV and you will see the true cause of the disease.\n \n \nSort of like saying, people who drive 90 MPH but wear their seatbelts are as safe as someone going 55 and wearing their seatbelt.\n\n \n No, in this case, the cause of the problem is indeed going 90 MPH. Unless you are completely safe while driving 90 MPH, then this example bears no relation. You are completely safe from STD's when you engage in safe homosexual sex. While driving, you are not completely safe from crashing, no matter the speed, and that is why many places require the additional precaution of a safety belt; none of us is willing to give up driving.\n \n \nThe problem is that \"safe sex\" has been pushed in the gay community for a long time, and it hasn't made enough of a difference.

The stats also mean nothing if you ignore science and reasoning, assuming the cause to be whatever best validates your argument. There is not even a small chance of getting an STD during gay sex if you engage in it safely. Same-sex marriage will encourage safe and monogamous sex.

Even more importantly, you can't convince the public.\n\n \n So do you think that if it was proven that harm comes from heterosexual marriages (often enough) that they should be banned?\n \n I think its odd that people really believe that some laws out there are meant to prevent harm. Is smoking marijuana more harmful than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol? Things like that. Then, when a group of psychologists make a statistical analysis to find out how many minors (those under 18) who had sex with adults (those over 18) actually received harm from it, and find that a lot of cases that had been labelled \"Child Sexual Abuse\" were not indeed abuse and was not harmful to the minor and should be classified under another name, congress was outraged. They \"condemned the findings\" as if you can condemn a scientific finding. They misconstrued the paper (as did NAMBLA) to say that sex between adults and children was fine just fine and that it was trying to normalize pedophilia. It did not, it just said that in some cases there was little or no harm done and they should not have been labelled \"Child Sexual Abuse.\"\n \n So are these laws there to protect people from harm or are they there to protect politicians ideas about how society should structured?

The Constitution lists the powers of the government, not the reasons for it. If you want to learn about the reasons for it, read the writings of the founders, such as the Declaration of Independence or the Bill for the Establishment of religious freedom.

Homosexuality might have absolutely nothing to do with your argument, but as far as I can tell, you do not have a reason to deny same-sex marriage. Or is your argument based on your religion?\n \n \n(Incidently, I do think homosexuality (as a sexual activity) is at least indirectly harmful in terms of the affect it has had on families, as well as the HIV rates in our country--there's the human cost which is horrible, and then there's surely an economic toll in terms of healthcare.)\n\n \n There is an economic toll for spreading STD's, which is caused by promiscuous sex, not by homosexual sex. Me having sex with my boyfriend would in no way contribute to the spread of STD's. I can't say I know what you mean when you mention the affect homosexuality has on families, but I assume you are referring to the fact that some families get broken apart because of homosexuality. In this case, the cause is not homosexuality but the fear or hatred of homosexuality held by some individuals. Homosexuality in itself does nothing to hinder a family.\n \n \nIt's not a matter of denying rights--I suspect most people in our country would ultimately be in favor of giving gay people what they need in terms of benefits.

If opposite-sex couples have marriage under the law, but same-sex couples do not, my religion is under attack. Your religion's marriage is recognized but my religion's marriage is not. Beyond that, individual self-images will be lessened, and straight people will have a lower opinion of homosexuals. Our laws will be teaching this. \n \n Beyond that, our laws will be discouraging homosexuality, simply by stating that homosexuals don't have access to the same rights, that they are somehow different. I suspect perhaps this is the subliminal reason you support maintaining marriage, that you are willing to give homosexuals equal rights, but you still want our law to discourage it because you don't approve of it. But even though you may not approve of homosexuality, you just don't have the moral justification to put its discouragement into the law. That makes the law teach your religion and not someone else's. Our law has no place doing that. \n \n We must give everyone the same right under the law, and redefining marriage is simply the easiest way to do that.

   "As a newcomer to the debate, I have a few questions I would like to ask supporters of same-sex marriage and some observations to make.\n\n \n Woo, I love questions!\n \n \nThe first is that can any of you show me what difference legal marriage will make in gay relationships?\n\n \n Jyoshu mentioned 1049 benefits of marriage. This number is actually correct. The summary can be seen here: http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/og97016.pdf\n \n If you don't feel like reading the whole thing, I won't blame you. I certainly didn't! In summary, though, the list I linked to talks about increased social security, welfare, medicare and medicaid benefits. It also talks about veteran's benefits for spouses, employment benefits, naturalization of spouses and children of spouses, military service benefits, intellectual property benefits, family violence benefits, increased ability to get a loan, and many other benefits which I'm not as familiar with. These benefits include medical coverage for children of same-sex couples, increased ability to adopt children, and tax breaks for couples with children. These benefits will greatly ease many difficulties faced by same-sex families, especially those same-sex families who wish to raise children.\n \n That link mentions only the concrete benefits granted to married couples; it does not mention the more abstract values. Legalizing same-sex marriage increases equality, certainly for both relationships will be treated equally. Legalizing same-sex marriage also increases freedom, because when the government grants benefits to one type of marriage but not another, it is promoting one lifestyle and one system of beliefs and discouraging the other. The government has no place discouraging my lifestyle or religion if they are not hurting anyone, and the government should not be allowed to do so. They in effect teach people that same-sex couples are not equal, they teach my own chlidren that my religion is wrong. This differential treatment further harms same-sex couples by teaching them a negative self-image in some cases and promoting a disapproval of them by others. Such are always additional harms of different treatment.\n \n Beyond that, having legal recognition for their marriages may encourage those homosexuals who act more promiscuously to actually look for someone they love and make the commitment of marriage, instead of continuing on in their promiscuous lifestyle. When the government teaches you that they want you to get married and start a family, that they have a place for you, you are more likely to get married than if the government teaches you that heterosexuals get marriage while homosexuals do not. This can help prevent the spread of STD's.\n \n While same-sex marriage probably cannot increase the love and commitment of current same-sex couples, fair treamtent can certainly make their lives much easier, especially when they try to raise children.\n \n \nAs someone who is arguing for a change in existing law and custom, the burden of argument is upon you to show that there are good reasons for this change to be made.\n\n \n Although I have above shown much good reason to legalize same-sex marriage, I disagree with your statement here. We are part of a free and equal society, not a tyrannical one. As such, we do not deny rights or benefits for no reason; we treat everyone equally unless we've got a very good reason to do differently. If someone wishes to persist an institution which elevates his own group over another, he had better have a very good reason to put himself above others, or he is not a supporter of freedom and equality; he is a supporter of tyranny and selfishness. The burden of proof is never on those who want equality, it is on those who wish to destroy it.\n \n \nSimply asserting a right is not an argument. All rights have limits placed upon them and part of what government does is balance where one right starts and another right ends.\n\n \n Any limits we place on rights must have proper justification or we are morally wrong for putting that limit in place. Government takes away some rights, but it tries to protect as many as possible. We should not take away rights or deny equality without a very, very good reason to do so.\n \n \nWhen you rule in favor of one right, you diminsh another.\n\n \n This isn't true at all. If I rule that the government cannot illegalize dancing, I diminish no one's rights, unless you consider the right to dance diminished because it is not specifically given to only a select group of people.\n \n \nIt is therefore up to same-sex marriage advocates to demonstrate the need for this change by showing the liberty/right/freedom that gays could gain.\n\n \n I cannot agree less with this conclusion for the reasons stated above.\n \n \nSo the starting point must be to show me what they will get if this is enacted into law.\n\n \n I believe I have done so here. Let me know what you think, and tell me what your next questions are, if you have any.",

The fact is, a lot of those 1049 or-whatever-number benefits are tiny barely consequential things that most people will never even deal with in their lifetime. I certainly haven't, and you're right in some cases it's actually more advantageous to stay single, if it's going to be about the benefits. For me, marriage is a lot more than that, and I'd be married regardless of govt. recognition. I think a lot of them actually know that most of those benefits are not that consequential; surely they aren't so naive to think marriage recognition is the answer to life's problems. I think for the most part this 'fight' on their part is more about deeper-rooted causes than that. I think they see gay marriage as the ultimate prize in terms of validifying homosexuality.

   "I see I am dealing with True Believers here. We'll have to back up a bit.\n\n \n Yes; most of the same-sex marriage supporters here are directly affected by denying same-sex marriage.\n \n \nThere are many advantages to NOT being married. As a married person, I can tell you that in terms of household income, marriage was a net loss.\n \n You obviously do not want to admit that in many circumstances this is the case.\n\n \n I ignore nothing of the sort; I do not deny that in a few cases, it is more beneficial to stay unmarried. However the implication that we should deny the option of marriage to all same-sex couples simply because sometimes it is a disadvantage is an illogical one, for it is certainly sometimes, in fact more often than not, far more advantageous to get married. Not only that, but even in the cases where marriage is financially unfavorable; it offers many benefits, which are listed in the document I linked you, that do not apply to finances. The idea that no same-sex couples should be married because some would be more financially secure does not make sense, for surely we are forcing no one to get married.\n \n This argument also ignores all of my reasoning for supporting same-sex marriage which have nothing to do with marriage benefits.\n \n \nThus if there are 1049 reasons to marry, why is divorce so common?\n\n \n Those 1049 benefits of marriage all benefit one's family and often require working together. For example, your medical insurance is extended to your wife during marriage. When one no longer wishes to be part of that family, many of the benefits of marriage are no longer really benefits at all. Even those which are still beneficial are offset by the fact that marriage through its nature implies family, and it is worthwhile to legally divorce to be legally unrelated. Though a lot of couples who break up stay married until they meet someone else they'd wish to marry instead. But the benefits of marriage are there; I sent you a link describing them, and I gave you an overview, and if you do not believe they exist, you are free to research them in any way you see fit. If you want to know why an individual divorces, ask that individual; everyone is not the same.\n \n \nSimply asserting it, or counting bits of the tax code isn't enough.\n\n \n But surely providing you a detailed, many-page description is enough, is it not?\n \n \nEvery action has a cost, but you refuse to acknowledge this, which is why I sense that debate is pointless.\n\n \n I disagree. Instead of simply making that assertion, why not state what the cost of same-sex marriage is? That way I can explain why I do not believe it to be a cost.\n \n \nEvery right also has a limit. When you expand a right, you necessarily limit other rights.\n \n By supporting free speech, you diminish the rights of others not to be bothered by hearing you talk.\n\n \n I think we are using different definitions of the word \"right\". I use it as the founders did, as Locke did, to describe the political freedom to do something. The idea that one person has the \"right\" to not be bothered implies that rights can be extended to preserving individual preferences. On the same note, I might say, for example, that denying free speech denies the right of a person to not be bothered by someone's inablity to say something. If we include preferences as \"rights\", then by the very nature of doing so, each time someone's preference right is violated, a person of the opposite preference has his right upheld.\n \n For example, you might try to say that by allowing same-sex marriage, we are violating one man's right to be comfortable knowing gays can't marry. Through the same reasoning, I could say that you are violating the right of another man to be comfortable knowing that gays can marry. I would consider neither of these rights.\n \n \nThe right to self-defense is another example. My right to carry a gun is frequently countered by others who claim that it interferes with their rights not to feel threatened.\n\n \n I think the situation is better described as such: You want to be allowed to exercise your right to carry a gun. Other people do not want you to have that right. To justify this position, they claim that it is harmful for people to be allowed to carry guns because guns are too often misused to hurt people.\n \n \nWhatever side you are on, there is a clear clash of interests.\n\n \n In most issues, such as gun control, abortion, etc. both sides have very valid points. Generally one side wants to take away a right because they believe that right is harmful, and they have good reasons for that. The decision then becomes: is that right worth the harm? But same-sex marriage is different; there are no good arguments opposing it, and there are many good arguments supporting. There is one clearly correct answer. You can say that I am ignorant or misinformed, but if you believe that so, why not list an argument in opposition to same-sex marriage, and I will try to explain why it is logically invalid.\n \n \nYou can pretend this isn't the case, but if you do, you are either ignorant or dishonest.\n\n \n I don't pretend, I believe. Again, instead of simply stating that I am wrong, prove me wrong by showing me a reason to deny same-sex marriage. Then we can discuss that harm and figure out whether it really is a good reason.\n \n \nI came to this debate skeptical, but willing to entertain the idea if someone could make a compelling case. To me that includes addressing the same concerns every other policy initiative does.\n\n \n Name a concern that I have not addressed.\n \n \nSimply announcing that you have a right, that your right won't hurt anyone else and that it is up to your opposition to find reasons NOT to embrace your view is no way to pursuade someone.\n \n To put it another way, the correct answer to \"Why\" isn't \"Why not.\"\n\n \n Because we should have a free and equal society, \"why not\" is indeed enough; we don't deny people the right to do something, then make them prove that they deserve it. Let me ask you: why don't we ban skipping? Why don't we ban producing yellow paper? Why don't we ban marble tables; I mean who really needs those? Why don't we ban spinning? Why don't we ban insulting people? Why don't we ban saying \"cookies\" three times in a row? We don't ban these things not because there is some incredibly compelling reason to allow them, we don't ban them because people deserve freedom.\n \n But you are wrong to say that I have not answered the question of \"Why\". I posted a very long description of why in my previous post. It started with \"Jyoshu mentioned 1049 benefits of marriage,\" and it ended with \"While same-sex marriage probably cannot increase the love and commitment of current same-sex couples, fair treamtent can certainly make their lives much easier, especially when they try to raise children.\"\n \n Perhaps you did come here skeptical, but skepticism does not justify denying that the why ever existed when it was posted in plain sight.",

Impressive! :p\n \n \nYou have such insight into the inner workings of the minds of the \"moral right\". Why don't you tell us why they would withhold these things from fellow citizens?\n\n \n Many reasons for different people.\n \n Some want to withhold them because they simply don't see homosexuality as a valid reason to give such things. \n \n Others see it as a moral delimma and feel they are standing up for what's right.\n \n And there are probably some that, frankly, just don't like gay people, unfortunately.\n \n But I'm left of a lot of the religious right on quite a few issues; I don't know that I'm the best person to ask.",

   "Many reasons for different people.\n \n Some want to withhold them because they simply don't see homosexuality as a valid reason to give such things.\n\n \n But certainly heterosexuality is also not a valid reason to give such benefits. The benefits of marriage are granted because of a loving relationship and the need to take care of one's family and hold it together. The reasons for marriage are equal among both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Or if they are not, what are valid reasons for marriage that do not apply to same-sex couples?\n \n \nOthers see it as a moral delimma and feel they are standing up for what's right.\n\n \n Without reason provided to see homosexuality as immoral, this can only be understood as a religious or personal belief, neither of which should be forced upon others or used to deny other people rights. Some people dislike black people or redheads or men, but that dislike simply is no excuse for denying those people equality.\n \n \nAnd there are probably some that, frankly, just don't like gay people, unfortunately.\n \n But I'm left of a lot of the religious right on quite a few issues; I don't know that I'm the best person to ask.\n\n \n The problem is that we've asked the religious right about these things our entire lives, and none have come up with an answer except beyond what you've stated here. No one has stated a reason, they've simply stated \"homosexuality is bad\" or \"I don't like homosexuality\".",
