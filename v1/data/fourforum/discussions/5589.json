   "Wednesday, June 08, 2005 \n \"REWARDING CORPORATE TAX CHEATS\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Last year, American Jobs Creation Act was signed into law by George W. So...how many jobs has it created?\n \n Well, gosh, say the Bushites, uh...um...er...none. Well then, how many jobs will it create later on? Golly, say the Bushites, actually...uh...we don't know...maybe none.\n \n This is because both the title and the promise of this law are lies. It's not a jobs bill at all, but a boondoggle for huge corporations, giving them a massive tax cut. \n \n For years, these giants have used loopholes that let them shelter their profits in various tax havens around the world. Finally, though, there comes a time when they want to bring this stash home--but, goodness gracious, this would require them to pony up their taxes. No problem for them, though, for this is why they hire hordes of lobbyists and make big campaign donations to lawmakers. They simply got Bush and the congress to declare a \"tax holiday\" for them, letting them repatriate their hidden cash at a tax rate of only five percent--a fraction of the normal rate and way below what we working stiffs and small businesses pay.\n \n This corporate tax dodge is so stinky that it needed some perfume to get it through congress--so the Bushites called it a jobs bill, promising that the companies would invest these billions in new operations here at home and hire workers. However, there was one little catch to their promise: They put no requirement in the law that the tax dodgers would have to do any of this.\n \n Guess what? They aren't. Pfizer Inc., for example, will haul at least $28 billion home from its international tax hideaways. Far from using this pile to create jobs in the good ol' USA, Pfizer says it will cut thousands of workers over the next three years. Asked about the ethics of this, Pfizer says curtly that it's \"following the intent of the law.\"\n \n Yeah, a law your lobbyists wrote! It should be called the Corporate Tax Cheat Forgiveness Act.",

   "Thursday, June 09, 2005 \n \"SAVING THE DAY FOR CORPORATE POWER\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Thank God we have Republicans in charge of several state governments, as well as our national government, because we can always count on them to take care of our country's big problems--such as making sure that the wages of America's workaday majority stay low.\n \n Of course, George W and the congressional GOP have done their part on this score, rejecting an effort earlier this year to hike the national minimum wage, which has been stuck since 1997 at a paltry $5.15 an hour. That's $10,500 a year gross for full-time work--a poverty wage that mocks moral decency.\n \n But I was particularly impressed by the extraordinary move recently made by Republican leaders in Georgia to enforce this low-wage ethic on their state's people. Governor Sonny Perdue has now signed HB59, barring any city in the Peach State from requiring that corporations that get city contracts have to pay higher wages than the poverty pay set by the federal government. \n \n How peachy of him! This means that the state's so-called conservative leaders have come out flat-footed against local control, forcing Georgia's duly-elected local officials to comply with a federal, low-wage standard.\n \n Of course, the governor and his gang are corporatists, not conservatives. They were acting at the behest of contractors that were apoplectic that the city of Atlanta has been considering a living-wage ordinance that would set a $10.15-an-hour wage floor to be paid by corporations that profit from government contracts. That's hardly lavish pay--about $21,000 a year--but it would allow working families a middle-class possibility, and would restore some integrity to the promise of America's work ethic.\n \n Luckily for the corporate powers, they've got stalwarts like Sonny Perdue ready and willing to abandon any pretense of conservatism, usurp local authority, stiff his state's working families, and save corporations from having to mess with matters of basic economic fairness.",

   "Monday, June 13, 2005 \n \"CORPORATE SHAKEDOWN ARTISTS\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The shake-down is an ugly but pervasive part of our culture. For example, schoolyard bullies shake down other kids, forcing them to hand over their lunch money, and the mafia made a big business of shaking down small businesses.\n \n But these shake-down artists are bush-leaguers compared to the all-time King of the Shake-Down: Corporate America. Using a scam called \"location incentives,\" major corporations that plan to open a new facility routinely bilk millions of dollars from us taxpayers to subsidize their move. Taking advantage of publicity-seeking mayors and governors, corporate executives come in waving paper promises of \"new jobs\" and \"economic growth\" for the lucky burg that pays up the most in incentives - things like no property taxes, free land, no utility bills, taxpayer-financed roads, and outright cash.\n \n This is, of course, a ripoff. But who doesn't like free money, so corporations now hire shake-down specialists who are expert at extorting the most. They'll tell Topeka's mayor to sweeten their offer, because Tampa says it will pay construction costs for a building, and Tucson is putting up a $3 million grant.\n \n No one mentions that all of this is a sham. Multi-billion dollar corporations neither need nor merit this public subsidy, they've already decided where they're going to locate (based on real business factors), they'll usually fail to create the promised jobs, and the giveaways drain the public budgets for schools and other real needs. Still, the shake downs work because mayors and governors get their political jollies from announcing that GreatBigGiantCorp has chosen Greater Bugtussle for a new factory.\n \n This is Jim Hightower saying... Holy Adam Smith! A public official should be ashamed, not proud, to take part in this total perversion of the very idea of free enterprise. To help stop these shameful shakedowns by Corporate America, call Good Jobs First: 202-626-3780.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Sources: \"Weigh giveaways against the publid interest,\" Austin American-Statesman, May 22, 2005.",

   "Tuesday, June 14, 2005 \n \"A MIGHTY SWEET RETIREMENT\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Are you worried about retirement, Bucko? Worried that Bush will \"fix\" Social Security by killing it, that your company will loot your company pension, or that your 401(k) will be reduced to just a (k)?\n \n Well step right up to my medicine wagon, for I've got just the potion you need to cast away your retirement worries. It's called a \"consulting agreement,\" and all the top CEOs are getting them these days. Oh, you're not a CEO? Tough luck, chump, for you don't know what your missing.\n \n In addition to getting fat pensions, health coverage for life, and other retirement goodies, the top honchos of major corporations also are collecting handsome fees for hanging around the executive suite as company-paid consultants after they formally retire. What do they do for the money? Somewhere between \"not much\" and \"nada.\" As one pay expert puts it, \"As a practical matter,\" most CEOs don't turn to predecessors for advice.\" Another expert gingerly notes that \"consulting agreements are a fuzzy area.\"\n \n Fuzzy... but comforting. Motorola's former boss, for example, is pulling down $4.6 million for two year's of unspecified \"work\" (on top of his $14 million supplemental pension). PepsiCo is ponying up some two million a year through 2008 for a former vice-chairman, whose only duty is to be \"available to consult.\" One wonders: Does it count as \"available\" if you leave your cell phone on while sipping cocktails on a Caribbean beach?\n \n Then there's meat magnate Don Tyson, former chairman of Tyson Foods. He gets $1.2 million a year for \"advisory\" services through 2011, but he'll not likely get many calls, since the company got caught engaging in an accounting scam on his watch. To settle the fraud case, Tyson agreed to pay $700,000. Poor Don... but do the math: His \"advisory\" job, minus the fine, still leaves him with $5.3 million to assuage his conscience. Imagine.\n \n This is Jim Hightower saying... CEOs no longer fade away... they steal away. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
