   "Nanotechnology is definitely an area of science that should be pursued with even more resources than it is now. I havent really done any research on it, though. Any idea how far away until it is a possibility?\n\n \n What do you mean how far way is it? Nanotechnology is already here, and will continue to offer pragmatic applications in the field of science. From manipulating chemical compounds to decreasing the size of the microprocessor to that of a nanoprocessor, nanotech has had an impact on many scientific endeavors. Here is a list of articles that discusses many of the patents that have been developed in this field. The source mentioned is the trade journal devoted to this exciting field of engineering and science, the Small Times. If you are interested in a very intriguing development that pertains to the use the use of nanotechnology in chemical engineering, and polymer chemistry take a look at the buckeytube. This material is 100 times the strength of steel and 1/6 the weight. By the way, this material is also an excellent heat and electrical conductor. This material could revolutionize the world as we know it. NEC has already found a practical application for this material. It could be used to power cellphones and laptop computers. Check out the information about their fuel cell design",
