At any rate, no one would really believe them or accept what they have said their \"marriage\" is. \n \n But in terms of how the government views things, a civil marriage is a contract between two consenting individuals. Animals, non-sentient being, and children can not give consent.

Gay couples asking to be able to do this is justified since the law will be just as applicable to them as a mixed-sex couple. On the other hand applying these laws and rules to a group would require a re-evaluation of what the law says, and how it is applied. People who want to marry the same sex as themselves are asking for equal rights, while polygamists are not.",
