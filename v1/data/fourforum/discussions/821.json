   "As far as the temperature 4000 yrs ago, it is generally accepted that they were higher. It is also generally accepted that CO2 levels were much higher, which was the cause of the increased global temperatures.\n \n As far as the ice caps melting, they were much smaller then than they are now. Much more of the world was under water at the time.\n \n I think it is pretty well established that increased CO2 levels will increase temperatures on earth. This has been tested on smaller scales in laboratories. There is nothing to suggest that the results of these experiments would not be scalable to the planet as a whole.\n \n As far as the majority of o2 being generated by oceanic plants, it would be difficult or the environmentalists to talk people into \"adopting\" a patch of seaweed. Trees are big and beautiful. Seaweed is yucky and slimy, \n \n There is a school of thought that says that the oceanic flora that provides the majority of our breathable oxygen is dying due to polution of the ocean. I haven't yet seen any hard numbers on this, so I personally am reserving judgement on this until more research is done.\n \n I think that the dire predictions of \"the end of the world\" are a l little overstated. It is not the end of the world we are talking about, just the end of the world as we know it. This could allow self corection of the environment of a sort. Last time the global average temperature was 10 degrees higher than it is now, the eastern seaboard was underwater, as was the majority of California. See?

   "Even though our planet is getting warmer, it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago. \n\n \n The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern, the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak. Projections show that instead of peaking, there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous.\n \n \nMost of our oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and even them oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere so we won't be running out anytime soon. \n\n \n Your lungs depend on partial pressure to oxygenate your blood. A change in percentage concentration will result in a change in partial pressure. This affects how we breathe. Projections show that with global warming there will be a vast increase in ocean cloud coverage, resulting in inhibited growth and photosynthesis of ocean plants, resulting in a lower yield of O2 on average. \n \n \nLike I said in #2, most of the earth's oxygen comes from the plants in the ocean and we still have al the other forest. \n\n \n The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole.\n \n \nLike I said, if that were true it would have happened 4000 years ago when our planet was a whole lot hotter. \n\n \n Ice is stilll ice at -30 or -40. I agree with your point that the earth will not flood, however, your justification is bogus. You also forget that with a temperature increase comes an increase in volume, its not the ice that people are worried about. Furthermore, certain currents are based on regional ocean temperatures and are responsible for the moderate climates in various areas (Britain for one).\n \n \nThere are many scientists that say this is true, but there are many more that say that it isn't \n\n \n Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)\n \n \nDid you know that in Siberia they are HAPPY that it's getting warmer up there? \n\n \n And down south wear the majority of people live, they aren't. The people in Siberia won't be too happy when their food source dries up.\n \n \nDo you know much of our atmosphere is made of C02? 0.035%!\n\n \n The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.\n \n \nadded C02 will be boon for flora\n\n \n The temperature increase will hamper growth about as much as the CO2 increase will help it.\n \n Looking at it from an economic perspective climate change on the scale that the greenhouse effect is causing will do nothing good.",

   "About trees\n \n Trees bind Co2. If you chop down trees you increase the ammount of Co2 in the atmosphere, which is not a really good thing AFAIK.\n \n About climate cycles\n \n Climate cycles have been observed for a long time, and scientists who believe in the global warming theory do argue this on a basis on climate cycles. Apparantly we should be experiencing a \"cooling\" effect at the moment, but we are not. Scientist therefor fear that when we start experiencing the \"heating\" effect it will be quite extreme\n \n About changing temperatures.\n \n Changing temperatures do not necessarily mean a bad thing. Most often it do however, and it has nothing to do with us wanting it to be cooler or hotter outside. The temperature is very important for the ecological systems of any given area. If the temperature changes in Siberia this will effect the Siberians deer owners and their possibility to survive. Now, I`m not sure that the current temperature increase will effect the deers negatively or positivly, but if the temperature increase \"too much\" it would be disastrous for Siberians. \n \n As for tempereatures 4000 years ago.\n \n It might have been higher temperatures, and it might have been lower. But does this really matter? I mean, nobody is saying that humans as a specie will go extinct (unless we somehow kill ourselves with bombs). But an extreme temperature shift will claim lives, cause immense siffering in certain countries (like the SAMOA Islands) and could possibly make our whole economic system to crash. Why risk all of this?\n \n As for melting polar caps.\n \n The polar caps are not important in this respect. Sea levels will not rise dramaticly because the polar caps melt. Butthe sea levels will rise dramaticly if the temperature increases dramaticly. This is because when the water gets warmer, it also grows in volume.",
