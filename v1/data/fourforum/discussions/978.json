We both say it in Church (Catholics in Mass, we in Divine Liturgy).\n \n However, Catholics have added the 'filioque' clause which is a cause of great division.\n\n \n Yes, the filioque and the papacy are the two dividing factors. I believe the filioque is mostly one of semantics. When we say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son we are speaking about being sent forth. The Father can send the Spirit and the Son can send the Spirit.\n As far as who he eminates from, I have read some ECF's that say he eminates from both. I can't say they were unanimous, but there is precedent for it. I do think it is an issue that should be discussed because I believe it is semantics at this point and shouldn't keep us divided.\n \n The papacy may be a little harder. I do believe in the pre-eminence of the Roman Bishop (Obviously), but I think early church writings support that. As St. Irenaeus said in the 100's in his writing Against Heresies, 'Every church must agree with the one in Rome on account of its superior origin'",

The Maronite Church says the original form (even though they are 'Catholic'; and when the Pope visits their churches he says the original form too!)\n \n A few other points of difference would be over the Veneration of Mary (the Theotokos)... Catholics have, in our opinion, raised her too far... to the point of being co-redemptress.\n \n We have a differeing view on purgatory.\n \n Orthodoxy is not keen on Catholic rational-legalism, where too many fine points are made.\n \n Further, sameness of Liturgical worship is a major point in Orthodoxy, but not an issue in Catholicism.",
