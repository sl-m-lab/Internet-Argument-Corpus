Miracles, as defined in the bible, are the products of God manifesting his power through mankind. A man imbued with the power of God could, almost at will, call this power forth to cause physics-defying phenomena. \n \n You might ask, how can we conclude that miracles never occured in the past simply because we don't see miracles occuring in the present? Well, referring back to the reference material, we see, within the definition of God (the source of miracles), that God is the same today as he was in times past. So, if God, being the source of miracles in the past, liberally granted humans the power to do miracles in the past, then he should still be the source of miraculous power, and still be granting humans the power to do miracles in the present, if God truly is the same today as he was in the past. \n \n There is a very obvious difference between the biblical past and our present with respect to miracles. They don't occur. Therefore if God is the same as the biblical past, and God does not grant humans the power to do miracles today, then God didn't grant men the power to do miracles; the bible lied. And if God does not grant humans the power to perform miracles, but he did in the past, the God is not the same as he was in the past; the bible lied. \n \n I don't accept a book of lies as reference material.",

   " I also am a stout supporter of the constitution and the bill of rights and a little thing called SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE\n\n \n Your version of the Separation of Church and State is more than likely 180 degrees opposite of what Jefferson and the Founding Fathers believed and practiced, i.e.\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Compliments: U.S. Library of Congress\n \n Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition)\n \n \n\n I actually believe in the validity of Christ being the messiah and believe he is the son of god and died for the worlds sins. \n\n \n Good! \n \n \n\n HOWEVER I am also a gay liberal...\n\n \n Why don't you keep that to yourself?

   "Well considering one listens to Chuck Smith he HAS to be right doesn't he? Sorry but my father listens to 107.9 and I loved one of Chucks most recent ramblings comparing gays to pedophiles and such. Another typical rambling of a man who supports Focus on the Family and other extreme reich wing political organizations under the guise of \"family.\"\n\n It just goes to show how rediculous absurd the idea of miracles is. Imagine, both archie and ez insessantly argue that miracles occur, as evidence that their gods have power and manifests it in the real world. When asked to give an example of what they are talking about when they say miracle, they talk about babies being born and staying alive. This is the kind of lame excuses for responses we have to deal with. \n \n I think its been established enough times so that we can permanently rest this case that miracles are not real.",

   "Nonsense. Typical liberalism - forget about taking personal responsibility for your behaviors and blame others instead. \n \n \n \n Nope.

Telling them to repent or die in their sins.\n \n You folks want salvation without repentance for your sins. That's real special, jazyjason. Frankly, I think it's a travesty, and no one is fooled by it except you and yours.\n \n \n \n I don't care what you call us. You're full of folly and your gay sex Christianity is an abomination. You can still come to church, just can the pro-gay sex nonsense.\n \n \n \n Sure I did. For years in rescue missions. So you're a misguided liar also. Like I said, you don't know anything about me. All you care about is trying to justify your sin. It ain't working.\n \n Not only that, but you folks typically also want people to embrace your sinful lifestyle, and even applaud it.

   "Nonsense. Typical liberalism - forget about taking personal responsibility for your behaviors and blame others instead.\n\n \n Funny but I thought you blamed gays an lesbians for the degradation of modern society and all its shortcomings ... \n \n \n \n \nNope. The bigots are those like you who can't stand to listen to Bible-believing Christians.\n Wrong. You can't stand to listen to reason even when it's clearly in front of your face. I have listened to you and all I here is the same convoluted babble.\n \n \n \n \nYou don't even know me, so go tell that clap-trap nonsense to your pet carp.\n I don't have a pet carp but even if I did I wouldn't abuse him with what comes out of your mouth.\n \n \n \n \nI am speaking out to and for them. Telling them to repent or die in their sins.\n \n You folks want salvation without repentance for your sins. That's real special, jazyjason. Frankly, I think it's a travesty, and no one is fooled by it except you and yours.\n\n \n \n So live and let die I take it. You know what is really special? I'll tell you. Hearing the same arguments you give over and over being used to justify killing gays. Beating them Kicking them out of their homes and jobs. Denying them equal protection under the law. Denying them the right to raise a family. And of course marriage.\n \n What you just posted clearly shows me your no christian. And if you stood before god this moment he'd throw the book of life in your face because deep down your heart is as black as the letters on this forum you have spewed demeaning others for whom they are despite their apparent suffering and strife.\n \n \n \nI don't care what you call us. You're full of folly and your gay sex Christianity is an abomination. You can still come to church, just can the pro-gay sex nonsense.\n Sorry but I think I'll keep my gay sex. You see the idea of fishy intercourse kind of grosses me out.\n \n \n \n \nSure I did. For years in rescue missions. So you're a misguided liar also. Like I said, you don't know anything about me. All you care about is trying to justify your sin. It ain't working.\n \n Not only that, but you folks typically also want people to embrace your sinful lifestyle, and even applaud it. That's not working either. We're calling you out to repent instead, and hope you will return to practicing Godly Christianity, instead of violating it.\n\n \n A liar? What have I lied about? Thats one for the books Easy when your condemning groups of people to hell and torment. As far as praciticing your version of christianity. IF demeaning a group of people and refusing to help them and love them for who they are is your form of true christianity. THen buddy you can keep it. I want no form of your bigoted self righteous hate filled belief. Go recruit some other self loathing wretch who needs to leech off of others suffering to raise their low self esteem. Not I...",
