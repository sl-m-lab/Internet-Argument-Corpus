   "I decided to do some research into the purported existence of god. Surely the following statistics prove there has to be a god. One has to agree that jc does, in fact, exist if only Tsunami deaths are considered (god works in mysterious ways!)!\n \n Were they all sinners? emoticon_confused Nonbelievers and non-christians were, for sure, sinners!!! But, he also took some of the faithful as a sign of his love and mercy ! No matter how young they were. Even the unborn children!..... By drowning and/or crushing them! emoticon_smile His love and mercy are boundless!!!emoticon_xangel emoticon_xangel \n \n Hopefully, this will end the debate over the existence of a god. COMMON SENSE (Reason, logic, rational judgment, etc.), proves he/she/it or whatever does exist! How anyone can deny his existence is beyond me! :xbanghead \n \n Please feel free to post additional statistics which add to the creditability of his existence and of his mercy and love for \"his children\". \n \n May the GREAT Turnip in the sky bless you, JFP8000\n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n This is an evolving table. Records of tsunami deaths are very commonly mixed with earthquake deaths, so notable tsunami events are surely missing from this table, and some numbers here may include deaths not caused by tsunamis. There also have been catastrophic waves recorded in India, attributed to storm surges, that may be tsunamis. The table reflects official compilations and has not been checked in detail. All large round numbers are approximate. \n \n 10 Deadliest Pacific Tsunamis \n Date Source Deaths\n 22 May 1782 Taiwan 40000\n 20 Sep 1498 Japan 31000\n 28 Oct 1707 Japan 30000\n 15 Jun 1896 Japan 27122\n 13 Aug 1868 Chile 25674\n 27 May 1293 Japan 23024\n 21 May 1792 Japan 15030\n 29 Aug 1741 Hokkaido 15000\n 24 Apr 1771 Ryukyu Islands 13486\n May 1765 China 10000\n \n 10 Deadliest Indian Ocean Tsunamis \n Date Source Deaths\n 26 Dec 2004 Sumatra 225000\n 27 Aug 1883 Java/Sumatra 36500\n 26 Jun 1941 Andaman Sea 5000\n 3 Sep 1861 Sumatra 1700\n 16 Jun 1819 Arabian Sea 1543\n 28 Nov 1945 Arabian Sea 1000+\n 16 Feb 1861 Sumatra 905\n 2 Apr 1762 Bay of Bengal 500\n 19 Aug 1977 Sunda Islands 500\n 4 Jan 1907 Sumatra 400\n \n 10 Deadliest Atlantic Tsunamis \n Date Source Deaths\n 1 Nov 1755 Portugal 60000\n 7 Jun 1692 Jamaica 2000\n 30 Jan 1607 England/Wales 2000\n 3 Oct 1780 Jamaica 300\n 7 May 1842 Haiti 300\n 6 Dec 1917 Nova Scotia 200\n 4 Aug 1946 Dominican Rep 100\n 7 Sep 1882 Panama 65\n 11 Oct 1918 Puerto Rico 42\n 18 Nov 1929 Newfoundland 29\n \n 10 Deadliest Mediterranean Sea Tsunamis \n Date Source Deaths\n 1410 BCE Greek islands 100000+  \n 28 Dec 1908 Italy 10000+\n 6 Feb 1783 Italy 1500+\n 11 Jan 1693 Italy 1000+\n 20 Sep 1867 Greece 12\n 16 Oct 1979 France 10\n 13 Dec 1990 Italy 6\n 9 Jul 1956 Greece 4\n 20 Oct 1859 Greece 2\n 11 Sep 1930 Italy 2",

I agree, in retrospect, that the font size was too large in this particular post... Therefore, I have changed it.\n Second.... I thought the content was more important, than the font size.:xcensored \n THIRD......WHAT COLOR are you talking about the original post??? :xbanghead \n Forth..... What is it with your attitude? It would have been nice if you had just sent me a private message INSTEAD. This would have been appreciated. Because it is not my intent to have people NOT read the post due to font size problems.\n Fifth..... You have a problem with larger font sizes & color??? Maybe write to 4fourmns and tell them they should remove the color & font options!!!! emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill",
