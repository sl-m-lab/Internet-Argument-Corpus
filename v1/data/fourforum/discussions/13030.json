   "This seems to be a key question in recently active threads both on this and the Gay Rights board.\n \n Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson thought so. (See my post in http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12981-seems-those-penguins-werent-so-gay-after-all-13.html#post362169.) \n \n And as holy a man as the Dalai Lama agrees: \nNo, actually I always try to promote secular ethics or human values not as a religion, not as Buddhism...\n \n But my partisan approach that is simply the promotion of human values, not religion, it's not a religious thing. In fact I make this always clear, in order to be good person, a warm hearted person, it is not necessarily to have religious faith. Without religious faith, there can be a nice person, a warm hearted person, and happy person.\n \n I think that among the 6 billion, more than 6 billion human beings on this planet, strictly speaking I think the majority are non-believers. Of course officially, \"I belong Christian...Judaism...\" like that. But strictly speaking, in daily life, I think majority are non-believers.\nInterview with Dalai Lama\n \n Even the Catholic Church admits you can be moral without God:\nWhere morality is divorced from religion, reason will, it is true, enable a man to recognize to a large extent the ideal to which his nature points. But much will be wanting. He will disregard some of his most essential duties. He will, further, be destitute of the strong motives for obedience to the law afforded by the sense of obligation to God and the knowledge of the tremendous sanction attached to its neglect -- motives which experience has proved to be necessary as a safeguard against the influence of the passions. And, finally, his actions even if in accordance with the moral law, will be based not on the obligation imposed by the Divine will, but on considerations of human dignity and on the good of human society.\n(Quote from \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" at Morality without religion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, emphases mine.) \n \n In other words, they may insist you still need an Invisible Sky Pixie to threaten you with a fiery eternal spanking if you're bad or offer you the promise of an (unverifiable) eternal cookie if you're good, or you might lack motivation to obey the law and act out of \"passion\" instead (like some people kill and torture out of their \"passion\" for God?), but at least they admit you can have a moral code without Him.\n \n Certainly, as many other posters have noted in these forums, God as portrayed in the Bible is inconsistent at best and a schizophrenic psychopath at worst--scarcely a model for what the laws of most civilized nations consider moral behavior in either His actions or His commands. I am not only disinclined to accept the \"morality\" of such a being, I would be inclined to stay well away from those who feel they should mimic those actions or obey those commands literally.\n \n To understate things, I find the arguments from the other side of the debate in these forums less than convincing. \n \n The claim that God gets a pass on behaving in ways that any sane human--religious or not--would find heinous to the max (killing babies, stuff like that) because we Poor Mortals don't have the omniscient perspective to see how it's all really for the good in God's Master Plan, sounds to me like one of those statements to which the SNL Church Lady would reply \"How conveeeeeenient!\" \n\"When the President does it, it's not against the law.\"--Richard M. Nixon\n \n \n And in response to a poster's answer to the question of whether there even IS a God, given His wildly inconsistent moral example and lack of verifiable presence--that since you can't prove He doesn't exist must prove that He does--I would just say that I find the logic of a character in an Ed Wood film less than persuasive in serious theological debate: \n\"Grave robbers from outer space! Can you prove it didn't happen??\"--Criswell's last speech in Plan 9 from Outer Space\nAnyway, the question of religion being required for morality having been broached as often as it has been lately here in disparate threads, I thought I'd give it its own.\n \n To start things off, consider this quote: \n(T)here is now substantial evidence drawn from evolutionary biology that humans possess an innate moral sense. Morality has its roots in group survival: the moral practices that evolved enabled tribes or clans to survive and function. This means that human beings are potentially moral. Whether or not this moral sense is realized depends on social and environmental conditions. Some individuals may never fully develop morally-they may be morally handicapped, even sociopathic. That is one reason society needs to enact laws to protect itself...\n \n To say that a person is moral only if he or she obeys God's commandments-out of fear or love of God or a desire for salvation-is hardly adequate. Ethical principles need to be internalized, rooted in reason and compassion. The ethics of secularism is autonomous in the sense that it need not be derived from theological grounds.\n A Short Primer on Secular Ethics The Dissection",

For those that have a desire to be moral and to analyze and adapt their own actions for those purposes, then they can find inspiration in either religious or secular moral philosophies. However, there are also wide ranges of people who don't particularly analyze their own actions where morality is concerned and have no desire for such analysis. For those people, then I would agree that some external authoritative set of moral laws are useful. Of course, such laws exist in the legal sphere - where it is fear of legal punishment that keeps some of these people in line. However, many ignore the law when passion pushes them toward certain actions. Similarly, I think that the threat of eternal punishment for certain actions that is imposed by certain religions can thwart bad behavior on the part of some people (as do legal threats). \n \n However, it has been clear from history that many will either ignore the religious threats or re-interpret them to their own liking. Unlike legal punishments, there is no feedback mechanism in religious threats to tell them whether or not their re-interpretation was correct. For example, if someone steels from another, then they might feel justified in those actions if that other person had treated them badly. Legal justice (a form of forced morality) will tell them - sorry buddy, but your interpretation of the justice of your action was just plain wrong so you will go to jail. He will learn his lesson by actually going to jail and others who see his example will learn from it too. How would that happen with religious threats? If somebody misinterprets a religious law to justify his actions, then, even if he does go to hell for those actions, then nobody else can learn about it since nobody has ever come back from heaven or hell. Therefore, religious laws are far more open to personal re-interpretation than are legal laws. That makes them far less effective against those who have no internal moral drive than one might think.\n \n So, in summary, I would argue that, for those that wish to be moral, both secular and religious moral philosophy can work. For those that don't care about being moral, then there might be some small advantage of the threat of religious punishment. However, for the extreme cases, neither moral philosphy seems to be very effective.

Hence more social experimentation and channeling power into the hands of a few. That summary is really too brief, but it's the best I can do with my limited time tonight.

I recommend that book! :)\n\n As someone who is left-of-center (but not hard liberal), I think that there are core drives of human nature that have not changed through the ages. However, we are defined BOTH by \"nature\" and \"nurture\", not just by \"nature\". In other words, our instinctual drives can be taught to be controlled or are least partly ignored. That is where morality comes into play. Moral teaching helps people learn to control their instinctual drives. \n \n However, moral teaching needs to be viewed as legitimate for people to actually submit to it. Many people of faith view religious moral teaching as automatically legitimate. However, though religious moral teaching sometimes outlines its reasoning, the reasons for many moral rules are often simply stated as \"because God says so in the Bible\" or because particular religious leaders say so - without going into the fully supportable details. This is true for issues such as gay rights, sex before marriage, etc. There are many religious moral issues, such as those examples, that draw people away from a full trust of religious morality. Among other reasons, that is why secular morality gets increasing notice. Secular morality tries to reason out morality based on such things as reciprocity (that one treats others as one would expect to be treated), what is best for society while supporting individual rights, etc. It is not always perfect, but it is open to reasoning and arguement. That doesn't mean that it is completely arbitrary since there are trends in human nature, coupled with the logic of reciprocity that keep it within limits.\n \n\"More often left to elites\" - exactly. I don't know if secular moral philosophy getting more community discussion would really change it much. I don't think the \"influence of the passions\" would change enough to make it less controversial with Christian organizations/beliefs.\n\n The goal of secular morality is not to make it pallatable to Christian organizations and beliefs. It is to try to reason out morality based, again, on principles such as reciprocity and what is best for society while supporting individual rights. There is some sense of moral relativism (in that most secular moral philosophies will not claim that there is one absolute truth when it comes to morality) but that does not mean that it is completely random. Certainly, there are people out there who use moral relativism as an excuse for absurd actions but they are rarely the people who actually analyze any of their actions and think in terms of reciprocity or other goals of secular morality. They are simply people who want an excuse for bad behavior. That is why I think it is important for secular morality to gain a better means of passing on wisdom to the populace, just as religions have churches to pass on wisdom to the populace. It helps keep the irresponsible people in line.",

Indeed, in my post, I specifically said \"though religious moral teaching sometimes outlines its reasoning\" - meaning that I aknowledge that there are moral rules whose reasons are illucidated. Indeed, there is great overlap between religious and secular morality since much of the morality is either uncontested or easily explained (such as moral rules against murder). \n \n However, religion, far more so than secular morality, seems to compartamentalize that reasoning - i.e. it uses reason in some situations but not in others. Take the gay rights issue. The great majority of religious rhethoric I hear about it is that it is against God's teaching in the Bible, or a very vaguely generic \"it is unnatural\" or some such arguement - not arguements in any detail about why it might be inherently wrong. The same is true for sex before marriage and other issues - some which draw more general sympathy and some which draw only localized sympathy. It is largely these unsupported (or undersupported) proclamations that people care about (sex before marriage, gay rights, etc.) that make religious morality lose its authority.",

The difference is in the expectation of benevolence. It would be nice if everyone went out of their way to help others. Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to expect it and any moral rule that expects it will not have a high degree of people following that rule. However, most people can be convinced by an arguement that points out their faults by giving them the example of someone doing the same thing to them.

   "I would think that a more realistic moral approach is \"do unto others as you would expect them to do unto you\" or simply \"do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you\". The difference is in the expectation of benevolence. It would be nice if everyone went out of their way to help others. Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to expect it and any moral rule that expects it will not have a high degree of people following that rule. However, most people can be convinced by an arguement that points out their faults by giving them the example of someone doing the same thing to them. I personally have found this to be far more effective with people.\n\n Well there's a difference in what you're saying about morality and what I'm saying. As a moral charge, the idea is not to act in a way because its only as good as everyone else. I think morality is and should be more idealistic, as if in an effort to create a better world rather than just try to maintain the status quo. That's how I see it.",

One also has to present a moral goal that is more realistically achievable. The first might inspire, say, 10% of the people while the other 90% view it as too unrealistic to follow so they don't even bother. The second can inspire most of the remaining 90%. The message would then essentially be: try to go out of your way to be good but, if you can't manage that, then at least don't be bad.",

(The no-true-scottsman fallacy.) Was the holocaust immoral? Absolutely. Is that the same thing as calling it irrational? No, I don't think so--those are not necessarily the same concept. \n\n Value judgements change with changing culture, logic does not. I gave my examples of what I thought was illogical about the Holocaust - examples which I repeat here in the hopes that you will address them this time:\n \n Where the Nazis and 6 million murdered Jews were concerned, they blamed Jews for all of the problems that the Germans had experienced between the wars (an unreasoned conclusion based on emotional scapegoating, not firm facts) and assumed that all Jews were bad people (an unreasoned conclusion based on stereotyped generalizations from what might have been a few bad eggs to a whole population).\n \n Please explain how those are not examples of lack of logic?\n \n In contrast, there are certainly examples of differences in laws based on value judgements - one of which is the approach to abortion law where those on the pro-life side value the potential that is resident in the early fetus more than they value a woman's right to her own body, and the pro-choice side's value judgements are opposite. I will grant that some examples of value judgements can lead to evil actions - for example, the Nazis desire to kill people with major mental problems and limitations was a value judgment on their part. However, even there, arguments could have been made to them (assuming that those arguments would have been honestly answered and the questioner would have remained safe) about whether Nazi officials would have killed their own child if he had been born mentally handicapped. Even many of the most evil people in the world will think twice about their approach to a situation if they themselves are put in that situation. That is a type of reasoning that counters them - the reasoning of reciprocity of morality. \n \n Anyway, my main point is that one must distinguish between moral decisions based on value judgments (which are culturally dependent and which are hard to change) and moral decisions based on logic. I think morality needs to be based on both, where it is mainly the difference in value judgements that make morality not fixed but relative to a culture.\n \n In fact, I think it may be a dangerous thing to not temper reason with morality. People that claim more benevolent morality is a result of reason are engaging in semantics, IMO. There's nothing that says benevolence/morality is automatically associated with \"reason\".

And that's really the whole problem with relying on reason--there's no set standard for IT, either.\n\n Reason and logic are not the same thing. Where morality is concerned, I would say that reason contains (or should contain) both logic and value judgement. It is hard to exclude value judgment completely from moral reasoning - I suspect that it is automatically included. Those value judgements are what make up the major differences between people who try to reason out morality. However, though variations in value judgements can widen the range of moral laws, logic can very much limit the range of moral laws. Such limitations include the limitations that come from the logic of reciprocity (when people imagine that they would have to live by the same laws, then their judgements often change), simple logic such as not stereotyping a whole group based on a few examples, the logic of making sure one has one's facts right instead of jumping to conclusions, etc. \n \nBut regardless, religious people STILL engage in what YOU consider 'reason', which is my point. They aren't just checking their reason at the church door, as one would assume from some of the posts here. They don't just become mindless zombies when they start reading a Bible.\n\n I have already said that there are many religious moral laws in which the reasoning is illucidated. So, any claim on your part that I do not aknowledge any reasoning in religion is disengenuous. \n \nAgain, the examples you gave are all grey-area issues, not cut and dried ones, and sometimes people fall on the same SIDE of the issue as religion does in these cases without being religious themselves. I know this for a fact because I know people that are that way. it's not like becoming an atheist suddenly magically transforms one into a pro-gay premarital-sex accepting evolutionist.

And for someone to assume they DO own it is to engage in the same sort of arrogance that religion itself has engaged in at times when it comes to morality.\n\n Again, I never claimed that we have a monopoly on reason and, given many of my comments in the previous posts, I find this accusation disengenuous. As I said before, there are many religious moral laws whose reasoning is illucidated. However, as I have stated, there are also examples of religious moral laws (that probably draw more attention since they are usually the most contraversial onces) where the reasoning behind a moral law is not illucidated but expected to be accepted on faith. \n \n Faith does not inherently contain reason. Faith, instead, expects one to accept something as true without question. Reason is the very asking and answering of those questions, and further asking questions based on those answers, ad infinitum. When something, such as gay rights, is accepted on faith without a full open-minded discussion being allowed, then I would say that very little or simply very faulty reasoning is being used. Again, when one uses reason, it means that one doesn't automatically assume truth but, instead, one tries to get at it through nested questions, answers and debate. \n \nI also think you're being er .... unreasonable (ahem!) in demanding an example of atrocities only within the last 9 years only ('21st century', as you call for). The emphasis on reason has been around a very long time; it grew out of the enlightenment and so I think examples from more than 9 years ago are not inappropriate at all.\n\n Very well then, how about if we extend it to the last fifty years - which covers most of our lifetimes. That is the world we live in - the world that we have experienced in our lifetimes. \n \n Actually, I can present an example myself of certain things that the secular world accepts without full reason that occasionally can lead to problems. Namely, there is an automatic unquestioned assumption that Democracy is always good. Criticism of that concept is something that even the secular world often might automatically scoff at without hearing out the arguements. Fareed Zakarhia has come up with a book about it (which I hope to read) but I have also heard other arguements against Democracies in certain cultures. For example, take a look at Iraq. It would idealistically be great if a true Democracy could be set up there but the prospects are fairly limited. The main problem was that the Sunnis and Shiites have great animosity against each other (though there are many who would be fine living side by side, there are far too many extremists that stoke the flames of hatred). In any Democracy that is not supervised by a greater power (such as the occupation forces of the US), then the Sunnis know full well that they would be marginalized, their rights would be limited, and they could easily be subject to government violence by the majority Sunnis. That is a major reason why they fight - wouldn't you? Democracies can only be successful if the rights of their minorities are protected - not all cultures are currently capable of such self-restraint.\n \n Also, Hitler was apparently elected Democratically and then he went about using his new power to cut off Democracy and introduce a dictatorship. So, there are various situations that Democracy is not self-sustaining and can lead to populist dictatorships.\n \n So, these are examples where Democracy is not always ideal and, going back to our main point, an example where secular reasoning is also often limited. However, the advantage of secular reasoning is that such arguments can be presented and, eventually, can change people's minds. In religious moral philosophy, there is often no room for change so an absurd law is either ignored (such as stoning of people engaging in adultery) or is automatically followed nonetheless (such as the proclamations against gays) - depending on how much of the populace is willing to accept those laws.",

   "It's a little too easy to just step back and call atrocities \"illogic\" in reasoning just because we can look upon them from the standpoint of culture that has changed.\n\n Say whaaa???\n How is that \"easy\"?\n A society evolves, but it is restricted from recognizing that its past actions were immoral???\n Because you think it's \"easy\"???\n \n Talk about thoroughly arbitrary objections.\n \n \n \n --that it wasn't really reasoning because it was bad. (The no-true-scottsman fallacy.)\n\n CLAFCLOW.\n Nobody is arguing \"it wasn't really reasoning because it was bad\".\n That would be circular logic.\n \n Another opinion clearly explained the violations of \"reason\"....an unreasoned conclusion based on emotional scapegoating, not firm facts...\n ...an unreasoned conclusion based on stereotyped generalizations from what might have been a few bad eggs to a whole population...\n \n \nWas the holocaust immoral? Absolutely. Is that the same thing as calling it irrational? No, I don't think so--those are not necessarily the same concept.\n\n CLAFCLOW.\n Nobody is saying irrational and immoral are the same concept.\n \n Another opinion explained some attempted moral justifications for the holocaust, and explained how they violated rational thinking.\n The same problem is seen in the \"unnatural homosexuality\" arguments.Anti-gay poster: Homosexuality is wrong cause it's unnatural.\n Pro-gay poster: One way your claim is flawed is because homosexuality IS natural. Animals do it.\n Anti-gay poster: Wow. You think it's okay to do something just cause animals do it???\n REASON demonstrates how the conclusion is invalidated, because the \"A\" portion of the \"If A, then B\" argument has been proven false.\n \n \n \nIn fact, I think it may be a dangerous thing to not temper reason with morality. People that claim more benevolent morality is a result of reason are engaging in semantics, IMO.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Cause arguing that \"benevolent morality\" is achieved just cause some burning bush supposedly told somebody something several millenia ago is SOOOO much better...\n \n \n \nThere's nothing that says benevolence/morality is automatically associated with \"reason\".\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n CLAFCLOW.\n The real issue is that SECULAR (reasoned) morality is superior to religious morality.\n Secular morality involves reason.\n Religious morality habitually involves \"Some guy claims to have spoken to God thousands of years ago, therefore I gotta do what he says...\"\n \n \n \nAgain, it goes back to the fact there is no outside standard for reason. There's no 'reason' committee in place somewhere, setting the rules. And that's really the whole problem with relying on reason--there's no set standard for IT, either.\n\n I invite readers to compare Jyoshu's argument to the \"religious morality\" approach...\n Again, it goes back to the fact there is no outside standard for religion. There's no 'religion' committee in place somewhere, setting the rules. And that's really the whole problem with relying on religion--there's no set standard for IT, either.\n \n The real issue is that with secular morality, PEOPLE CAN DISCUSS the validity or invalidity of the reasons behind the morality.\n Religion habitually involves \"We got told to think this way, and God doesn't change\".\n \n The bible states that women CANNOT be teachers of males. Period.\n So either we ignore that, or we follow that.\n \n \n \nBut regardless, religious people STILL engage in what YOU consider 'reason', which is my point. They aren't just checking their reason at the church door, as one would assume from some of the posts here.\n\n :xbanghead\n I really don't think you get what that is showing.\n Religion says to do something, and the followers recognize the flaws of the religious edict based on secular reasoning.\n \n The secular morality supercedes the religious morality.\n The secular morality is recognized as better than the religious morality.\n \n So which is recognized as superior in that case???\n Get the point?\n \n \n \nThey don't just become mindless zombies when they start reading a Bible. Again, the examples you gave are all grey-area issues, not cut and dried ones, and sometimes people fall on the same SIDE of the issue as religion does in these cases without being religious themselves.\n\n Suppose you have a magic-8 ball and a computer giving you the answer to a math problem.\n The magic-8 ball and the computer happen to agree.\n Does that mean that one is not better than the other? :xbanghead\n \n \n \nI know this for a fact because I know people that are that way. it's not like becoming an atheist suddenly magically transforms one into a pro-gay premarital-sex accepting evolutionist. And so what if one DOES use God's will to inform reason.... To assume that's automatically a lapse of reason is to engage in one gigantic begging of the question.\n\n :xbanghead\n \"one DOES use God's will to inform reason\"\n If I were to tell you that John believes God speaks to him through his magic 8-ball, would you say John \"uses God's will to inform reason\" on decisions in his life?\n If I were to tell you that Mark believe God speaks to John (same one as above), would you say Mark \"uses God's will to inform reason\"?\n \n The Old Testament is filled with people who spoke to burning bushes, thought God told them to kill their son, etc, etc, etc...\n If you were told about similar people who made such claims in modern times, you would probably scoff at them.\n But just cause millions of people have believed it before you, passing it down like some chain letter, you want to claim it's \"informed reason\"???\n :xbanghead\n \n Perhaps we need a thread as to why some people think the religious process can be called \"reason\" in the first place.\n And before the inevitable obfuscation, I have no doubt that there is inevitable overlap between the two. A stopped clock is still right twice a day.\n But most reasoned men would not look at a clock that is only right twice a day and insist that it is divine \"reason\"...\n \n \n \nIt's not like the issue of God's existence is settled; if an omniscient God exists, someone would be a fool to NOT let it inform his or her reason, no?\n\n Do you realize how many people have lived over the years who have tried to hand out all sorts of contradictory claims as to what \"God(s)\" supposedly wanted people of earth to do?\n \n Even within the bible, in books passed down by people claiming to believe the same thing, there are inherent contradictions. All in self-proclaimed \"messages\" from God.\n \n Me personally? If I knew God wanted me to do something, I would take a hard look at the request and probably do it if it was within my power.\n But that's not what we have.\n What we have is PEOPLE who claim to speak to God (and in modern times that is often an automatic indicator of crazy) who tell others that God wants them to do something. And these requests habitually look like their own PERSONAL governance, instead of divinely inspired governance.\n They reek of human foolishness, arrogance, and/or greed.\n \n And the things that they do get right are such absurd no-brainers (don't kill one another? how original! emoticon_rolleyes ) that any child can recognize it as legitimate morality, and claim it divinely inspired.\n \n Part of the problem of the \"religious experience\" is the presumption to listen to people who have self-proclaimed religious/divine experiences, without any real proof.\n \n \n \nThe whole idea of thinking of the situation as religion and reason being pitted against ea other is invalid to begin with. Religious people are engaging in reason too; they've just come to different conclusions sometimes.\n\n And AGAIN we need to come back to reality on this issue.\n \n When religion actually succumbs to reason, you want to use those examples that they are not \"pitted against each other\"???\n :xbanghead\n Cause when religious people \"engage in reason\", that is often what is truly going on.\n \n And as for another side of that Venn diagram, whereby reason reinforces an area of religion that some people see as lacking reason???\n WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?\n I can give you examples where that DOES NOT happen.\n Lemon Test, which you so repeatedly abhor, allows for a rule that happens to be religious if there is a SECULAR JUSTIFICATION FOR IT.\n And if there were secular justifications for these religious rules that Christians want to legislatively implement, it wouldn't be a problem and you wouldn't be complaining about it.\n But people like you recognize there OFTEN ARE NOT secular justifications, and you want your religious rules anyways, ergo the complaints...\n \n Another example? Gay rights issues.\n I have REPEATEDLY asked for any \"legitimate state interest\" which would justify discrimination against gays. Over and over again, I see RELIGIOUS justifications brought forth, but NO SECULAR justification for discrimination against gays.\n Another example where \"reason\" completely fails to reinforce \"religion's\" ideals.\n \n \n \nSorry, but you simply don't have a monopoly on reason! You don't own it. It's not like you have a Reason Committee\u0099 to appeal to in terms of what's the standard, and so you don't get to say \"hey, mine is legitimate reason and yours is not\". And to assume you DO own it is to engage in the same sort of arrogance that religion itself has engaged in at times when it comes to morality.\n\n Boringly pretty words, that are thoroughly empty.\n How about an example?\n \n How about an example where some people proclaim \"This religious standard lacks reason\" and you can SHOW a reason for the religious standard?\n Otherwise, your complaints on \"monopoly\" are amusing cause you aren't even able to attempt to sell a competing product.",

   "Value judgements change with changing culture, logic does not. \n\n \n How exactly do you arrive at the idea that logic is enough to make moral judgments? (That's the term you're using now, and if I'm misunderstanding you, please say so.) Logic can't tell you whether or not to apply ethical consideration to scientific work, or to what extent to do so. It can't tell the nuances of morality that determines when the needs of the few may be important than the needs of the many (to use a 'trek-ism'). Logic is objective, and you're talking about issues that are often subjective. I don't see how you can argue logic is sufficient. Call it reason, call it logic--whichever you think of it as--it needs morality to temper it. I simply don't want my morality dictated only by cold logic. you may feel differently for yourself, and that's your choice of course. I don't want to live that way. My points about this still stand even if you refer to it as \"logic.\" If everything were CLEARLY logical, there wouldn't be any controversies in our culture. These forums wouldn't exist because it would all be cut and dry and there would be no disagreement. Standards of logic are easy with things like mathematics; not so standardized when it comes to sociological issues. (Edit: reading down through your post further, it seems that you don't advocate logic-only after all, and so I think we may agree in some ways on this. If I'm understanding you correctly.)\n \n \nI gave my examples of what I thought was illogical about the Holocaust - examples which I repeat here in the hopes that you will address them this time:\n Where the Nazis and 6 million murdered Jews were concerned, they blamed Jews for all of the problems .... \n Please explain how those are not examples of lack of logic?\n\n \n Where I think you're misguided here is in assigning logic or lack thereof as a causality. If they had only applied benevolent morality to their logic, it wouldn't have happened, after all. Again, what they did was no doubt completely 'logical' in their own thinking. \n \n \nEven many of the most evil people in the world will think twice about their approach to a situation if they themselves are put in that situation. That is a type of reasoning that counters them - the reasoning of reciprocity of morality.\n\n \n IMO, that's not \"logic\" though. What you just described isn't 2+2=4, it's simply a way of conducting morality. It's no more than saying one should think of a situation with himself in the place, so if anything, it's an appeal to self-preservation emotion, in a sense. Not really logic.\n \n \nI think morality needs to be based on both, where it is mainly the difference in value judgements that make morality not fixed but relative to a culture.\n\n \n Alright. And I think if you review my points, that's largely what I'm saying too. After all, I've said quite clearly that logic needs to be tempered with morality. I think we're saying much the same thing here, just in different ways.\n \n \nReason and logic are not the same thing. Where morality is concerned, I would say that reason contains (or should contain) both logic and value judgement.\n\n \n Again, I think religious people do indeed use reason, and in that sense I have to agree, based on my observation and experience. \n \n \nIt is hard to exclude value judgment completely from moral reasoning\n\n \n I'd go farther than that and say it shouldn't be excluded. Again, logic needs to be tempered with morality. One can't feel cold hard logic toward their fellow human beings. But one can feel compassion, for instance.\n \n \nI have already said that there are many religious moral laws in which the reasoning is illucidated. So, any claim on your part that I do not aknowledge any reasoning in religion is disengenuous. \n\n \n I'm not making that point in rebuttal towards you. I'm simply making the point in general because I think it is an extremely important one. IMO religion is somewhat looked down upon in this forum, wrongly so, and so I think it needs to be emphasized that religious people generally use reason as well. It's not an either/or scenario.\n \n \nHowever, as I have stated, there are also examples of religious moral laws (that probably draw more attention since they are usually the most contraversial onces) where the reasoning behind a moral law is not illucidated but expected to be accepted on faith.\n\n \n I think your parenthetical statement hit the nail on the head. A religious nutcase gets far more PRESS than the many, many more who are reasonable people. Then we have some who think they champion reason who believe religion is bad in ANY case. Or that it's bad to have religion inform morality. That view in and of itself is unreasonable.\n \n \nFaith does not inherently contain reason. Faith, instead, expects one to accept something as true without question. \n\n \n I think there needs to be a distinction made here between the term \"faith\" and religious belief. Of course 'faith' is about accepting something--a leap of faith, after all. I've studied much of the evidence pro and con, for instance, in terms of the early church and New Testament writings. I don't NEED faith to believe they are legitimate; the evidence suggests they are, and there is a lack of evidence to disprove them. That's reason, not just faith. That's what I mean by saying you don't own reason. I may have come to different CONCLUSIONS than you have, but that doesn't mean I'm not thinking through it. \n \n \nReason is the very asking and answering of those questions, and further asking questions based on those answers, ad infinitum.\n\n \n Do you not think many religious people do this? I certainly do, as do most Christians I know. \n \n \nWhen something, such as gay rights, is accepted on faith without a full open-minded discussion being allowed, then I would say that very little or simply very faulty reasoning is being used. Again, when one uses reason, it means that one doesn't automatically assume truth but, instead, one tries to get at it through nested questions, answers and debate. \n\n \n So, if a debate takes place, and continues to take place, but someone comes to different CONCLUSIONS than you, you're ok with that? You're satisfied that reason has been utilized? Again, I think anyone who assumes religious people aren't wrestling with this issue in society has no idea what's really going on in religion. Trust me, there's PLENTY of debate and questioning going on about that subject. \n \n I'm sorry, but to be perfectly honest, I find the call from skeptics for more 'debate' and 'questioning' to be somewhat humorous, if not disingenuous. If you're satisfied with someone questioning and debating, but then coming out of it with conclusions DIFFERENT than yours, then very well. But most of the time, I find on such issues that calling for people to \"question\" and \"debate\" to more be code words for accepting the views of the one calling for questioning. IMO it's the height of arrogance for anyone to associate one side's views and conclusions with a lack of questioning. With all due respect, my religious views HAVE come about through questioning and debate, thank you, even if they are not the same views you have. \n \n \nVery well then, how about if we extend it to the last fifty years - which covers most of our lifetimes. That is the world we live in - the world that we have experienced in our lifetimes.\n\n \n Alright then ... the excesses of the sexual revolution, for example. It's not like STDs and the effects of drugs weren't well-known, and I think you'd be hard pressed to find religious motivation behind it. Logically, why NOT sleep around? It's fun and harmless when taking precautions. But wait .... it seemed to cause a lot of problems nonetheless. Apparently logic wasn't enough to ensure they WOULD take precautions.",

The last guy who tried (RamFel) tried to argue that sperm had a purpose and since homosexuality didn't utilize sperm's purpose, that made it immoral... emoticon_ic\n \n Furthermore, you're pulling this usual junk where you talk about satisfying ONE condition, and automatically thinking that ALL conditions must be satisfied.\n If I am having a discussion with a religious person who is basing his argument on the bible, that's one thing.\n But if the argument suddenly becomes \"logic\" based, but I still don't agree, that doesn't mean I automatically yield cause logic was used.\n OF COURSE the dispute can still go on.\n But the LEVEL of the dispute is obviously raised to a more intellectual level when the one side doesn't blindly rely on \"cause some ancient sheep-herder told me to think this way...\"\n \n \n \nIMO it's the height of arrogance for anyone to associate one side's views and conclusions with a lack of questioning.\n\n But in a lot of cases, ENTIRELY ACCURATE.\n Make no mistake. I am not saying that is the way in EVERY case.\n I am saying there are a LOT of cases where your declaration of \"height of arrogance\" is just you being annoyed with the truth.\n \n \n \nAlright then ... the excesses of the sexual revolution, for example. It's not like STDs and the effects of drugs weren't well-known, and I think you'd be hard pressed to find religious motivation behind it.\n\n And without surprise, jyoshu HAS AGAIN MOVED THE GOAL-POSTS...\n Jyoshu, you weren't just asked to find a non-religious \"atrocity\".\n \n You were challenged: \"Secular morality seems to be more consistent in trying to keep their arguments based on reason / logic.

   "Another Opinion, would you have a problem if we discussed this in the Challenger's Corner, where we can do so one-on-one? I don't have the time to address multiple posters on this and it's already getting redundant here, especially when they are rather long posts. But I'm enjoying our dialog. I appreciate your penchant for civility and willingness to constructively discuss over confrontation.\n\n I would be fine with discussing this in the Challenger's Corner if you like. My understanding is that Challenger's Corner is not really a formal debate but simply one between two posters that tries to adhere to general rules of civility, and structure - in at least trying to address all of the opponents points.\n \n It would then be useful to copy over the existing posts we have on the subject to that thread. Do you know how to do that? I don't.\n \n \n Meanwhile, I will answer the previous post in this thread ....",

   "It would then be useful to copy over the existing posts we have on the subject to that thread. Do you know how to do that? I don't.\nI don't think there is a handy way to do this---however, IMHO, the nearest best thing to it would be (I know this would be a pain) to copy and paste the relevant posts into your first few Challenger's Corner posts... which might take up a few, but at least you'd have a pre-existing foundation outsiders could follow on from.\n \n Second best would maybe be to post links to them, instead of the complete versions. There, of course, you'd have to rely on readers' willingness to click there to be able to fill themselves in.\n \n OR you could just start from scratch with \"first principles,\" lay out a beginning hypothesis in your first post, and proceed from there...though, considering the topic, may not sit well with your anti-rational opponent, I don't know. And of course, he may not accept your challenge at all.\n \n (I'm running a private pool, by the way, as to whether he does or not. :))\n \n \nThose who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider whether they argue against reason with or without reason; if with reason, then they establish the principles that they are laboring to dethrone: but if they argue without reason (which, in order to be consistent with themselves they must do), they are out of reach of rational conviction, nor do they deserve a rational argument.--Ethan Allen, \"Reason, the Only Oracle of Man\"\n",
