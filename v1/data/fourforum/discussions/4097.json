   "Christian theology teaches that every human being has an immortal soul. After the body's death, an individual soul (still possessing consciousness) is supposed to enjoy everlasting life in company with all the other souls already present in God's heaven. It's easy to understand why this doctrine is believed by so many people: a transcendent existence that reunites family, friends, and relations in eternal happiness seems a very appealing prospect.\n \n But for secular humanists, atheists and materialists, the absence of any convincing evidence or arguments to support the idea of immortal spirits enjoying an everlasting future, puts the entire \"theory\" beyond belief. Yet even the most rational reductionist can \"look forward\", and backwards, to a kind of immortality - which might be described as follows:\n \n Every living organism has an atomic and molecular structure that remains biologically active until the time arrives for its disintegration. After death, the natural processes of decay will (eventually) scatter the atoms from the variety of elements that formed the living creature. These atoms will then rejoin that enormous but finite pool of matter from which everything in the universe has been and will be assembled. Some particular atoms (and molecules) will of course find another temporary residence in future living organisms (reincarnation ?): but none will be destroyed and all will share the ultimate fate of the universe. This is the \"immortality\" I envisage.\n \n We should also account for the origins and prehistory of the atoms which are now doing a temporary job in the bodies of every living person. Apart from simple hydrogen and possibly a trace of helium, all these atoms now currently on active duty throughout humanity were synthesised (or \"cooked\" if you prefer) in the stars billions of years ago. The hydrogen originated in the Big Bang.\n \n It all adds up to a very very long life for those indispensable bits of ourselves that we can never see.",

   "Interesting concept you have there , it does make sense in todays high tech world, somewhat. I wonder if someday that this mode of thinking could not merge with the Christian belief in some way ? I think the Christian version of \"all will rise again in a NEW spiritual body\" after the physical death , has been one of the hardest doctrines I have tried to understand. ...\n \n When one puts in to play the absolute fact of total physical decay , and/ or cremation of the physical body , one has to wonder how all the \"atomic matter\" would be reunited to the right person, to be present for the Christian judgement day. On the other hand , it is also hard for a person to dismiss the notion that there is not a \"afterlife\" for the human body ( soul, spirit, entity, whatever one chooses to call it) especially after that person has had a experience in such matters.

   "I don't think all Christians feel it is simply a soul that enjoys immortality. The authors of the Matthew, Luke/Acts and John seem to go to great lengths to describe Jesus' resurrection as a bodily one. The stone needed to be rolled away, he let people feel his wounds, he ate, etc. Some people assume this is what is to be expected, similar to Greg's musings above.\n \n It may explain this Christian nation's peculiar custom of mummifying the deceased, and placing them in vaulted coffins, an abhorrent idea. Let the atoms free! Let them breathe again.",
