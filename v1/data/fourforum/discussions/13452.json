   "funny peculiar that only the Americans can afford American \"football\". Why nobody plays American 'football' in Europe or Australia, we can't afford the gear?\n \n Get real! \n\n \n American football isn't something that you start playing when you go to college. Most successful players start playing when they're very young in peewee football. The expenses for football gear for growing kids for 2 decades is considerable. I doubt that many poor kids around the world choose a $250 football helmet over food. \n And in the more affluent countries, as I stated before, it takes a huge infrastructure to support a quality football program from youth to adult and I'm sure soccer is easier to fund and participate in. Additionally, it takes ONE referee and two line judges. Football is immensely more complex, requiring more, highly trained referees.\n \n\n how come basketball is not the most popular game of the world? it only takes a basket, a pole, a small court and 10 players?\n \n\n \n Actually, basketball has become VERY popular around the world. There are professional basketball leagues in Europe and it is going wild in China. \n \n\n Is Basketball Slowly Replacing Soccer As Top Global Sport?\n \n \n The English Premier League (EPL) is the \"embodiment of sporting globalisation,\" but in recent years the popularity of soccer has \"plummeted, taking down with it the sport's leading brand,\" the EPL, in favor of basketball and the NBA, according to Julian Borger of the Manchester GUARDIAN. The \"meteoric rise of basketball in China almost certainly means basketball has now surpassed [soccer] as the world's leading sport, in terms of the number of active players.\" The success of basketball in China represents \"one of the most stunning marketing coups of our time.\" Fourteen NBA games are broadcast live every week on state TV and 51 regional stations in the country. In January, the NBA set up four offices in China. The contrast with the EPL's fortunes \"could not be starker,\" as the league \"does not have an office or a single representative in Beijing.\" But \"a lot of this is not\" of the EPL's making, as \"some of it is due to chance.\" Borger: \"We are now in the midst of a second round of sporting globalisation. It is a more voluntary affair, requiring willing sellers and willing buyers, so Britain's sporting exports are facing much stiffer competition.\" It is \"not enough for today's professional clubs, leagues and associations to collect subscriptions and ticket receipts -- like any other corporation, they must grow, and that ultimately means spilling over their borders\" (Manchester GUARDIAN, 12/6).\n Is Basketball Slowly Replacing Soccer As Top Global Sport?\n \n\n \n\n how come baseball is not the most popular sport of the world? one ball a stick and some dummies standing still ?\n \n\n Baseball is also growing around the world. \n \n\n Baseball goes global \n America's game takes on world flavor as talent flows to majors \n Friday, March 30, 2001 \n By JIM CAPLE\n SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER \n Not all that long ago, baseball's so-called major leagues were limited to U.S. cities east of the Mississippi or along its western banks. Baseball's idea of internationalism was nicknaming someone Dutch or Heinie. \n No longer. Baseball may be on the decline in U.S. inner cities, but it is expanding across the globe as steadily and surely as Mo Vaughn's waistline. Foreign-born players made up 24 percent of major league opening day rosters last year, with 198 players representing 16 countries and Puerto Rico. Two years ago, baseball opened its season in Mexico. Last year, it opened in Japan. This year, it opens in Puerto Rico. \n \n Baseball has more of an international flavor than a shelf of Starbucks high-priced exotic blends. When the Expos and Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu played the Dodgers and Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park the first week of last season, fans could listen to the game in English, Spanish, French, Japanese and Korean. \n This spring the Mariners had players from Japan, Korea, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Aruba, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, Puerto Rico, China and even Italy -- can't wait for that Francesco Imperiali baseball card -- in their major and minor league camps. \n How far has baseball extended its borders? \n \"The Mariners have a scout in Europe. Imagine that,\" Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln said. \n And not just Europe. The Mariners have either part-time or full-time scouts in Korea, Taiwan, China and Australia, and obviously also keep a close watch on players in Japan. Nor are they alone. The Mets have had a full-time scout in Japan for five years. \n \"There are numerous teams that never had a face in the Pacific Rim before that realize they have to have a presence there now, even if it's just following the guys we scout,\" said Ted Heid, Mariners director of Pacific Rim scouting. \n In time, the World Series could be truly and exactly that. \n Baseball goes global \n\n \n\n how come rugby is not the most popular sport of the world ? one funny ball and no expensive headgear ?\n \n how come .... etc ?\n \n The reason only Americans play gridiron is because Americans are dumb and boring. Their redeeming feature is that they play basketball.\n The truth is only Blacks play basketball or gridiron, the whities are a token minority. Maybe by law (in the constitution perhaps) there must be a minimum number of white players in every team?\n \n Americans are funny\n\n \n Again Winston, your mouth is moving but everything coming out of it is false.......per usual. Just because you're out of touch with what the world does, doesn't mean that the rest of us are. Stick to a topic that you have at least a modicum of exposure to, such as brutal Chilean dictators.",

   "American football is awesome. The fact that it is more complicated, involves more strategy, and takes more people to play (as opposed to soccer or basketball, where 2 people can basically play 1-on-1 against each other)\n makes it less popular in other countries. \n \n I would guess that most people who don't like football (but like other sports) have very little understanding of the basic rules.\n\n \n It is boring to be honest and far less flowing or entertaining than Rugby football.\n I think its the cheerleaders that draws the crowdsemoticon_xhoho",

(For example, I hate the NBA, but I follow college basketball because I have a team.)

I could just as easily say that soccer is just a ton of guys on a ridiculously large field jogging around and constantly turning the ball over, rarely scoring, getting elementary-school-esque colored cards for discipline, ridiculously flailing and exaggerating any contact, and playing while the clock counts up.

   "Hockey is one of the few sports left for real men.\n By comparison:\n American football: A 16 game regular season?? Gee, don't strain yourself.\n Soccer: A mostly non-contact sport, pu-leeese.\n Basketball: Home for people that couldn't make it as gang bangers.\n Tennis: Ping-pong played while standing on the table.\n Baseball: a place where getting it right 30% of the time is considered really good. (.300 batting average)\n Golf: Does anybody actually consider this a sport.\n \n Hockey: Full contact, issued a weapon, minimal pads (except goalie), 75+ game season, hardest professional sports trophy to win.\n \n :):):):)\n\n \n Bravo Lurch. I was wondering if anyone was going to bring up the best sport in the world. \n \n An aside...doesn't it seem like the NHL is getting a little rediculous with the suspensions for quasi-pseudo-almost legal hits? The gave Upshall a 2 game suspension for his hit on Bartulis in the game Tuesday against Philly. Wasn't even close to boarding like they called it. Sad. What ever happened to \"put on a helmet, get in there and hurt somebody\"? \n \n Why do I love hockey? It's the only sport where you can see goals like this, and your punishment for this is that you have to go sit down for 5 minutes. (btw...I love a good goalie fight)\n \n GO CAPS!!!!!",
