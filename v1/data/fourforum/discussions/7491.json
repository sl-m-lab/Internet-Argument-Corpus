   "I have taught for years. I taught with a teacher who taught her views on government in the United States. She of course is a liberal democrat. She teaches these college students her views, and how the government should be run in her own views. This is not right. Now, she retired. She later became a substitute with me. I was walking by a classroom and heard her teaching some ninth graders her views on government, and how Republicans will ruin Amerika and so on. This is not right.\n Teachers now a day are democrats, liberals, or both. Now, these kids need to decide which party to belong to, or have their own views. They don't need liberals, republicans, democrats, conservatives, or whatever telling them what to think. I have my own views on government. I despise democrats, but this is Amerika. They have the right to their own views. It is opposing views and conflict over these views that result in Amerika's prosperse. In other words, if we just had Democrats, we would be in big trouble. But, I respect democrats opinions. My seventeen year old daughter is a democrat. I don't like that, but I respect her views.\n But my point is, kids fourteen and older should decide which politikal party they support for themselves. They don't need teachers telling them \"Oh, republicans are Amerika's problem. They are the downfall of Amerika.\" \n Now, I teach political science a lot at colleges when I am substituting, and sometimes I teach a high school level of civics, and politics in high school. I taught ninth graders once, and for god sakes. Fourteen and fifteen year old kids have great grasp on government. I asked a question about the war in Iraq just to conduct my own personal experiment to see how these kids are with politics. I admit, I did not expect them to know anything about politics. I asked about the Patriot act, and they most have the same views as the republicans do. \n Kids are smart. They can think for themselves. These kids are probably politically active anyway. I can tell these kids watch the news and stuff. \n But, should teachers that teach civics, political sciences, or government be allowed to teach politcal standpoints of theirs to children? Like telling them this is right, and the republican view is wrong, or vice versa?\n I want your comment.",

While this is a free speaking forum it would be nice for people to stick on topic for atleast the first 3 posts....already we wasted 2 posts on this thread :p\n \n As for the orginal topic, I agree. It is getting out of hand. I actually have had some of these teachers and some teachers that are neutral. Not only do the neutral teachers teach better but you learn more from actually hearing the topics and forming your own opinions. Constitutional law classes are the worst for having agenda teachers :)",

The right are happy to whine about lefty teachers but keep quiet or actively promote inviting businesses and the military into schools.\n \n I also wonder whether John has stopped to think about why so many teachers are left-wing.

Also the left don't really care about the students and are more concerned about their benefits and keeping the unholy alliance between the teacher unions and the democrats strong. The students would be served much better in a school choice system backed by vouchers. Schools would strive to be the best eliminated the so called caring teachers who put their benefits and union loyalty above student education.",

Why do you have a problem with the government funding science?\n \n \n... but subjects regarding our origins have question marks around them and should be chosen by the parent which should be allowed in a free democracy.\n\n The only question marks regarding evolutionary theory have to do with specifics and mechanisms. There is no scientific doubt that evolutionary theory is true; it has the same standing as gravitational theory or the germ theory of disease, except that it has been strengthened by being the subject of much critique by rabid fundies. It is quite possibly the best-supported biological concept in existence. If you care to deny this, start a thread in the Creation/ID vs. Evolution forum, and your arguments will be thoroughly dismantled and refuted.\n This XXXX about parents' choice is getting very old. If a parent has no significant education in history, why should that parent have such a significant role in determining what is taught? Apply this to any and every subject. If you're not familiar with the mathematics behind the summation of infinite series, why should teachers ask you if and how it should be taught?\n \n \nAs for Government tax credits the government only sees money going to the parent.\n\n If the \"credit\" is for a specific purpose, namely education, and the recipient does not spend it on education (but rather religious instruction), you see no problem with it? If grant guru Matthew Lesko tells me how to get $50,000 to start a new business, and I spend it all on twinkies and ramen noodles for my friends, do you think the government doesn't care?",

I was in the car and we were talking and my brother pointed out something about Lincoln suspending the writ of Habeus Corpus (which I actually hadn't heard) for some people. He was saying how it was for the good of the country, and when I challenged him on that he said \"well that's what my history teacher said\". I asked him how it was any different than what Bush is doing in Gitmo, suspending their rights for \"the good of the country\". I tried to explain that it sets a dangerous precedent when we allow anyone to simply take away rights for \"the security of the country\". But he still maintained that the country would have fallen apart without him doing that. But basically it was because his teacher had told him that Lincoln was good and what Bush is doing is bad (well I don't know about the second part coming from a teacher, but I agree with him on that. We can't be taking away rights for the sake of security. Then all we have to do is have a permanent state of war. Wait a minute...).",

Teacher Bob knows a lot about education. Parent Charlie may know only a little of both/either. Why should Charlie's opinion of how to teach science and what science to teach matter more than Alice's and Bob's?\n This would be a good place to make the sad-but-true observation: In the U.S., we need a license and a passing test grade to drive. We need a license and training to teach. We even need a license to have a dog. But there is no license or training required to have a kid. (No, I'm not saying this should be changed, I'm simply pointing out that becoming a parent does not instill knowledge of parenting techniques -- or science, or English, or history, or math, or philosophy, or anything else -- upon a person.)\n \n \nGranted there will be the occaisional parent who simply doesn't care about his/her kid, but they are few and far between.\n\n Will you please explicitly also grant that even those parents who do care won't necessarily always be correct about what is best for their children? (Please? Just so I can be sure that you get it?)\n In fact, won't you also grant that average parents are not as qualified to make these decisions as people who have been trained in the appropriate subjects? These people's holding of government positions (some do, some don't) don't render their qualifications void.\n \n \nWhy does it matter if someone is taught that the Earth evolved after God created it?\n\n If you mean in public schools, it matters because government money is funding religion, which is a violation of the Establishment clause.\n It's not my place to demand that parents or churchgoers be restricted from teaching their beliefs, but that doesn't mean that I think it's right to promote lies or discourage people from making their own religious decisions.\n \n \nBecause the fact that evolution occurred is well-established fact.\n\n I know this, and you know this.

Religous progamming also plays it's part in this, In the US televangelists apparently have no safeguards whatsoever leaving it wide open to blatent rip off merchants to clean out the mentally challenged.\n By contrast the BBC Religous Programmes have no such connotations, although there is an obvious Christian bias (Usually broadcast on Sundays, Songs of Praise is explicitly Christian and the H&E Show always has a Christian story and is dedicated to Christian groups at least half the time)\n As **** as religous programmes are they do keep the lid on things.\n\n \n I read that 40% of UK citizens aged 16-25 declare themselves atheist or agnostic. I'd consider that an indication of what will be and is a major political impact on how politicians cater to the public with regard to political control through religion. \n \n Compared to any country from the US down on this continent having enormous control over populations through belief systems that demand adherence to biblical dogma (televangelists and the stigma of birth control in S. America being prime examples), I consider religion to have far less of a hold on UK citizenry and consequently politicians than it does in the US. \n \n Tony Blair has not publicly proclaimed hearing voices from Jesus nor has he stated Jesus is his favorite philosopher. Any US president or S. American dictator/elected leader is unable to ignore religion as a tool of governing and still reflect the general public.",

The Church of England is like any other denomination--it has it's liberals AND it's conservatives. If they were so for human rights as you say, the Archbishop of Canterbury would be more eager to embrace liberal episcopals' gay clergy movement in the U.S. \n \n Furthermore, Blair, like many in the UK, falls somewhere between the CoE and Roman Catholicism. (His wife and children are Catholic, from what I understand.) There has bee speculation for a long time now that he would convert to Catholicism. \n \n What I most have a problem with in your post however, is your one-sided view of American Christianity that, just because it may not support GOVT. and politically-correct social justice and \"peace\", that it's not practicing what it preaches. Or that Bush is a \"reflection of U.S. Christianity.\" Wow, talk about a gross generalization.",

Blair equivocates on things that the church has a very clear position on, such as trade justice, and the ethics of slaughtering civilians because you don't like their leaders.\n\n \n Well, I'd still say \"White-Anglo-Saxon Protestants Christianity\" is still quite a generalization in terms of Bush's faith. Sure, is he IS white and anglo-saxon, and protestant, but then so are many Unitarians and liberal Episcopals. I don't mean to needle you here, I just don't like to see religion painted with broad brushes. If all you meant was that it was limited to being white, of European descent, and protestant, then fine--but that wouldn't make a lot of sense with our context here. WASP simply means one is white, anglo-saxon in descent, and protestant.\n \n In terms of Blair's equivocation on harmful trade issues and \"slaughtering civilians\", if that's true then I agree with you. However I find it hard to believe that Blair would be for slaughtering civilians. Perhaps the issue is that he differs in the way he thinks that issue should be addressed, or believes that there are cases where collateral damage of civilians being killed cannot be avoided so easily.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean by: \"Blair, like many in the UK, falls somewhere between the CoE and Roman Catholicism\". There is an Anglo-Catholic faction in the CofE, but that is a long way from being Roman.\n\n \n Yes, the forever on-going \"Oxford Movement\" that never really ended. Yes, it's a long ways from being truly Roman. I only meant that Blair's worship and beliefs seem to fall between what is generally considered CoE and what is generally considered the tenets of Roman Catholicism.\n \n \nHow is US evangelical Christianity practising what it preaches when it says the Bible is inerrant and the Bible says \"it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven\"; yet these same evangelicals are prepared to back discredited supply side economic policies because it gives them an excuse to give the wealthy more money.\n\n \n Do you really think they support that economic model simply because they \"want to give the wealthy more money\"? They believe it's best overall for the nation's economy. Claiming it's been \"discredited\" is a HUGE statement--many don't believe it's been discredited at all. They simply have a different view of what is best overall for the country than you do.\n \n This is one thing I don't understand about contemporary liberalism. On one hand it preaches separation of church and state religiously--even to the point that religion should NOT enter into politics in any way. But then on the other hand, there's this strange expectation toward religious people that religion should lead one to support certain govt. policies and economic models over others (welfare, Govt. social engineering progs, high-tax economic models, etc.)--in other words that religion SHOULD play into govt. and policy. I don't get that double standard.",

   "Protestant evangelicals voted for Bush by about an 80:20 margin, that's who I was referring to.\n \n I've never suggested religion should be kept out of politics. I've said that people's views on personal morality should not be imposed by the state. I'm fully in favour of religion in politics, how could I not be when my faith informs my own politics?\n \n As to Catholicism, the CofE has always embraced a diversity of practise, as well as of belief, that's why it's still one church, here in Lancaster you will find a whole range of different styles of worship, from the anglo-catholic tradition, through broad church mixed styles and lutheran simplicity to evangelical styles. Apart from attending mass occasionally (something that I do myself) I fail to see what Blair has done that makes him particularly Roman, but in any case the Roman Catholic church has been strong on issues of human rights as well, parts of it have been very strong on social and trade justice too.",

I'm fully in favour of religion in politics, how could I not be when my faith informs my own politics?\n Isn't this an inconsistent thought though? The \"state\" is made up of people that have their own personal morality and are speaking on behalf (in theory) of the people that have views based on their own personal morality. If a moral comes from a religious base shouldn't matter....For example a murder law could be formed because some people think murder is wrong since their religion thinks it is wrong. This view can't all of a sudden be not included because it happens to stem from a religious beleif. \n \n I do agree that you can't make laws that declare certain relgious things to be law though...such as \"everyone must be a baptist\" or \" you have to attend a christian church twice a week\"...those are directly religious laws which violate the 1st amendment....making moral laws that may happen to align with religious views are not.",
