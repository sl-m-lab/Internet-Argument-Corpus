   "This author says 62,000,000. In total, Communists accounted for about 100 million deaths during the 20th Century and yet there are those who still worship at the Communist alter because we haven't done it right, yet.\n ===============================\n Tuesday, April 26, 2005\n How Many Did Stalin Really Murder?\n \n May Day is coming up, which used to be a day of celebration in the Soviet Union with an impressive show of weapons and infinitely long parade of soldiers. Perhaps, then, it would be appropriate to pay special attention on this day to the human cost of communism in this symbolic home of Marxism, and worldwide. This blog is on Stalin and the Soviet Union. I will post one on the overall cost of communism next week.\n \n By far, the consensus figure for those that Joseph Stalin murdered when he ruled the Soviet Union is 20,000,000. You probably have come across this many times. Just to see how numerous this total is, look up \"Stalin\" and \"20 million\" in Google, and you will get 38,800 links. Not all settle just on the 20,000,000. Some links will make this the upper and some the lower limit in a range. Yet, virtually no one who uses this estimate has gone to the source, for if they did and knew something about Soviet history, they would realize that the 20,000,000 is a gross under estimate of what is likely the true human toll.\n \n (Snip)\n \n \n I did a comprehensive overview of available estimates, including those by Conquest, and wrote a book, Lethal Politics, on Soviet democide to provide understanding and context for my figures. I calculate that the Communist regime, 1917-1987, murdered about 62,000,000 people, around 55,000,000 of them citizens (see Table 1.1 for a periodization of the deaths).\n \n http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB1.1.GIF\n \n As for Stalin, when the holes in Conquest's estimates are filled in, I calculate that Stalin murdered about 43,000,000 citizens and foreigners, over twice Conquest's total. Therefore, the usual estimate of 20 million killed in Soviet democide is far off for the Soviet Union per se, and even less than half of the total Stalin alone murdered.\n \n But, these are all statistics and hard to grasp. Compare my total of 62,000,000 for the Soviet Union and 43,000,000 for Stalin to the death from slavery of 37,000,000 during the 16th to the 19th century; or to the death of from 25,000,000 to 75,000,000 in the Black Death (bubonic plague), 1347-1351, that depopulated Europe.\n \n http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/04/how-many-did-stalin-really-murder.html",

Yours sounds very accurate. Although, not completely. My father, history teacher, and books I have read state that thousands are still missing today. I don't know though.\n Would you beleive my history book states that Stalin \"MAY HAVE BEEN \" responsible for those murder's?\n I don't know what would give them reason to not beleive he is responsible. They have letters ordering the deaths. \n Yes, it is amazing that people still support it. I myself have never lived under communism. My great grandfather did in the thirties forties, and fifties before he came to America. He lived in the USSR.\n But, anyway. I have read The Communist Manifesto, Engels, and Lenin. After reading those books, I came to realize that the system works. \n Communism is meant to improve land, economically be better for the country, people work as a comminion and make that economic dream a reality, no private property, yada yada yada.\n The system Marx and Engels dreamed of could work. It is theoretically a better way to run the country, and again theoretically could be economically better for it. But, in reality, it will never work. The soviet union could have worked had the leaders not abused power, killed many people, and stole the wealth from others to keep for themselves. \n I read the books of Marx and Lenin and not once in the book, does it mention killing political adversaries and keeping stability through deadly means. \n Anyway, ttyl\n -Chris",

   "Great as the death toll under state-capitalist regimes claiming to follow some form of marxist-lenninist ideology has been, it is much lower than that under market-capitalist regimes.\n \n Under Stalin, the vast majority of deaths were the result of starvation.\n \n Only counting children under 5, 10.1 million people died of starvation in 2005 - almost all in the developing world (which is just about entirely market capitalist). This doesn't take into account deaths from disease, which are also massive, those murdered by market-capitalist governments and those over 5. If we assume similar figures for 1997 - 2007, this already 'beats' 100 million (the highest proposed 'communist' figure). \n \n I am not a marxist, and to my mind lenin's betrayal of the russian revolution was one of the greatest tragedies in history - but market-capitalism needs to be stopped, now.\n \n Viva the revolution.\n \n (It wont let me post the link for my stats as I dont have enough posts)\n \n Also: The reason stalin's administration killed more than slavery and maybe black death is because populations were far smaller back then.",

In total, Communists accounted for about 100 million deaths during the 20th Century and yet there are those who still worship at the Communist alter because we haven't done it right, yet.\n\n \n And yet if you simply ask for evidence to verify the claim that Hitler killed SIX million, you're a wanted man in Europe and many other places. Obviously, he's being made to take the rap for all of Socialism-- and his identification as being one with the face of Anti-semitism seems to coincide well with this, given the strong pro-Socialist sentiment in the Jewish lobby; this likewise plays well with the Zionist tack, in attracting US aid for Israel at the expense of American domestic security and other interests, when logically the UN is the one responsible for doing that.\n In fact, no one can voice this criticism as being simply pro-American or-- or even being even-handed-- without being labelled an \"anti-Semite,\" or even a Nazi sympathizer or \"Holocaust denier.\"\n \n \nThe comparison of Stalin and Communism to the Black Death is most appropriate.\n\n \n That's still too selective. When Hitler allegedly killed 6 million Jews (\"allegedly\" since you're not allowed to question the figures), it's called a \"Holocaust\" (i.e. the end of the world), he's called the Devil incarnate, and you can be arrested in Europe for even being asking for validation of the figures. \n However when Lenin and Stalin kills 40 million+, Tojo kills 30 million in China, and Mao likewise kills 30 million in China, then it's not even sniffed at, all the killers are absolved in history, and there's no pressure whatsoever to admit it. Ditto for Pol Pot killing 10 million in Cambodia-- not to mention the untold millions elsewhere in the world in Soviet client-state nations in Africa, the Middle-East, Cuba etc by various other Socialists and dictators.\n \n Likewise, the judges of the Nuremberg testified personally on C-span, that they were only able to account for 1 million names, with the remainder being based on estimates; but if anyone asks for verification, they are called a \"Holocaust denier\" for failing to blindly accept allegations by the personally outraged, i.e. no one is permitted to simply verify claims for mere historical accuracy, but is bullied into accepting oft-repeated figures without objective verification of any sort.\n \n Clearly there's hypocrisy, double-standards, and selective outrage going on; not only are some lives being considered more valuable than others, but also these \"others\" are being deliberately under-valued in order to make the least-murderous among them look more heinous than the others. \n \n Likewise, the fact is being deliberately obscured, that Hitler represented the global majority of the era, i.e. totalitarian socialism followed by most of Europe, Asia and Africa-- as well as central America, the Middle East and Cuba.\n \n Clearly this is a smokescreen to both villify America's chief enemy-- i.e. Hitler-- under the doctrine of vae victus, as well as a means to absolve Socialism as the murderous evil which it clearly represents; instead, Hitler is being made the scapegoat in order to hang the burden of all world-evils on one convenient vanquished in a blaze of self-righteous hypocrisy-- which is particularly beyond all decent credibility, when viewed in light of the similar and greater crimes committed by his allied enemies-- which the Third Reich was chiefly in reaction against, following the illegal scheming and success of united actions against Germany just 20 years prior.\n \n Likewise, Japan was conveniently absolved of the notably more heinous war-crimes-- including the maltreatment of American prisoners-- probably to divert from the American war-crime of using women, children, and other noted non-combatants as Guinea-pigs for nuclear-bomb tests, as well as deliberately-targeted mass-victims of such.\n \n You don't have to be a bloodhound here, to smell a cover-up of epic proportions. When someone tells you \"believe this or go to jail,\" you KNOW something's afoot; it's virtually a state religion-- which is the hallmark of Socialism, i.e. the state as a secular corporate ruling entity, which none may question-- without being silenced one way or another, as with MOST people who \"ask too many questions\" of a shadow-government.",
