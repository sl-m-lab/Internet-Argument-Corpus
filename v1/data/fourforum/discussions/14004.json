I believe I mentioned Charles Templeton in a previous thread, you can Google him, but I think you probably are familiar with him. In the final analysis, faith is inherently personal. That Charles Templeton lost his faith was his problem. We are not concerned about what is going on in the mind of the next guy. Faith is a learning process and if, at some point in the process a person lets that faith pass away, we usually don't know WHY that happened, but the reasons are almost completely personal.\n \n \nSkeptics convert to other religions also. They do so based on the evidence and/or an experience with the divine, but either they are wrong or the theory is flawed. \n\n \n Just because someone is a skeptic does not necessary make them the most clear-thinking individual.

By and large debaters who can hold their own have studied both sides of the equation. Can you give any example of well seasoned debaters who do not apply the verses to themselves?
