We know a lot more about post-abortion harm to the mother.\"\n \n The legislature debated a similar bill two years ago, but Governor Mike Rounds vetoed it because of concerns over some technicalities.\n \n Hunt says, \"We have made those corrections to the bill.\"\n \n Sunday, Hunt and other anti-abortion advocates held an event promoting their legislation. They say now is the time to pass it, because other states are considering similar bills and because with new Chief Justice John Roberts, and possibly Samuel Alito, the US Supreme Court is changing.\n \n Hunt says, \"Two very solid, we feel, pro-life candidates. Again you never know but based on their testimony to the senate we feel they're good candidates.\"\n \n Hunt says he thinks enough other lawmakers support the bill for it to pass, but he still thinks the decision will be a close one.\n \n He says, \"I learned a long time ago the only time you really count the votes is when you're taking the votes.\"\n \n Hunt will also introduce two other bills this week. One is meant to ensure doctors explain the risks of an abortion to a woman is writing.

Their agenda is pretty simple: judges should not say that something is a Constitutional right if it is in fact not in the Constitution. Such was the case in Plessy, which the court reversed 58 years later thereby correcting it's error. And such is the case in Roe.\n \n \nAlso do you think this legislator will keep his job?\n\n This guy will undoubtedly keep his job.

The reason that mostly consevatives would propose such legislation is because, for the most part, it is conservatives that desire such legislation. It isn't because they can't mind their own business (no government does), it isn't because they want to control peoples lives (every government does to a degree), nor is it because they are heartless (they obviously care very deeply about the issue).\n \n \nHOw about this LET THE PEOPLE VOTE.

The people of South Dakota, through their elected representatives, are formulating the State's policy position toward abortion. This is what conservatives mean by \"let the States decide.\" That means, \"let the States decide in accordance with their own constitutional requirements.\" That is what we call federalism.\n \n \nAre they afraid to take this to the voiters? I don't think it would pass since the majority supports abortion rights.\n\n Conservatives are not afraid to take the issue of abortion to the voters. This in fact is what they desire, which is why they advocate the reversal of the wrongly decided Roe v. Wade case.

   "What agenda do conservatives have? Their agenda is pretty simple: judges should not say that something is a Constitutional right if it is in fact not in the Constitution. Such was the case in Plessy, which the court reversed 58 years later thereby correcting it's error. And such is the case in Roe.\n \n\n \n The fact that an anti abortion judge was nominated and is expected to overturn roe is a prime example of an agenda that the conservatives said they didn't have.\n \n \n\n I tend to think this is incorrect. The reason that mostly consevatives would propose such legislation is because, for the most part, it is conservatives that desire such legislation. It isn't because they can't mind their own business (no government does), it isn't because they want to control peoples lives (every government does to a degree), nor is it because they are heartless (they obviously care very deeply about the issue).\n \n\n \n To interfere with a womans decision about an aspect of her body is an example of not minding ones own business. Conservatives want to control peoples sex and moral lives. You can not deny this. I could point to many examples and quotes of conservative republicans that want to pass laws that will effect the lives of people who do not share their moral beliefs and force people to live by their moral standards, which I consider to be evil and corupt.",

I agree this is a State's Rights issue.\n \n Like this one:\n \n http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/stories/2003/07/27/canCongressGetACluemedical.html\n \n \"In an attempt to claim that there is no medical need for marijuana, he then proceeded to include in the record the package insert from Marinol, a high-priced cannabinoid based drug that was speedily approved by the government (with the encouragement of the pharmaceutical industry) for use in easing many of the same symptoms that marijuana helps. He just conveniently failed to mention that Marinol is generally less effective, has worse side effects, greater dosage control issues, and is more expensive than marijuana.\"\n \n \nI wonder how far you can take this. For instance, you may never allow \"the people of the country\" to tell you what's best for your health, but we need only look at an example to prove that \"the people of the country\" can make a law in that arena anyway. Marijuana, for example. You may not think marijuana is harmful to your health, but if you smoke it, you break the law. And if you break the law, you can be punished under that law. Even if you don't think the \"people of the country\" can tell you what is best for your life or your health, they still legitimately do so in many areas.\n\n \n Legalization of marijuana is also a State's Rights issue, is it not?\n \n If you're for States Rights, you should be against the DEA, or at least against its denial of medical marijuana (or any marijuana for that matter). The feds can regulate interstate commerce, but they can't regulate a plant grown in one state (in one house) and smoked in that same state (or same house).

Such an eggregious attack on the Constitution needs to be righted, IMO, regardless of whether or not one is in favor of abortions. It is a blight on the Court and the Constitution. :xbanghead\n\n \n Yes! We need more Republicans in favor of impeaching Bush over warrantless searches. I recently learned that Clinton too authorized warrantless searches, but with court approval. Wow! The courts actually approved circumvention of the constitution, which states in unambiguous terms that there shall be no warrantless searches by anyone. Clinton should have been impeached and convicted based on that alone, but he wasn't. Which means, that likely Bush won't either.

   "So in order to prove that abortion causes mental illness they bypassed interviewing the women because it wouldn't have a huge impact? Steve, if you wanted a direct correlation you would have wanted to interview and incorporate their feelings into the research.\n No. Once again you fall to read the conclusion\n \n \nConclusions: The findings suggest that abortion in young women may be associated with increased risks of mental health problems.\n\n \n \nIt is nice you want to talk about results and all but I am speaking about links. An explained correlation. Again, you don't understand the scientific method at all.\n What I posted had correlation data in it. This study used the scientific method. I like how you resort to critizing me instead of the actual study. Maybe this suggests that you don't want to be admit that you are wrong.\n \n \nThe results of this analysis are summarised in Table 4 which shows estimates of the covariate adjusted incidence rate ratios for the number of mental health problems. The association between pregnancy/abortion history prior to 21 and number of mental health problems from 21-25 years remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment (p = .008). In addition, consistent with the previous analysis, the results show a clear pattern in which, after covariate adjustment, those who were not pregnant and those who were pregnant but did not have an abortion had rates of disorder that were not significantly different (p < .05), whereas those having abortions had rates of disorder that were significantly (p < .05) higher than both of these groups.\n\n \nIrrelevant. The conclusion is the end results of the study, Steve. It is a big whopping maybe. You are grasping straws right after you gave yourself the deathblow.\n I find it said that you can't see a difference when someone says \"our data shows a relationship between abortion and mental health issues...this study therefore shows there maybe a relation\" and \"there might be a relation but our data in inconclusive\". \n \n If I go to a McDonalds and get sick everytime I eat there then I would say \"it might be McDonalds that is getting me sick\"...the evidence would suggest this but at the same time it could very well be something else or even mere chance.\n \n \n In the end Linus, you haven't read the study yet you think you know what data it has. You discredit the findings as nothing \n \n You use the work \"link\" a lot as if it were lifesupport for your arguement...well, get ready to unplug that.\n \n \nthis paper reports an analysis of the linkages between abortion in young women aged 15-25 and subsequent mental health in a birth cohort of young women studied to the age of 25\n If you wanted the work \"link\" you got it big guy.\n \n here is another one:\n \nIn this study we have used data gathered over a 25-year longitudinal study to examine linkages between mental health and exposure to abortion in adolescence and young adulthood. This study produced evidence consistent with the view that in young women, exposure to abortion was associated with a detectable increase in risks of concurrent and subsequent mental health problems.\n\n \n \nTo our knowledge, no previous study of this topic has combined all of these features to examine the linkages between abortion and mental health.\n\n \n What will you think of next?",

We can draw two purported justifications for the legislation from the article. Notice that it says:\nHunt says, \"DNA testing now can establish the unborn child has a separate and distinct personality from the mother. We know a lot more about post-abortion harm to the mother.\"\n I believe jitobear focused us on the maternal health issue, and thus this whole thread jumped on that bandwagon. However, there is yet the issue of the \"sepreate and distinct personality,\" that South Dakota is claiming. There may be a plethora of opinions about what that fact means, but in the end, the question comes down to who should decide. I say the States should. That is the issue at stake with this proposed legislation; not whether their justifications are true or whether you agree with them, but whether the State should be able to make it's own decisions when it comes to abortion.",

Tie your damn tubes.\n\n \n If anyone did any research into the partial birth abortion they will see it is absolutely barberic. It gives me chills thinking about it. Essentially the fact of partial birth is a late-term baby is placed in the breach position and the doctor pulls this baby out and once the doctor sees the head jabs a large syring/needle into the skull collapsing it, now that is horrifyiing. The thing is all these late term babies can survive outside the womb. Premature babies at six months with technology can survive outside the womb. A human baby's fate is in the hand of the mother solely, there is something so wrong here. \n \n Even in the event a woman's health is at risk in a late term, medical science is such where the baby can be extracted unharmed, death does not have to occur, partial birth is yet another last minute gruesome \"choice\" for the mother, but no \"choice\" for the baby.\n \n In the event of deformity of the child, well, we simply live in a shallow society. I don't know what people call deformity. Some countries think female gender is a deformity and will abort, and do. A missing limb? Deafness? Blindness? Is that a deformity to kill? To hate? When we walk around and see a person \"different\", no arm or no leg, blind or deaf, do we hate them so much we think \"why didn't their mother abort them\"! \n \n We've grown up in a society where imperfection is cause for the death penalty.\n \n I can't help but think of a movie I saw where an entire family had disabilities, where the parents had their own children but also adopted like 12 others with severe disabilities. I know we all are different, but how can some people see the beauty of life while others see life as insignificant.\n \n If partial birth abortion is going to continue, at least FOR HUMANE REASONS, pull the baby out COMPLETELY, don't play that political game where the baby's whole body/trunk is out and the head is almost out and \"our law\" allow doctors to violently kill it, my goodness if we hate so much, let's give the baby a little respect if you can call it that, pull the baby out and put the baby to sleep with medicine at least DON'T shove a syringe in the head and collapse it...SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We have gone too far in the name of \"choice\"-for-mom! Hitler, Saddam and other brutal dictators are evil, brutal and barberic with their killings, but we are no better, a violent death like partial birth abortion is gruesome!!!!!\n \n America alone kills on average 1 million babies a year with abortions and we are called a \"civilized\" country?

   "I have three children of my own and my wife has had zero abortions. Are you attempting to say that anyone who is anti-abortion can only be so if they adopt orphans? Maybe you should rethink that tactic. I'd bet that most pro-life advocates already have kids. There's no Litmus Test that says you have to adopt orphans to be Pro-life just as there is no Litmus Test that says you have to have had an abortion to be pro-abortion. \n Do I have to adopt a drunk to be against drunken driving? emoticon_confused\n\n \n My point was that if pro-life advocates who do not want abortion permitted are concerned, why don't they have an open adoption policy for unwanted babies and offer that alternative to abortion?",
