   "Audra Shay, vice chairman of the Young Republicans and the leading candidate to be elected its chairman on Saturday, is now the latest in a growing list of GOP officials learning this lesson the hard way, based on pictures of a now-deleted Facebook page obtained by The Daily Beast.\n \n On Wednesday, Shay-a 38-year-old Army veteran, mother, and event planner from Louisiana who has been endorsed by her governor, Bobby Jindal, ... initiating a political conversation by posting that \"WalMart just signed a death warrant\" by \"endorsing Obama's healthcare plan.\" At 1:52, a friend named listed as Eric S. Piker, but whose personal page says his actual name is Eric Pike, wrote \"It's the government making us commies... can't even smoke in my damn car... whats next they going to issue toilet paper once a month... tell us how to wipe our asses...\" \n \n Two minutes later, Piker posted again saying \"Obama Bin Lauden [sic] is the new terrorist... Muslim is on there side [sic]... need to take this country back from all of these mad coons... and illegals.\"\n \n Eight minutes after that, at 2:02, Shay weighed in on Piker's comments: \"You tell em Eric! lol.\"\n \n Shay now claims that she was only responding to Piker's first comments, not having noticed the second. The eight-minute gap between the second post and her response strains the credibility of this defense.\n \n It didn't take long for other posters on Shay's page to do the math. First, Derek Moss wrote \"What's disheartening is the use of the word 'coon' in 2009. Wow... I'm usually outnumbered about 500-to-1 on Audra's threads so go ahead, lemme have it, I deserve it.\" He apparently expected to be criticized as among this crowd for calling out the racist comment. \n \n Cassie Wallender, a national committeewoman from the Washington Young Republican Federation, then wrote: \"Someone please help a na\u00efve Seattle girl out, is Eric's comment a racist slur?\" She answered her own question one minute later: \"Okay, why is this okay? I just looked it up. 'It comes from a term baracoons (a cage) where they used to place Africans who were waiting to be sent to America to be slaves.' THIS IS NOT OKAY AND IT'S NOT FUNNY.\"\n \n This was followed soon after by the chairman of the D.C. Young Republicans, Sean L. Conner, who wrote \"I'm really saddened that you would support this type of racial language. ..wow! Thanks Cassie for standing up...\"\n \n Shay was silent on this exchange, but soon word started spreading throughout the Young Republican circuit, open to GOP members under 40. Significantly, Shay then \"de-friended\" Wallender and Conner-in the world of Facebook, that means cutting off relations-after calling her out, but kept Piker as a \"friend\" (subsequently, it appears their profiles are no longer linked).\n \n \"If Audra really did find these remarks to be 'outright disgusting,' then why was her response to immediately de-friend those who made statements against Eric's blatant racism?\" Wallender wrote yesterday in a letter to the Young Republican National Committee. \"I was blocked for stating that Eric's racist comment was \"NOT OKAY. And it is not funny.\" Please take a moment look at the entire screenshot linked above, and ask yourself: which comment would lead you to de-friend someone, mine, or Eric's?\"\n \n In the face of the \"coons\" comment, Shay's main concern seems to have been damage control. She deleted the controversial exchanges from her page (but not before screenshots were taken) and tried to tamp down the fire internally. Almost eight hours after Piker's comments, and Shay's ensuing \"LOL\", Shay posted a Facebook status update stating that neither she-nor her Young Republican political slate-\"condones the use of racial slurs on my wall.... It is not right to nor appropriate to talk that way and will not be accepted!\"\n \n At 10:31 p.m., a friend named Dale Lawson raised the P.C. defense, writing \"the over reaction to it was a little amusing.\" Then her friend Piker came roaring back: \"I agree with dale... this is still America... freedom of speech and thought is still allowed... for now any ways... and the last time i checked I was a good ole southern boy... and if yur XXX is black don't let the sun set on it in a southern town...\"\n \n ....\n \n Taken by themselves, the exchanges on Shay's page might be dismissed as an isolated ugly incident. But there's a pattern emerging from the fringe of the GOP grassroots. Three weeks ago, former South Carolina State Election Director and Richmond County GOP Chairman Rusty DePass \"joked\" on his Facebook page that first lady Michelle Obama was descended from a gorilla which had gone missing from a local zoo. Days later, Tennessee state legislative aide Sherri Goforth emailed out an image labeled \"Historical Keepsake\"-showing august portraits of all the presidents of the United States, ending with a pair of googly-eyes peering out from a black background to symbolize President Obama. When confronted, the aide to State Senator Diane Black said only that she regretted sending the image to the wrong email list and from her government address. She was \"reprimanded\" by her supervisors but not otherwise punished (a forced furlough at Memphis's National Civil Rights Museum would have been an inspired penalty). And of course, all this has taken place after Chip Saltzman's bid to be RNC Chairman was derailed by his decision to mail out a parody CD featuring the song \"Barack the Magic Negro.\"\n \n \"It seems like some of us Republicans are taking our conservative message, mixing it with personal prejudices and racist views, and calling it patriotism,\" says McAllister. \"You can cover cyanide with chocolate, but you still can't call it candy.\"\n \n This pattern of racial remarks from grassroots Republican politicos highlights a real problem: As the party tacks right, it seems increasingly reluctant to challenge folks on its fringe for fear of offending the base-even, in this case, by failing to immediately rebuke racist supporters on a Facebook page. Let's say that Shay's \"LOL\" response was the online equivalent of nervous laughter, the kind of passive response to racist jokes that may have once been considered acceptable in pool halls and country clubs of the past. In the Internet era, it offers indelible evidence of acquiescing to something evil in our politics. There is a fear-based paralysis, a lack of moral clarity, which is in direct contradiction to their historic role as the Party of Lincoln.\n\n New GOP \"Racist\" Headache - The Daily Beast\n \n And some people wonder why blacks are predominantly voting Democrat... emoticon_ic\n \n The below picture was taken from a McCain/Palin rally.\n http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c114/foundit66/Protestor_Allowed.jpg\n \n While I do not believe racism dominates the RNC, it is a problem that needs to be addressed by the RNC.

   "\n \n And some people wonder why blacks are predominantly voting Democrat... emoticon_ic\n \n\n \n I'm still wondering. Do they like massive taxes passed down to them? You know, the ones the Dems always levy on corporations that they pass down to the little guy in the form of increased prices for goods and services? Do they need a big daddy government for handouts? I don't think they do. I think they're quite capable of telling the government to go pound sand IF THEY WANT. But instead, the Dem leaders keep promising them goodies and they keep voting for the goodie providers.  Isn't God their provider, or aren't they supposed to take care of themselves? All the Dems want to do is keep them on the planatation so they can provide for them. In return, the blacks vote for them.\n \n And where is abortion approved in their Bibles (note Jeremiah 1:5; Psalm 139;19, etc.)? WHY AREN'T THEY LOOKING OUT FOR THE LITTLE BABIES AND VOTING AGAINST THE PRO-INFANTICIDE CROWD???  And they call themselves Christians?? Almost 70% of their children are born out of wedlock. WHERE'S THAT IN THEIR BIBLES, WHERE FORNICATION IS OK? AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS?? WHAT KIND OF CHRISTIANITY IS THAT??? Plus, they're ok with the Dems approving gay marriage? Where's that in their Bibles?  Have they never read Leviticus 18:22; Lev. 20:13; Romans 1:26-27; I Cor. 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.? \n \n Not that there aren't a lot of white's and hispanics doing many of the same things. Frankly, they disgust me too when they vote for the party of carnal hedonism and trillion-dollar spending programs.",

   "emoticon_wow\n I really don't know whether to be shocked and disgusted, or just disgusted (without shock).\n After that racist display, the group STILL ELECTED her...\n \n \n \nAudra Shay, the Young Republicans leader accused of endorsing racism on Facebook, was elected head of the group for GOP members under 40 this afternoon.\n \n Audra Shay, who became the subject of a national controversy after The Daily Beast uncovered racist comments she wrote on Facebook and other social-networking sites, won the race to become head of the Young Republicans by approximately 50 votes (out of about 950 voting delegates) at their national convention this afternoon in Indianapolis.\n \n Shay faced calls to remove herself from the election after appearing to laugh at a racial slur about President Barack Obama, The Daily Beast's John Avlon exclusively reported. The comments, in which Shay responded to a comment calling blacks \"coons,\" were quickly deleted, but prompted fellow Young Republicans to urge her to take her hat out of the ring for the national election. And though Shay issued a statement that neither she, nor her Young Republicans slate, \"condones the use of racial slurs on my wall,\" Avlon reports that Shay has a history of racial comments, encouraging extremism and partisan hate online.\n \n Before the election, Meghan McCain urged the group not to choose hate by electing Shay: \"What exactly do the Young Republicans expect to achieve by electing a 38-year-old woman who thinks racial epithets are acceptable?\"\n \n Young Republicans insiders had expected the vote to be \"very, very close\" and said that many delegates were urging unity no matter who the winner turned out to be.\n \n Shay defeated Rachel Hoff, who serves as the Young Republicans' Director of Media Relations. She ran on a five-point platform that emphasized education, technology, and community outreach. According to George P. Bush, son of Jeb Bush, \"Rachel's professionalism, hard work, and leadership will well-represent the GOP.\" Sarah Huckabee, daughter of Mike Huckabee, said, \"Rachel Hoff's approach to politics and life seems to be: 'Stand Up and Lead.'\"\n\n Young GOP Chooses Hate - The Daily Beast",

I've seen a lot of white nigg*rs in my time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\n\n \n We can infer many things from this quote. Those on the left will say that Robert Byrd was making an equation of equality between white and black by calling all race baiters \"nigg*ers\". Or, we can use the right's version of the phrase and just ignore everything else and focus on one word and completely forget about context. To me, I can understand (though not really agree) with what he is saying and regardless he had the decency to apologize for the above statement almost immediately. \n \n Did Byrd vote against both Marshall and Thomas? Yes, yes he did and for very different reasons. He voted against Marshall in 1967 because he was still very much of a racist at the time. He voted against Thomas (like most democrats did) because Thomas had some serious problems but to imply he voted against Thomas because of race is to simply over simplify.\n \n Did you know that Byrd endorsed Obama way back in May of last year?\n \n How does the NAACP rate Robert Byrd?\n \n \nIn the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP)[53] Congressional Report Card for the 108th Congress (spanning the 2003-2004 congressional session), Byrd was awarded with an approval rating of 100 percent for favoring the NAACP's position in all 33 bills presented to the United States Senate regarding issues of their concern. Only 16 other Senators of the same session matched this approval rating. In June 2005, Byrd[54] proposed an additional $10 million in federal funding for the Martin Luther King memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that \"With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently.\"\n\n \n Sheesh, couldn't even give 110%, what a bigot.\n \n Not that any of this matters, what do you think of the new leader of the Young Republicans? I can guess that as long as Robert Byrd has that (D) after his name you're never going to like the guy. What about the Young Republican that this thread is about? Yep, obfuscating......you're doing it wrong.\n \n Hey, Robert Byrd was a dixiecrat who changed his ways, what party took in the rest of the dixiecrats when the democratic party moved to the left?

I've seen a lot of white n-word in my time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.[45]\n Byrd's use of the term \"white n-word\" created immediate controversy. When asked about it, Byrd responded,\n  I apologize for the characterization I used on this program... The phrase dates back to my boyhood and has no place in today's society... In my attempt to articulate strongly held feelings, I may have offended people.[45]\n\n Robert Byrd - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I have said it before. Some people (foolhardy IMO) attempt to strip the word \"n-word\" of its racial connotations/denotations. They utilize the word (in their own personal definitions) whereby the word IS NOT about race.\n They use the word in a racially neutral attempt like saying \"white trash\" would be applied regardless of race.\n \n I don't agree with it, but I would hope that some people would appreciate the REAL INTENT of the word.\n A parallel would be like people complaining that anti-gay Christians \"hate\" gays, when the truth can be something else.\n Here, I don't see Byrd's use as racially derogatory, but rather a misguided attempt to use a foul (IMO) word in a way that ignores races.\n \n And quite frankly, isn't ignoring the race of people something that we should want in the first place?\n \n \n I find your allegations amusing, especially considering how the NAACP looks at Byrd...\n \nIn the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP)[53] Congressional Report Card for the 108th Congress (spanning the 2003&#8211;2004 congressional session), Byrd was awarded with an approval rating of 100 percent for favoring the NAACP's position in all 33 bills presented to the United States Senate regarding issues of their concern.

Time to man up.\n\n I think it's time for people to start manning up to the reasons why Republicans lost power.\n Some people complain that the Republicans get a bad rap when it comes to gays and blacks.\n I think those \"some people\" fail to recognize how the Republicans have EARNED that bad rap.\n \n This isn't about a \"bunching bag\".\n This is about a sincere belief in opposing racism.\n Please don't denigrate that belief by treating it so callously.",

They refer to the Senate's senior Democrat as the \"conscience of the Senate.\" They downplay his white-sheet-wearing days as a \"brief mistake\" -- as if joining the Klan were like knocking over a glass of water. Oopsy.\n \n This ex-Klansman wasn't just a passive member of the nation's most notorious hate group. According to news accounts and biographical information, Sen. Byrd was a \"Kleagle\" -- an official recruiter who signed up members for $10 a head.\"It's absolutely unfathomable that a man who was a member of the Klu Kux Klan would even be in the senate today. Ah, but Byrd says he's sorry--that makes it all better! So instead, let's get all bent out of shape over the racism of some newly elected leader of the \"young Republicans\" ....\n \n On another note, one figure uses the term \"white n*****\" and it's characterized by those in his party as not really being racist. Someone of much less importance uses the term \"coon\", and it's heavily condemned. The stark imbalance of reaction is striking. (I guess if Shay had said \"WHITE coon\" in the context of a discussion about race, it would suddenly be ok. emoticon_rolleyes )\n\n \n \"In the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP)[53] Congressional Report Card for the 108th Congress (spanning the 2003-2004 congressional session), Byrd was awarded with an approval rating of 100 percent for favoring the NAACP's position in all 33 bills presented to the United States Senate regarding issues of their concern.

The issue has never been whether someone should be \"forgiven\" or not.\n\n Man. You are HILARIOUS.\n YOUR position on this issue \"has never been\" including on forgiveness. \n But then again, I would love to see you give a definition of \"forgiveness\" that YOU YOURSELF can use in this situation (with Byrd), that would be uniformly applied to you by your God...\n But we both know you'll never address that about your personal beliefs.\n \n \n \nOf course he should be forgiven--that doesn't mean we have to elect the man to be a senator. I don't think Jesus meant for forgiveness to also be an exercise in stupidity in OTHER ways. \n\n \"we have to elect the man to be a senator\"???\n No. Forgiveness shows that he is ELIGIBLE to be elected, and he should be elected based on his CURRENT merits.\n \n In Christian theology, isn't it an issue that God WIPES YOUR SLATE CLEAN if forgiven?\n Or is it more an issue that God says you're forgiven, but he still won't let you do certain things cause of your past actions...\n \n \n \nNah, your point would mean something if you applied forgiveness beyond your political party affiliation. That's my point.\n\n And that's your false allegation pretense that you can read my mind.\n You can't.\n This doesn't have to do with political party affiliation.\n But that won't stop you from making that false and thoroughly baseless allegation, will it... emoticon_xdonno",

While its true that there are way more Blacks in the Dem party, this is largely due to the preponderance of blacks in the cities (not to mention the perpetuation of the myth of Pubs hating Blacks probably stymied the recruitment drive lol).\n\n I think you pay wayyy too little attention to details that most people notice.\n Like McCain voting against the MLK holiday, and that's the guy who is put up as the RNC candidate...\n \n I've also given REPEATED examples of racism in the Republican party.\n \n But on your \"preponderance of blacks in the cities\" comment, I would be really curious if there is any poll which shows a locational divide amongst blacks. Showing \"city\" blacks have a significantly higher percentage of Democrats than \"non-city\" blacks...\n I think your dividing comment is like saying \"the water evaporated because it was a hot day\", while failing to recognize that the water was sitting on top of the stove burner which was on high...\n \n \n \nI mean think about it like this... obviously the Republicans didn't come out with a memo stating that they hated blacks so where did the belief come from. Well if it didn't come from the Republicans, it must have come from the democrats.\n\n Wow. And there's the assumption it didn't come from the Republicans, just cause there wasn't a memo?\n Oh wait. There HAVE BEEN memoes. And e-mails. And public comments...\n \n This will be the third time I've posted the following...\n Rush Limbaugh's \"Barack the Magic Negro\" song.\n And then Chip Saltsman, a candidate for the RNC national chair, distributes it as a stocking stuffer...\n \n University of Kentucky's student body president Nick Phelps (Mitch McConnell protege) forwarding racist e-mails.\n \n Then there were the McCain / Palin rally issues. Racism found a bizarre \"tolerance\" within these rallies. \n Examples like this one...\n http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c114/foundit66/Protestor_Allowed.jpg\n They shouldn't have been allowed in the front door, but they were allowed in without problem.\n That, and there were various articles about vendors selling racist t-shirts and similar items.\n http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c114/foundit66/ObamaButton0001.jpg\n \n And then there is Derek Black in Florida. Republicans elected this white supremacist to a party position.\n George Allens' \"macaca\" nonsense.\n \n \n And for the issue in general, you have polls like this one.\n It demonstrates racism exists in both parties. That I have no doubt on.\n But ACROSS THE BOARD, Republicans are more likely to support NEGATIVE stereo-types of blacks by a margin of about 10 points. Republicans are less likely to support POSITIVE statements of blacks by a margin of about 10 points.\n Political Pulse | The Associated Press-Yahoo! News Poll on Yahoo! News\n \n And as I post that list, I keep thinking of more examples.\n Remember Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama? And Limbaugh turning around and making overtly racist comments about the endorsement???\n \n \n These are some of the reasons why blacks recognize an anti-black prejudice that is more dominant in the Republican party.\n \n And let's look at it from another perspective for a minute.\n Stop focusing on \"prejudice\" and talk about WHICH PARTY HELPS blacks more...\n The Republicans repeatedly fight against quotas to help mitigate past injustices which have held blacks back.\n What about the examples of Republicans trying to repeatedly make voting tougher in areas with predominantly black people? Quite frankly, I think this issue is more an issue of vote voiding for party favoritism. Gore pulled some similarly egregious junk with military ballots in 2000.\n But, while that's my assessment, a black person may see it differently, and thus another reason for why the RNC is frowned upon...\n \n \n \nI mean, the Pubs freed the slaves...\n\n Oh do not go there.\n The Republican party of Lincoln's time IS NOT the same RNC of today.\n \n \n \n... fought the Dems in the south to stop reprisals against blacks. Pubs fought for the Civil Rights Amendment. \n\n And that's another skewed perspective.\n PEOPLE IN THE NORTH (Democrats and Republicans) fought people in the SOUTH (Democrats and Republicans) on this issue...\n \n This can be seen in a variety of ways, like the vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964...The original House version:\n \n * Southern Democrats: 7-87 (7%-93%)\n * Southern Republicans: 0-10 (0%-100%)\n \n * Northern Democrats: 145-9 (94%-6%)\n * Northern Republicans: 138-24 (85%-15%)\n \n The Senate version:\n \n * Southern Democrats: 1-20 (5%-95%) (only Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas voted in favor)\n * Southern Republicans: 0-1 (0%-100%) (this was Senator John Tower of Texas)\n * Northern Democrats: 45-1 (98%-2%) (only Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia opposed the measure)\n * Northern Republicans: 27-5 (84%-16%) (Senators Bourke Hickenlooper of Iowa, Barry Goldwater of Arizona, Edwin L. Mechem of New Mexico, Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, and Norris H. Cotton of New Hampshire opposed the measure)\n Civil Rights Act of 1964 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n The clear dividing line IS NOT \"democrat vs republican\", but rather north vs south.\n And if you want to take it a step further, look at the comparison of SOUTHERN democrats vs SOUTHERN republicans.\n NORTHERN democrats vs NORTHERN republicans.\n \n The Republican percentage is worse than the Democrat percentage in both areas...\n \n \n \nFord appointed blacks to the cabinet as did Regan, G H W Bush, G. W. Bush appointed like 6 and a Supreme Court Justice. And now there's a black LEADER of the Republican Party! I can't see where the Pubs turned into haters of blacks?!?!?!?!\n\n See the above.\n Your comments make it seem like we should judge the party based on four people who have nominated blacks.\n But let's look at the Democrats, who are habitually FIRST in these efforts...\n The first Black U.S. cabinet member: Robert C. Weaver, 1966&#8211;1968, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Lyndon Johnson; the first black female cabinet minister was Patricia Harris, 1977, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Jimmy Carter.WikiAnswers - Who was the first US president to be appoint a black cabinet member\n With more than 30 appointments to his credit, President Bill Clinton has named more Black ambassadors than any other president in history.National Headliners.(African American ambassadors)(Brief Article) - Jet | Encyclopedia.com\n Where his predecessor, George Bush, could find only one qualified woman, one African-American and two Hispanics for his Cabinet, Clinton nominated three black men, a black woman and two Hispanic men to join nine white Cabinet nominees &#8212; three of them women. George W. Bush&#8217;s push for diversity in his own Cabinet this year can be seen as an affirmation of Clinton&#8217;s work on that front.Leaving diversity in his wake - The Clinton Years - MSNBC.com\n \n And to clarify, this doesn't prove anything (IMO) about party comparisons any more than your comments above about what four republican presidents did somehow proves something about the party in general.\n But as for perception, it helps to solidify why blacks are more comfortable voting for Democrats, as opposed to Republicans.\n \n Al Franken had an interesting comment in one of his books. He talked about a black Republican organization, whose \"chairpeople\" were PREDOMINANTLY WHITE. And he asked one of the blacks who was on the committee about the presence, and the guy DID NOT EVEN REALIZE he had been named to that committee... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n And to put this all in perspective, a LOT of what I posted above (IMO) isn't really addressing an assessment of \"a lot of Republicans are racist\".\n A LOT of what I posted above is a simple answer to the question of why Republicans are seen as being more racist, and not as much for the Democrats...\n (Although there are a variety of examples above that do address the issue of \"some Republicans being racist\")",

Isn't the definition of racism basically judging someone by their color?

Now, you've got to admit that some of that 14% have legit reasons for disliking him.\n\n First of all, I think we need to get some perspective on scope...\n I am not saying all, or even most of the RNC are racist.\n I actually think it's a small minority.\n \n During the last election there were a variety of polls. One asked if there was a generally qualified person with characteristic ____ who was nominated from your party, would you vote for them.\n ____ filled in with gay, black, woman, atheist, etc.\n \n I believe it was only 10% (depends on how accurate my memory is) said they would not vote for their own party's nominated, generally qualified person with the ONLY detracting feature being \"black\". I think this is a decent starting point for \"racist\".\n That's nowhere near all or most Americans.\n \n Now if we were to assume that all that 10% were filling just one party (a statement I do NOT agree with), and that party was roughly half of the country, that would make that party's percentage of \"racist\" as 20%.\n \n And I throw this figure out there as an upper bound, although obviously still ridiculously high for one party (not rational to assume all the racists are in one party).\n \n Now. With that said...\n My comment was essentially to address YOU trying to give praise to the Republican party for putting Steele as RNC chair.\n I think giving the Republican party credit for that is absurd because MOST REPUBLICANS DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING about Steele.\n That was the point of that statistic.\n \n Too many care more about which pundit they listen to than who is the RNC chair...\n \n \n \nNow, you've got to admit that some of that 14% have legit reasons for disliking him.\n\n Slightly off-topic, but relevant to your comment...\n I think the Republican party is in the stage of eating their own, and the people who are unphased by this trend are the people who WERE NOT ELECTED to their position and answer essentially to nobody. People who don't have to give solutions.\n Like Limbaugh and Beck.\n \n Just look what they did to Jindall. Jindall did decent for what he had to work with (which isn't much, but not his fault), and people like Coulter eat him up with mindless \"slum dog millionaire\" comments... emoticon_ic\n Look at Steele having to apologize to Limbaugh, when Steele's comment on Limbaugh being an entertainer was 100% accurate...\n \n So while some may have some reason they think is significant for disliking him, I don't think that's as important as most people just don't care about the man, or his position.\n \n Racism isn't always about \"I hate black people\". In fact, I believe it is RARELY about that.\n Most of the time it is believing that blacks should not be in a certain position because they are black.\n A racist white man will probably not care about a black mayor in a city he doesn't care about.\n And right now, I don't think enough people care about the RNC chair position to care about whether or not he is black or white.\n \n Here's a real question for you...\n Based on real votes, by real tax-payers.\n How many black Republican congress people are there?\n How many black Democrat congress people are there?\n African Americans in the United States Congress - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n For the House of Representatives, during the \"modern era\" which starts as early as 1929, there are a measly THREE black Republican House of Representatives.\n The list of black DEMOCRAT Reps is very long...\n \n Now, these are people that are ELECTED by the people.\n Not \"selected\" by a committee ...\n \n \n \nWow? Yeah wow! What a way to denigrate the first Black Chairman of a national party. Shesh.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n No.\n I use the word \"token\" to reference the reason WHY HE WAS SELECTED.\n Not to his credentials for the job...\n \n When most Republicans don't know enough about him to even form an opinion, does that sound like somebody who is in office because the voters want him there?\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nAnd I could give a ton of racist examples of PEOPLE in the Dem. party.\n\n And I have no doubt you could.\n Like I said at the start of my post, I was accomplishing a couple things...\n 1) To point out why some people PERCEIVE racism in the Republican party...\n \n 2) To point out why some people perceive MORE racism in the Republican party...\n \n The first point concentrating on perception.\n The second point concentrating on an actual justification of that perception...\n \n \n \nIs the Dem party inherently racist? No (now its history...).\n\n I've already addressed this.\n The actual issue of importance is the Northern / Southern divide.\n \n Some people argue that blacks are more violent and commit more crime.\n But in polls that examine race AND INCOME, it is shown that the crime is actually more closely related to LOWER INCOME with a black low income person having a similar criminal statistics as white low income person.\n And when blacks have higher income, they have similar criminal statistics as the corresponding white higher income.\n \n Unless you're reaching WAYYYYY back to Republican Lincoln, in which I think it's rather obvious that this is NOT Lincoln's party anymore...\n \n \n \nYou can give racist examples of PEOPLE in the Pub party (but its history???).\n\n Look at the 1964 civil rights vote.\n Dividing by area, republicans had a HIGHER PERCENTAGE of voting against the 1964 civil rights bill than Democrats.\n Comparing South with South, and North with North.\n \n It all depends on how far back you want to go. Both parties are continually evolving.\n \n \n \nWith any organization with that many people there are, UNDOUBTEDLY going to be some racists. But to say the PARTY is dirty? No way.\n\n My stance is that the percentage of racists in Republicans is higher than percentage of racists in Democrats.\n I think I proved that with the one poll I linked to, showing Repubs had about a 10 point increase in negative association for blacks...\n \n Now, with that said, I am ultimately talking about an issue of \"more\".\n As to saying \"the PARTY is dirty\"? I wouldn't make that claim. It's too generic, and doesn't give enough credit to the vast majority of the party who aren't...\n \n \n \nExcept, I'll give you one. Its not really 'race' but the Pubs stance on gay marriage is wrong. If there's one glaring fission in the Party its between the Religious Right and those (like me) of the Libertarian bent. I try to convince my fellow conservatives to leave the gay stuff alone but I'm not always very successful...\n\n The day is coming.\n The cracks are showing, although the people STRESSING the issue in the RNC just aren't there yet. I would agree that it's a \"fissure\", but it's not \"glaring\" by its own light.\n There are multiple polls showing that within JUST the Republican voter base, they APPROVE of allowing gays in the military, gay civil unions, ENDA, and gay hate crimes. But the Republican voter base is not holding their politicians responsible for reflecting their majority position on the gay issue.\n \n Politicians (on both sides) often do not follow the wishes of their ACTUAL base, but cater to lobbyist groups (including social issue lobby groups).\n In the preps for last election, EVERY RNC presidential candidate made it plain that they WOULD NOT want to end the ban on gays in the military. (At least while we are \"at war\", and bin Laden isn't going to surrender, so where does that leave us...)\n \n Other issues abound. Republicans stuck to calling Sotomayor \"racist\" and largely voting \"no\" on her Court seat. I don't think that will go unnoticed. Especially in a country with a rising Hispanic population.\n I heard one pundit mention McCain's Arizona seat as possibly having some future fall-out for his vote...\n I'll be curious how that turns out...\n \n The two sides are kind of funny in their issues.\n The Republicans often want government out of financial issues, but to get involved in social issues.\n The Democrats often want government IN financial issues, but to stay out of social issues.\n \n \n \ngotta run... I'll get to the rest later...ow. And there's the assumption it\n\n C you later... emoticon_xgood",
