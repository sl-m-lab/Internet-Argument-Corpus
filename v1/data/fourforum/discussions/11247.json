   "If you're American, before you go making illogical accusations that blame everything on Israel, remember that they're our only ally in the Middle East.\n\n How has the US alliance with Israel ever benefitted the US? It seems that our alliance with Israel is far more of a liability in the Middle East than it is an asset since, besides the Iraq war, it has been fueling a lot of the anti-American anger for decades now - anger that helps fuel terrorism.\n \n I have always gotten the impression that the main reasons our politicians continue this largely one-sided alliance with Israel is:\n \n 1) Continued Western guilt about having taken insufficient action regarding the Holocaust. This also allows Israelis and their supporters to call any criticism of Israel (whether justified or not) as anti-Semitic - thus cutting off any discussion. \n \n 2) The pro-Israeli political structure in the US is very well organized in their approach to the media and in other politically influential directions - far better organized than any Arab organization. This allows for better mass action in voting against candidates, pooling or restricting campaign contributions, etc. Such organization translates into power disproportionate to their actual numbers.\n \n 3) The Evangelicals have put it into their heads that Israel needs to fully return before the second coming of Christ can arise, so they put some of their political muscle into the mix to support pro-Israeli policies.\n \n That, anyway, is my take. If you disagree, then what would you say is the main reason that the US is allied with Israel - what specifically does the US gain from such an alliance? What has Israel done for the US to warrant such support?",
