   "Ah yes, Bush can never be to blame. He is a god, and therefore is never wrong. Ever. All praise the great leader Bush, for in his infinite wisdom he has decreed that our sons and daughters be sacrificed upon the mantle of unnecesary war. Who are we to question his intelligence? We are nothing but the dirt upon which his blessed feet trample. No, it is not Bush we should be blaming, but instead, those dirt, murderous and depraved liberals! How dare they speak of world peace.\n \n \n emoticon_rolleyes",
