The first half of this is looking possible at the moment. It's really difficult to tell this time around though. Many people are fairly happy with Labour's overall performance in the last four years but remain angry at the way we were taken into the Iraq war despite huge public protest.\n \n Regardless of who wins, I can't see our position on Iraq changing. Our troops are there to put right the mess they created with the invasion. We are used to our troops being stationed abroad for long periods of time, so there is no great call for them to be brought home. Our position with Bush has changed already as can be seen by Britain siding with France and Germany over Iran rather than with the USA for example.",
