   "Disregarding Laws We Oppose\n An Open Letter to the San Francisco Civil Authority\n by David Codrea\n \n \n \n February 16, 2004 \n Dear Mayor Newsom (gavin.newsom@sfgov.org), Judge Warren (wsuperiorct@sftc.org) and Acting Chief Fong (sfpdpbaf@pacbell.net),\n \n Mayor, I see you are authorizing city employees to perform homosexual marriages, Judge Warren, you are allowing them to proceed, and Chief Fong, you are allowing California law, as enacted by a vote of the people, to be publicly and repeatedly broken without making any arrests. \n \n I'm not commenting on that issue, per se, so much as observing that you are all three instigating and abetting the violation of that law. \n \n Judge Warren, you went so far as to state that you couldn't issue a restraining order to halt the marriages because, as Reuters reported, \"there was not enough evidence presented showing that immediate damage would be done by allowing them.\" \n \n Which leaves me with an interesting dilemma. \n \n You see, I also belong to a group that is forced by social prejudices to keep a low profile-often times to hide my choices and practices lest I suffer disapproval and ultimately, life-threatening persecution by the state. \n \n I am a gun owner and I live a gun owner life style. \n \n I don't know if I was born with a tendency to be this way, or if it was an acquired disposition. All I know is, I don't see why I should be forced to change. Truth be known, I like owning guns, and am happy with who I am. I hope I suffer no repercussions by \"coming out of the safe,\" but I just can't hide the truth any longer. \n \n We gun owners have been living and working among you. Our kids go to school with yours. We may be your doctor, or minister, or your child's teacher. We may even work in city administration, or the courts, or on the police force. And we are sick of being abused for simply being who we are, all because of hoplophobic* prejudice and fear. We don't see any reason why we should have to put up with it any more. \n \n Which brings me back to my dilemma and the reason I am writing you. \n \n You have shown progressive thinking and tolerance for that which the majority condemns. So I was thinking of coming up to San Francisco and exercising my right to keep and bear arms, maybe showing up at City Hall with a state-banned AR-15 and a couple 30-round magazines, and also carrying several pistols concealed without a permit. \n \n Yes, I know, it will be a violation of California laws, but you've shown that you're willing to disregard those when it serves your goals. And because I am a peaceable citizen, I should easily meet Judge Warren's criterion that no immediate damage would be done by allowing this. \n \n So what do you think, if I visit your city and proudly display my lifestyle choices, can I count on your support? As a private citizen, don't I have as much right to disregard laws I find reprehensible as you public officials? Isn't that what equality is supposed to be all about, where no class of citizen enjoys privileges and immunities not extended to all? \n \n How about it? You wouldn't have me arrested, would you? \n \n Please let me know if I have your support. \n \n \n Sincerely,\n David Codrea\n codrea4@adelphia.net\n \n * Credit and gratitude to the peerless Col. Jeff Cooper for coining this term.\n \n \n \n \n \n Comments?",

Allow me to elaborate:\n \n The meaning of the phrase \"well-regulated\" in the 2nd amendment\n From: Brian T. Halonen <halonen@csd.uwm.edu<\n The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n \n 1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n \n 1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n \n 1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n \n 1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n \n 1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n \n 1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n \n The phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, in theory which is why despite supporting the course they are championing I am not sure whether the way of doing this they chose was a good one. Of course if you did this there is nothing stopping them from deciding you are threat to the citizens of San Fransisco (why else would you want a concealed weapon unless you plan on suprising someone rather than using it as a deterrant) and shoot you first, ignoring the rule against murder, which is a far more serious issue than then having double standards over your guns.\n\n \n \n You are so far removed from the issue that this may be hard for you to comprehend. By having CCW legal a criminal is unsure as to whether you are armed or not. It is a deterrent due to fear of the unknown. Our second amendment makes no distinction between concealed and not. And again it is rather bigoted of you to assume that if I were to carry a concealed weapon my only purpose would be for mayhem....",

A view that inteferes wih my constitutional right is an attempt by the lunatic fringe to intefere with my life... Simple.\n\n \n What do you mean \"my ultimate agenda\"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.\n \n This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.\n \n The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore \"well regulate.\" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, \" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia.\" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that \"The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia.\" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.\n \n \nYour anti-freedom agenda. Its so funny how you label anything that has less governance than your comfort of suckling on that entitlement sow and following your fedgov masters is anarchy... I am not asking for anarchy. I am demanding my civil rights as a free born human being.\n\n \n I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?\n \n \nAgain???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as \"saturday night special\" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?\n\n \n First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned \"saturday night special.\" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?",

Shall I explain it to an american who can think and therefore understand what I am saying so he can explain it to you? How do bills of rights get written up saw for the US constituaiton, UN human rights and propsed EU consititution if only people with the rights in the first place can understand the rights and therefore can decide that they ought to be rights?\n \n \n \n \n\n Now you are telling people how to respond. Criminals are not affected by gun control laws because criminals will not obey gun control laws. \n \n\n I am pleading with you to actually post something other than spam. Others who are pro-gun can do it, why can't you?\n \n \n\n The question asked about the gun deaths in the UK was just who committed the murders? If you are going to use the UK's low gun death rate as an example, please explain why a country with a gun ban has gun deaths. Who committed these gun deaths? Criminals that do not obey gun control laws or law abiding citizens that do obey gun control laws?. \n\n CRIMINALS WHO HAVE BROKEN BOTH GUN LAWS AND MURDER LAWS, not just 'criminals', we have plenty of people in jail for things other than murder by gun. They didn't shoot someone because they were criminals, they because criminals because they shot someone, Your point boils down to 'Laws do not work because people disobey them-we should have no laws'.",

   "The above quote is just ignorance. Please provide any evidence you have that a criminal has a right to do this.\n \n The only people affected by laws against rape are criminals. The people affected by the laws such as robbery, rape, murder, and vehicular manslaughter, are criminals. These laws do not infringe on a right.\n \n Criminals will not obey control laws. Criminals will not be affected by gun control laws.\n\n \n The original article said that gun laws discriminated against gun owners for who they are. I could say that anti-rape laws discriminate against rapists for who they are. But then you go on to say that gun ownership is a right and that raping is not. What objective means are you using to determine this? Obviously, there is not a legal right to rape and there is a legal right in most cases to own a gun in most states. But these are simply LEGAL rights. That simply means that one day some people wrote down a law which outlawed rape while they also wrote down a law which guaranteed gun ownership in most cases. But, as TastyFish has pointed out 47 times, laws can always be changed, so to base the fact that gun ownership is a right simply on the current laws makes no sense. If gun ownership was not guaranteed by law, would it still be a right? Would it still be any more of a right than rape, since it would no longer be a legal right? Let me give you a nice historical example. Holding slaves was once a legal right. Did that make it right? It was not against the law to kill one of your own slaves, so did that make it a right as you define gun ownership as a right? It was not the right thing, even though it was a legal right, and eventually it was changed, just as the legality of gun ownership can change. So to base your argument simply on the current state of laws is pointless.\n \n And by the way, stop excluding TastyFish from the argument simply because he is not American. That makes no sense. Again, I point you to the example of slavery. If there was a debate over slavery during the 18th century, would you exclude someone from a non-slaveholding county who points out the moral evil of slavery? Would you say that that person would not \"understand\" the right of slavery. No, that would make no sense, just as it makes no sense to exclude TastyFish.",

   "140 million gun owners, roughly 250 million guns, military of 2 million. I will take those odds, especially since I believe that the maority of our miliatry would not be too enthusiastic about gunning down their neiborghs. The pro-gunners could take losses of 70-1 and still come out ahead.\n\n \n I would still have to put my money on the military.\n \n \nThe founding fathers of the united states did not do anything as simple as disregard laws they opposed. They rose up against a government that they percieved as tyrannical and defeated it. This is considered not only a right, but a duty of every American.\n\n \n The premise of the original article was that it was wrong and still is wrong for all the gays in San Fransisco to disregard laws they oppose. Perhaps they percieve the laws against gay marriage as tyrannical, so if it really is a \"duty\" of Americans to rise up against tyrannical governments, are they not as justified as the founding fathers? Obviously, the American Revolution was more extreme than gay marriage, but it was still disregarding laws. You can't deny that they disregarded laws which they opposed.\n \n \nThe fact that rights were existing prior to the constitution does not make any difference in the natural rights thoery (which I believe is what some here are trying to debate). The rights laid forth in the Bill of rights are those that have been percived as being natural rights. Just as you have the right to breathe the air simply by your existance, you have the right to free speech simply because you have a mouth to speak with. \n \n It was the belief of the men who authored the constituion that freedom from tyranny was a natural right. They wrote the bill of rights in order to allow Americans the tools to resist tyranny. The RKBA is no different than the right to free speach, or the right to be secure in your person, or the right to a trial. \n \n Slavery was never a pre-existing right. There was never a \"right\" to own slaves, there were laws in place that allowed the ownership of slaves, but that is a whole different matter. I am always a little surprised to see the \"no such thing as natural rights\" debate. Do you not feel that you have the right to live? HAve you really ever done anything to earn this right? Was the right granted you simply because there is a law against murder, or is the right yours simply because you were born? If I was to take you to Antarctica, which does not fall under the sovergenty of any nation, and kill you, would I not be wrong since three would be no law specifically prohibiting me from doing so?\n\n \n I don't feel that I have any right to life. What does that mean anyway? How much life am I entitled to? There are laws in place that are intended to protect me and you from being killed in certain ways. But are these natural right? No, because there is no such thing. How can you objectively say what a natural right is, and from what do you derive these rights? But before you say, \"is it wrong for me to kill you?\" let me explain. It is not morally wrong for you to kill me, because as a non-religious person, I have no morals. But at the same time, I enjoy life and do not want you to kill me. You also probably don't want me to kill you. So let's agree to not attempt to kill each other. You know what, why don't we give this agreement a catchy little title like \"law.\" And while we're at it, we can establish some sort of governing body to enforce this law and other laws. We may have to sacrifice some things, but in the end, these laws will benefit both of us.\n \n So there is no natural right to life, but there are laws that are intended to protect and improve our lives. And at the same time, there is no natural right to bear arms.",

   "Good question, Sorry I missed it, But you completley misunderstand the Free State project. We are 20,000 or more who will move to NH to affect political change in accordance with the laws and the constitution to restore our freedoms guaranteed to us. The \"gay rights\" activists are BREAKING laws in an attempt to ram thier views down peoples mouths... (BTW gay marriage would be a non issue in the free state NH due to my prediction that the marriage would not be governmental business)\n\n \n No, I know it is slightly different, but following the same principle if others had a different interpretation of the constitution and wanted to interpret the law in a different way than the state is headed (though may have not decided totally yet) do you think it would work, or would it create more trouble due by seperating people with contrasting views into two groups thus providing a clear 'enemy' when they start competeting?",
