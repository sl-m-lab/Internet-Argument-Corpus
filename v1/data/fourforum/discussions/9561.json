   "I wonder if people ever stop to think that when the bible was written homosexuality may have been a sin, but we have come to a new understanding of homosexuality that was not available at the time the bible was written. Understanding that the bible may have been inspired by god according to Christian belief, it is still the work of men who had little or none of the understanding we have today of the science of sexuality.\n \n Many of the assertions in the bible have been abandon or reconfigured as we learn more about the world we love in through science. Could it be possible that this is just another assertions that how been discovered by science to not make as much sense as it use to?\n \n It seems to me, and others, that we tend to come up with our assumptions than look and seek backing for them in the bible, what would happen if we reversed the process? WOuld out conclusions be the same? Myabe for some they would but others may realize that they use the bible to back their own assertions rather than using the bible to give them assertions and using life and science to back them and make them real.....\n \n Just a thought....",

They want everyone to agree with their \"enlightened\" opinion.\"\n I wonder...\n Does he really need me to send him \"lots of columns\" from the other side of the fence?\n Does he really expect us to believe that the folks on \"his\" side of the fence don't also \"want everyone to agree with their \"religious\" opinion\"?\n \n 4) \"That just means their moral code doesn't fluctuate based on society's ever-changing standards.\"\n The Biblical moral code espouses misogyny towards women, allows for slavery, condemns touching pig-skin, ...\n \"Doesn't fluctuate\"???\n Has he READ the bible???\n \n 5) \"As long as we're not being violent toward one another, as long as we can be civil, everything should be fine.\"\n I think a requirement of \"can be civil\" involves civil rights.\n Respecting the equality of others.\n Generically speaking, how can anybody who espouses somebody else's rights should be limited and discriminated against be considered \"civil\"?\n \n 6) \"And please don't compare being homosexual to being black. I consider that insulting to blacks for a number of reasons. The fact that some blacks make the comparison themselves only shows how crushed our racial esteem has become because of America's oppression (witness our insistence on calling ourselves the n-word).\"\n Interesting how he makes the request, but doesn't address the REASONS WHY people make the analogy...\n \n 7) \"You can't hide your skin color, choose your skin color, change your skin color or switch your skin color back and forth.

An analogy involves similar issues being compared, but they are NOT IDENTICAL. Here, Chris focuses on an irrelevant difference while ignoring the similarities.\n 3) \"many scientists on both sides\"?\n I always get a chuckle when somebody tries to summarize some issue like that. It helps them ignore the fact that the vast majority have come to realize one conclusion based on the facts, and the other side, with just a few people, has no facts and refuses to admit the reality of the situation.\n \n And quite frankly, Chris's summary on the \"biological evidence for homosexuality\" probably has about as much credibility as Tom Cruise's expertise on psychiatric drug usage...",

   "\"he knows I believe he needs to change his lifestyle.\"\n \"are saying I must change my entire belief system/religion\"\n \n So, it's fine for Broussard to want others to change, but not for others to want Broussard to change? That's a pretty obvious double standard he's promoting there. If he wants to think that homosexuality is wrong and sinful, that's his right. If he wants to go about expounding on those beliefs, he can do that too. And if people want to think he's unenlightened for holding those beliefs, and they want to say so, then they have that right as well. Broussard is outright saying that he has a problem with anyone saying that his views aren't progressive or enlightened, and yet he clearly has no problem with saying that other people are immoral and sinners. I don't know exactly what \"Those folks\" have done, but if it's just talking, if it's just telling him that they think he's wrong, then he has no legitimate grounds for complaint. If you want to put your opinions out into the public sphere, than you have to deal with the fact that people may critisize them.\n \n For example:\n \"That doesn't mean they're unenlightened. That just means their moral code doesn't fluctuate based on society's ever-changing standards.\"\n Enlightenment means to see the light, to come to a new awareness. Clinging to an old moral code tenaciously, despite anything that says you should be reexamining your position, is pretty much the epitome of unenlightenment. Refusal to even consider that you might be wrong, that your beliefs might not be correct, is unenlightened. If your thought process runs something like \"My religion says X\", and then stops, you are unenlightened. So those millions Broussard is talking about? Yeah, it's probably a safe bet that most of them aren't all that enlightened.",

It it used here by you in the same context as in most definitions I've seen of The Age of Enlightenment that occured in the 18th century. The Age of Enlightenment brought about changes. That does not mean that enlightenment always brings about changes...it means that the enlightened person has learned something s/he didn't know before. The word has been around for centuries and was certainly used prior to the 18th.\n \n If you present irrefutable evidence that homosexuality is 100% genetic and does not involve choice, I will change my view.

See teach/learn.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n enlightenment \n n \n Definition: awareness, understanding\n Antonyms: bewilderment, confusion, ignorance, puzzlement\n \n \n \n Enlightenment \n European intellectual movement of the 17th-18th century in which ideas concerning God, reason, nature, and man were blended into a worldview that inspired revolutionary developments in art, philosophy, and politics. Central to Enlightenment thought were the use and celebration of reason. For Enlightenment thinkers, received authority, whether in science or religion, was to be subject to the investigation of unfettered minds. In the sciences and mathematics, the logics of induction and deduction made possible the creation of a sweeping new cosmology. The search for a rational religion led to Deism; the more radical products of the application of reason to religion were skepticism, atheism, and materialism. The Enlightenment produced modern secularized theories of psychology and ethics by men such as John Locke and Thomas Hobbes, and it also gave rise to radical political theories. Locke, Jeremy Bentham, J.-J. Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Thomas Jefferson all contributed to an evolving critique of the authoritarian state and to sketching the outline of a higher form of social organization based on natural rights. One of the Enlightenment's enduring legacies is the belief that human history is a record of general progress.\n \n The noun Enlightenment has one meaning:\n Meaning #1: a movement in the 18th century that advocated the use of reason in the reappraisal of accepted ideas and social institutions\n Synonym: Age of Reason\n \n \n \n \n enlightenment \n \n IN BRIEF: The state of seeing or understanding clearly.\n \n Knowing other is wisdom, knowing yourself is enlightenment. - Lao Tzu (c.604-531 B.C.).\n \n \n \n Enlightenment \n Quotes: \n \n No one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily. - Andre Breton\n \n If I could define enlightenment briefly I would say it is the quiet acceptance of what is. - Wayne Dyer\n \n I don't know Who -- or what -- put the question, I don't know when it was put. I don't even remember answering. But at some moment I did answer Yes to Someone --or Something --and from that hour I was certain that existence is meaningful and that, therefore, my life, in self-surrender, had a goal. - Dag Hammarskjold\n \n In this world, which is so plainly the antechamber of another, there are no happy men. The true division of humanity is between those who live in light and those who live in darkness. Our aim must be to diminish the number of the latter and increase the number of the former. That is why we demand education and knowledge. - Victor Hugo\n \n The real meaning of enlightenment is to gaze with undimmed eyes on all darkness. - Nikos Kazantzakis\n \n The moment of truth, the sudden emergence of a new insight, is an act of intuition. Such intuitions give the appearance of miraculous flushes, or short-circuits of reasoning. In fact they may be likened to an immersed chain, of which only the beginning and the end are visible above the surface of consciousness. The diver vanishes at one end of the chain and comes up at the other end, guided by invisible links. - Arthur Koestler\n \n Enlightenment must come little by little-otherwise it would overwhelm. - Idries Shah\n \n \n \n \n In the Western philosophical tradition, enlightenment is seen as a phase in cultural history marked by a faith in reason, generally accompanied by rejection of faith in revealed or institutional religion.",

There is also considerable recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality.

Monozygotic (MZ) twins show greater concordance for homosexuality than dizygotic (DZ) twins. Early Scandinavian studies reported rather questionable levels of concordance (around 100% in Kallmann, 1952). Using more sophisticated methods and larger samples in the USA, the concordance rate was 52% among MZ male twins, 48% among MZ female twins, compared with 22% among DZ male twins and 16% among DZ female twins ( Bailey and Pillard, 1991 and Bailey et al., 1993). Higher rates of concordance were reported by Whitam, Diamond, and Martin (1993); 65% for MZ males and 29% for DZ males. Taken together, these studies suggest that around 50-60% of the variance in sexual orientation is genetic. However, they suffer the methodological problem of ascertainment bias; subjects were recruited primarily through homophile organisations and word of mouth. Recently, two methodologically rigorous studies; Bailey, Dunne, and Martin (2000) reporting on a large representative sample of Australian twins, and Kendler, Thornton, Gilman, and Kessler (2000) reporting on a US national probability sample, found only 30% concordance among MZ twins for non-heterosexual orientation (much lower than in previous work). In a separate analysis of the Australian data, Kirk, Bailey, Dunne, and Martin (2000) actually estimated a higher heritability for female (0.58) than male (0.26) homosexuality. \n \n\n \n Mas:\n \n  here ",

Is it so just because you say so?\n \n On the third, I see nothing that connects with the argument. The \"closet\" may be built of shame.\n \n On the fourth, the testimony of gay people is not evidence. While all may say that they can't remember having a choice in the matter, it could still be that genetics had no part in their decision to identify as gay.\n \n On the last, a considerable of peer-reviewed scientific research has only been claimed here...it has not been presented.

And speaking of dung, what did the comment about hippo doo mean?\nIt has no derogatory connection to this conversation and is not a reflection of what I think of you. It simply means that I learned of the tremendous dependence upon hippo dung while watching a well researched NOVA program. Were it not for hippos pooping in the river, there would be no organisms eating that poop, no little fishes eating those organisms, no medium fishes eating the little fishes, no big fishes eating the medium fishes, no fish-eating birds eating fishes along the river. Life along the river would be drastically different...if it weren't for hippo dung. So...hippo dung is a good thing to have around. It just wouldn't work as well if they pooped on the land.\n \n Now you show me a NOVA special on genetic homosexuality and I'll change my view on the matter.",

Further interpretation of the results of this study must be considered speculative. In particular, the results do not allow one to decide if the size of INAH 3 in an individual is the cause or consequence of that individual's sexual orientation, or if the size of INAH 3 and sexual orientation covary under the influence of some third, unidentified variable.\" S. LeVay, \"A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men\" 253 Science 1034, 1036 (1991) \n He later added, \n \n \n \"It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain. ... Since I look at adult brains, we don't know if the differences I found were there at birth or if they appeared later.\" \n",

They truly see themselves as reasonable guys! Whatever.\n \n What is amazing in these debates is what posters consider evidence. It really is as simple as being able to write a term paper, but perhaps that basic, if rigorous, scholarly skill escapes them. Prior to the availability of the enormous amount of data at our fingertips that is the Internet, people had to use libraries, where it was the librarians' charge to screen out unreliable sources that purport to be objective. With the Net, we hear folks say, \"Show me a link to back that up.\" With great search engines, you can literally find \"a link\" that states ANYTHING. What makes it worse is the anti-science bias. While Jim's source very loudly proclaimed its anti-gay position, and Jim thought it was OK that is was not \"gay-friendly,\" the implication being that scientific papers are inherently pro-gay, liberal and atheistic. The reality is that kind of politics (there are clearly academic and publishing politics, but they tend to balance out in the wash) is simply not a concern in scientific publications. The only reason science gets involved in politics is when is it attacked. This anti-intellectualism and opposition to real science, posing as an ostensible confrontation of political correctness, is what really saddens and scares me.",

Not true.\n In fact, I think you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY the analogy exists in the first place, and the grounds by which the analogy is made.\n \n If you LOOK at the arguments used in favor of black discrimination, and compare the arguments used in favor of gay discrimination, there is an AMAZING degree of overlap.\n \n \n \nPlease read above text one more time.\nHere, you claim \"objects without similar characteristics\", and then you COMPLETELY IGNORE THE SIMILARITY we are talking about in order to focus on a dissimilarity you want to talk about.\n By that technique, NO analogy would be valid. You could invalidate ANY analogy if all you had to do was point to a difference between the two. \nNo. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.\n\n No. I have understood only PERFECTLY CLEAR what you have said.\n All you have done, in essence, is add \"100%\" to my statement. That's it.\n By the same ideology, ANY analogy between fish and birds could be invalidated because fish have gills. Birds have lungs. Fish have scales. Birds have feathers.\n Ergo, by your complete lack of comprehension and appreciation for what an ANALOGY is in the first place, you declare the analogy invalid.\n If somebody were to compare the migratory habits of birds and fish, ignoring the similarities, you would pipe up and say that it couldn't be done. No analogy could be used.

   "OK, THIS is my last post.\nI bet!\n \n \n\n I have already posted my opposing viewpoint, with real scientific evidence to support it. You clearly do not understand the difference. \nThe difference is that your opposing viewpoint is a validly held opinion (as is mine) and your \"scientific evidence\" is invalid.\n \n \n \nIf you truly believe that the NARTH website is a legitimate source of knowledge and in any way comparable to the kind of references I have provided, you and I have nothing to discuss.\nOf course it's a legitimate source of knowledge. Your problem is that it debunks your claimed \"evidence\".\n \n \n \n Our views of reality are too disparate.\nQuite so! Reality remains the same though, regardless of our views of it. You have proved nothing except your own tenacity in holding on to a flawed analogy and a misguided conclusion drawn upon data that not only the author but others have shown to NOT support your argument concerning genetically driven homosexuality.\n \n \n \n\n I shouldn't have said that information is dishonest and idiotic. That is an insult to liars and XXXXXX.\nLet's not be melodramatic.\n \n ********************************************************\n \n \nYeah, don't feel to bad about stopping your debate with jimstrucking. I know from experience how frustrating and tiring it is to debate an opponent that constantly shifts goalposts with an almost religious fervor and beleives things like NARTH is a legitimate source for information. As I already intimated, you could riverdance naked in front of him while showing him the information, and he'd still not accept it or even admit that it has been given to him. I, too, recuse myself from this pointless debate with jims. To quote MrWriteLA:\nThank you for backing out. I asked you to do just that a few posts back. You tend to do nothing save parrot the sensible posters here rather than come up with challenging points anyway. Go grow a beard and come back swinging.\n \n *******************************************************\n \n \nI don't feel bad about stopping that interaction, it really isn't debate.\n Somehow, I knew you'd post again.\n \n \n \n\n Folks like him and jyoshu just aren't willing to admit they simply don't like homos.\nI do not recall either of us saying we don't like \"homos\" (as you have chosen to call yourself).\n \n \n \n I am sure they don't have gay friends or interact with anyone gay in any real, human way. \nHow did you come to be sure that I have no gay friends? Search the forums and you will find several instances where I have revealed friendships with gays and lesbians. I repeat for you just one more time...my best friend is a lesbian.\n \n \nBut, they do not want to see themselves as redneck ###-bashers - apparently they consider that uncool - so they try to intellectualize their indefensible positions.\nI am not into gay-bashing. I'd have to bash several friends if I were. What I am into is dispelling the ill-contrived opinion of many gays that there's some need to redefine marriage in order to guarantee equal rights for gay couples. This is simply NOT true. In arguing the position, you precipitate response based upon what you claim to be true. You claim an invalid analogy using blacks in the place of gays and I will point it out. You claim there is no choice in the matter, I will point to sources (whether you like them or not) that explain in no uncertain terms that that was never a logical conclusion to be drawn from the twin-studies or any other study made to date. There is no gay gene.\n \n \n \n They fabricate these convoluted arguments, which get all the more mercurial as each point is effectively confronted, to justify pre-existing positions, so they can try to convince themselves they are not knuckle-draggers.\nI have fabricated nothing. As for getting mercurial, it is your side that brings up the hurdles (ie the bad analogy and the claim of genetic predisposition) that must be addressed in turn. Once we have settled the issues on these points, we can continue. Apparently I will have to come up with a more clear explanation of why the analogy doesn't fly. I don't see an impasse in the analogy issue. All I have to do is come up with an expanation you can undertstand. The genetics things is a bit more complicated. I contend (along with NARTH and at least one of the authors you cited) that a gay gene has not been found...yet you claim it exists. I have provided proof that it has not been found yet you blindly and without backup claim it has...so I think maybe we have reached an impasse here.\n \n \n They truly see themselves as reasonable guys! Whatever.\nMy ability to reason based on precise logic has not diminished.\n \n \n \n\n What is amazing in these debates is what posters consider evidence. It really is as simple as being able to write a term paper, but perhaps that basic, if rigorous, scholarly skill escapes them. Prior to the availability of the enormous amount of data at our fingertips that is the Internet, people had to use libraries, where it was the librarians' charge to screen out unreliable sources that purport to be objective. With the Net, we hear folks say, \"Show me a link to back that up.\" With great search engines, you can literally find \"a link\" that states ANYTHING. What makes it worse is the anti-science bias. While Jim's source very loudly proclaimed its anti-gay position, and Jim thought it was OK that is was not \"gay-friendly,\" the implication being that scientific papers are inherently pro-gay, liberal and atheistic. The reality is that kind of politics (there are clearly academic and publishing politics, but they tend to balance out in the wash) is simply not a concern in scientific publications. The only reason science gets involved in politics is when is it attacked. This anti-intellectualism and opposition to real science, posing as an ostensible confrontation of political correctness, is what really saddens and scares me.\nYour idea that my argument is anti-intellectual or opposes real science is just as ridiculous as your apparent assertion that scientific studies should be affected by political correctness. That doesn't sadden or scare me ... it puzzles me.\n \n ...and NARTH is not anti-gay...they're just trying to promote the truth and clear the air regarding some false claims.\n \n ******************************************************\n \n \n..... Frankly, it sounds like you're just having a bad day here.\nYou got it!\n \n ******************************************************\n \n \n... Just here, admitting you have no gay friends - that seems inconceivable to me. How can that possibly be? ....\nYou say in post #47 \"I am sure they don't have any gay friends or interact...\"...yet you say here that it is inconcievable that he has no gay friends. You are sure of something that is inconcievable? How does that work? LIke the analogy...it doesn't.\n \n *****************************************************\n \n \nFALSE!\n The \"dissimilar characteristic\" you are trying to state here is NOT THE ISSUE regarding the connectability in the analogy.\nIt is the only issue that invalidates its legitimate use in your argument. When you try to use the analogy in this thread, you are assuming the genetic cause of homosexuality exists as strongly as it does in the determination of skin color. This has not been proven. Do not claim something as evidence of your claim when the 'evidence' has not been proven.\n \n \n\n Show me ANY PERSON who has promulgated a gay equality argument with an analogy that blacks and gays are similar in genetic aspects.\n ANYBODY...\n That's what has been happening here. You claim the analogy supports your cause...I say the analogy is invalid because skin color is 100% determined by genetics ( a proven fact )...homosexuality has not been proven to be 100% genetically imposed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You know, it's funny that you make this claim, and then you link to a web-site that is titled \"peoplecanchange\".\n Would you mind explaining why you linked to that web-site if my argument \"is unrelated to genetics\"?\nI was referring to your immediately preceding statement...which I quoted. Read your quote that precedes my statement. The fact ex-gays may be just suppressing their desires, never changing to \"heterosexual\" at all is UNRELATED to genetics. I can suppress a bad habit, still want to partake of it and this means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING regarding whether the habit was inherited or chosen. You are pushing the \"my genes made me do it\" routine and I am pushing the \"most people can change\" routine. Life is great!\n \n \n \n\n ... ...\n \n \n \n I gave a reason why I saw it as irrelevant.\n EVEN IF being black were a choice, it would STILL be an invalid grounds for discrimination.\n Do you disagree?\nThere is no ground for discrimination against a law-abiding citizen.\n \n \n \n\n ... .\n \n On the flip side, you say \"you have no idea why\" but then COMPLETELY FAIL to explain any reason why black being a choice would be important here.\n \n You seem to be under the delusion that the black / gay comparison survives because being black is not a choice. Not true.\n In fact, I think you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY the analogy exists in the first place, and the grounds by which the analogy is made.\nOh, I completely understand why it was attempted.\n \n \n\n If you LOOK at the arguments used in favor of black discrimination, and compare the arguments used in favor of gay discrimination, there is an AMAZING degree of overlap.\nThey've both been mistreated. This does not validate the analogy used in this thread.\n \n \n \nHere, you claim \"objects without similar characteristics\", and then you COMPLETELY IGNORE THE SIMILARITY we are talking about in order to focus on a dissimilarity you want to talk about.\n By that technique, NO analogy would be valid. You could invalidate ANY analogy if all you had to do was point to a difference between the two. \n No. I have understood only PERFECTLY CLEAR what you have said.\n All you have done, in essence, is add \"100%\" to my statement. That's it.\n By the same ideology, ANY analogy between fish and birds could be invalidated because fish have gills. Birds have lungs. Fish have scales. Birds have feathers.\n Ergo, by your complete lack of comprehension and appreciation for what an ANALOGY is in the first place, you declare the analogy invalid.\n If somebody were to compare the migratory habits of birds and fish, ignoring the similarities, you would pipe up and say that it couldn't be done. No analogy could be used. Based on differences IRRELEVANT to the analogy.\nIf the differences are indeed irrelevant to the analogy, they do NOT invalidate it. However, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding the laying of eggs is invalid except for the four or so species of snakes that do lay eggs (as does the coral snake) because all birds lay eggs, most snakes don't. Likewise, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding how they care for their young is invalid because of all the snakes...none of them nuture their young. An analogy between snakes and birds regarding variations in color IS valid because both exhibit a wide range of colorations. You have to consider the attributes of both entities when applying an analogy. The particular attribute in question for the analogy your side uses to support its argument is based on genetic determination. Skin color is a genetic thing...homosexuality has not been proven to be so. If and when it has, you are perfectly correct to use that analogy.\n \n \n \n\n Surely I expected you to have a clue before you piped up...\n Since it has been abundantly clear that you don't even comprehend the point of comparison of the black / gay analogy in the first place, I apologize for my mistake and will correct for your lack of comprehension in the future...\nTell you what...we'll drop that issue until I can come up with a clearly understandable outline for its invalidness.\n \n \n \n\n That is mind-numbingly simplistic, and without scientific basis.\n If you wanted to go that route, the amount of INDEPENDENT research on change would prove our \"genetic\" case.\nI've already stated that those numbers are arbitrary guess on my part. It could be 20-80, 30-70, 40-60, 50-50 or something else. At this time, there is NO REASON to believe it is 100-0.\n \n \n\n And on another note, just a few sentences ago, weren't you claiming that the capability to change was irrelevant to genetics??? :xbanghead \nNo! I claimed it was UNRELATED to genetics.\n \n \n \n\n I can prove that the sun is not black by showing a picture of it where it is yellow.\n Likewise, if you can show ANY evidence from people showing how it is something other than genetic, that would be a start.\n \n I'll take it by your demure that you want to avoid that...\nProving that something does not exist is quite different from proving that something that does exist is not a certain color. That analogy ^^^^ won't work either. There is some evidence that it is not genetic in the links I posted.\n \n \nI challenge you to show ANY scientific research which even hints that homosexuality is a choice.\nThe links I posted suggest that it is a combination of things...just as I thought\n \n \n\n You have the gall to challenge the \"genetic\" aspect, and then toss out this lame attempt to back-door the idea that it's \"choice\"?\nNowhere have I claimed it to be totally free of genetic influence. Neither have I claimed that it is all choice.",

I explained why.\n You insist it would be important, yet upon being questioned you are incapable of explaining why....\n \n All you are doing is saying over and over that genetics is important to the analogy, saying it is your opinion that black being genetic and homosexuality's genetics being in dispute invalidates the analogy, while being thoroughly incapable of explaining why...\n \n \n \nI was referring to your immediately preceding statement...which I quoted.

Not a matter of opinion, but if you claim that Jane did something because of X, and she didn't do it because of X, then your claim is false.\n \n \n \nThey've both been mistreated. This does not validate the analogy used in this thread.\n\n Do you even comprehend what the definition of ANALOGY is in the first place?\n \n analogy:\n a : resemblance in some particulars between things otherwise unlike : SIMILARITY b : comparison based on such resemblance\n \n An analogy is BUILT off of a similarity. Like in this case, being \"mistreated\" is part of the analogy.\n \n Whether or not an analogy is a good one is often based on the strength of the similarities, which you HAVE NOT EVEN BROACHED, or significant differences between the two WHICH RELATED TO THE ISSUE OF SIMILARITY.\n \n Suppose I make an analogy with John killing a rabbit, and Jim killing his wife.\n The motive for John killing the rabbit for food, and Jim killing his wife for the life insurance money, would be relevant to the point of the analogy.\n The fact that John chose to be a republican, and Jim didn't choose to be black, would be irrelevant to the analogy. The comment is unrelated to the similarity basis of the analogy.\n \n \n \nIf the differences are indeed irrelevant to the analogy, they do NOT invalidate it.\n\n Then maybe you can explain WHY genetics is relevant to the BASIS OF THE ANALOGY made regarding blacks / gays.\n \n \n \nHowever, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding the laying of eggs is invalid except for the four or so species of snakes that do lay eggs (as does the coral snake) because all birds lay eggs, most snakes don't.

Would it make sense to turn around and say say the analogy is invalid because of your comment regarding \"caring for the young\"???\n NO!\n \n Likewise, here we are making an analogy based on ONE issue, and you turn around and focus on a SEPARATE issue to declare the analogy invalid.\n \n \n \nThe particular attribute in question for the analogy your side uses to support its argument is based on genetic determination.\n\n WRONG!!!\n You're doing it again!\n \n YOU are saying that genetics is important to our analogy.\n NOT us. We are not saying that.\n So STOP CLAIMING that we are saying genetics is important to our analogy.\n \n \n \nTell you what...we'll drop that issue until I can come up with a clearly understandable outline for its invalidness.\n\n Before you attempt that, maybe you should start by familiarizing yourself with what we are saying in the first place.\n Because you keep on attempting to use oranges to explain why the apple is invalid, and then claiming that we are insisting that the oranges are necessary...\n \n \n \nI've already stated that those numbers are arbitrary guess on my part. It could be 20-80, 30-70, 40-60, 50-50 or something else. At this time, there is NO REASON to believe it is 100-0.\n\n Regarding those \"numbers\", you have provided NO validity for the second number at all, assuming you're still claiming \"choice\" like you did in the earlier example.\n It's like claiming that the human body is made up of water and sunshine, and that since we don't know what percentage of water makes up the body then we can't be certain on how much sunshine is in the body.\n \n Homosexuality has NO component of \"choice\".\n You have yet to provide ANY evidence showing \"choice\" is ever involved.\n \n \n \nNo! I claimed it was UNRELATED to genetics.\n\n There is a pointless debating tactic whereby people change on word to a similar word, which has ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT on my argument.\n If you change my phrasing from \"irrelevant\" to \"unrelated\" (which is such a huge change, isn't it... emoticon_xdonno ), my argument still remains.\n \n \n \nProving that something does not exist is quite different from proving that something that does exist is not a certain color.

Neither have I claimed that it is all choice.\n\n :xbanghead \n You should stop saying that ANY part of it is \"choice\" until you provide proof of that claim.\n Choice is not a factor when it comes to being gay.

   "...To my knowledge, there are no gay therapists whose career mission is to turn heterosexual men and women into homosexual men and women.\n \n On the other hand, there certainly are Christian therapists whose mission it is to turn homosexual men and women into heterosexual men and women. They call themselves therapists, at any rate. Beneath the hair gel-soaked facade of the Christian Right, it's a little hard to sort out exactly how meaningful some of those credentials are, isn't it? These days, anyone with a mail box and a few dollars to spend can call themselves \"Doctor.\"\n \n But they certainly have fancy names for what they do. \"Reparative Therapy\" is one, as though homosexuality can be fixed like a malfunctioning Maytag or mended like a sock. And there's \"Conversion Therapy,\" implying that with the right sales pitch, gays can be talked out of being gay, like switching them over from State Farm to Geico.\n \n The foundation of all this--\"Transformational Ministries,\" they call it--is the conservative Christians' insistence that homosexuality is a choice, not a condition--that gays don't have to be gays--that they pick their orientation like other people pick suburban living over life in the big city. The more liberal of the conservative Christians might concede that some gays become gays because of glitches in the way they were raised, but that's as far as they go. Never would they accept the growing body of evidence that indicates homosexuality is innate--that some people are born gay, just as other people are born blond or left-handed. Oh no, that would be too close to saying God made 'em that way.\n \n \u0095\n \n But what would be the harm in acknowledging that God made 'em that way--that homosexuality is inherent? Why can't conservative Christians just admit that, after centuries of persecution and decades of this pseudo-psycho-mumbo-jumbo, they haven't put a dent in the homosexual population? (In fact, what little unbiased research there is on conversion therapies indicates a failure rate in the high 90th percentile, and even the most biased claims concede they can never entirely eliminate homosexual desire from even those gays most desperate to change.)\n \n So why don't they just give it up and quit trying to fiddle with the nature of gays? And why did they make such a public spectacle of turning Ted Haggard around? Repairing him. Conversionating him. Whatever.\n \n Ah, but they had to show they could \"fix\" such a man as Haggard, don't you see? Or pretend to fix him. That's what these \"Transformational Ministries\" have been lacking--a poster boy. A Jared, to show you really can shed those homosexual pounds. If they could demonstrate to the world that their de-gayifying process worked on this one fallen Sodomite, then it could work on any Sodomite. And I have little doubt Haggard went along with the show willingly. After all, what's a man like him going to do for a living if he can't continue to preach against sins of the flesh?\n \n Point is, the conservative Christian leadership has invested too heavily in the \"sin\" of homosexuality to throw up their hands and concede you can't fight Mother Nature. The issue seems to have become a central focus of those conservative churches that rely on fear and loathing as a central tenet of their faith, and to admit they can't change sexual orientation would demand an entire re-evaluation of their attitudes toward gays--which is out of the question. This crusade is as much a matter of money as morality, of power as piety.\n More at http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A217276",

Quite frankly, I post them in my signature as a sign of AGREEMENT with what Jyoshu said. I DO believe accusations need to be proven when they are made.

Of course they weren't really married - but they sure seemed to have fun pretending.\n \n As a result of the concerted effort by liberals to mask the devastating effects of the gay lifestyle, many people are shocked to learn that the average life expectancy of a homosexual male is only about 45 years old - 30 years younger than that of a heterosexual male. \n \n One study determined that homosexual males have from between 20 to 106 sexual partners per year. It's no wonder that homosexual men account for over 50% of all hepatitis cases, and still account for over 50% of all AIDS cases despite the fact that they only make up 1-3% of the population. Homosexual men and women share a markedly increased risk of contracting nearly all forms of STD. The men frequently suffer from other sodomy related injuries, and are far more likely to be murdered (likely by another homosexual) than their heterosexual counterparts; this, due to the typically raucous and oft anonymous nature of the gay lifestyle. \n \n All of these things considered, and given that the cost to treat an AIDS patient averages nearly $350,000, the homosexual lifestyle shares responsibility, by no small measure, for this Country's skyrocketing health care costs. \n \n Fortunately, for those who wish to escape the homosexual lifestyle, there is support. A number of homosexual recovery organizations such as Exodus International and NARTH have helped thousands of people who have been addicted to homosexual behaviors, successfully leave the lifestyle. Many have gone on to have happy and fulfilled heterosexual marriages, to include the greatest of all blessings... children. \n \n But the militants don't want to hear it. In fact, they don't want you to hear it, and have proposed legislation to ban such recovery organizations claiming that any mention of homosexual recovery is \"hate-speech.\" But it's predictable - any time anyone dare expose the aforementioned truths about the homosexual lifestyle, or criticize the homosexual lobby for its radical anti-marriage, anti-family agenda, there's an enormous backlash. It's an age-old tactic geared toward silencing one's critics. It consists primarily of the ad hominem atack - Homophobe! Hate-Monger! Bigot! Gay Basher! Neanderthal!  \n \n http://www.theconservativevoice.com/articles/article.html?storyid=1484",

   "\n I think for them it just boils down to a vague propagandists' rejoinder, which allows those who have already assumed the veracity of the claim as inescapably true to give themselves the impression that they have proven something...\n Much like claims of \"protecting marriage\" by preventing gay marriage. I think deep down they know that if they actually had to explain their statement, it wouldn't hold up to the light of day.\n \n I was actually surprised the EasyRider attempted a response to my question, even though it's blatantly obvious he didn't really answer it. I suspect that his obfuscation will stop shortly as he drops the whole conversation entirely...\n \n I suspect the real reason he doesn't like my \"taglines\" (I am assuming he is referring to my signature?) is that it presents a standard in debate which recognizes the deficiencies in his approach... Ergo, he criticizes me for repeating Jyoshu's statements, but interestingly enough does not criticize Jyoshu for being the one to ACTUALLY MAKE those statements...\n Quite frankly, and I say this acknowledging the fact that I'll probably never get a straight answer from him, I would LOVE to hear him explain how it \"demeans\" what Jyoshu said. Quite frankly, I post them in my signature as a sign of AGREEMENT with what Jyoshu said. I DO believe accusations need to be proven when they are made. I DO believe that there are too many times people don't address points, and it is essentially a sign of a concession of the issue (even when the other side refuses to admit it...)\n \n \n And for the record, because I predict more obfuscation if he tries to reply, the question that needs to be answered which hasn't been answered yet is: \"define what you think \"intolerance\" means?\"\n What (explicitly) does \"intolerance\" mean to you EasyRider?\n\n Very true. We now see him, in the post above mine continue his evasion. I actually didn't see the \"tag lines\" comment. I do think he was talking about your signature, claiming that it \"demeans\" what Jyosh said. I really do not see how it could possibly demean when all it is is quoting him (wonder if he thinks I'm demeaning the people quoted in my signature). \n \n BTW, your predictions regarding EZ are almost always correct, as proven by his latest post. I think we can safely take a Jyoshu quote from your signature and say: \n\"Well since you didn't address my points, I'll assume you're done! A simple \"ok, I concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...\"\n ***Jyoshu\n \n",

The Gay Agenda vs. Family Values\n 1) I think all he did was go to a \"conservative\" web-site and search for an article that had \"intolerance\" and \"gay\" in it. Then posted it, pretending it meant something regarding anything.\n All it does is prove my earlier point in my very first response to him in this thread. He complains about people criticizing Jyoshu, but then fully supports criticizing gays in general. The sad part being that I see many of the same ol' lies in the article that he quoted that the anti-gays love to quote.\n And the article doesn't even have the courage to try and quote the \"studies\" directly. Not one citation...\n \n 2) I always get a chuckle whenever the anti-gay right try to criticize others for something they excel at. Intolerance.\n We aren't asking that their rights be restricted. We aren't asking that their lives be limited in any way. (Although I notice the article includes blatant lies about THAT as well...)\n But it's OUR \"intolerance\" which needs to be criticized...\n \n 3) You're right. He in no way answered my question.\n And you're also right in how Jyoshu's quote applies. It's the reason I put the quote in my signature line in the first place.\n I suspect the reason they really bugged him was that because deep down he KNOWS the truth behind them.\n (Ooops! Did I just insult Jyoshu by calling his quote the truth? :xbanghead )",

   "To respond to Easyrider's quoted article...\n \n Paragraph #1? Pure opinion / propaganda. About every fourth word is purely propaganda in action: activist, taunts, defiles, sanctity, cons, corpulent...\n We get you don't like gay marriage.\n My personal take on the situation is that Newsom did something courageous. He purposely broke a law to the question of the laws constitutionality to a head. To have the issue raised in court.\n Rosa Parks broke the law when she refused to ride in the back of the bus. It was an unjust law, and her actions brought the law to the courts to question it.\n \n \n \nAs a result of the concerted effort by liberals to mask the devastating effects of the gay lifestyle, many people are shocked to learn that the average life expectancy of a homosexual male is only about 45 years old - 30 years younger than that of a heterosexual male. \n\n And this starts the whole list of claimed facts with no substantiation.\n And gee. Doesn't this sound familiar as well...\n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_cameron_obit.html\n \n Barber is quoting Paul Cameron's work, demonstrating the fact that he has no problem quoting liars.\n Paul Cameron did research during the HEIGHT of the AIDS crisis where he took obituaries from \"gay\" publications, and compared to the national average, conveniently assumed to be \"heterosexual\"...\n \n The link above recounts the ridiculous inaccuracies in this technique.\n And it's well known amongst the scientific community that this technique is not accurate. The only conclusion one can reach by somebody still quoting such a \"study\" is that the person quoting it has no problem with duplicity.\n \n \n \nOne study determined that homosexual males have from between 20 to 106 sexual partners per year.\n\n Another Paul Cameron study no doubt.\n A study in which he went to gay bars and gay bath houses to inquire about sexual partners.\n A bit like going to church to figure out how often people pray. It's not a representative sample.\n \n \n \nIt's no wonder that homosexual men account for over 50% of all hepatitis cases, and still account for over 50% of all AIDS cases despite the fact that they only make up 1-3% of the population.\n\n Around 47% of all people diagnosed with AIDS were probably infected with HIV through male-to-male sexual contact, while people exposed through heterosexual contact comprise around 17% of the total. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the number of heterosexual infections has increased dramatically. According to CDC estimates, heterosexual contact led to about one third of new AIDS diagnoses and one third of new HIV diagnoses in 2005.http://www.avert.org/usastatg.htm\n \n So yes. Gays account for about half of all AIDS cases.\n But that's not the full story.\n The \"half of all AIDS cases\" means half of all the LIVING PEOPLE with AIDS.\n For NEW infections, it's a different story...\n \n Gays are improving their sexual habits, while straights are unfortunately picking up the slack. \n But this is overlooking another fact as well. The vast majority of gays do not have HIV or AIDS.\n Do the math for yourself. \n 5% of the population is gay. (Barber again plays with numbers when he tries to diminish the number to 1-3%.)\n About 300 million people, giving about 15 million gays.\n And doing the math we come out with about 3% of the gay population has HIV.\n Leaving 97% of the gay population without HIV.\n Should we condemn the entire 100% because of a disease that 3% has?\n \n \n \nHomosexual men and women share a markedly increased risk of contracting nearly all forms of STD. The men frequently suffer from other sodomy related injuries, and are far more likely to be murdered (likely by another homosexual) than their heterosexual counterparts; this, due to the typically raucous and oft anonymous nature of the gay lifestyle.\n\n PURE bullspit!\n 1) Having sex with an infected partner is what causes STD risk.\n A straight man having unprotected sex with an infected prostitute has more risk from HIV than I do having unprotected sex with my monogamous partner.\n \n 2) \"frequently suffer\"? \"sodomy related injuries\"? Another lie the religious right loves to spin.\n I have known NOBODY who has suffered from a \"sodomy related injury\".\n I have frequently looked for statistics on this, and never find any. If anybody can show me some, I would love to see them.\n When I take a shower in the morning, there is a possibility that I could slip and fall, cracking my head open and dying.\n The chance is so small, and easily mitigated by something like putting down a mat to improve traction.\n Likewise, the ACTUAL chance of sodomy injury is small, and can be made easier by a simple thing like lube...\n \n \n \nAll of these things considered, and given that the cost to treat an AIDS patient averages nearly $350,000, the homosexual lifestyle shares responsibility, by no small measure, for this Country's skyrocketing health care costs. \n\n I would LOVE to see that substantiated with proof...\n But of course, none can be found anywhere in Barber's fiction work...\n \n \n \nFortunately, for those who wish to escape the homosexual lifestyle, there is support. A number of homosexual recovery organizations such as Exodus International and NARTH have helped thousands of people who have been addicted to homosexual behaviors, successfully leave the lifestyle. Many have gone on to have happy and fulfilled heterosexual marriages, to include the greatest of all blessings... children. \n\n Sigh. Another lie.\n \"helped thousands of people\"?\n What ultimate b.s.!\n \n The VAST MAJORITY of people who attempt reparative therapy see no effect. In the end, they are still homosexual.\n Some see a temporary effect, much like somebody who tries something to quit smoking, and then starts up smoking again a couple of weeks later. But the reparative therapy groups count these as \"successes\".\n \n There are precious few independent studies of \"reparative therapy\" results. Primarily any claim of \"success\" will be coming from the reparative therapy groups themselves. Much like trusting a drug company to tell you what the effectiveness of their drug is, without an FDA to tell you the truth or to report the negative effects...\n From the available data, four studies reported a \"success\" rate during conversion therapy of 0.4%, 0.0%, 0.5 and 0.04%. That is, conversion therapy has a failure rate in excess of 99.5% during each study.http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_exod1.htm\n \n \n \nBut the militants don't want to hear it. In fact, they don't want you to hear it, and have proposed legislation to ban such recovery organizations claiming that any mention of homosexual recovery is \"hate-speech.\"\n\n Quite frankly, I think any \"therapy\" organization SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE FOR PRACTICING.\n But WAYYYYY too many of these groups have none, and operate PURELY out of religious purview and reasoning.\n And don't get me wrong. If they want to operate out of religion, then they can do so as long as they DO NOT try to pretend it's \"therapy\" or \"psychology\" when it's not.\n People who use such organizations should know when it has no psychological training for personnel on the staff.\n \n Is that so hard?\n \n \n \nBut it's predictable - any time anyone dare expose the aforementioned truths about the homosexual lifestyle, or criticize the homosexual lobby for its radical anti-marriage, anti-family agenda, there's an enormous backlash.\n\n So Barber is doing BOTH LIES and PROPAGANDA now.\n We're not \"anti-marriage\". We like marriage so much we want to be a part of it.\n We're not \"anti-family\". We just want our own families to count too, whereas people like Barber want to see them illegal.\n \n \n \nIt's an age-old tactic geared toward silencing one's critics. It consists primarily of the ad hominem atack - Homophobe! Hate-Monger! Bigot! Gay Basher! Neanderthal! \n \n Rrrriiiiggghhhhtttt....\n And what Barber did above was clearly not an ad hominem attack on gays, filled with blatant lies...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n This is the pot calling the silverware black!\n Especially considering at the end of his diatribe, Barber tosses out the \"qveer\" word...",
