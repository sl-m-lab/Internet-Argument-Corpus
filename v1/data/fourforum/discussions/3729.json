But they said it was a pretext, meaning \"an effort or strategy intended to conceal something.\" Where does the author get the information that states we used the WMD rationale to conceal some other rationale? I've never seen any evidence indicating that.\n \n \n- the rationale of the war changed from \"al qaeda links\" to \"wmds\" to \"sanctionn violator\" to \"bad bad dictator\" to \"liberating iraq\". i remember when kerry used to flip flop...\n\n \n Maybe the rationale changed, but the site doesn't say that. It actually says we went into Iraq to \"grab for Iraqi oil and to stop Iraq switching from US dollars to euros for all oil payments.\" I don't think we ever used that as an excuse for war. Once again, unobjectivity.\n \n \n- several oil companies are already assessing iraq under government approval\n\n \n And this means we went to war for oil?\n \n \n \n- saddam was supported by the cia in his early reign\n\n \n So was Bin Laden. This happened before we knew they were blood thristy psychos.\n \n \n \n- saddam had already started to switch his primary oil currency to euros\n\n \n And this also proves we went into Iraq to stop the US dollar from declining? If so, we'd probably be all over Europe right now.\n \n \n \n- while bush used the threat of nuclear warfare to incite public support for his invasion plan, our troops are polluting iraq with depleted uranium\n\n \n Actually, Saddam was polluting the country with old and dirty bombs with VX and nerve gas. Not to mention the people he used it on.\n \n \n \n- al-yawer, the new iraqi president, definitely a puppethead for bush\n\n \n Your opinion...not a fact.

We're seeing a growing trend of citizens, not governments, of many other nations boycotting US made products and our currency in protest of our actions as a nation, not our administration.\n\n \n \n I since the recent election you are correct. Prior to the election, it seems that a large portion of the world did differentiate between the Bush administration and the American public. They saw the anti bush protests and the anti war protests. I think it is safe to say that most of the international community was of the impression that Americans felt we had made a mistake in electing Bush and that mistake would be rectified in the next election. When bush was re-elected, I think it was a real surprise for much of the world. \n \n This does bring to mind a question I have asked here many times before and never really had answered. Since what AQ and other Anti US forces are protesting is not anything recent, but a long standing, continous pattern of US foreign policy, are US citizens really \"civilians\" in this war? It seems reasonable to me for the enemy to class us all as combatants, since this is such a long standing problem and the American public could have at any time voted people who wished to continue these abuses out of office. Is \"I am too lazy to pay attention to what is going on\" really a adequate defense?\n \n The list of grievances that AQ has posted against America contains no falsities. It is all true, and we all know it. The US has run roughshod over the world. We have installed and supported tyranical governments, we have used predatory trade practices, and we have enabled our businesses to exploit workers, including child workers, in thrid tier nations by using our military as a bargaining tool. We all know this stuff is true, our government has never really sought to keep it a secret. They have been doing ti since the early 60's, and we have stood by and let it happen. \n \n That being the case, it seems to me that every american holds some personal responsibility for these actions.",

   "i still can't see how bush capturing bin laden and actively eliminating terrorist leaders could possibly be bad for his approval ratings and bad for his election chances.\n \n but more than that, i cant see how the public can be convinced that fighting al qaeda and terrorist organizations is NOT a good idea, but attacking iraq is. by attacking iraq we will not eliminate or even affect terrorism. by iraq even willingly adopting democracy it will not eliminate or affect terrorism. even if saddam had surrendered, took a plane to the us, and turned himself into to a local precinct, it still would not eliminate or reduce terrorism\n \n HOW WILL A DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ REDUCE TERRORISM????\n \n this is the eternal question that noone can answer, and i am becoming sick of asking\n \n btw, i was banned from a pro-bush forum today :p\n\n \n His approval rating would dump if the economy tanked by taking Iraq, domestic anti-terror and excess military spending out of the GDP even if he captured BL and the mythological devil feared by all Christians in one grab.\n \n The public is, for the most part, sheep. They've been duped into believing democracy in Iraq will solve all problems including AQ by spreading to other ME nations and making the world one happy camp. Few realize most Iranians, Turks, Pakistanis and many others would be labeled as insurgents and disposed of in our standard manner. \n \n Trying to debate in a rational manner to people hiding under what's becoming a threadbare flag is fruitless. They believe what their elected officials tell them and close their eyes to everything else. To entertain a thought that we're not right is believing enemy propaganda or worse yet, unpatriotic. \n \n I've been banned from several. The last one was because I stated that the reason the US volunteer military is partially working (no responses about using reserves, national guard and massive numbers of 'contractors') is because entry level jobs now available pay far, far less than military pay and benefits, don't offer paid college educations and a large number of our youth is stupid enough to risk getting blown apart in Iraq because their jobs have disappeared and they follow a president who cares not about their lives but only his own ambitions. Had my physical presence been available, the responses indicated that every vet and Bush supporter on the list would have shot me on the spot as a traitor.

It feels better to wrap ourselves in democracy and freedom.\n\n \n I would agree that it probably had something to do with it, but I don't think it was probably a deciding factor. Lets be realistic here. The last election had nothing to do with who was the better leader or who was better suited to lead, or who had the better idea for the direction America should take. There was simply not enough realistic difference between the two platforms to base a decision on such factors. The last election was decided by who ran the best smear campaign, and Bush won. \n \n \nYou haven't described anything that we don't do to each other here in our own country all in the name of being good businessmen.

You are telling me that your average joe couldn't take a couple hours a week to kind of keep up on what is going on in the world? \n \n Even without doing extensive research, I have noticed that most people here are aware of the fact that the US does, and has in the past, supported tyrannical governments. Most people here are aware of the fact that our corporations exploit children as little nmore than slave labor overseas. Even if you are unaware of exactly the mechanisms we employ to do these things, it should be pretty damn obvious that they are WRONG. \n \n \nAt this point, now that the issue has risen to the top, I've invested my time.

I think not.\n \n The average guy on the street has much MORE power than most realise. This is because we, as a society , are such an a pathetic bunch of loosers that those we elect assume that every letter they recieve on a particular issue reflects the view of THOUSANDS of people. Ten letters about one issue in a single month to a single congressman is considered a massive influx. \n \n How many times in the last 10 years did you write your congressman to tell them that you would prefer that your tax dollars not be used to prop up evil dictators and tyrannical governments? How many times did you jot down a line or two requesting that we not use our tax dollars to provide Israel with artillery and bulldozers so they could attack refuge camps or run bombing raids on their surrounding coutries? \n \n But now that there has been blood in the street and we all know there is likely more to come, you volunteered and voted for Kerry so your conscience is clear? If that is all it takes to make you feel better, you should be a professional assasin. Do a job, hand out some political action pamphlets, and sleep like a baby.\n \n COME ON. This has been going on for YEARS and our leaders have not even made any effort to hide it. You didn't even have to get a sattelite and tune into foreign media outlets to find about about it. You watch MSNBC, see a story about our allies the saudis. Later there is a story about the latest atrocity perpetrated by the saudi governement. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out, and it doesn't take but about 5 minutes to sit down and write your congressional representatives a little letter asking them to please not support the tyrants and cut throats in the house of saud. Stick a stamp on it and call it good.\n \n Never happens, though, because your average american isn't watching the story about what a bunch of evil tyrants the sauds are, or the story about what great frineds they are to the US.

We are the land of the stupid and home of the regulated. There are more federal laws onthe books RIGHT NOW than in the first 150 years of this countries existance combined. Wasn't it Ayn Rand who suggested that since a government really has no control over law abiding citizens, they endeavor to make everything illegal\n \n What you are describing is a government unanswerable to the people. What is the definition of tyranny if not this? I personally hope thing are not as bad as you describe, because if so, it is time to start throwing members of our government up against the walls and shooting them. Is this where we are? Is it time to use the second ammendment as it was meant to be used, and take back control of our country from the power hungry special interest whores who run it?\n \n I am starting to wonder if maybe the time for this has not come. This is a new thought process for me, so please excuse me if I do not have it all worked out or I am unable to articulate it well.\n \n It seems to me that there is very little our government is doing, or trying to do, that is actually in the best interest of the American people. They have become a government representative of the power of special interests and mega corporations, not a government of, by and for the people. I think that Americans need to take a good, hard look at our govenrment and decide if this is how they wish to live, and how they wish for their children to live in the future.\n \n I can't help but wonder if our government has become so disconnected from the people that it no longer serves us, but merely rules us. As I watch some of the actions of our government in recent years (say, the last 20), I am reminded of a quote by Thomas Paine:\n \n \nHe that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from opposition; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach himself. \n \n \n Is our foreign policy indicitive of our governments true attitude regarding self determiantion and democratic rule? If so, it brings to mind yet another quote from Paine:\n \n \nIf there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace. \n \n \n \n \nSo, I've got one for you?

I could letter write for years regarding Iraq. If the Iraqi's streamed into the street, they could solve it by the end of the week. I wish they would.\n\n \n Because we have the worlds biggest and baddest military and we don't fight fair. Our soldier hide in armored vehicles and tanks and drop bombs from 30,000 ft, while our navy launches cruise missiles from hundreds of miles away. \n \n In countries where they have simply said NO, such as vietnam, korea, panama, Iraq, tens or hundreds of thousands have died.\n \n In Iraq, they ARE trying to dislodge us. There is no way a resistance movement that large could last as long as they have without the support of the majority of the population. It is simply not possible. Why don't they take to the streets and remove us? The last time they took to the streets in any kind of force for a demonstration, US marines fired into the crowd and then tossed everybody they could get their hands on into abu ghraib, apparently to be tortured. \n \n It is a lot easir to preach standing up tot eh bully than it is to actually DO it. \n \n \nAmerica is stuck in the middle.

Every comment from his mouth in the lead up, and during the initial phases to allies about Iraq was very poorly done\n \n Only the countries that go into Iraq get rebuilding contracts\n \n Old Europe (France Germany) needs to smarten up and look to new Europe (Poland etc)\n \n You are either with us or against us.\n \n Is just a list of some of the poor diplomacy of Bush\n\n \n I have to agree with you here. His diplomacy skills are non existant. the question is, does it even matte now? America has embarked on a course that is not going to be popular no matter how smooth your president is. If we are going ot insist on sending our military all over the planet to enforce our foreign policy decrees, the rest of the world is not going ot like it. Hitler was a smooth talker and a good diplomat. The rest of the world still didn't like the things germany did.",

   "Of course not. But it's an example, right here in America, of organized crime that held the population in its grip. The real difference is what?\n\n \n The real diffence is that in one case you are talking about folks who undertook shady dealings, in the other you are talking about folks who are in armed rebellion against the sitting rulers. BIG difference.\n \n \nYou're just not with me regarding the size of the crowd. Are you saying we'd mow down a couple hundred thousand? The jails aren't big enough. The newspaper reporters are everywhere.\n\n \n I am saying that we don't have to mow down everybody. In a crowd of 200,000, you can kill 1 ro 2 thousand, toss a few hundred more in prison, and the rest of them get the point immediatly. The reporters aren't everywhere. They are embedded with the troops. Don't want a reporter there, no problem, you just send the troops with the embedded reporter somewhere else. \n \n In America, you could likely put together a demonstration like this. In Iraq, there is no way. Here we are dealing with our own government, our own elected officials. There they are deali9ng with an invading force with a lot of bombs and tanks and helicopter gunships and everybody is carrying a machine gun. The American troops there have been known to target civilians (during protests, no less), are not known for showing any kind of real restraint when using their toys, and it is widely known (now) that we torture prisoners. \n \n It doesn't take much by way of a show of force to keep embarassing demonstrations out of the street. People simply support the armed insurgents instead. If people are going to die/be killed by a hostile power, I think they prefer to do it fighting rather than trying to pull a Ghandi.\n \n \nThey don't even have to unite. Each group in its own area could do it. Where's the necessity to do it simulateously. They can't march in step among themselves. Evidently they haven't figured out the power of peaceful demonstrations. Shall we send them old news footage of sit-ins?\n\n \n What exactly IS the power of peaceful demonstrations? I know there were a lot of peaceful demonstrations during vietnam, but we didn't pull out because of them. We puleld out because men with guns were killing us. For that matter, we had the biggest peaceful anti war protest in history right here in the united states during the Iraq war, and it didn't do a bit of good. \n \n Lacking a good government, representative of the people, a peceful protest is nothing. The kids at Tiananmen Square were peaceful protestors. The VC were protestors, but certainly not peaceful. Which did the most good?\n \n Even with a representative government, a peaceful protest is nothing but a media stunt.\n \n History is not made by a bunch of flower children sitting around chanting \"Hell no we won't go\". History is made by picking up a gun and killing your enemy.",
