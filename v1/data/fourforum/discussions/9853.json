   "The problem with making records of sex offenders public is that you make it more likely that they will not keep the authorities informed about changes of circumstance and hence are less well monitored and more dangerous.

   "This wouldn't be a problem if... \n \n \n \n This wouldn't even be a problem if we had a quick and fast way to dispose of these people. I read somewhere that the recidivism rate for sex offenders (specifically child molesters) is close to 100%. I hate to say this, because I know a lot of them are broken goods already and didn't get to grow up in good homes or had some kind of brain damage or birth defect which effected them mentally. However, they are agressors. They deserve a speedy trial and if found guilty, public execution. These people have been pampered by a system obsessed with \"rehabilitation.\" \n \n Rape is a different matter. I know this is going to make some people blanch, but I don't think those convicted of rape are deserving of the death penalty. It should be assault. Honestly, when you think about it, whats the worst that is really happening? If there is any part of a thug that a woman would want to get bludgeoned by repeatly, wouldn't it be a guys dick? Seriously, thats all thats going on. Its an invasion of privacy, an affront to her most sacred private property, and she should have a right to defend her self, with deadly force if need be, but after the fact, the guy shouldn't be killed. Federal Prison, 5 years, Felony offense. Its like an ikky form of trespassing in my mind. If a guy comes on your lawn jacks off on the porch and you slip and fall in it, thats about the extent of the crime being committed here. We need to drop the whole male dominated chivalry thing. We hate rape because its an affront to US as men. If we really examined the situation objectively though, and gave women what they want, (equality, liberty) then we would have to see rape in a whole different light. Its bad, but its not THAT bad.\n \n Equality! MM-HM Good!",

   "Rape is a horrific crime, I have heard victims describe it as being killed and then asked to stand up again. I don't support the death penalty for any crime, but I think there should be scope for sentencing rapists to anything up to life in prison, if the circumstances warrant it. It seems quite absurd that you advocate a penalty for rape that is less severe than for possessing crack in the US.\n \n Rape is a horrible, horrible thing whether the victim is male or female, adult or child. The emotional trauma is often permanent, and it strikes me as particularly callous to call it trespass. No wonder your buddies in the marines commit so many crimes against humanity.:xcensored",

   "But did you know that you have to register if arrested for taking a pee outdoors?\n\n OR occasionally for being a few months into adulthood whilst your GF/BF is a few months still into 'childhood'.\n Yes, in the registries I've searched, there are some who are relatively speaking, non-offenders or technical offenders.\n Some really dispicable offenders can even dodge the registry by pleading to a lesser non-sexual crime.\n There are some people who are public over this issue, mostly in areas that work on expanding restrictions against said offenders.\n IIRC, I watched a TX. news station's report where a woman was checking many out herself (registry verification) to see who was what.\n \n \nBut to part of my question Is the support or pushing for the registry a conservative or liberal issue?\n\n It's neither. \n It'd have more to do with actual facts of recidivism in such people and the paranoid parents have for their children's safety.\n As a relatively young non-parent, you'd probably object to such registry. More so if your aspect of the gay community turns a blind eye to (pool-boy???) relationships. I'd side with Savage on keeping any young person away from vastly older people regardless of orientation.\n But, if you were a parent, your ideas may change in regard to this.\n \n \n \nThe other point is that you don't know what their crime was exactly. They may have been just arrested for having sex with a man in their own home.\n\n \n Unfortunatly not all registries are exact in details of crimes done. Most are very vague. So, is it the 20 year old who hooked up with a very mature 16 year old 5 years ago...or a 20 year old who molested his 5 year old nephew?\n Some discernment helps but, YES it would be a more just system if we really did prosecute for actual crimes rather than take pleas and let some slip through the cracks or if judges allowed for common sense in some prosecutions.\n \n Morale of the story should be, ensure the age of your partner and legal standings for engaging in such activities.\n \n On a related note, my sister was statuatorially raped by a man when she was 15. He was prosecuted. Last I heard, he was murdered by his wife at the time a few years back for insurance money in a typical white-trash conspiracy. Was ruled a suicide...",
