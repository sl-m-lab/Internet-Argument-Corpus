   "An attack ad linking Kay Hagan to the Godless Americans PAC boosted her instead.\n \n The Democratic senator-elect's campaign received 3,600 contributions within 48 hours of an ad by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole criticizing her for attending a fundraiser.\n \n Hagan immediately used the ad as an e-mail fundraising tool.\n \n \"We got responses from people who identify themselves as atheists and every religion under the sun who found that ad offensive,\" said Hagan spokeswoman Colleen Flanagan, who said the campaign hadn't calculated the dollar figure raised yet.\n \n Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster in Raleigh, said Hagan was winning by four percentage points more than president-elect Barack Obama during early voting. After the ad aired, she won by 11 percentage points more than Obama. \n \n Dole said the $3 million personal loan she made her own campaign in early October was not specifically related to the ad. (Char-O) Hagan got 3,600 donations after &#039;Godless&#039; | newsobserver.com projects\n \n Congratz Religious Right!\n You've earned your \"backlash\"... emoticon_xgood",

   "Hagan did a good job of capitalizing on it for political gain, that's for sure.\n \n Problem is, the ad was true. Hagan really did attend a PAC fund raiser; and the group's priorities are for such things as taking \"God\" out of the pledge or off coinage ... such a PRESSING and MAJOR priority for our country, you know. Oh and remove Christmas a federal holiday.\n \n If that's a \"backlash\", then it's a backlash that needed to be risked on principle. But everyone I've heard comment on it has said the press played up the whole \"Godless\" thing; that it really was more indicative of the election as a whole.",

Hagan really did attend a PAC fund raiser; and the group's priorities are for such things as taking \"God\" out of the pledge or off coinage ... such a PRESSING and MAJOR priority for our country, you know.\n\n Yeah.\n A \"pressing and major priority\" like high school prayer at football games or graduation.\n Good things Christians never make a big stink over that either...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n \n \nOh and remove Christmas a federal holiday.\n\n Christmas was a non-Christian holiday that Christianity absorbed in order to make their religion more appealing.\n It's application is an individual basis. While the presumption of some Christians to pretend to unilaterally declare what the holiday is can be annoying, it's no reason to \"remove\" it.\n \n \n \nIf that's a \"backlash\", then it's a backlash that needed to be risked on principle.\n\n Funny how when the atheists raise the issue and its not \"such a PRESSING and MAJOR priority for our country, you know\".\n But when it's the Christians who push the issue, then it's \"needed\"...\n \n \n \nProblem is, the ad was true\n\n Have you seen the ad?\n The ad has met exceptionally strong criticism from the public as well as many local and several national media outlets. CNN's Campbell Brown said about the ad: \"[A]mid all the attack ads on the airwaves competing to out-ugly one another, we think we've found a winner.\"[20] The ad has been described as \"ridiculously outrageous,\"[21] \"indecent,\"[22] a \"gross misrepresentation,\"[23] \"worse than dishonest\"[24] and \"beyond the bounds of acceptable political disagreement,\"[24] among other harsh criticism.[25] Another ad issued by the Dole campaign in mid-October 2008 was described by The Fayetteville Observer as \"[setting] the low mark in negative political campaigning.\"[26]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Hagan#.22Godless.22_ad",
