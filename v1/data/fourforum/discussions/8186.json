   "Pro-gay student writer takes flak in Utah \n \n PlanetOut Network Fri May 26, 4:25 PM ET\n \n SUMMARY: An anti-gay group asks Utah's attorney general to probe a Provo-area high school paper that ran pro-gay and health-related articles. \n \n A right-wing organization has asked Utah's attorney general and education chief to investigate a Provo-area school over a student's pro-gay and health-related articles in the school newspaper, the Associated Press reported.\n \n One of the articles ran alongside an opposing article written by the daughter of Stephen Graham, president of the anti-gay Standard of Liberty Foundation.\n \n On Nov. 17, an opinion piece by student Sarah Brimhall advocated formation of a gay-straight alliance at Lone Peak High School in Highland. It appeared alongside an opposing view written by Graham's daughter, Elise.\n \n On May 15, a news article and an opinion piece, both written by Brimhall, addressed a vaccination for human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be spread by sexual contact. In the opinion piece, Brimhall wrote that teaching abstinence is not enough to prevent the spread of HPV.\n \n \"The promotion of abstinence is placed above the prevention of a disease that claims thousands of lives each year,\" she wrote.\n \n The Standard of Liberty Foundation contended Wednesday that Brimhall's articles violated a Utah law prohibiting schools from any activity that results in students revealing information about their sexual behavior, orientation or attitudes and a law that requires schools stress abstinence and not advocate homosexuality or sexual activity outside marriage.\n \n \"Sex activists are targeting kids,\" Graham told Provo's Daily Herald. \"They know that high school newspapers can be highly effective carriers of anti-parent, pro-sex propaganda. School administrators are either complicit or clueless.\"\n \n Carol Lear, director of school law and legislation at the Utah Office of Education, told the Daily Herald she has no plan to investigate the articles.\n \n Lone Peak principal Chip Koop told the Herald that the school aims to obey the law and \"at the same time allow students some freedom to investigate topics that are important to them.\"\n \n Brimhall was honored last year in Salt Lake City's Deseret News for her success in overcoming traumatic brain injuries, including hearing loss, sustained in a car accident.\n \n \"Doctors thought she wouldn't be able to learn very well,\" her teacher told the News. \"What takes some students very short amounts of time to do takes her hours to do at home . . . She . . . doesn't complain about assignments or how difficult things are for her. She is . . . an example of ambition and determination.\"\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20060526/co_po/progaystudentwritertakesflakinutah",
