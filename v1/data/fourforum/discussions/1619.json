   "Technology on customs is probably the biggest one, customs and ethics are pretty much based off rules for living in a society, customs are the actual action carried out based on this and ethics the 'theory' behind them. \n \n Technology enlarges that society by improving communications and making travel easier and providing solutions for the problem of providing resources for a large group of people living together and other related issues (i.e problems of disease etc). Ethics and customs will change to better allow people to live in the new larger society (i.e if you are no longer competeting with the neighbouring tribe for food due to your increase in farming technology it is no longer nessesary to kill trespassers on your tribal domain as it is no longer all used for providing food) and because people will come into contact with new ethics and customs. You can go a bit into mimetics here, a meme is an idea that can replicate and spread- the concept equivalent of a gene, the increase in communication between will spread these memes faster and possibly lead to the growth of more aggressive ones, ones that don't jsut compete by conferring an advantage onto the host but do so by attacking the hosts of rival memes (think Inquisition). Could go into religions here if you are feeling a little controversal and think you could get away with it, there seems a definite trend between a decrease in the power of religion and the level of technology in a culture as the conditions under which the meme of religion arose is significantly different from today's situation that it is no longer the best adapted meme.\n \n Technology can not really decide ethics I would say, merely influence them as ethics are really just the best code of behaviour possible that allows you to survive in the world. It can decide customs as you could write customs as the equation 'Ethics + Technology = Customs' (i.e what you beleive combined with what you can do results in how you behave).\n \n Hope it helps",
