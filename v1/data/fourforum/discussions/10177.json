   "(I wasn't sure where to put this, philosophy or politics might have been better but here it is.)\n \n I ask this question mainly for the americans on this forum, mainly because in the UK patriotism isn't really the flashpoint issue that it seems to be in the states. This could be because people overreact to the idea of patriotism because they associate it with Nazi Germany, and also because Britain has already had its decline and fall (to an extent) so we are not so wrapped up in notions of being a 'great' country.\n \n I also ask with reference to the oft-repeated accusations of someone being 'un-american' or 'anti-american'. This is definitely not something you ever see in the UK; never in my life have I heard or read someone using the phrase 'anti-British'. I am hard pressed, in fact, to recall a single instance of any culture outside the US using this turn of phrase, with the exception of supranational religion ('un-christian', 'anti-muslim' etc).\n \n It seems to me to be a meaningless label, particularly (and ironically) so for the 'land of the free' where evryone is supposed to be able to pursue their own crazy lifestyle and espouse their own crazy views without this sort of vilification. \n \n An extension of this is people being told that they obviously 'hate their own country' etc, with the tacet implication that they are supposed to absolutely love it, a form of flag-worship in my opinion. This makes no sense to me, because as a UK citizen I neither love nor hate my 'country' as a whole. How can I? There are aspects of British life that I love, such as our cynical attitude and irreverent sense of humour, and there are aspects that I hate, such as our readiness to follow the US into wars, and our woefully one-dimensional politics. \n \n So what do think patriotism is?\n \n How do you define a patriot?\n \n What (if anything) does it mean to be 'anti-american'?",

K. CHESTERTON: \n \"My country, right or wrong\" is a thing no patriot would ever think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying \"My mother, drunk or sober.\"\n \n GEORGE BERNARD SHAW: \n Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it.\n \n GOETHE: \n Patriotism ruins history.\n \n H. L. MENCKEN: \n The notion that a radical is one who hates his country is na\u00efve and usually idiotic. He is, more likely, one who likes his country more than the rest of us, and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees it debauched. He is not a bad citizen turning to crime; he is a good citizen driven to despair.\n \n H. L. MENCKEN: \n In the United States, doing good has come to be, like patriotism, a favorite device of persons with something to sell.\n \n HENRY STEELE COMMAGER: \n Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive.\n \n JAMES BALDWIN: \n I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.\n \n For more quotes visit http://www.wisdomquotes.com/cat_patriotism.html\n \n\n \n my personal favorites in bold.",

Take, for instance, growing number of extradition requests from only Poland for criminals, who are suspected of such serious crimes in their native country, as murder, rape, robbery, burglary or drugs. In the last 12 months, officers from our Metropolitan Police's Extradition Unit have been asked to track down 257 Poles across the UK (dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=504532&in_page_id=1811).

Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian tycoon, who decided to suggest himself for Georgian president now (htt://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/acticle3087485.ece). \n It is understatement to say that this Chechen mercenary has prepared realization of his bloody plans on the territory of this country.

For crying out loud! How much should British people exercise patience towards regular bandits like Y. Ahmadov, whose hands are stained with blood of 4 of our country fellows?
