Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control\" \n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40.

Well here are the facts from http://www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm:\n \n D. Myth #4: Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate. \n 1. Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed. Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus, the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law. \n 2. Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths. The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that, \"An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the link-the significant rise of murder in the late 1960's, and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population.

According to the Clinton Justice Department, crime has decreased even while the number of guns increased. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the research arm of the Justice Department, reported in 2000 that while the number of firearms in circulation rose nearly 10% during a recent five-year period, gun-related deaths and woundings dropped 33%.174 \n 4.

   "***Yawn*** revisionist history... Well here are the facts from http://www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm:\n \n D. Myth #4: Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate. \n 1. Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed. Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus, the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law. \n 2. Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths. The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that, \"An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the link-the significant rise of murder in the late 1960's, and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population.

Please read and explain to me how (if) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr. Civil-Rights violator:\n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",

   "The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false. The NG is a standing army. The militia is not. The NG can be federalized. The militia can not. They wear the same uniforms. The officers all know each other and play golf together.\n \n If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.\n\n \n Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.\n \n You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.\n \n The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.",

A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n\n A lot of those points are strawman arguments. The author is saying if you believe in gun control then you believe these things. Well, I believe in gun-control and I don't believe a lot of those things the author just posted. So the author must not be familiar with the arguments that pro-gun-control people make.",

Some people have claimed that the numbers used in that report are heavily edited to support your claims. Could you please provide me with a list of sources that was used in the compilation of the report so I can review the data myself and refute their claims?\n \n Here is a c&p of their reply:\n \n Due to the complex nature of statistical analysis, we do not provide source or raw data information. Often, our studies draw from such a broad range of sources that we are not able to keep track of all of them ourselves! You can be assured that our team of researchers has reviewed all the data available and drawn the correct conclusions.\n \n \n So, what they are saying in the first line is they feel that you are too stupid to look at raw data and formulate a conclusion. In the second line, they are saying that THEY are too stupid to keep track f their sources, and in the third line they are saying, \"but it is OK, we won't provide you with any evidence, but trust us anyway\".\n \n This is a typical \"analysis\" dne by the brady folks. No sources, they are unwilling to provide source information, they toss out a single source which doesn't even come close to covering all the claims they have made, but they expect us to just trust them.\n \n The anti-gunners have a long ways to go if they are going to convince us that their doctored numbers are real. I am not realy fond of the NRA (because I think they are traitors to their memebers), but their reports are generally footnoted, and if you request raw data fromm them you ge either a definitive link, or a HUGE packet of photocopies.",

The closest they do to this is:\n \n \nArrest data is regularly accepted as a valid measure of crime, reflecting law enforcement response to criminal activity, and is used by agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for its Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). \n \n \n Which argues what a valuable source of information arrest data is. It does not say where they got their arrest data, and does not even, in the entire article, claim that they actually USED arrest data in its formulation, They simply cite another article in order to \"prove\" their claims.\n \n The other article they cite is one that THEY have written. It is a very long article, very well written, except for the exclusion of any references to the source material they used. They have a section entitled \"Section Two: Details of Specific Arrest Incidents Involving Concealed Handgun License Holders\" where they outline 11 individual cases. At the top it says:\n \n \nUsing outside resources, such as newspaper accounts, law enforcement reports, and public data on criminal records, the Violence Policy Center was able to obtain additional information on 11 of the 5,314 arrests reported by the DPS&#8212;10 for murder or attempted murder and one for aggravated kidnapping\n\n \n This is a flimsy attempt to lend the report credibility. They say they used outside sources, but do not name them except in the vaugest of terms. If you contact them (and I ust hung up the phone) they \"do not rememeber\" specifically where they got the information.\n \n In the coclusion, they ust bluff and bluster some more, and STILL do not list a single source. Didn't any of these people go to college? While they were there, didn't any of them learn to write a research paper?\n \n As pointed out by gewehr44, the texas dept of public safety was so outraged by the lies in that report they went to the trouble of fashioning an official rebuttal. \n \n VOR, be careful who you listen to.

If you view people that don't want to victimized as potential, or even probable, criminals, then you might as well just imprison the bulk of the population. Remember, hundreds of millions gunowners commited no crimes yesterday. Guns simply do not cause crime. If you view the common population as a threat to your wellbeing, then you, sir, are paranoid to the point which, perhaps you are better suited to seclusion than to society.",

   "I have laid down some conditions before I give up my guns. They are not going to happen. There is no way I see within my life, that the 2nd Amendment will be repealled. There is no way that the National Guard will become \"militia-ized\" in my life time.\n\n \n If I may suggest to all; 'A repeal of the Second Amendment, alone, will not automatically exclude gun owners from owning firearms. The right to keep and bear arms preceeded the Constitution and Bill of Rights, therefore, it would take a Constitutional Amendment, in and of itself, to deny citizens that right. That is what will not happen, in my estimation. \n \n The LIB DIM GGs will continue to incrementally impose restrictions and caveats on honest gun owners, collectively WE will continue to compromise with the buggers, until we are for all practical purposes, disarmed. \n \n May I also suggest to firearms owners, to carefully edit from their rhetoric, any mention of them personally owning firearms. Who knows when these forums are being monitored?",

   "The problem is that allowing people to legally carry concealed weapons makes it easier for criminals to carry guns around. And people with a concealed weapons permit are more likely to commit a crime. Florida and Texas have had a lot of problems.\n\n \n Please furnish evidence of that. In Texas, there has been no more than a handful of crimes committed by CCW permit holders. One of the arguments before hand was the streets would run red with the blood of innocents and bystanders. Another was at any time, road rage would take ove rthe reason of people and many would be killed. Hasn't happened, me bucko.\n \n [quote]\"From 1996 to 2000, Texas concealed handgun license holders were arrested for weapon-related offenses at a rate 81 percent higher than that of the general population of Texas, aged 21 and older which amounts to more than one weapon-related offense every other day since the law went into effect.\"\n http://www.vpc.org/press/0206ltk.htm\n \n Oh, the VPC is as honest as the Brady Campaign.

That is about the only check in place. OF course, wihout concealed carry permits, you can be assured that EVERYBODY who is carrying a gun is doing so illegally.
