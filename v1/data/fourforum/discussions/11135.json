   "IMHO Brussels took very advantage-ground it makes run errands on account of something and without it! Look, Lithuania needs to close its nuclear power station and we are in Bulgaria obliged to cope with corruption and criminal! But more interesting is that raging criminal tendencies in Bulgaria is due to the fact that EU old members are trying to get rid of crime dregs and criminal elements paying for their moving to Bulgaria from the union budget! \n Well, I think that Brussels has found perfect method for solving it's own problems! EU admits new members for using their territories as cesspool by sending there all those 'not wanted un EU'! Eh, EU policy is artful really! Instead of newcomers' support Europe uses them as buffered zone! As I understood the policy of double standards is turning into commonplace practice in the EU.",
