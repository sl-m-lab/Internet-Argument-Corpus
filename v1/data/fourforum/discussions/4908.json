   "Thankfully, I was raised by a Catholic mother who spared me the indignation of the Church. She was mindful to point out many if the Churches hypocracies. Let me do the same for you here.\n \n First off the RCC says that they welcome gays, but we all know that in fact that a homosexual who practices gay sex is most definitely NOT welcome in the RCC. \n Secondly, the RCC condemns such acts of violence and abuse towards children, except when it comes to those acts committed by their own priests. \n Thirdly, \"In October of 1986, John Paul II assembled 200 leaders of the world's great religions in Assisi, Italy ... `to be together and pray' on behalf of peace. ... On that fall day in the birthplace of St. Francis, John Paul joined a circle with the Dalai Lama, Orthodox bishops, Hindu swamis and a Crow Indian medicine man in full feathered headdress, saying little but offering a powerful symbol of solidarity. ... Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's top doctrinal officer, told a German newspaper: `This cannot be the model!' John Paul, however, insisted on the propriety of the event: `Diversity is the nature of the human family. ... We must go beyond [Catholicism] to persons of goodwill who do not share our faith.' It was a striking overture, considering Catholicism declared in 1217 at the Fourth Lateran Council that `there is indeed one universal church of the faithful, outside of which no one at all is saved.'\" {reprinted from this mornings \"Meet the Press\" on NBC}\n \n In this we see the division of ideals between John Paul II and Benedict XVI. \n \n We must also remember that Benedict, before he was elected Pope, was the leader of the group formerly known as the Inquisition, now known as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. \n \n I predict only a more tightfisted Papacy with Benedict at the helm.",

I have some issues with it however, that I'd like to point out.\n \n Catholic teaching, as well as much Christian teaching period, has to be understood in the context of belief in absolute and higher truth, and the understanding that morality comes from God, not human reason. That view is anathema to atheists, but nevertheless it is a very predomiment religious understanding of truth whether one agrees with it or not. I think many Catholics and protestants do indeed understand and know that 'being gay' is a matter of nature. The problem is that they are being expected by gay lobbyists to ignore or reinterpret 'absolute authority,' because to them, absolute authority is telling them that homosexual behavior is wrong. It's not the nature that religious people have an issue with; it's behavior. You're never going to be able to convince many religious people to give up on their view of absolute truth, which is exactly what is being expected of them in this debate. From their point of view, you might as well be asking them to turn their back on their belief that murder or child abuse is wrong. (No, I'm not saying homsexuality is like either of these issues; I'm simply saying that indeed many Catholics and the Catholic church leadership takes it just as seriously as what they consider to be sin).\n \n You say that asking a homosexual to restrict themselves to heterosexual sex is like asking a heterosexual to restrict themselves to homosexual sex, but there are two problems with this. \n \n First, it tries to put the two on the same playing field, which I don't agree with. Given that gay people comprise a small minority, probably no more than a few percent at most, it can be said that gay people aren't really all that common. I think it is just as legitimate to say that the typical sexually active person has heterosexual sex, and so heterosexual sex is the typical form. It is really the norm, and homosexual sex is the exception. It is just as legitimate to say that most people are heterosexual, and homosexual relationships fall outside of that norm, alongside other things like polygamous relationships, or inter-family relationships that are also not that common. So I don't think it's really accurate to put them side-by-side, as if homosexual relationships were alone as the only exception to the norm of heterosexual relationships.\n \n Second, I think that saying 'homosexuals restricting themselves to heterosexual sex is like asking heterosexuals to restrict themselves to homosexual sex' is to not realize how seriously Catholics take what they consider to be sin. If Catholics believed God (absolute truth, to them) held heterosexual relationships as sinful, I have no doubt that they would take a strong stance against heterosexual relationships. Remember, they DO take such a stance already when it comes to such relationships among the priesthood. \n \n So when it comes to the church taking a stand against homosexuality, or any issue for that matter, it is rarely a matter of political or prejudicial motivations. Rather it is simply a matter of them believing they are doing what is right, because to them, absolute truth holds heterosexual relationships as the only Godly standard. So I have to sort of take issue that this is a matter of the church considering gay people \"disordered.\" The issue really isn't even gay people at all. It's what they consider to be the right thing to do, and obeying God. You can of course, go against centuries of belief, as well as be in the minority world-wide and disagree with that interpretation, which is your right.\n \n \nSo it's basically a conflict of values - Because the Catholic Church regards non-heterosexualities as being deviations away from a norm, rather than as simple being variants of that form, the satisfaction of those sexualities is pathologized. \n\n \n Indeed they do consider non-heterosexualities as being deviations away from a norm, but I don't think they consider it so much of a 'pathology' as they do simply sinful simply because they view it as against God's will or outside His plan for the family structure. The mental state of gay people or anyone else isn't the issue at all for the RCC.\n \n \nThe \"Love the sinner, hate the sin\" approach gets it wrong precisely because it starts from the assumption that sex for reproductive purposes is the only moral form of sex. \n\n \n Not really. I don't think it's so much that the RCC views sex as only for reproduction (in times past they did), but rather it's a matter of homosexual sex deviating too much from what they consider the norm should be for a relationship and the family structure. Remember, there is no teaching (that I know of anyway) that forbids sex in Catholic households when reproduction isn't the intent. \n \n Again, like every other issue in regards to Catholic teaching, this has to be understood in the context of their obedience to absolute truth. To the Catholic, it's better to trust in God and let Him decide when children are conceived and born than take control of such matters. The ideal in Catholic thinking is to have sex whenever a couple wants, enjoying it, and let whatever happens happen. If children come along, great! (They are a blessing and wonderful, in Catholic thinking.) If they don't, they don't. This often seems strange to some in our post-sexual revolution culture, where pleasure has become the preferred purpose over reproduction, and sex has become such a big deal to so many people. But in the Catholic mindset, children are always considered a wonderful thing--one of the greatest blessings of life. (Hence their disdain for abortion.) So it's not a matter of sex being only for reproduction, but rather reproduction shouldn't be prevented, because it might be God's will. The RCC's stance against birth control seems extreme to it's critics, but it's really just another example of them wanting to let the will of God be. (One could argue that if God is truly all-powerful, He could over-ride birth control if He wants, but that doesn't allow for human freedom of choice, IMO.) \n \n \nThis assumption ignores the multiple purposes of sex\n\n \n In our time and culture there are only two possible \"purposes\" of sex, period: reproduction and pleasure. Can you think of any others? I doubt it. I think sexual pleasure is fine, but as a benefit it pales in comparison to the benefit and blessing of a child being born. Not even close. That's my opinion, though I think it is the more common opinion for most of the world, especially the billions of religious people world-wide. A gay couple can never achieve the first purpose (reporduction) in sexual acts with each other. They can only have the second purpose.\n \n \nWhen we recognize that sex has a variety of purposes as well as reproduction, and that those purposes are defined in relation to the particular sexuality of a person,\n\n \n Again, there aren't a 'variety' of purposes that sex has; it only has two possible ones: reproduction and pleasure. And the only way they are defined by one's 'sexuality' is that heterosexual couples are the only ones that can conceive a child with each other. Pleasure can be a purpose with any given sexuality.\n \n \nIf we are to properly evaluate the morality of someone's actions, we must first recognize who it is that performs those actions rather than applying some over-generalized one-size-fits-heterosexuals moral code.\n\n \n Then you are asking religious people to deny absolute truth and have a relative morality. 'Situational ethics.' In my opinion, it's asking too much.\n \n \nJesus fortunately recognized this, being a student of rabbinical thought. But Pauline Christians - thanks to their Greek and Roman influences - don't.\n\n \n Jesus' teachings never directly touched on homosexuality, just as it didn't on numerous things that that the church views as sinful. If we only took the red-letter record we have of His words as the only moral code (rather than other parts of the Bible as well), we could have no moral disapproval of such things as prostitution, slavery, child abuse, etc. Jesus never gave a comprehensive list of 'here's what's ok and what's not ok', because that was already in the scriptures, for all to read even in His time.",

   "jyoshu:\n \n Obviously some things haven't been made clear. \n \n The first is that restricting homosexuals to heterosexual sex is an issue that would be wrong regardless of whose sexuality is in the majority. \n \n This restriction is wrong because sex has more purposes than reproduction than the purposes of reproduction and pleasure. \n \n Sex may also be an expression of love and affection, as a token of intimacy, as a bribe, as a commodity, as a healing process, as meditation, and as a stress reliever. \n \n All of these, including reproduction and pleasure, may be the only purpose an individual has for sex. Achieving most of these purposes, for some reason, requires a least one partner whose sexuality aligns with your own. Reproductive sex, like sex-as-bribe and sex-for-trade, doesn't even require that. \n \n Secondly majority status does not always signify a norm from which minorities deviate from. \n \n White americans, for example, are not the norm that black, latino, and asian americans deviate from. \n \n Likewise heterosexuality is not the norm that homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality, and other minority types of sexuality deviate from. \n \n In order for minority sexualities to be deviations from heterosexuality, they would have to be derived from heterosexuality. Unfortunately us minority sexualities don't start off as heterosexuals and become corrupted, it's an innate thing that we're born with like handedness. \n \n Now it's interesting that you argue that asking Catholics to accept that people should cater to their own sexuality rather than trying to fit into a particular mold of heterosexuality is a denial of absolute truth.\n \n Of course, this absolute truth seems to have an awful lot of interpretations, as is obvious from the sheer number of christian churches, let alone the number of other religions claiming absolute truth. \n \n The problem with absolute truth, as recognized by wise men in the past few centuries, is that there is know way of being epistemically sure that what you think is absolute truth actually is absolute truth.\n \n Instead it is a matter of faith, and forgive me but since I do everything else in life according to objective (note not absolute) reason, I think I'll take the same approach to sexuality. \n \n I mean, the fact that some people can't be easily convinced that they're wrong, thanks to the special kinds of cognitive blocks they've contracted, is hardly reason to say they're right. \n \n By all means, stick with Catholic dogma. Just be aware that the rest of the world has advanced in knowledge and wisdom since then. \n \n Forgive me if a reject a set of sexual mores formulated by XXXXXX that couldn't see the holes in the ontological argument thanks to their primitive logic, didn't understand concepts such as zero, negative numbers, and the infinitessimal calculus in mathematics, and thought euclidian geometry was the be all and end all of geometry.\n \n My point is that technology has advanced since then. Mathematics, logic, science, language, ethics, gov't, medicine, and epistemology have all advanced in great strides since the 1st century AD.\n \n All power to the Catholics for holding fast to their beliefs, but the problem is that our technology hasn't advanced and improved by people regarding primitive iron-age tools (both physical and mental) as the last word in technology. \n \n Moreover I'm not asking that Catholics abandon an objective ethics (being an objectivist myself) in favour of a relativist ethics (a contradiction in terms) but rather that they accept that humans are fallible creatures that are occasionally wrong. To err, as they say, is human. In God we trust, and all others we subject to peer review. \n \n I trust God to know what is right. Unfortunately I don't trust people to know what God actually thinks, including myself. Given that I do not know for sure what God wants of me, but that She has given me the faculty of reason to figure out the options and the power to choose, I will choose according to the best reasoning I have so that I can justify the faith that God has put in me to do good.\n \n In this case Faith means rejecting the Biblical claim that homosexual acts are wrong because it stands in contradiction to my experience and to my reason, which God has given to me. Unfortunately most people don't have the experience of being non-heterosexual and misuse their faith such that they put it in worldly things such as books rather than in God-given reason. \n \n It could be that I'm wrong, but then I could also be wrong about the sun rising again tomorrow.\n \n [Note: Looking back this turned out to be quite the rant. Hopefully you see the points I'm getting at: majority/minority status does not imply norm/deviation, sex has more than two purposes, believing that you have absolute truth is a misuse of faith and will prevent you from finding Truth for yourself.]",

   "Well, there probably are some 'gay' people who DO have that belief. But again, I'm just not one for trying to seamlessly catagorize people into neat little boxes (gay, straight, bi). The gay lobby has done a very successful job in the last few decades of defining the debate by overreaching with terms like \"gay\" and \"straight,\" and \"sexual orientation\" and using them to set up an argumentative system where those things are givens and shouldn't be (in their view) challenged in any way, lest we fall into the pit of being politically incorrect. Or worse, those \"givens\" are \"backed up\" with grand statements like 'every reputable medical association is on board' or 'the vast majority of the medical community agrees.' Well, no they don't--I know of plenty of doctors who do not agree. Claiming \"offensiveness\" and therefore making something politically incorrect can be a very effective way to stifle any opposition or even publications dissenting on an issue, and gay rights groups have pulled that off quite well.\n\n \n I do not recall the gay rights movement ever claiming that any doctor or medical association states that people must be categorized into three special groups and they are unable to act outside of those. What they do say is that homosexuality is not harmful, is natural, and is not a disorder. What gay rights supporters call \"offensive\" is offensive, and there should be no doubt about that. Every time you claim that homosexuality is immoral, I am offended as much as you would be if I claimed that Christianity is immoral, or that your relationship with your loved one is immoral, and you should understand that, though the subject should not be taboo.\n \n \nAgain, not everyone believe that certain way.\n\n \n I know this. I used the term \"anti-gay lobbyists\" because you used the term \"gay lobbyists\".\n \n \nThere are gay people who certainly DO know that gay sex and relationships are wrong. It's probably a struggle for them at times, but we all have our weaknesses.\n\n \n But there are more straight people who DO know that gay sex and relationships are right.\n \n \nI DO understand that it probably FEELS normal. But morality is not based on feelings.\n\n \n Morality is also not based on hurting others. You cannot treat others differently than you would treat yourself and call that moral. It isn't. I understand that it feels moral for you to disapprove of homosexuality, but morality is not based on feelings.",

   "If so, then why do you use those catagories as a sort of debate-based 'doctrine?' Do you not realize that is exactly what you are doing when you or others claim 'gay people can't change'?\n\n \n Erm, do you mean the categories of harm, naturalness, and it not being a disorder? Well, I use the concept of harm to describe how beneficial or harmful same-sex marriage would be to our society. I only discuss how natural homosexuality is if someone else brings it up, because it isn't relevant, and the fact that homosexuality is not a disorder indicates that it does not need to be cured, which I find a useful fact, often. Of those, I really only use \"harm\" as part of my debate-based doctrine. I do believe that some gay people can change their sexual attraction, and I believe that most cannot. I'm sure any gay person can choose to live his or her life with someone other than the person he or she loves, but I see no reason to make them suffer so.\n \n \nWell, there you go. You've made my point. If simple disagreement is going to be deemed as 'offensive' and politically incorrect, you've succeeded in \"heading the debate off at the pass\", if you will. I would agree that calling gay people derogatory names is offensive, or making villainous associations (such as people saying 'Hitler was gay and that's why he killed people') but it seems that the line for what's deemed offensive has been moving more and more to include any discourse whatsoever on the issue of homosexuality for some time. You don't get to decide that there won't be a debate. There IS a debate, and that's the way it is. If that's offensive, then your standard of what's offensive is way too broad.\n\n \n It isn't too broad. To claim it to be fact that I or someone I believe to be moral lives in sin is offensive. I would be hard-pressed to understand how someone who calls me evil could manage to not offend me, and I wonder why you do not mind being called evil. I think perhaps it is because no one hurts you when they call you evil; you're in the majority. It isn't the same when one person to calls you evil as it is when hundreds of millions do it. Yet as I stated:\n \n \nthe subject should not be taboo.\n\n \n We cannot shut down the debate because people are offended, for that would accomplish nothing. But it should be expected that people will be offended, and as I said, you should understand that.\n \n \nActually I would not consider that statement offensive at all on your part--I'd accept that as your opinion. I wouldn't agree of course, but I wouldn't take it as or claim it to be offensive. When our standard of what offensive is so broad, it only stifles discussion.\n\n \n Being offended always stifles discussion no matter what context it is used in anywhere. Yet it exists, and we must both recognize and deal with it.\n \n \nThose are two different concepts, and therefore the \"hurting\" statement is a strawman. You haven't shown or proven that gay people will truly be 'harmed' if the govt. doesn't recognize their marriages but instead finds a way to give the same benefits to all regardless of marriage.\n\n \n This would not be the strawman fallacy. I would be guilty of the strawman fallacy if I found your weakest point, and singled that one out for attack, ignoring the strongest parts of your argument. What you claim I have done is failed to back my own statement. I have backed it, though.\n \n I have explained several times that by being denied marriage, same-sex couples are denied an equal opportunity to be accepted. I have said that if the name \"marriage\" meant nothing, you would have no reason to be so adamant about preventing same-sex couples from using it. It does mean something, and denying them access to marriage denies their lifestyle, religion, and beliefs an equal chance to be accepted in society. The only proof or evidence one might offer of this is the overwhelming number of people who believe that same-sex couples do not deserve equal rights, that they do not deserve to be treated the same as others treat themselves.
