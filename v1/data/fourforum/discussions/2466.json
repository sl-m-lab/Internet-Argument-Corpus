   "A fedral judge awarded nearly $150,000 to a man fired by AT&T Broadband for refusing to sign a diversity policy requiring him to \"value\" the beliefs of others, including gays.\n \n The man stated that \"AT&T should not force their beliefs on people.\" He stated that he is a Christian and \"loves all people\", regardless of lifestyle, but that he \"cannot value homosexuality.\"\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/4/6/141535.shtml\n \n Or Google: Fired Christian AT&T.\n \n The Federal judge was correct in the decision. This isn't a private organization such as a fraternity/sorority, church, club, etc that can chosse what kind of org. belief system they will have.. This company is a public one and therefore cannot make anyone value another persons beliefs. Even SCOTUS has repeatedly stated that there is a difference between private and public entities.\n \n What, sign a form requiring one to value radical Islamic beliefs?\n \n Should one have to sign a form requiring them to \"value\" gays beliefs?

Tolerate also means to recognize and respect others beliefs and practices without sharing them. If you respect something, you hold it in esteem, you value it. Tolerate however, can also have a negative meaning, meaning to simply put up with something that is not really liked. I can see why they chose \"value\" instead, as the most respectful of diversity.",

   "Worker opposed to gays wins suit\n \n \nThe judge found that although there was no direct religious discrimination against Mr. Buonanno, AT&T Broadband failed to show it could not have accommodated Mr. Buonanno's beliefs \"without undue hardship\" to the company he had been with for nearly two years. [...]\n \n The Civil Rights Act requires employers to reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of employees unless the employer can show it will create an undue hardship on the company to do so. [...]\n \n In the ruling, the judge listed several things the company could have done to avoid the situation, such as communicating better, getting more details about Mr. Buonanno's concerns, clarifying what the company intended by the language in question, accepting his pledge not to discriminate, or even rewriting the language to make it less ambiguous.\n\n \n I think it's important to note WHY this guy won his case. Not because his religious views somehow trump company policy, but because the company did not make sufficient effort to try and accommodate him.\n \n In other words, they fired him too quickly.\n \n Employers still have the right to implement and enforce \"diversity\" and \"non-discrimination\" policies.",
