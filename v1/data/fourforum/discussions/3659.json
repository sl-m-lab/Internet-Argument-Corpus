This includes all personal and corporate income taxes, payroll and self employment taxes, capital gains, AMT, EITC, gift and estate taxes.\n \n The FairTax will REPLACE the INCOME tax with a single-rate, federal sales tax collected only once, at the final point of purchase of new goods and services for personal consumption. Used items are not taxed, because they have already been taxed once. Business-to-business purchases for the production of goods and services are not taxed, because they will be taxed for the first time when sold retail. \n \n Under the FairTax, Food would be taxed. Exempting items by category is neither fair nor simple. Respected economists have shown that the wealthy spend much more on unprepared food, clothing, housing, and medical care than do the poor. Exempting these goods, as many state sales taxes do, actually gives the wealthy a disproportionate benefit. Also, today these purchases are not exempted from federal taxation. The purchase of food, clothing, and medical services is made from after income tax and after payroll tax dollars, while their purchase price hides the cost of corporate taxes and private sector compliance costs. Since these \"costs\" will be eliminated, the price of food will go down. The end result will be that the cost + the tax will total about the same as the total price is now. The difference is that the amount of tax will be shown on your receipt instead of hidden in the price. And you will be buying your food with pretax dollars (no money taken out of your paycheck).\n \n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",

   "Isn't that a major incentive to establish personal wealth? To be able to spend more for pleasure and/or necessities than the poor or middle classes...\n\n \n Absolutely!! Most people want to \"better themselves\". And buying steak instead of burgers is an incentive; buying a New car instead of a Used one is an incentive; buying Mercedes instead of a Chevy; a bigger boat, a bigger house; a bigger car; etc. those are definitely examples of incentives to establish personal wealth.\n \n \n \n \n...without concerns of wealth redistribution?\n\n \n First of all, The FairTax is NOT wealth redistribution!!! (Re-read http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3566 post no.9). \n \n I agree with you that wealth redistribution is not an incentive for wealth. Take the current tax code for example. It started out in 1913 as a \"flat tax\". Now, it has evolved into thousands of pages of revisions, and loopholes, and incentives, and deductons, all in an effort to redistribute money by way of \"tax incentives\" and \"deductions\" and \"tax credits\" etc. ...Buy this and get a deduction; buy that and get deduction, etc... All of which is the Government (dangling carrots) providing you with an \"incentive\" to spend your money where THEY want your money to go. The ultimate example of this redistribution of wealth is manifested in the form of jobs being outsourced to other countries. The FairTax eliminates redistribution of weath allowing you to do with your money as you wish.\n \n \n \n \nWhy bother amassing personal wealth or pursuing capitalism if legislated redistribution creates financial equality?\n\n \n Good question. You work hard for your money. Why give it to someone else, before you even get it? The FairTax is only another way of collecting revenue. What the Govt. does with the money after they get it, is still a variable. \n \n \n \n \nYou still haven't addressed the issue of state tax revenues. Is fair tax a vehicle to eliminate state tax and states rights, especially regarding education, still primarily funded by state tax revenues, and establish central government that dominates all financial and socioeconomic facets of the populace?\n\n \n The FairTax pertains only to \"Federal Taxes on Income.\" It has nothing to do with State or Local taxes. No state is required to repeal its income tax or piggyback its sales tax on the federal tax. All states will have the opportunity to collect the FairTax; states will find it beneficial to conform their sales tax to the federal tax. Most states will probably choose to conform. It makes the administrative costs of businesses in that state much lower. \n \n The state is paid a 1/4 of one percent fee by the federal government to collect the tax. For states that already collect a sales tax, this fee proves generous. A state can choose not to collect the federal sales tax, and either outsource the collection to another state, or opt to have the federal government collect it directly. \n \n If a state chooses to conform to the federal tax base, they will raise the same amount of state sales tax with a lower tax rate - in some cases more than 50 percent lower - since the FairTax base is broader than their current tax base. States may also consider the reduction or elimination of property taxes by keeping their sales tax rate at or near where it is currently. \n (Source: http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/smart/faq-main.html#25)\n \n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",

   "Why do people hate taxes so much? Are they really that greedy?\n\n \n No one with wealth normally hates paying taxes, it's considered a cheap form of civil control, far more cost-effective than personal armies. When those taxes begin allowing able people to avoid making their contribution to society to feed, clothe and shelter themselves, or enhance their standard of living without personal effort it presents normal resentment.\n \n The other end of the economic scale has traditionally paid their taxes with about the same amount of grumbling as the wealthy, also understanding the advantage of a stable civil circumstance and accepting their station in life. Especially since their residences normally border areas where civil disobedience is the norm. \n \n In the US our once-stable civil circumstances have progressively deteriorated into semi-controlled chaos. Our prison population is now the highest per-capita in the developed world, with private electronic 'moats' and contracted security personnel becoming the norm in upper income levels, our criminal and civil courts are clogged to a point where criminal plea bargains and negotiated civil settlements based on increasing insurance costs dominate 'justice' and we've created a new class of citizen, the welfare takers and seekers.\n \n When compared to our past glory provided by abnormal post WW2 prosperity, 'greedy' people just don't feel they're getting much of a bargain from their tax dollars by supporting others too lazy to make their own contributions. When one takes a capitalistic system where 10% of the citizens pay 90% of the personal taxes and begins using legislation purely to redistribute wealth on an indiscriminate basis in an effort to create economic class equality, hate from those supplying the tax money will quickly replace resentment.",
