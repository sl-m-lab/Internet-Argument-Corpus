Adultery is generally understood as someone cheating on their spouse, i.e. having an extra-marital affair. You are correct however that Jesus did say anyone who remarries also commits adultery.

I think religious people are generally talking about the sanctity of marriage as an institution, not on the individual level. That's why it's not really a valid argument when people ask \"but how is your marriage threatened\" (which I see sometimes). No one is saying that peoples' marriages are threatened; I think their point is about the institution of marriage. In some ways, a lot of this comes down to the differences in which people view marriage. I think religious people sometimes have a tendency to view marriage in terms of a lofty institution (cultural and/or religious), rather than simply a commitment between two people or in the basis of legal grounds. In fact, when religious people oppose gays getting couples' benefits, they are opposing a legal matter on cultural/religious grounds, and so I don't think their arguments are very valid.",

The key word here is \"institution.\" They're talking about marriage in a general sense, in society. They aren't talking about peoples' individual marriages which may result in divorce, a long-term commitment, the early death of a spouse, a spouse commiting adultery, or any number of things going wrong. They are talking about \"marriage\", not \"a marriage\". I think it is a bit disingenuous when opponents of evangelicals criticize them for their own marriage failures in their individual marriages because of their views on marriage at large, as a societal institution. It's like telling someone they shouldn't have the view that education in America is beneficial to society at large if they're dropping out of college (for any # of reasons). Those are dealing with two completely different arenas: one's views about his personal situation, and one's views about society and culture at large. To them gay marriage is very much of a broad issue pertaining to the institution of marriage. Adultery is much different--it leaves what constitutes the make-up of a marriage alone, and is more in the arena of an individual marriage.",

   "I'm not talking about anyone's individual marriage. I'm talking about the general approach to the issues of homosexuality and adultery. You're talking specifically about gay marriage. Gay marriage is included in this discussion of course, but it's about attitudes towards homosexuality in general, and adultery in general.\n \n \nTo them gay marriage is very much of a broad issue pertaining to the institution of marriage. Adultery is much different--it leaves what constitutes the make-up of a marriage alone, and is more in the arena of an individual marriage.\n\n Interesting, considering that, biblically speaking, homosexuality really is just a specified form of adultery.\n You, yet again, are making my points for me. They approach homosexuality and adultery differently not because they are biblically significantly different, but because it's more inconvenient to approach adultery with the same tenacity they approach homosexuality.",

   "Quote:  We can be grateful that Mr. Gordon and his fellow fundamentalists are too humane to obey Leviticus 20:10: \"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife ... the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\" Otherwise, we would have to slaughter half the adult U.S. population, all the remarrieds and their spouses.\n \n Whoever wrote that is ignorant of how things work in the NT. No where in the NT is death by the hands of Christians proscribed for any sin / sinner. Rather, if there is capital punishment for any wrongdoing, it is by God's hand or by the state (Romans 13). But the writer is right about one thing: Gay sex and adultery are both sins.\n\n \n \n \n Um Easy Leviticus is OT. But your right about the NT part, it's just not relevant to the statement.emoticon_xgood",

We're in NT days, and though the moral sins have not passed away, the agents of justice in the NT are either God, or the ruling authorities (Romans 13).

Is it really likely that the Jesus-besotted Paul would have commended his idol's executioners as divinely appointed to administer justice?

At least to the extent of believing it was in the will of God and all part of His purpose.\n \n The Christians of the day had a very different outlook on civil and governmental roles than we do today, particularly in our Western-based democracy. I think this is a case of people trying to frame early Christians in the mindset of modern day people who are less likely to have an individualistic mindset. Early writings of the church fathers suggested they believed it was important to submit to civil authorities in all things except when they expected worship of false gods. Paul's view, as pointed out by EZ, is quite consistent with other Christian writings of the early church.",
