   "If such American dependents as Poland and Lithuania are ready to invest their money in Byelorussian \"orange revolution\", let them do it and leave the other members of EU in peace. Yankees give them enough funds for it. And our politicians should understand that EU will let payments for organizations of similar revolutions go down the wind, because there is no real opposition or such main revolutionary factor as popular discontent in Byelorussia. Remember, Byelorussia is not the same country as, for example, Georgia or Ukraine. And it would be more proper to invest our money in business with Byelorussia and develop our economic relations. Look at very same Poland and Lithuania! They shout at the top of voice about necessity of power change in Byelorussia and simultaneously they buy cheap gasoline there and then sell a part of it to us.",
