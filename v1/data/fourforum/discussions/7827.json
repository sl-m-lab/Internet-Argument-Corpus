   "Milosevic: With Unclouded Eyes\n \n If you have been paying attention to the world around you, you will know that Slobodan Milosevic was the former president of Serbia and was standing trial in The Hague for alleged war crimes. He was found on March 11th dead in his cell. Initial reports say he passed away from a heart attack. However, news reports are beginning to appear saying that mysterious chemical traces were found in his bloodstream during a post mortem examination.\n \n Now, I cannot claim to be an expert on the Balkans and the former Yugoslavia, that beautiful yet sad part of Europe that has always seemed to draw out the bloodiest inclinations of man. Nor can I claim to know the political minutiae of Mr. Milosevic's term as Serbia's president. But what I can tell you is that he was a hated figure in the West, principally in the United States and most especially among the Jewish power brokers. How do we know this? By their own words, of course.\n \n In April 1999, during the height of the U.S. bombing of our Serbian racial kinsmen under President Clinton, Susan Estrich, a Jewish law professor at the University of Southern California and a militant feminist who was under consideration for a Clinton cabinet post, said the following:\n \n \". . . the first war of the 21st century: a conflict not about communism, but about race and ethnicity, being waged by committee, against a madman who is not himself a direct threat to the countries waging war against him. . . . [T]he President is committed, and the country is behind him. The number of Americans willing to take the war to the next step -- committing ground forces -- has in fact been increasing steadily. It speaks well for the future.\"\n \n Or how about this remarkable admission from Clinton's political general Wesley Clark, who told the Jewish Week in New York that his relatives were not just Jews, but members of the priestly caste of Cohens:\n \n \"There is no place in modern Europe for ethnically pure states. That's a 19th-century idea, and we are trying to transition into the 21st century, and we are going to do it with multi-ethnic states.\"\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=8392\n \n Or listen:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/docs/audio/fr20060325.pls\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/docs/audio/fr20060325.mp3\n \n \n \n .",
