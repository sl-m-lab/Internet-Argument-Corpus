   "The best Rock band in years. American Minor is a 5 piece band from Huntington WV and have released their self titled debut album on Jive records on Aug 19. \n www.americanminormusic.com and www.myspace.com/americanminor\n \n I've saw them 3 times and they get better every time. I saw them Friday when my brother's band Jake Leg (www.myspace.com/jakeleg) opened up for their record release party followed by The Hiss (www.myspace.com/thehiss).\n \n American Minor ended with a dead on cover of the Allman Brothers' \"Whipping Post\" \n \n Thought I'd spread the word to any rock fans.",
