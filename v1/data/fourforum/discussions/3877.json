He watched her cut his hair in the mirror with a very serious look on his face. It was amazing! I was started crying because I couldnt believe what I was seeing. He was just like a little man. They even used the clippers and he didnt even blink an eye :)",

   "First haircut...Big step. I am glad your little one took it well. \n \n We had an exciting first here last night, too. First M&M up the nose. My 2 yr old came in rubbing here nose. The conversation went something like this:\n \n \"Whats wrong with your nose hon?\"\n \n \"M&M in nose\"\n \n \"You have an M&M in your nose?\"\n \n \"Yes\"\n \n At this point I obtained visual conformation that there was in fact a yellow M&M lodged securely in the left nostril.\n \n \"Why did you put an M&M in your nose?\"\n \n \"Momma did it.\"\n \n \"Your mother put an M&M in your nose?\"\n \n \"Yes\"\n \n \"I don't think momma did it. Did you put the M&M in your nose?\"\n \n \"Yes\"\n \n I have found from past experiences that asking foolish questions like \"why would you do somehting that rediculous\" get you nowhere. Just accept the fact that the M&M is in the nose and move on.\n \n I held her down on the couch and blew in her mouth (a trick I learned from an ER doctor when I once transported a 3 yr old to the ER with a nostril full of styrofoam packing beads) and the snotty M&M shot right out. \n \n The thrills of being a parent.",

   "Anastasia,\n \n Have you ever done the rouge test with your little boy? It involves using a mirror and some make-up to demonstrate the development of self-awareness during infancy. \n \n Since it is right around 16-20 months that infants start to become acutely self-aware (a major developmental milestone that preceeds true emotion) I bet that your son was having one heck of an time understanding what was going on between the mirror and his head. That could be why he looked so serious -- he had a lot on his mind. \n \n Development in action--so common but so extraordinary at the same time.\n \n \n Whistler\n \n PS Hmm...can you tell I work in a research institution devoted to child development?",
