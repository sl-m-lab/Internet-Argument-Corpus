   "Any of you seen this, worth a look. Can see the debating antics of Hovind from this vid. The science side is taken by a bloke from Skeptic magazine.\n\n I've seen parts of it. To put it nicely, Shermer got his XXX kicked. Let's face it, Shermer isn't a good debator, especially against an expert bullspitter like Hovind.\n Shermer is not a scientist. Many of his answers expose his lack of familiarity with the specifics of biological evolution and cosmology. He is unable to supply the slaughter that Hovind's talking points deserve. This is an excellent example of why live debates against creationists are strongly discouraged: we get the usual Gish Gallop, and any time a single point can't be refuted off the top of the debator's head, it's a victory for the creationist.",
