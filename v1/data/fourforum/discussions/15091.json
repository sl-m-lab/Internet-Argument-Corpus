   "Lorne Gunter: Crown and police still view gun owners as criminals | Full Comment | National Post\n \n \nThe Crown in Ontario has decided to drop some, but not all of the charges against Ian Thomson, the Port Colborne man who last August caught three masked men trying to firebomb his rural home - with him in it. Thomson fired two or three shorts over the heads of his attackers to scare them off, but then ended up being charged by Niagara police for daring to use force to defend himself and his property.\n \n Wednesday in a Welland, Ont. courtroom, prosecutors apparently dropped the charge of dangerous use of a firearm against Thomson, but retained an unsafe storage charge. And the way in which police fortified the court against peaceful protestors - including the reported deployment of a sniper on a rooftop across the street - shows that police and prosecutors still don't get it: Ordinary gunowners are not the enemy! (They're not criminals either.)\n \n Thomson, a trained former firearms instructor, insists that when he heard intruders lobbing Molotov cocktails at his home he went to his gun safe, took out a revolver that he owned legally, loaded it and fired his warning shots. If his version of the early morning attack is true, the Crown's decision to keep pushing for an unsafe storage conviction is illogical, to say the least. It also illustrates how convinced the Crown is that no use of a firearm is ever justified. Nor do officials see much difference between law-abiding gunowners and criminal ones.\n \n Follow me for a minute. Canadian gun law requires owners to keep their firearms locked away and unloaded when not in use. Thomson claims he was in compliance. Only after his life and home were at risk did he go get his gun from its lockup, load it and fire.\n \n The Crown's actions would seem to indicate that they believe guns must be unloaded and locked at all times, even when in use. (Huh?) In short, prosecutors seem to arguing that Canadians may own guns, so long as they keep them safely stored at all times. As soon as they take them out of their safes to hunt or target shoot or ward off bad guys, the guns are no longer safely stored, so owners are by default guilty of storing them unsafely.\n \n You think I'm kidding, but I have been following federal gun control efforts since they began in 1995, and it would not surprise me a bit that prosecutors are so obsessed with pursuing administrative gun crimes (such as failing to obtain a license or register a shotgun) that they have tied themselves in a knot of logic in which any removal of a gun from storage, even for legal purposes, is a crime.\n \n Several of the protestors who went to the Welland courthouse Wednesday also report that police were out in full force, including a SWAT team and, perhaps, even a sniper on a roof across the street. (There was certainly an officer on the roof, but whether he was a sniper is debatable.)\n \n Here's one account of what police were doing:\n \n All entrants to the courthouse were subjected to a search as intense as any ever received at any airport. They were wand searched, patted down, pockets emptied and made to lift their pants legs. Belt buckles were examined, too.\n \n A total of 12 uniformed officers were stationed in the small main foyer. Four more officers were in the courtroom.\n \n All this for a court appearance that took about ten or fifteen minutes.\n \n Why the show of force? A police spokesman said that it was for the protection of the defendant (Ian Thomson) and his lawyer (Ed Burlew).\n \n Was a threat made?\n \n If a threat were actually made, why did they protect Ian at the courthouse but refuse to allow Ian to protect himself on his own property? They seized his guns.\n \n Was the show of force an expensive way to intimidate legal gun owners?\n \n Or, given that media were expected, was the show of force a display designed to imply that legal gun owners are dangerous and unpredictable vigilantes?\n \n Really!? Police expect us to believe that all this was necessary to ensure Thomson's safety. From whom? Gunowners who had driven from all over Ontario to show their support for him?\n \n The official explanation makes no sense, so I have to agree that all of the possible explanations - that police view all gunowners are potentially dangerous and they want to convey that through the media.\n \n This is what Bill C-68 has achieved. It has done nothing to lower gun crime because real gun criminals will never register their guns. Instead it has turned legitimate gun owners against police because it has made police treat them as suspects just because they like to hunt, shoot skeet or control vermin on their farms.\n",

   "The right to self-defence\n \n \nCrown attorneys in Ontario have dropped two criminal charges laid against Port Colborne resident Ian Thomson. Mr. Thomson, who had been involved in a yearslong dispute with a neighbour, was attacked at dawn one morning by masked men shouting death threats and hurling Molotov cocktails at his house. Fortunately, neither he nor his home were harmed, likely due to the fact that Mr. Thomson, a former firearms instructor, confronted his attackers with a .38-calibre revolver, driving them off with several warning shots, none of which caused any injury.\n \n When police arrived at the scene, they entered the house, saw the revolver and another pistol that was not fired during the incident, and arrested Mr. Thomson. They charged him with pointing a firearm, careless use of a firearm and two counts of careless storage of a firearm. On Wednesday, the Crown, citing little likelihood of conviction, withdrew the more serious charges of pointing and careless use of a firearm. But the two careless-storage charges remain, which means Mr. Thomson's legal saga continues.\n \n For thousands of Canadians who fully comply with the country's strict, convoluted firearms regulations, this is a familiar story. Police officers and the Crown routinely deter citizens from taking steps to protect themselves, by forcing them to justify lawful acts of self-defence. Edward Burlew, Mr. Thomson's lawyer, believes that there is indeed a deliberate, if unstated, desire among Crown prosecutors to send a message that discharging a firearm, even as intruders attempt to burn down your home with you inside it, is not condoned by authorities.\n \n Ignorance is likely an issue. Mr. Burlew has dealt with hundreds of similar cases, and believes that many police officers have been trained incorrectly, causing them to lay charges against citizens whose weapons are in fact disabled to the law's satisfaction while in storage. For example, hunting rifles and shotguns can be rendered completely inert by removing a few mechanical components. Even so, many Canadians who have so disabled their guns are charged for not locking them in a safe, which is not actually required by law.\n \n Whether ignorance or intent is to blame, the situation cannot continue. Police should improve training to avoid laying unfounded charges. Crown attorneys in every province should be reminded that armed self-defence is a right enjoyed by all Canadians -and that a firearm used to defend one's life or home is by definition in use, not in storage, and is governed by different norms.\n \n Law-abiding citizens such as Ian Thomson should not be arrested and pushed into financial hardship by police or Crown attorneys ignorant of the law or eager to exploit its complexities in pursuit of an anti-firearms agenda. We wish him well in his efforts to defeat the remaining charges.\n",

   "Every single gun crime is committed by a gun owner. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n That's quite an absolute and hyperbolic statement you've just made Penfold. It's also quite false and lacking in both intelligence and substance.\n \n You claim every single gun crime is committed by a gun owner. Just how exactly do you define \"gun owner\" in a manner that applies to everyone? Simply being in possession of something doesn't mean that you own it or that the object in question can be classified as your legally recognized property. That's why we have the term \"possession of stolen property\" in our dictionary.\n \n Then we come to the fact that there are a considerable number of groups of people who are legally barred from gun ownership for various reasons. Convicted felons, domestic abusers, drug addicts, mentally insane, illegal aliens, traitors to the country, those who have given up citizenship, and minors just to name the best known. By definition these people are not capable of legally owning or even possessing a gun, nor can the law recognize them as being the rightful owner of a gun. So should one of these groups go out and commit a gun-related offense such as robbery or murder theirs can't possibly be the actions of a legally defined \"gun owner\".\n \n You certainly aren't going to try and claim that the murder of border patrol agent Brian Terry was the action of gun owners are you?",
