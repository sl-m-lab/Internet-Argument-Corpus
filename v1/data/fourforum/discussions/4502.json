I'm strictly a straight line racer. :) \n \n ...\nCircle racing is about preparedness, stamina, skill and luck. It takes all of those to be in the front after 100 laps or so. The excitement of watching several cars negotiate banked corners with all of them in a four wheel drift, just inches apart (if they manage to stay apart), throwing dirt-and-rubber twin rooster tails and the anxiety associated with hoping your favorite driver's engine and drive train will stay together that makes dirt track racing a magnet for me.\n \n There's quite much in the way of preparation and car set-up that will make or break a run for the front spot, even in an 8 lap heat race. It's far more complicated than drag racing. You're competing with other drivers all the time, not just trying to be consistent with elapsed times.\n \n Don't get me wrong...I like drag races, too. I had a friend in high school who was ape over it...had a fire engine red '56 Chevy tudor no-poster and was really good at engine work. Back then, it was a great accomplishment to home-build an engine that would turn 7000rpm and stay together. Baroni was good at it.",

   "Circle racing is about preparedness, stamina, skill and luck. It takes all of those to be in the front after 100 laps or so.

It's all about marketing now. I seldom watch the restrictor plate (Daytona, Talladega) races except for the last few laps.\n \n And you're definitely right about speed costing money. A couple of years ago it was said that in order to run a Nascar team for one year you need about 7 million dollars...8 if you wanted to win!\n \n Some of the dirt racing sanctioning bodies are trying to stem that trend by creating the \"spec\" motor and \"crate\" motor classes, but the response of the fans has not been as good as expected...we like the fa$t cars!",
