For example, bombing abortion clinics because they feel so inclined about abortion being evil.\n \n As far as Gay activism goes there is a simple yet underlying issue with trying to bridge the two. In religious activism, you conform others through law to adhere and accept your beliefs and faith based reasoning....\n \n Where as with Gay activism, or civil rights activism, it is merely being active to garner rights for a group of people, whereas now I see most often religious activism is to take anyone's rights away....\n \n \n I hardly see any form of positive activism from religious groups such as Focus On The Family. or the FRC.

   "\n For some people you take away religion and they have nothing left. \n\n \n I've personally encountered some who 'lost their (blind) faith'. It's not pretty. I've also spoken with several mental health professionals who've dealt with the fanatics...who later left their 'cult'. Many say the believer who goes to such extremes of faith or seek meaning in the rules of a religion tend to have something inately wrong with them. Often, no internal moral code or set of ethical conduct...no compass and lack comprehension on why such (external or internal) is needed for a society to smoothly function. \n So, when the fanatic 'wakes up'...they can devolve into very self-destructive behavior. Nihilistic even.\n Some find purpose in other endeavours and can resume somewhat of a normal life. Others go on to find something to be fanatical about once again.\n \n You can look at a couple of fanatics who post on these forums. They justify their uncivilized behavior and bad attitudes with their religious interpretations. Their faith is absolute that they are corect and always in the right and thus can 'do no real wrong'.\n Take away their convictions and chances are, they'd continue with the uncouth behavior but find a new justification for it.\n \n Bottom line seems to be that it's always about themselves.\n Their religion promises THEM rewards later.\n Take that away...and they'll still seek reward in one manner or another.\n \n \nRegarding Christian \"zealots,\" what is a zealot, except someone who believes in God more than you do.\n \n And that's all that need be said for this sorry thread.\n\n \n Yep, all are created equally...just some are more equal than others.\n \n A zealot is just someone who wants to prove to others (even god) that they are believers by engaging in excessive and often calloused behavior.\n I'm sure EZ and the others literally pat themselves on the back daily for their adhearance to their faith.\n There is no one more morally upright and spiritually connected than they are. They follow their lords dictates to the letter and go to their equevalant of the temple to boast about such...while looking on at the soul next to them in contempt as that person bemoans their failings and struggles with seeking and finding forgiveness.\n Yep, church politics and the secret thoughts and gossip of the followers. It knows no denomination.\n \n If god is dead, he was struck the mortal blow with the sword of hypocracy in his very own house.\n And it was weilded by those who followed in the footsteps of Simon the Zealot.",

Not in the angry little boy who needed a male role model mind you, only in the opportunity to make themselves feel that much holier by condemning a man they didn't even know. Just like you are, right now.\n \n This mentor turned into a great friend and an amazing father. He is dedicated, loyal, honest, loving, and generous. We are united at sporting events, teacher conferences, in expectations and discipline. He has been in a committed relationship for more than twenty years, works with the mentally ill, volunteers several hours a week, and treats everyone with kindness. \n \n You can make all the assumptions about him you want but I KNOW the truth of the matter. You know NOTHING about him. \n \n If this were any other manner of \"sinner\" - one who had been divorced, one who had cheated on his wife, etc. you would not be making such assumptions. Maybe you can convince yourself that you aren't a hateful bigot, but I am on the receiving end and know better. By the way, you just insulted my family again. Coward.\n \n How would you like it if I insulted your daughters or your wife? Would you believe it was honest debate? That my assumptions about people I don't even know are some kind of truth?

All I have ever had to do to stir the venom of these humanists is to dare to share a scriptural value system in debates. Sorry if the truth I share sounds harsh, but nobody ever said the truth doesn't or shouldn't hurt.\n\n \n Get over yourself.

You define the naive, the simple minded and the scoffers who hate correction but love to be accepted for and encouraged as you also encourage those who practice such things. And in your mind, this represents enlightenment and progressive thought. I guess I should heed the warning in Proverbs 9:8 regarding you scoffers since I have received ample hatred for my warnings to you and your ilk. emoticon_confused emoticon_xdonno :xbanghead",

Face it pappi, Man possesses universal morality and values such as basic laws against murder, incest, robbery, assault and rape to name just a few principles which are universal among all people throughout all of time and history. \n \n And you notice I stress \"among humans\"? that's because even though you atheists argue in favor of evolution, animals don't practice or respect the laws of civilization which only exist among the human race. If we truly evolved from the lower animals, we would find some remnant of the laws of the wild carried over to the human species since they would be innate within our DNA. You know, like animals very rarely fight members of their own species to the death for any reason. Even to procreate they simply test each other so the strongest male wins the prize (the female) to continue his progeny. But fight to the death? Rarely, if ever!!!\n \n Only MAN kills MAN in warfare and for greeds sake or for jealousy sake or for numerous untold reasons which are founded in sin but have no origins which can be found in what motivates lower life forms to kill for survival, which is where your side claims we came from via evolution. \n \n And why are these actions considered sins or laws to be broken at all if no universal sense of morality exists at all? Why isn't it ok to just kill anyone who upsets you, or to take any woman you like and have your way with her? What's wrong with that since no laws exist in the animal kingdom where killing or raping is concerned? That killer whale in Fla just got away with murder when he dragged his trainer to the bottom and held her there until she died according to Mans laws, but not the laws of the wild. Had he been a Man, he would be in jail right now awaiting trial for murder. Yet you claim this universal sense of morality just came about accidentally? That we individually inherited it via evolution when no such credo exists in the wild in any of the lower animals which exist around us? Is this more of the so called reasoning you godless intellectuals boast that you possess but we traditional moralists and believers in God lack all semblance of? Once again your reasoning is as deep as a puddle and your common sense is as consistent as the weather. emoticon_rolleyes\n",

   "What shark attack? I'm speaking about the Orca at Seaworld which dragged its trainer to the bottom and drowned her. Are you not familiar with that? It just happened a little over a week ago. \n\n Sorry for the mix-up...no, I didn't know about that. \n I have heard of such things before...an elephant comes to mind....and the ape that tore the face off of a woman.\n \n \nBut we didn't hold the animal responsible for murder because it doesn't understand the concept of right and wrong. It acts on instinct rather than emotion. \n\n \n Um, I have to disagree with you here. Animals are fully capable of displaying emotions. The concept of 'right' and 'wrong' are subjective and human-made. I'd say the whale incident was intentional, as was the case of the elephant trainer and the woman who was attacked by the ape.\n Every day there is someone, somewhere, who is viscously attacked by someone's pet dog...and that dog IS judged by our concept of 'right' and 'wrong' and IS held responsible (sometimes for 'murder) and sentenced to death.\n Of course, we say the poor animal is a danger to society and so we must eliminate them..but we don't hold the same standards for human deviants - them, we give free room and board for life.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAnd do Orca's murder each other out of malice or envy as Man does? Do any male animals in the wild which compete for females in order to extend their progeny kill the competing males or just prove through contests of strength which is stronger and therefore more viral? \n \n Does one pride of Lions attack another pride of lions and fight till the death even though a drought is threatening all of their lives due to a depleted water supply? No, they don't.\n\n I'd have to do some research on this...and it's Friday... so, I'll have to move on...\n \n \nWhat I am saying which you are obviously ignoring is simply this; if man truly evolved from lower animals then the traits which are hard wired into all lower animals would have carried over in us so that even though we would hunt, kill and consume other animals in order to survive, like all other animals, we wouldn't be the only species which kills its own type for reasons well beyond the need to survive or procreate. And yet we are exactly that. THE ONLY CREATURE ON EARTH WHICH KILLS ITS OWN TYPE AS A MATTER OF FACT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN SURVIVAL AND PROCREATION. \n\n \n Well, you're getting into a big can of worms here. :p\n First of all, I actually DO have a problem imagining that humans have evolved from some lower forms of life. We appear to be so different from every other life form on Earth, not just by our aggressiveness and brutality but also in our creative abilities.\n But, that leaves the question: Did we just appear 'as is' at some point in time during the Earths evolution or, are we just really freaks of Nature?\n \n As for the unexplainable brutality and general meanness, it could be caused by fluoride. :p \n Seriously, if you consider this characteristic in the earliest known humans, which I see no reason not to, then it is just a flaw in human nature - we are simply the meanest bunch of mammals on the planet.\n \n \nIf you were intellectually honest at all you would ask yourself why we break all the rules of evolution by no longer following the instinctual values which are hard wired into every single other lower life form on Earth? But you aren't, so you wont. You will just ignore the obvious as you continue to run toward spiritual destruction with your fingers in your ears. \n\n I don't think we do break all the rules of evolution. As a global society, and with our abilities to read and write and reason with each other, I think we have simply invented a way to live that works better than just going by our inherited animal instincts. We all still have them inside, but they've been kept under lock and key for so long that they only appear in the most desperate situations.\n Most of the inmates in prison are there because, in some way in their mind, they were only trying to survive and procreate...in a society which makes it very difficult to do so.\n \n \nHere's a song which describes where we have come from and what we have become due to the willful ignorance which defines so many of us. How does it feel knowing that you are an enemy of all that is good and right in this world?\n http://songoffaith.com/mp3s/Albums/HesAlive/HA_AdamWhereAreYou_DonFrancisco.mp3\n\n Sorry, not in the mood today...but thanks for the thought. \n \n How does it feel knowing that you are an enemy of all that is good and right in this world?\n \n Quite the contrary. I feel pretty good, thank you. emoticon_xgood",

   "Who's this WE you speak of? Are you referring to this homosexual big brother character whom you have apparently invited into your family as a co-parenting figure for your son? Are you so devoid of positive family influences in your family that you needed to bring a stranger into your nuclear family unit as if he is an actual father figure? \n \n Your son's Father? Are you referring to this homosexual big brother figure whom you're not married to, have no personal or blood relation to but apparently have brought into your family as a co-parenting figure even though he has no permanent connection with your son at all? Is this your idea of a father figure? Where's the boys real father and why isn't he involved in his sons life? And doesn't that failed relationship reflect on your judgement and character at all since you saw fit to procreate with him? \n\n \n The man I have been speaking of is his REAL father. Apprently you feel that screwing makes you a parent. It doesn't. When I was young, and frankly not so wise, I fell in love with a man, even married him. Had a baby (due to failed birth control). Same man turned into a cheap, abusive drunk. I threw him out and filed for divorce. My son was three. The reason he is not involved in my son's life is because he chose not to be. He was not a US citizen, went home, never supported or contacted us at all. When my son was five I started to seek a male mentor, like I told you I started with church - they were not interested. The Big Brothers program came through after two years on the waiting list. My son was seven. This man became such a positive and powerful influence in my son's life that my son started calling him \"Dad\" on his own. When he was ten my son's biological father was stripped of his parental rights and my son's mentor adopted my son. He is his LEGAL and REAL father as he has actually bothered to do the job. \n \n It is so tempting to get on here and take cheap shots at your family in return. However, someone taught me better than that.\n \n When you go to your blessed heaven you can tell God all about how you tried to turn me to His love by insulting my family. I am sure Jesus would be impressed. \n \n \nAnd tell me jito, with a mother and father figure who question Gods existence, who is guiding your son toward the true and living God so he can assure his eternal salvation? Oh wait, you don't believe in that stuff which proves my point about the spiritual vacuum which defines your understanding of who and what you actually are in reality.\n\n \n Only people of your faith can be good parents then? Tell me how this doesn't make you a bigot? Actually, you know, it doesn't - it makes you a xenophobe.\n \n \nI never said you instill NO values at all in him. I am saying that because you possess no true soul saving spiritual values which guide your life, you then have none to offer him, and you have proven that in your quote above to EZ.\n\n \n I don't want your values. I don't want my soul saved if it means thinking like you. Acting like you. Treating people the way you treat them. I will not hold my higher power to lower standards than I hold myself.\n \n \nWOW, look who's playing dumb now? You and I participated in many of the same debates over an extended period of time on that forum. If you avoided taking me on directly, you still attacked me as part of the gang like the typical philosophical cowards who trolled over there. \n\n \n Maybe we did. I honestly have no memory of it as I have been on this forum longer and am more active here. I could have sworn you were banned there from pretty much the time I started. \n \n \nWhat you know about me based on my posted opinions is that I am a moral traditionalist who believes that preserving innocence in our children and our society is a good thing. I reject the progressive school of thought which has and continues to tear down the moral fabric of our society and is replacing it with a godless and secular/atheist man centered philosophy.\n\n \n Sounds like you support a theocracy while failing to recognize its secular values that will always ensure your right to worship, live and raise your children as you choose.\n \n \nYou and I are total opposites on the spectrum of moral values and ever time you post an opinion on pretty much every subject you confirm that belief.\n\n \n Yep. \n \n \nOnly in the mind of one who loves spiritual darkness, is telling an eternal truth which leads to salvation considered being a jerk. \n\n \n Only a complete and total imbecile thinks that insulting somebody's family isn't being a jerk.\n \n \nHere's how the bible puts it:.....\n\n \n Don't care.",

Here we have a boy who, for whatever reason, was in some kind of trouble. The church is approached, but appears to be of no real help. Then along comes a man who is regarded by certain members of society (and indeed this forum) to be contemptible.

I'm sure you'll work it out.\n \n Anyway, 'The Truth' that I seem to have stumbled across is this.

Indeed they are also condemning those who would choose to associate with this man of low morals. When in fact, this wretched man, this outcast has shown a far greater morality that you, Archie or Easy, could possibly dream of.\n \n Jito, if you had been trying to fabricate a story to reveal 'The Truth' about the morality of certain members of this forum, then you could not have done a better job of it. I wish you, your son and you 'wretched' friend all the best.\n \n Archie, Easy, you should read this hilly bobble thing. Chris seems to know what he's talking about. You might learn something.",

Yes we do. \n \n Because we have learned to act differently doesn't mean base instincts don't exist. Morality is a result of those instincts being acted upon. Males want an attractive female who we think will want to have sex often. Women don't like being beaten or raped and we see the pain such actions cause those we know that have suffered these things.

You know, the chain of evidence that shows we retain a morality which carried over from our pre-evolved state as members of the lower animal kingdom! In typical fashion you support your rant with no evidence at all as you ignore the fact that the hard wired traits which guide the social structure of the complete animal kingdom exist nowhere in the human social structure. If we truly evolved from within the animal kingdom which evolution states is an absolute fact, then we would surely have retained this most basic innate value system which exists without question in every type of mammal on Earth. Further more, if you question the validity of evolution then you should have no qualms with agreeing with my position. Yet, like an obstinate child, you must disagree on principle since no leftist will ever agree with anything Archangel proffers.\n \n Let's face it, every \"so called\" intellectually superior pacifist will state that Man goes against even the most basic values which are widely practiced in the animal kingdom. Those being that Males don't kill other Males over food, females or territory, they have tests of strength to win the contest of dominance. This proves, according to these same mental giants that Man has somehow devolved into the interspecies murdering narcissists and that animals aren't motivated by the baser human emotions such as greed, jealousy, envy, or the hunger for personal power as Men are. Yet here, when it isn't convenient to admit these obvious differences between Man and Mammals, you attempt to make excuses justify rather than accept the obvious fact that Man was created separately and above animals. This is why discussing anything with you is a waste of time since you will go to any length and redirect the subject toward any direction in order to attempt to defuse the valid point I am making in my argument. \n \n \nAre you blind to the world around you? You must live in a bubble or you show just how out of touch and incapable of recognizing what goes on around you. Maybe since many of us posses a level of intelligence higher than most animals those traits are expressed somewhat differently than in the wild.

We look to treat women better and protect them from the behavior of other males and we don't like other males around our females, like pack animals. Except we call it a double standard.\n\n \n Note the bolded: You love to speak to my ignorance or lack of understanding when it is you who is apparently clueless to the innate instincts which are hard wired into we Human Beings as compared to the lower Mammals of the animal kingdom. I will not allow you to blur the point I am making with your continued efforts to change the subject or to prove it is you who doesn't appreciate the difference between innate instincts and learned behaviors. \n \n So in answer to your question if I am blind to the world around me? The answer is NO, since it is me raising the issue in the first place. But it's becoming painfully apparent that you are blind to the realities of the world around you to have made this incoherent rant which I quoted directly above.\n \n \nMaybe animals value life more than we do.

There has also been research showing ants will leave the nest when sick to protect the nest.\n\n \n This whole paragraph is rife with nonsensical what ifs which have no basis in fact at all. They aren't even theoretically rational, but simply represent your complete ignorance regarding the point I am making and the subject being discussed by me. Why must your side constantly throw out any minutia in the hope of derailing a thought process you can't rationally respond to or choose to oppose simply in order to be the spoiler you always seem to be.\n \n You say, \"Maybe animals value life more than human beings?\" And every other example you pose has absolutely no rational bearing on the truth of my argument that we human beings should have retained the innate instinctual value to never kill our own for the sake of advancing our individual positions in life if evolution was a valid explanation for how we got to who and what we are today as human beings. That is the sole point you should be contending with rather than all of these sideways excuses in order to justify why things are what they are in reality. \n \n You bring insects into this when it is mammals we must compare ourselves to. But you don't care about consistency of argument since you are only interested in opposing my position that if we truly evolved, and over the past 200,000 years or so as evolutionists claim since we allegedly first appeared that recently. Evolution of Modern Humans:X Early Modern Homo sapiens\n \n Just imagine any other animal in the evolutionary theory which evolved so far so fast as the so called homo sapien sapien is believed to have come. The reason for this is simply because scientists must find a way to match up the fossil record with the reality of who and what we are as human beings whom they allege evolved from lower primates. But in typical fashion they must compartmentalize and ignore the inconsistency of the fact that our innate instincts don't jive with where they allege we came from as descendants of the lower primates even though we are so close to the actual evolution process which these pseudo intellectuals claim is a fact. \n \n \nAnd why are these actions considered sins or laws to be broken at all if no universal sense of morality exists at all? Why isn't it ok to just kill anyone who upsets you, or to take any woman you like and have your way with her? What's wrong with that since no laws exist in the animal kingdom where killing or raping is concerned?\n \n [Pappi]As I have explained learned behavior from our instincts, intelligence and emotions are what make us different from animals as well as determine our behavior, social interactions and structure. There was a time when it was ok to kill someone for no reason and taking a woman or girl or man or boy was something that happened or even encouraged at certain points in history.\n \n \n You prove your ignorance of human history with every post. Even the most barbaric civilizations had laws against cold blooded murder, rape and kidnapping. It was enforcement and fair application of those laws which they lacked.\n \n \nThat killer whale in Fla just got away with murder when he dragged his trainer to the bottom and held her there until she died according to Mans laws, but not the laws of the wild. Had he been a Man, he would be in jail right now awaiting trial for murder. Yet you claim this universal sense of morality just came about accidentally?\n \n [Pappi]If a man were kidnapped and put in a cage and made him do tricks and he killed his captors would he be charged with a crime? If there is no law why don't dogs and cats ravage all their owners? Why do the numerous wild animals in captivity or in the wild always end up with an attack. \n \n They are animals who do not posses the same intelligence as we do. Why would you expect an animal to be thrilled about becoming a zoo exhibit, pet or test subject. \n\n \n WOW, you are just full of excuses and apologetics as you deny reality, aren't you! Animals who kill in captivity aren't rebelling against their captors, after all, we were given dominion over all of the Earths creatures by God Himself and have exercised that authority before any high technology existed which allows for their control today. More than two thousand years ago Babylon had wild Lions and every other type of creature under control in dens managed by men. \n Dan 6:16 So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to him, \"May your God, whom you worship continually, rescue you.\"\n Dan 6:17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel from the lions.\n Here are some of the oldest known Zoo's, called menageries. \n Zoos have been around since ancient times. The first zoos were call menageries. One of the first menageries was the Garden of Intelligence in China, around 1000 B.C. (3000 years ago) King Solomon was said to keep exotic animals, and King Nebuchadnezzar had a large menagerie in Babylon. Even Alexander the Great send back animals from regions he conquered to be put into menageries. Zoo Coupons and Deals | 1ZooCoupon.com This reference makes clear that the very first and earliest examples of man keeping wild animals in captivity is unknown as it is lost to the annals of history. \n \n Also, How long has Man been hunting whales? According to this source, since prehistoric times. History of whaling - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nNice job on putting together and expressing your views here. Based on your statements I would suggest stay away from are you smarter than a 5th grader and the outdoors. Who knows what those crazy immoral animals may do and the 5th graders would just embarrass you. emoticon_smile\n\n \n Nice attempt at condescension and the typical arrogance of the uninformed as you obfuscate and ignore the realities of my argument in favor of mockery which is founded in a complete lack of understanding. emoticon_xgood",

   "What a load of bogus and incoherent drivel which is offered as a response to this point I made in my first paragraph: go ahead and show evidence to the contrary. You know, the chain of evidence that shows we retain a morality which carried over from our pre-evolved state as members of the lower animal kingdom!\n\n \n Funny, I ask you to prove that morality is given by God and that had he not done so man would lack any moral values. Your response ask me to prove morals come from man. I will keep waiting for you to offer something intelligent on the God given gift of morality.\n \n \nIn typical fashion you support your rant with no evidence at all as you ignore the fact that the hard wired traits which guide the social structure of the complete animal kingdom exist nowhere in the human social structure. If we truly evolved from within the animal kingdom which evolution states is an absolute fact, then we would surely have retained this most basic innate value system which exists without question in every type of mammal on Earth. Further more, if you question the validity of evolution then you should have no qualms with agreeing with my position. Yet, like an obstinate child, you must disagree on principle since no leftist will ever agree with anything Archangel proffers.\n\n \n Traits thought to belong to man alone also found in animals\n So you think humans are unique? - life - 21 May 2008 - New Scientist\n \n \n \nLet's face it, every so called superior intellectual pacifist will state that Man goes against even the most basic values which are widely practiced in the animal kingdom. Those being that Males don't kill other Males over food, females or territory, they have tests of strength to win the contest of dominance. This proves, according to these same mental giants that animals aren't motivated by the baser human emotions such as greed, jealousy, envy, the hunger for personal power. Yet here, when it isn't convenient to admit these obvious differences between Man and Mammals, you attempt to make excuses justify rather than accept the obvious. This is why discussing anything with you is a waste of time since you will go to any length and redirect the subject toward any direction in order to attempt to defuse the valid point I am making in my argument.\n\n \n You shifted the argument, I followed. \n \n Your description is more fitting to your style of debate. I agree though I should not have responded when you changed the focus and should have returned back to having you support your claim of God given morality\n \n \nNote the bolded: You love to speak to my ignorance or lack of understanding when it is you who is apparently clueless to the innate instincts which are hard wired into we Human Beings as compared to the lower Mammals of the animal kingdom. I will not allow you to blur the point I am making with your continued efforts to change the subject or to prove it is you who doesn't appreciate the difference between innate instincts and learned behaviors.\n \n \n OK what is your point? That we differ from other animals? That we have more complex social structures? No kidding. \n \n What that one is God given and the other God permitted? What is the difference between the to in your mind?\n \n Your trying hard to avoid showing that God is the sole reason man has morals. \n \n \nSo in answer to your question if I am blind to the world around me? The answer is NO, since it is me raising the issue in the first place. But it's becoming painfully apparent that you are blind to the realities of the world around you to have made this incoherent rant which I quoted directly above.\n\n \n Which realities would that be? \n \n \nThis whole paragraph is rife with nonsensical what ifs which have no basis in fact at all. They aren't even theoretically rational, but simply represent your complete ignorance regarding the point I am making and the subject being discussed by me. Why must your side constantly throw out any minutia in the hope of derailing a thought process you can't rationally respond to or choose to oppose simply in order to be the spoiler you always seem to be.\n \n You say, \"Maybe animals value life more than human beings?\" And every other example you pose has absolutely no rational bearing on the truth of my argument that we human beings should have retained the innate instinctual value to never kill our own for the sake of advancing our individual positions in life if evolution was a valid explanation for how we got to who and what we are today as human beings. That is the sole point you should be contending with rather than all of these sideways excuses in order to justify why things are what they are in reality. \n\n \n I am responding to your ridiculous contentions. If you want to stay focused on something specific then don't drift and I won't respond. \n \n To retain the exact same anything is the opposite of evolution. If we were no different than we were 25,000 years ago then there would be no evolution, huh. \n \n You might even have some evidence that God existed with that. Since God would have given us our moral values and there should be no need for them to be any different. So why are they not the same everywhere, always. Why are we not born knowing not to hit someone who displeases us? Or to take something from someone because we want it?\n \n \n \nYou bring insects into this when it is mammals we must compare ourselves to. But you don't care about consistency of argument since you are only interested in opposing my position that if we truly evolved, and over the past 100,000 years or so as evolutionists claim since we allegedly first appeared that recently. Evolution of Modern Humans:X Early Modern Homo sapiens\n\n \n I brought up insects in response to your claim that only humans commit acts or war and conquest. War is defined by numbers. 4 people fighting over something isn't a war. 100,000 fighting over the same thing is. \n \n So how do we get morality only exists by virtue of God by comparing the behavior of mammals to humans?\n \n \nJust imagine any other animal in the evolutionary theory which evolved so far so fast as the so called homo sapien sapien is believed to have come. The reason for this is simply because scientists must find a way to match up the fossil record with the reality of who and what we are as human beings whom they allege evolved from lower primates.\n\n \n Yep, that is the only reason. It's the anti-God agenda of secular humanist darwin evolutionists. This is coming from someone who cries the blues about people unwilling to look at the evidence for everything you attribute to God. \n \n Let's see evolution or made from dirt. When you look at skin under a powerful microscope do you see dust or cells similar to those found in most living animals. I am going to lean towards evolution on this one. \n \n But we are drifting let's get back to you showing how morality exists in man only because of God.\n \n \nBut in typical fashion they must compartmentalize and ignore the inconsistency of the fact that our innate instincts don't jive with where they allege we came from as descendants of the lower primates even though we are so close to the actual evolution process which these pseudo intellectuals claim is a fact. \n\n \n Your saying we should act the same as we did 50,000 years ago and that would support evolution. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nYou prove your ignorance of human history with every post. Even the most barbaric civilizations had laws against cold blooded murder, rape and kidnapping. It was enforcement and fair application of those laws which they lacked.\n\n \n How about before civilization? Or did we go from dust to cities? These things had to happen frequently enough to be understood as something that should not happen long before enforcement and fairness became guess what something that needed to happen frequently enough to be understood they were a problem that needed to be dealt with. \n \n This is explained further below and you are being really short sighted here. Only seeing what you want to see.\n \n \n \nWOW, you are just full of excuses and apologetics as you deny reality, aren't you! Animals who kill in captivity aren't rebelling against their captors, after all, we were given dominion over all of the Earths creatures by God Himself and have exercised that authority before any high technology existed which allows for their control today. More than two thousand years ago Babylon had wild Lions and every other type of creature under control in dens managed by men.\n \n \n What are they doing? Playing?\n \n If we have dominion why can't we just say \"sit\" or \"stay\" and they obey?\n Why do animals in the wild attack their masters? Why do we need controls and cages if God commanded us to have dominion over them?\n \n Do you see how absurd your statement is and what does that have to do with with God given morality?\n \n \n \nDan 6:16 So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions.

It isn't a true representation of social development and interactions of man and animals. You do this because your belief in God prohibits you from accepting anything that may question your faith.\n \n So you showed nothing valid.\n \n \nYou see pappi, I was showing an inconsistency in evolutionary theory from a social perspective which common sense tells us that morality therefore came from God because we didn't get it through evolution.\n \n \n If common sense was involved you wouldn't have reached this as an answer. Morality is learned behavior. Evolution gives us the ability to reason and learn and draw logical rational understanding from real and conceptual experience which allows for us to grasp the significance and benefit of moral actions. \n \n Even if God made us from dirt your premise is still flawed. If God instilled in us a sense of right and wrong it would be present from birth to death and from Adam until the last person was born, but it isn't. Children must be taught, prehistoric man wasn't averse to acts we consider immoral today. Morality isn't consistent even today everywhere in the world. \n \n \nI realize that requires some common sense deduction which is why you can't grasp the concepts i've shared with you. Thus, I am wasting my time trying and don't feel like going around in circles with someone who is dense to the point of rational nullification. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n If you were smart you would have said God instilled in us the ability to develop morality or the evolution of morality is a guage used by God to judge where we are on the path towards Heaven, but you didn't. You and many like you by insisting that you know God's plan and you know what God's intentions are make God out to be not very smart. You further chase people away when your adamant about something that can be explained as being the result of some other cause or else or can be shown to not be a possible reason. It's like saying a banana is pink or rain is the tears of Angels. \n \n Maybe God is smarter than you think and maybe the Bible doesn't have all the answers and maybe God is waiting for man to stop placing obstacles in front of himself and grow up and reach his potential.\n \n You could be right though, maybe God wants us to wallow in self pity doing all we can to make sure he knows how wonderful we think he is.

   "Here you go, have at it...\n \n \nProve that morality didn't come from our Creator Father who made us in His image; go ahead and show evidence to the contrary. You know, the chain of evidence that shows we retain a morality which carried over from our pre-evolved state as members of the lower animal kingdom! Face it pappi, Man possesses universal morality and values such as basic laws against murder, incest, robbery, assault and rape to name just a few principles which are universal among all people throughout all of time and history. \n \n And you notice I stress \"among humans\"? that's because even though you atheists argue in favor of evolution, animals don't practice or respect the laws of civilization which only exist among the human race. If we truly evolved from the lower animals, we would find some remnant of the laws of the wild carried over to the human species since they would be innate within our DNA. You know, like animals very rarely fight members of their own species to the death for any reason. Even to procreate they simply test each other so the strongest male wins the prize (the female) to continue his progeny. But fight to the death? Rarely, if ever!!!\n \n Only MAN kills MAN in warfare and for greeds sake or for jealousy sake or for numerous untold reasons which are founded in sin but have no origins which can be found in what motivates lower life forms to kill for survival, which is where your side claims we came from via evolution. \n \n And why are these actions considered sins or laws to be broken at all if no universal sense of morality exists at all? Why isn't it ok to just kill anyone who upsets you, or to take any woman you like and have your way with her? What's wrong with that since no laws exist in the animal kingdom where killing or raping is concerned? That killer whale in Fla just got away with murder when he dragged his trainer to the bottom and held her there until she died according to Mans laws, but not the laws of the wild. Had he been a Man, he would be in jail right now awaiting trial for murder. Yet you claim this universal sense of morality just came about accidentally? That we individually inherited it via evolution when no such credo exists in the wild in any of the lower animals which exist around us? Is this more of the so called reasoning you godless intellectuals boast that you possess but we traditional moralists and believers in God lack all semblance of? Once again your reasoning is as deep as a puddle and your common sense is as consistent as the weather. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nWhat shark attack? I'm speaking about the Orca at Seaworld which dragged its trainer to the bottom and drowned her. Are you not familiar with that? It just happened a little over a week ago. But we didn't hold the animal responsible for murder because it doesn't understand the concept of right and wrong. It acts on instinct rather than emotion. And do Orca's murder each other out of malice or envy as Man does? Do any male animals in the wild which compete for females in order to extend their progeny kill the competing males or just prove through contests of strength which is stronger and therefore more viral? \n \n Does one pride of Lions attack another pride of lions and fight till the death even though a drought is threatening all of their lives due to a depleted water supply? No, they don't. What I am saying which you are obviously ignoring is simply this; if man truly evolved from lower animals then the traits which are hard wired into all lower animals would have carried over in us so that even though we would hunt, kill and consume other animals in order to survive, like all other animals, we wouldn't be the only species which kills its own type for reasons well beyond the need to survive or procreate. And yet we are exactly that. THE ONLY CREATURE ON EARTH WHICH KILLS ITS OWN TYPE AS A MATTER OF FACT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN SURVIVAL AND PROCREATION. \n \n If you were intellectually honest at all you would ask yourself why we break all the rules of evolution by no longer following the instinctual values which are hard wired into every single other lower life form on Earth? But you aren't, so you wont. You will just ignore the obvious as you continue to run toward spiritual destruction with your fingers in your ears. \n \n Here's a song which describes where we have come from and what we have become due to the willful ignorance which defines so many of us. How does it feel knowing that you are an enemy of all that is good and right in this world?\n http://songoffaith.com/mp3s/Albums/HesAlive/HA_AdamWhereAreYou_DonFrancisco.mp3\n\n \n \nWhat a load of bogus and incoherent drivel which is offered as a response to this point I made in my first paragraph: go ahead and show evidence to the contrary. You know, the chain of evidence that shows we retain a morality which carried over from our pre-evolved state as members of the lower animal kingdom! In typical fashion you support your rant with no evidence at all as you ignore the fact that the hard wired traits which guide the social structure of the complete animal kingdom exist nowhere in the human social structure. If we truly evolved from within the animal kingdom which evolution states is an absolute fact, then we would surely have retained this most basic innate value system which exists without question in every type of mammal on Earth. Further more, if you question the validity of evolution then you should have no qualms with agreeing with my position. Yet, like an obstinate child, you must disagree on principle since no leftist will ever agree with anything Archangel proffers.\n \n Let's face it, every \"so called\" intellectually superior pacifist will state that Man goes against even the most basic values which are widely practiced in the animal kingdom. Those being that Males don't kill other Males over food, females or territory, they have tests of strength to win the contest of dominance. This proves, according to these same mental giants that Man has somehow devolved into the interspecies murdering narcissists and that animals aren't motivated by the baser human emotions such as greed, jealousy, envy, or the hunger for personal power as Men are. Yet here, when it isn't convenient to admit these obvious differences between Man and Mammals, you attempt to make excuses justify rather than accept the obvious fact that Man was created separately and above animals. This is why discussing anything with you is a waste of time since you will go to any length and redirect the subject toward any direction in order to attempt to defuse the valid point I am making in my argument. \n \n \n \n Note the bolded: You love to speak to my ignorance or lack of understanding when it is you who is apparently clueless to the innate instincts which are hard wired into we Human Beings as compared to the lower Mammals of the animal kingdom. I will not allow you to blur the point I am making with your continued efforts to change the subject or to prove it is you who doesn't appreciate the difference between innate instincts and learned behaviors. \n \n So in answer to your question if I am blind to the world around me? The answer is NO, since it is me raising the issue in the first place. But it's becoming painfully apparent that you are blind to the realities of the world around you to have made this incoherent rant which I quoted directly above.\n \n \n \n This whole paragraph is rife with nonsensical what ifs which have no basis in fact at all. They aren't even theoretically rational, but simply represent your complete ignorance regarding the point I am making and the subject being discussed by me. Why must your side constantly throw out any minutia in the hope of derailing a thought process you can't rationally respond to or choose to oppose simply in order to be the spoiler you always seem to be.\n \n You say, \"Maybe animals value life more than human beings?\" And every other example you pose has absolutely no rational bearing on the truth of my argument that we human beings should have retained the innate instinctual value to never kill our own for the sake of advancing our individual positions in life if evolution was a valid explanation for how we got to who and what we are today as human beings. That is the sole point you should be contending with rather than all of these sideways excuses in order to justify why things are what they are in reality. \n \n You bring insects into this when it is mammals we must compare ourselves to. But you don't care about consistency of argument since you are only interested in opposing my position that if we truly evolved, and over the past 200,000 years or so as evolutionists claim since we allegedly first appeared that recently. Evolution of Modern Humans:X Early Modern Homo sapiens\n \n Just imagine any other animal in the evolutionary theory which evolved so far so fast as the so called homo sapien sapien is believed to have come. The reason for this is simply because scientists must find a way to match up the fossil record with the reality of who and what we are as human beings whom they allege evolved from lower primates. But in typical fashion they must compartmentalize and ignore the inconsistency of the fact that our innate instincts don't jive with where they allege we came from as descendants of the lower primates even though we are so close to the actual evolution process which these pseudo intellectuals claim is a fact. \n \n \n \n You prove your ignorance of human history with every post. Even the most barbaric civilizations had laws against cold blooded murder, rape and kidnapping. It was enforcement and fair application of those laws which they lacked.\n \n \n \n WOW, you are just full of excuses and apologetics as you deny reality, aren't you! Animals who kill in captivity aren't rebelling against their captors, after all, we were given dominion over all of the Earths creatures by God Himself and have exercised that authority before any high technology existed which allows for their control today. More than two thousand years ago Babylon had wild Lions and every other type of creature under control in dens managed by men. \n Dan 6:16 So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to him, \"May your God, whom you worship continually, rescue you.\"\n Dan 6:17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel from the lions.\n Here are some of the oldest known Zoo's, called menageries. \n Zoos have been around since ancient times. The first zoos were call menageries. One of the first menageries was the Garden of Intelligence in China, around 1000 B.C. (3000 years ago) King Solomon was said to keep exotic animals, and King Nebuchadnezzar had a large menagerie in Babylon. Even Alexander the Great send back animals from regions he conquered to be put into menageries. Zoo Coupons and Deals | 1ZooCoupon.com This reference makes clear that the very first and earliest examples of man keeping wild animals in captivity is unknown as it is lost to the annals of history. \n \n Also, How long has Man been hunting whales? According to this source, since prehistoric times. History of whaling - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \n Nice attempt at condescension and the typical arrogance of the uninformed as you obfuscate and ignore the realities of my argument in favor of mockery which is founded in a complete lack of understanding. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \nLet me make this real simple for you since anything deeper seems to befuddle your simple mind. Sure, you repeatedly asked me to support my claim that morality comes from God after I repeatedly showed that the other popular secular explanation for mans being here; evolution, doesn't explain why we have abandoned the hard wired values imbedded into the animal kingdom of not killing each other for dominance. \n \n You see pappi, I was showing an inconsistency in evolutionary theory from a social perspective which common sense tells us that morality therefore came from God because we didn't get it through evolution. I realize that requires some common sense deduction which is why you can't grasp the concepts i've shared with you. Thus, I am wasting my time trying and don't feel like going around in circles with someone who is dense to the point of rational nullification. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \nMorality is God given because we were created in His image and have always had a sense of right and wrong which was expressed by creating laws against the same offenses even though we have discovered records from every corner of the Earth where civilizations had no contact with each other. Yet their moral laws were consistently the same. \n \n It is also a fact that we don't reflect the natural inclinations of the complete animal kingdom of not killing our own species for dominance but fall short of that drastic measure, so we don't embody the character traits of animals that have evolved or retained those characteristics which would prove and support the evolutionists theory that we did actually evolve from the lower animals. \n \n We are a unique creation and have had a unique history to the animal kingdom. We, unlike all animals on Earth have fallen from grace and are able to sin against ourselves and our Creator.\n",

   "Where does it say that in the Bible and where does it say at what point they are no longer safe?\n\n   The \"Age of Accountability\"\n The term \"age of accountability\" is not used in the Bible. Nevertheless, the doctrine of an age or a time when men become accountable for their actions is clearly taught in the Bible. What is meant by this term is that children cannot be accountable for their actions until they have a knowledge of good and evil, until they know to refuse the evil and choose the good.\n We know that children are not sinners at birth; for if they were, there could be no such thing as an \"age of accountability.\" If babies are guilty and condemned for the sin of Adam from birth, then there is no room for them to reach a certain age before they become accountable. They are guilty and under God's wrath from birth. However, the Bible teaches that babies do not inherit sin and guilt from Adam. \"For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil...\" Rom. 9:11. Jacob and Esau had no original sin; they did not sin with Adam when he transgressed. We know this because they were not sinners while in the womb of their mother, Rebecca. Since the Bible says they had done nothing good or evil up to this time, we must assume that they became moral agents at some later time, after they were born. There are numerous verses like this in the Bible which show the doctrine of original sin to be false, and which also teach, either directly or indirectly, the doctrine of an \"age of accountability.\" Let us look at some of them:\n \n Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. Deut. 1:39\n \n For before the children shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. Isaiah 7:16\n \n I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. Gen. 8:21\n \n Deut. 1:39 speaks of the \"little ones\" and the \"children\" who \"in that day had no knowledge between good and evil.\" Isaiah 7:16 speaks of a child coming to an age when he knows to \"refuse the evil, and choose the good.\" Both of these texts speak of children coming to a time in their lives when they have a knowledge of the moral character of their actions and know there is evil which they ought to refuse and good which they ought to choose. Neither of these verses gives a certain age at which moral agency begins. This is because there is no fixed age at which children become accountable, since reason will develop earlier in one child than another according to his gifts and circumstances. But when a child's reason has developed to the point that he knows to \"refuse the evil and choose the good,\" he becomes a moral agent and is accountable for his deeds.\n \n This possession of moral knowledge or understanding is absolutely necessary before there can be accountability. A child must know the moral character of his actions before he can be responsible for them.\n \n Some advocates of original sin have objected that the government of God would be unjust if children were made accountable for their actions at a tender age when they would not be able easily to withstand temptation. They have used this objection as an excuse for maintaining the doctrine of original sin. This kind of logic is absurd. For, according to the doctrine of original sin, children are guilty and under the wrath of God from birth, without any probation. It is hard to understand how the advocates of original sin can swallow whole the injustice of being born in a state of guilt and condemnation, and yet quibble over the supposed injustice of becoming accountable at a tender age. This amounts to swallowing a camel and straining at a gnat.\n \n With God, there can be no such thing as a \"tender age\" in the sense of an unjust age at which children become responsible. God alone knows and is the judge of when a child reaches the \"age of accountability.\" He alone knows the thoughts and the intentions of the heart. And, knowing that God is just, we know that God will not work unrighteousness in this respect. \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" Gen. 18:25. Those who make this objection seem to feel that God cannot be trusted with what is unknown to us. But he can be trusted. God is just in all his judgments. The accountability or non-accountability of every child is perfectly known to God. He \"searches the reins and hearts\" of all men. He discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart.\" He will bring to light the \"hidden things of darkness\" and judge the \"secrets of men\" in truth and righteousness.\n \n The advocates of original sin need not fear that God will unjustly make children accountable at too early an age. He can be trusted to judge righteously with the hidden things of the heart. Truth, justice, and equity are the foundations of his throne.

So, imo, No, he did not have a choice other than the one he made in the beginning.\n\n \n I wrote this for a forum on Beliefnet, thought I would repost it: It is part 2 of 3, the first being the torture before the cross.\n \n Some excerpts from the March 1989 issue of The Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association. Esd\n \n Jesus is on His knees, supported between two Roman soldiers, each holding one of Christ's arms outwards from the side to keep him from falling forward, but also at the same time to keep them away from His mangled body. His head is bowed and lines of blood roll down his forehead and off His nose and cheeks from the crown of thorns pressed down firmly upon his head. The taste of blood is bitter in His mouth. He is in shock, and now passing between consciousness and unconsciousness as the minutes tick by.\n \n A screaming pain is rampant up and down his back, which is now draped with a mocking purple robe thrown over Him by jeering Roman soldiers, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" The pain in His legs is only rivaled by the equally screaming pain down his chest from the flagellum. The soldiers are busy preparing the crosspiece, or patibulum, and will tie it across Christ's shoulders with rope. The patibulum weights approximately 110 lbs. It will take all of Christ's remaining strength to haul this weight on His final staggering walk up to Golgotha.\n \n The Fortress Antonia is approximately 650 yards from the place of crucifixion, known as The Place of A Skull, approximately one third of a mile on a gradually rising slope. Whether He can make it is the last thing on Jesus' mind, all he wants to do is make it through the next 60 seconds, taking His life, and each gasping breath, one minute at a time. Then the crosspiece is hoisted onto His shoulders, tied in place, and the two soldiers pull Him to his feet. A wave of nausea, dizziness, and vertigo nearly overcome Him as he tries to get his bearings. The heavy patibulum is nearly overwhelming, but Christ manages to finally put one foot forward and begin.\n \n But only a few precarious steps into the passage, Christ collapses. The trauma from the combination of flogging, thirst, blood loss, and a sleepless night, is simply more than He can bear. With His arms tied to the patibulum, Christ cannot break His fall, and he falls forward to land squarely upon His chest, managing to turn His head back at the last moment just enough to protect His face. (This fall causes additional trauma to an already stressed heart and many scholars agree that this is one of the reasons for the quickness that death came to Him after he was hung on the cross.)\n \n The Centurion looks into the crowd and spies a stout Cyrenian, later identified as Simon. He orders the soldiers to cut the patibulum off Christ's shoulders and place it on Simon. Barely able to feel the weight being removed, Christ looks up, sees His benefactor, and manages a imperceptible nod.\n \n \"Get Him up!\", the Centurion screams to the soldiers, \"We don't have all day!\" The soldiers grab Him under the armpits and lift Him to His feet. Free of the heavy cross-piece, He now manages to make progress towards the grim upright he sees at the top the hill.\n \n After what seems like ages, He is finally there. The crosspiece is taken from Simon and laid out on the ground, the purple robe, now adhering to the drying blood on His back is ripped off and Christ nearly faints with agony at the pain as the torn flesh begins bleeding anew. He is turned and pulled backwards onto the patibulum, the executioner places the nail in the hollow of the bones just at the back of the wrist and drives it in. At this point in time, Christ has little feeling left in his extremities as He is so far gone into shock. The remaining of His coverings are removed so he is completely naked. The other wrist is then secured to the crosspiece and it is hoisted and dropped into the groove at the top of the horizontal support.\n \n When this happens, Christ is suddenly hyperinflated, that is, he has inhaled, but cannot exhale. He begins gasping for a breath he cannot take. The soldiers then take one of His feet, lift it up enough to bend the knees outward several inches, and hold it against the upright. They then place the sole of the other foot across the first and drive a single nail through both and into the upright.\n \n Although the pain is excruciating, Christ manages to begin pushing himself upright using the nail in his feet and finally manages to breathe. He manages to stay in this position for a minute or two taking staggering breaths, but finally must ease the pain on his feet.\n \n Each respiratory cycle requires that Jesus lift himself on the cross, exhale and gently let himself down as he inhaled. His back, laid bare from the scourging, each cycle of breathing necessitates that he rub his back against the upright and agonize as the raw flesh is further macerated. Each time he takes a breath, his leg muscles quiver as his feet push against the spike. Each time he seeks relief by resting his legs, the spikes in his wrists spit fire into the stretched and lacerated median nerve. There is no relief.....\n \n A sign is hung on the upright identifying Christ: Jesus of Nazareth, The King of the Jews. \n \n Physiological changes are going on within His human body: Although it is an agonizing and frightful way to die (if the victim is conscious), it is, nonetheless, a quiet death. The victims do not scream because they simply do not have the strength and breath to do so. Often, they do not even so much as whisper because all of their efforts are directed at saving that precious breath of air. The usual means of death on the cross was by exhaustion and asphyxiation. That was its design. Jesus did not die that way. We can be sure of it. The Bible provides the details necessary for us to make this conclusion.\n \n Meanwhile, the Romans soldiers begin casting lots for Christ's coverings....John 19:24.\n \n Psalms 22: 7 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads: 8 \"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.\" 9 Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. 10 From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God. 11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. 12 Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. 13 Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me. 14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death. 16 Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet. 17 I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. 18 They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.\n \n In Luke 23:46 we read: \"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit, and, having said this, he gave up the spirit.\"\n \n Matthew 27:50 and Mark 15:37 repeat the part about Jesus' crying with a loud voice and then suddenly giving up the spirit. If Jesus had died of exhaustion and asphyxiation, then he would not have had the air in his lungs to have cried out with a loud voice saying, \"Father into thy hands I commend my spirit . . . \" Then Jesus breathed His last.\n \n The scriptures indicate that something happened suddenly causing Jesus to cry out in pain and then suddenly die. That is not the picture of death by exhaustion and asphyxiation. Now, we must honestly ask ourselves, could Jesus have faked it at this point? Absolutely not! By its very design the crucifixion would have prevented this.\n \n If Jesus had intentionally tried to pretend death, then he would have had to breathe without anyone in the crowd noticing it, an impossible feat considering that each breath required the victim to lift himself on the cross so he could exhale and then inhale fresh air. Everyone would have seen this - in particular, the soldiers who were trained executioners.\n \n If Jesus had simply swooned, as some insist, then he would have died anyway because he would not have been able to lift himself to breathe. That was the design of the crucifixion process. That was the purpose of breaking the legs of the victims who were not already dead. Once their legs were broken, they could not lift themselves on the cross to breathe. Then death would ensue quickly.\n \n The final proof, however, of Jesus' death was the \"coup de grace\" of the sword in his side. This was the soldier's surety of the victim's death, a trained maneuver to lay to rest the question of a live victim.\n \n John 19:35 says, \"And he that saw it bore witness, and his witness is true; and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\" You can almost sense John's efforts to convince the reader that what he was writing was the truth. Ordinarily when a dead man is cut, no blood flows. John and the rest of us know that. That is probably why he insisted that his witness of the event was true. But, it is also why this bit of evidence is doubly important. Since no one present at the crucifixion knew the significance of the blood and water, and indeed, it appeared to be even contrary to the expected norm, we can be assured that this account was not fabricated, but was simply an honest rendering of the crucifixion events.\n \n If indeed a rupture of the free wall of the left ventricular myocardium occurred (as I believe it did), then there would certainly be cause for sudden death with rapid development of cardiac tamponade. Ordinarily, there is approximately 30 cc of clear fluid in the pericardial cavity. However, due to the stress of the terminal events of the crucifixion (with congestive heart failure and decreased venous return to the heart resulting from hypovolemia and hyperinflation of the lungs), there could have been 100 cc or more of pericardial fluid present. Rupture of the free wall of the ventricle would have added another 200 or 300 cc of blood before tamponade would have effectively produced cardiac standstill. This blood would probably be noncoagulating and with the demise of the victim there would be some settling of the cellular components to the bottom of the pericardial cavity. (There certainly could be some clotting, also which would likewise contribute to the separation of red blood cells and \"clear fluid.\")\n \n At this point, the Roman soldiers are coming to check on the status of the three crucifixion victims and find that Jesus is already dead. Reacting in true military form, the \"coup de grace\" thrust of the sword is aimed at the heart. As soon as it pierces the pericardium, the pressurized contents gushed forth. The blood, which is on the bottom comes first, followed by the clear \"water\" on the top.\n \n That is exactly the way the Bible says it happened.\n \n The following quote from Friedberg's Diseases of the Heart helps us to understand this type of injury better. A frequent cause of nonpenetrating cardiac injury is the well-publicized steering-wheel accident. The driver's chest is pinned against the steering wheel when the forward momentum of the car is suddenly arrested. Severe cardiac injury or rupture of the heart often follows crushing chest accidents when an auto, train or other vehicle runs over the prostrate body... Direct blows to the anterior chest wall by a baseball, golf or tennis ball traveling at high speed, by heavy falling or swinging objects which strike at great velocity, fist blows and kicks by a horse or other powerful animal and compression of the chest between two moving objects are among the causes of nonpenetrating cardiac trauma. . . Serious contusions and even rupture of the heart often occurs without significant visible external injury of the chest wall and without fracture of the chest wall and without fracture of the ribs. In fact, in a series of 250 nonpenetrating chest injuries by Arenberg, the greater cardiac damage occurred among the cases without rib fracture.\n \n That is particularly important since we know that Jesus had no broken bones (John 19:36).\n \n There seems to be no reasonable doubt that the fall could cause significant myocardial injury and even rupture. It also seems to be reasonably certain that should there have been such an injury, which predisposed to myocardial rupture, that the tremendous workload of the crucifixion process would have increased the likelihood of such a catastrophic event taking place. The remaining question seems to be, would it have occurred so soon? So, the question of Pilate (Mark 15:43-45) as to why Jesus was so soon dead demonstrates the reliability of the Bible, not only as an important source of facts, but also an important source of probing questions which lead us to the truth.\n \n In summary, Jesus likely was unable to carry his cross because of his cruel treatment and scourging. He then fell with the 100+ pound crosspiece on his back and was unable to break the fall because his outstretched hands were tied to the crosspiece. This resulted in blunt chest trauma and a contused heart. On the cross the workload of the heart was greatly increased due to multiple factors, but primarily the increased effort necessary to breathe. This resulted in a rupture of the free wall of the heart, which caused Jesus to cry out in a loud voice and suddenly die. This cause of death is confirmed for us by the sword pierce to the side, which resulted in the flow of blood and water. In effect, that was a brief and legitimate postmortem exam.......\n \n And thus, we can say that Christ truly died of a broken heart....\n \n \n \n \n \n \"See from His head, His hands, His feet.\n \n Sorrow and love flow mingled down.\n \n Did 'ere such love and sorrow meet.\n \n Or thorns compose so rich a crown.\"\n \n \n \n So now, His head bowed, having given His final breath and made His empowering atonement, Jesus Christ has finished the great plan set in motion by His Father when His first creation succumbed to Satan's way instead of God's own. Christ, an innocent man without sin, has made it possible for sinful man, through an accepting grace, to be reconciled once more with the Father. Satan has been shown the vision of his final consignment to the flames.\n \n But sundown is rapidly approaching..... (next, The Empty Tomb)",

She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.\n Rev 18:3 \"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.\"\n Rev 18:4 I heard another voice from heaven, saying, \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;\n Rev 18:5 for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.\n Rev 18:6 \"Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.\n Rev 18:7 \"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, 'I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.'\n Rev 18:8 \"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.\n Rev 18:9 \"And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,\n Rev 18:10 standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'\n Rev 18:11 \"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more&#8212;\n Rev 18:12 cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,\n Rev 18:13 and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.\n Rev 18:14 \"The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them.\n Rev 18:15 \"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,\n Rev 18:16 saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;\n Rev 18:17 for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,\n Rev 18:18 and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city is like the great city?'\n Rev 18:19 \"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!'\n Rev 18:20 \"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.\"\n Rev 18:21 Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, \"So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.\n Rev 18:22 \"And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;\n Rev 18:23 and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.\n Rev 18:24 \"And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.\"\n \n Now go on and mock and scoff at the future which faces this country jito, but I promise you that if you survive the initial conflagration which is coming, your blood will run cold when you finally realize how wrong you have been and that you wasted your life denying the complete spiritual part of your humanity. :xbanghead",

   "I'm serious here..... It seems to me that anyone with any abstract criticism or analytical mindset towards matters of faith including their own, have a more firm grip on their actual faith than by those who just go blindly along defending it....\n\n \n Yup, glad someone else has noticed this strange phenomenon! \n \n \nMany of us feel that our faith has been stolen, & it's time to take it back ... How did the faith of Jesus come to be known as pro-rich, pro-war, & only pro-American? \n Jim Wallis, God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong & the Left Doesn't Get It\n\n \n I believe the entanglement of Religion & State has done way more harm than good. Case in point? The last 50 or 60 years. When did our State Religion become (gangster) Capitalism? \n \n When did the marketing of fear become so darn lucrative? When did the politicians, preachers, talk show hosts, etc. become 'fear brokers'? \n \n I think you have to ask yourself, \"Is it working?\" Does fear motivate or does it paralyze? Has it resulted in \"United We Stand\" or \"Divided We Fall\"? Americans seem to be more afraid of each other however you want to group them. & what are its effects on other areas of life, such as education, the art & freedom of scientific inquiry, care for the environment & the tolerance & practice of religion? \n \n Are we becoming silent about the things that matter most to the heart of this country? When does it stop? Where? How? \n \n Is it working? \n \n \nWhy is it that those who draw so much upon their faith and flying blind so to speak, are the most vocal and seemingly absolute in their mindset and less apt to change, than those who take a look at their faith and question certain points, or issues?\n\n \n Even though this is from a pretty old book, I think it still has merit when it comes to the analysis of the process of change:\n \n \nIn 1898, Andrew Dickson White (1832-1918), a professor and co-founder of Cornell University, wrote a rather notorious book called \"A History of the Warfare of Science With Theology in Christendom.\"  He tracked many religiously-based conflicts, and showed that they often take decades or even centuries to resolve. Although his book exhibits a heavy -- sometimes vicious -- bias and opposition against religion, he did notice a pattern in these conflicts: they often go through eight stages before being finally resolved: \n [*]Some individual or group will propose a new belief system that is in conflict with established religious beliefs. The official religious institutions generally ignore this. [*]A growing number of people will start to disagree with church teaching. [*]Churches issue statements which condemn the proposal, citing Biblical passages as justification for their stance. [*]Support for the proposal continues to grow among the public. [*]Churches issue statement pointing out that belief in the proposal negates the entire Christian message, or attacks a fundamental Christian principle. [*]Public support continues to grow. [*]Churches begin to ignore the proposal, and sometimes ignore the Biblical passages that it once quoted in opposition to the new idea. [*]Many decades or centuries later, churches may incorporate the proposal into their beliefs.http://www.religioustolerance.org/scirel_ov.htm \n\n \n EVERYTHING CHANGES. One of the most valuable of human skills is our ability to adapt. A double edged sword too but that's a different discussion. Insisting that anything remain static puts you at opposition with reality. Impotent whining. Being able & willing to adapt involves being able & willing to adapt to change. \n \n Some people have an intense need for immediate gratification. It can become a blind spot for viewing reality.",

   "I suggest you compare Christianity in countries with a state church (e.g. Britain, Sweden, Germany etc.) with what is prevalent in America. If anything, rampant secularism and an absurd paranoia over separation of church and state is what has caused the bizarre fusion of faith and capitalism in the US, along with the politicisation of issues of personal morality.\n\n \n Thanks for the suggestion. I will try to attempt to do so. Although I would like to attempt to explain a bit more where I'm coming from:\n \n To clarify what I was trying to express: I think the blending (entanglement) of religion & state (in the US) has resulted in more not less bafflement & confusion. It's a bit complicated to figure out how this happened, after all the critical step from correlation to cause is not easy, (& causes & effects are sometimes not closely related in time & space). If you accept that  underlying premise, it's often difficult to ascertain correlations between one discernible & verifiable event with a discernible & verifiable present day event occurring in real-time (i.e. - present day reality). Having said that, I say take a look at this timeline:\n \n \n[*]Early 1960s - Barry Goldwater's political campaign draws much attention from conservative leaders. A number of prominent former Dixiecrats, including Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms, eventually would switch to the Republican Party. \n [*]July 2, 1964 - The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prompts the defection of some Southern Democrats from the Democratic Party. \n [*]1972 - The 'Southern strategy' of Richard Nixon's presidential campaign, of exploiting racial anxiety among white voters in the South, eventually leading to a realignment of the South with the Republican Party. \n [*]May 15, 1974 - The United States Supreme Court that held, in Bob Jones University v. United States, that the Internal Revenue Service could, without the approval of the United States Congress, revoke the tax exempt status of organizations that are contrary to established public policy. The decision came about from the university's ban of \"admission to applicants engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating.\" \n [*]1974 - Robert Grant founds the American Christian Cause as an effort to institutionalize the Christian Right as a politically active social movement. \n [*]Late 1970s - The New Religious Right becomes much more involved in politics and media. \n [*]1979 - Jerry Falwell founds Moral Majority, which is often said to be the beginning of the New Christian Right. \n [*]April 29, 1980 - Washington for Jesus founded by John Giminez, the pastor of Rock Church in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Dr. William Bright, Benson Idahosa from Africa, and many other high-profile Christians marched on Washington DC, in an effort to support Ronald Reagan's presidential run. This event provides a place for the Christian Right to outline many of their beliefs in speeches and statements. \n [*]1981 - Ronald Reagan becomes president, serving two presidential terms (1981-1989). Republicans capture the Senate for the first time since 1952. \n [*]April 30, 1987 - Pat Robertson founds the Christian Coalition, which later becomes the most prominent voice in the Christian Right. \n [*]1992 - The Christian Coalition produces voter guides and distributes them to conservative Christian churches. \n [*]January 20, 2001 - George W. Bush becomes president as a result, in part, from overwhelming support from white conservative evangelical voters. \n [*]2004 - Randy Brinson founds Redeem the Vote as an evangelical counterpart to Rock the Vote as the Christian Right begins to take a stand on new issues.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right\n\n \n What about the separation of religion & state? \n \n When you take a look at the 'unholy alliance' between the Xian right & conservativism?\n \n Imho this 'alliance' has gained a stranglehold on the USA. & we seem to be stuck there. \n \n I don't think many American people realize how extraordinary their brand of conservatism is. While the American left - unions, academics, public-sector workers - have their equivalents overseas, the angry taxpayers & militant gun owners are distinctly American.\n \n I happen to like the teachings of Jesus, his words, stories, philosophy, etc. (along with others). In his day, I hardly think he would be considered a 'conservative'. I think those who attempt to make this claim may be guilty of using the 'fallacy of nunc pro tunc' or 'presentism' i.e. by using the past (& removing its context or \\'time & space\\' in order to validate or legitimize their present day political beliefs.\n \n It\\'s a con job.",
