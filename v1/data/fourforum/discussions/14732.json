   "Let me get this straight:\n \n We evil human beings are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere ccontributing to all this nasty \"global warming\" (ahem) excuse me.......\"climate change\".\n \n Since the earth is heating up due to (whoops! There I go again!) I mean....Since the climate is being altered due to our carelessness, the polar ice is melting causing the ocean levels to rise.\n \n So, since it is so bad that the average temperature could approach extremely high levels, causing all this ice to melt, and all manner of bad things......\n \n ...and all this is attributed to we bad, bad, humans......\n \n \n How did all those frozen mastodons and other prehistoric animals frozen in the ice get there?\n \n After all, since we are causing the atmosphere to increase in temperature enough to melt the ice......\n \n ...What caused it before?\n \n Unless you believe that all these prehistoric animals magically teleported themselves underneath the ice when they died, the earth must have been warm enough for them to get there, right?\n \n Well? What caused it to be that warm? Remember: We evil humans weren't around to warm it up so they could get there at that time. So there must be another explanation for it.\n \n But, then the warming would have had to have been a natural occurrence, right?\n \n Which is it? Is all this warming (oops!) I mean \"climate change\", caused by evil gas guzzling, Hummer driving, styrofoam burning humans, or not?\n \n If so, I can finally confirm my hypothisis that prehistoric animals poseesed a strange form of magic allowing them to be teleported below hundreds of feet of ice.\n \n If not, it completely shoots that theory down. Which raises the following question:\n \n Why all the self-flagellation?",

   "While I'm not an expert on climatology, I can see where you went wrong.\n \n \n First, climade does change, and has changed, naturally - ie, without human intervention. Ice ages are one example - look them up\n Ice age - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Paleoclimatology - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n However, the prevalent scientific thought also indicates, that humanity has now started affecting the climate on its own, in addition to the antural changes.\n \n Lastly, \"global warming\" means a change in global temperatures, which manifest differently in different areas. So, no, global warming won't mean +1 degree in summer and +1 degree in winter. It might, for an area, mean 20% less rainfall. Which may be hardly noticeable - or it might mean turning from human friendly green to human hostile desert...",

Just because it's a scientist doesn't mean they make a scientific argument.\n \n The 'science' behind global warming is so simplistic this video describes it pretty well.\n \n I'm sure you know of the various absorbance spectrum's of molecules and elements from high school chemistry, the whole idea is based on proposed opacification of the atmosphere to low frequency radiation. When objects radiate energy they do so at lower wavelengths than the sun (it's a lot warmer) and so if something was transparent to high frequencies and opaque to low frequencies it could 'prevent' energy from escaping the way it came in.\n \n It's not very complicated. If you were talking about the data, yes that's a little harder to find; but it is out there.\n \n \nCalling anyone who shows the slightest sign of scepticism' deniers' and ( in the case of the UK) showing scary cartoon commercials aimed at children just increased my scepticism.\n\n They don't act like the evidence is on their side do they? I however cede that if the threat was real showing scary cartoons is probably a good idea. You could call the taking cover films from the WWII and the coldwar scary but they served a purpose.",
