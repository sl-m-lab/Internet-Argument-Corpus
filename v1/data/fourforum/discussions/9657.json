   "You can delude yourself my friend, but passing them off as well considered facts is to attempt to delude others and that is where I step in. The so called invisible God you deny not only created this World you occupy but you yourself. By denying Him you deny your own place in Creation which is the saddest fact of all regarding your existence. By being blind to the ebb and flow, not to mention the balance and coordination found in His finely tuned creation just shows how out of balance and blind you are to your own royal lineage as a child of the Most High, the Creator of all that is. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I feel that dillusion would be a description of one who claims existence of supernatural beings they choose to believe in and expect and/or feel that others should believe in it as well.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Tell me, how does one with no hope, one who thinks they are nothing more than dust and ash, how do people like this find the strength to care at all about life if they have no hope to live beyond this flesh and blood body ?

Again why do you assume that belief in the afterlife is what supplies a person with strength and a reason to care? I can assure you for me at least that is not the case. Once again, before I could deny the living and personal God who is Jesus Christ, I would first have to believe that he actually exists. I don't believe he exists, I am in denial of the belief that he does. Do you see the difference?

And you are experiencing it all alone with no knowledge of your standing in Gods eternal plan for you. I find that very sad indeed. \n \n \nHope is not dependent upon the existence and/or belief in a supernatural creator. I truly hope that you may realize that one day. After my death I suppose I will become dust and ash of some sort, but while I am alive I think of myself as a human being, nothing more nothing less. Again why do you assume that belief in the afterlife is what supplies a person with strength and a reason to care?\n\n \n If you personally knew the living God you would understand that before knowing him you were just an empty shell. As a believer, the verse \"To live is Christ, to Die is gain\". is a very real and true statement. I might live for as many as 100 years in this life (not that I expect to or want to) but I will live for eternity with Him in eternity with an immortal body that will never hunger, thirst, age or get sick. And as one who is in-dwelt by God's Holy Spirit, I don't HOPE that, I KNOW it as surely as I am typing these words to you now.\n \n \nI can assure you for me at least that is not the case. Once again, before I could deny the living and personal God who is Jesus Christ, I would first have to believe that he actually exists. I don't believe he exists, I am in denial of the belief that he does. Do you see the difference?

However I do not support your assumptions about those who do not share your way of thinking. At least in my case you are sadly mistaken.\n\n \n Do you realize how accurately you stated the facts in saying you're in denial of the belief that He exists ? Because you being in denial of the belief that He exists say's nothing at all about Him actually existing. Imagine this scenario because I can guarantee you that you will live it one day. The day comes when you die in this fleshly body. You immediately feel filled with unconditional love and within your mind you immediately know that God is real, alive, and His presence is literally everywhere. In your minds eye you can then see clearly every instance in your life when you pushed those thoughts of God away and that it was Him prodding you to receive Him. He was always reaching out seeking to fellowship with you, as it were He was knocking at the door of your heart seeking to dine with you and you with Him, as it says in the bible. What is so sad is that with your perfect understanding at that time, and your perfect sense of justice, you will condemn yourself to eternal separation from His Love because you will understand that it was you who rejected Him. Not Him who ever rejected you in this life.\n \n So don't assume that believers live their lives hoping for the unknowable to occur. I know with certainty what is coming in the next life. I know with certainty because my God, my Savior lives within me via His Holy Spirit as a fulfilled promise by Jesus who said before His ascension to go prepare a place for us that He would send the comforter (Holy Spirit) to guide us and teach us until his return. Well, His return is very close now according to prophecy. The end of this Age is approaching with lightning speed. But the natural man is still running to destruction with his fingers in his ears. That's why I say the unbeliever is without hope gaetano, because if you are without Christ, you are without hope. According to the bible, everyone who isn't saved is spiritually dead just as everyone who has received Him is born again and therefore alive in Christ and dead to this World. I understand that I am an alien in this World. But it is about seeking a truth greater than oneself that matters in this life.

It is there and available at all times. There is nothing stopping you from taking it. You refusing to do so, does not mean that there is a condition to you getting it. \n \n To reinforce the lottery example: A conditional \"gift\" would be I'll give this lottery ticket to you if you give me five dollars.

The christian doctrine as I recall says that everyone is already going to hell. There is no choice in that matter.

   "God makes the decisions as to what happens to you. No-one else makes that decision and no-one can tell God what decision to make. He alone knows what your life and intentions were\n\n \n It's true that God knows the intentions and motives of our hearts in life. But you must also understand that even though I am possibly the greatest sinner on this forum, God has thrown all of my sins into the Sea of Forgetfulness. I am sinless in His sight because I am covered by the shed blood of the Lamb of God who died for my sins. \n \n Where as Old Testament Jews sacrificed an unblemished lamb on a regular basis for forgiveness of sins, they were temporary and unworthy to die once for all the sins of man. Jesus is the perfect lamb of God who is worthy to have died for all of the sins of humanity once and for all time. \n \n The Apostle Paul, the greatest Apostle in the New Testament was a known murderer who had purposely killed many jewish converts to Christ when he was struck with blindness on the road to Damascus as Jesus said Saul, why do you persecute me ? He was renamed Paul and spent the rest of His life leading people to the Christ he had previously worked so hard to wipe off the face of the Earth as a loyal Pharisee. So even murderers will not only be saved and forgiven by our God, but also used to change the World for the better.\n \n I'm trying to show you that nothing is cut and dry as it is seen by the natural man. But it all starts at the throne of grace where we must submit authority over our lives to a perfect, holy and trustworthy Father who loves us, which is why He originally created us for fellowship. Do you understand that that is the reason you exist ? And to deny Him is to deny the whole point of your creation ? Think about that, absorb that reality and if you can understand the fulness of what that means you will finally appreciate the reason for your life.",

   "With respect, a flawed analogy. As Huck has put it,\n \n Now, who has determined that before the offer is made I'm 'already going to hell', with 'no choice in that matter'? Why, the very entity that's making the offer. Pretending that the threat of hell somehow exists independently is disingenuous. So it does boil down to 'if you don't accept this you're screwed'.

   "I too love my parents and feel blessed to have been born to them. But your post just confirms the shallowness of your spiritual understanding.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Save your breath. I had 12 years of Catholic School and another 3 years spent in Christian youth groups. One half of my family is Catholic, the other half are Protestant. My grandmother was a Sunday School teacher. My Aunt is born again, the Lord delivered her from the lies of Catholicism about 24 years ago. My mother became a Christian. My mother, my Aunt, and my born again sister would attend weekend retreats for women on a a quarterly basis. After about 10 years she finally stopped when she was no longer allowed to have her own opinions or interpretations of scripture. She enjoyed the social aspect of it, but grew tired of pastors, guest speakers, and retreat members raking homosexuals and nonbelievers over the coals. My father was a nonbeliever and we also have no shortage of gay people in our family. She was tired these godly people insulting her loved ones and using God to make it all okay. So in conclusion I know the drill. My knowledge about spiritualty is quite sufficient. You have a habit of making assumptions, that have all been incorrect so far. Remember you are a Christian not a psysic.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We live on 2 levels of existence as human beings, the physical and the spiritual. You have no comprehension of the spiritual side of who you are to just focus on being your parents kid.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n There you go again, telling me what I don't know. I guess I didn't make it clear enough for you. My bond and relationship with my mother and father was spiritual. What would appear to others as a family visit, for the three of us it was always an event.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And yes, it is your life, and you will ultimately decide whom you will follow. The empty, dead end lies and deceit of this World. or the truth, unconditional love and forgiveness that has been bought and paid for by a perfect and holy God who paid the complete price for you. The choice is and will most assuredly be yours.\n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Here is where we differ. I do not see an empty world of dead end lies and deceit. I see a world where those things certainly do exist, but for me the world is a beautiful place. And what you call truth is anything but that for me. A perfect and holy God would not would sit in judgment over lesser beings of a fallen world. A fallen world that he created, already knowing it would fall. Already aware of the countless millions of people that would be suffering, here on earth, and for eternity in the afterlife. A perfect and holy God would not require that one live to worship and glorify him. A God who chooses to produce rain to drown out humanity, then withholds rain from drought stricken lands is not perfect and holy. A perfect and holy God would have no reason to create mankind, If he is perfect, then he is complete. Choice and/or freewill have never existed for this god you subscribe to. None of us had the choice of whether or not we wanted to be born. \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n This choice isn't an optional choice mind you. When you shed this flesh, you'll quickly realize that making no choice at all in your lifetime is choosing just the same. It's just that you chose separation from God rather than accepted His free gift of reconciliation.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The free gift of reconciliation. That is a joke. The same God that created the entire universe in 6 days is now pushing free reconcilliation gifts. Are we contestants on a game show?\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n We all choose where we will spend eternity my friend, even if we put off thinking about it until we die to this world. And it is the most important choice of our existence, but it must be made on this side of the veil if we hope to live with our Creator in Eternity.\n\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Again we have a different idea of what constitutes important decisions. I find it a very unimportant decision. Why? Because I don't buy into any of this stuff to begin with. If heaven were to really exist, how could there be even a moment of happiness while fellow human beings are being TORTURED for eternity?",

At some point you have to come back to the final definition. There must be a final judge. It is why there is no appeal beyond the supreme court in the US. Someone has to have final say as to what is legal and what is not.\n \n Next, For love to exist there must be a choice. If it is obligatory, then it is not love. If it is forced on you then it is not love. That is why mutual consent is okay and rape is not.\n \n Next, The christian doctrine says that you can either follow the laws which exist to demonstrate love, or you will be declared guilty. Our own justice system mirrors this thought. If you break the law then you are condemned. You can receive a pardon from the president but someone has to bear the cost of the offense. If you murdered someone it would be their family. If you lied under oath about your alleged affair with an intern it would be the people of the country. (sorry couldn't resist the jibeemoticon_xangel )\n \n Next, the christian doctrine is that man breaks the law daily and constantly. Man is condemned. Now God says, here, have a pardon. God also says, that He will bear the cost so that no one else has to.\n \n I suppose if you received a presidential pardon you could refuse it and then complain that being put in jail is unfair.

   "OK, I know I said I'd withdrawn from this discussion, and I apologise for going back on my word; but Huck, in your own words\n Your entire argument rests on loading the dice at the outset:\n \n This is a classic case of begging the question. You could equally well designate it a circular argument: you use as an initial premise the very proposition your 'argument' seeks to demonstrate - whatever god does is loving, therefore by definition there can be no coercion.\n \n I had expected a higher standard of argument...\n\n \n \n John, I respect your opinion and have no problem wityh you coming in again. I have not necessarily loaded the dice. The arguments I am addressing are dealing with the christian God. Therefore, it is only proper to consider the attributes of the christian god as a part of the argument.\n \n NOw, one of those attributes is that He is love, by definition. Regardless of whether or not I believe that (this is why you consider it a begged question) or anyone else believes it is irrelevant. The issue is what is the christian doctrine. That doctrine says that God defines love and is himself love. Love is defined by who God is. While I appreciate the circular nature of this, the problem is that for all things one must come to some arbitrary definition. Since we are talking about the \"christian\" god then it is appropriate to use their definitions. To say that they christian god is not love means that I (me) get to define love regardless of the christian doctrine. Since we are not talking about the huckleberry doctrine, nor is the argument aimed at such, it is inappropriate to use my definition. It is not a begged question but merely using the contextually appropriate definitions. \n \n For any logical discussion there must be some assumptions. Some are inappropriate others are appropriate. It may seem circular but it is not. Rather it is the \"given\" of the argument. No other person gets to change the attributes of God to fit their argument. Either the argument is based on the stated attributes of god (the christian god in the context of our discussion as no one seems to be discussing valhalla) or it is an illegitimate argument.\n \n What trebor has done is just as bad and worse because it is not contextually appropriate. He has defined god according to his own thinking and then used that to prove his point. The problem is that the attributes of God according to Trebor are in direct contradiction to the stated attributes of God according to christian doctrine.\n \n His logic is the same as mine. The final issue is that he does not stay in context and thereby equivocates the definitions. He uses his own definition of God and then claims that is the christian god. This is equivocation (the sliding of definitions from one meaning to another in order to win the point). He cannot have it both ways. If we talk of the christian god then we must use that God's stated attributes. According to christian doctrine, God is! That means all else came into being by him and through him. It means that God is love. It means that whatever god causes or allows is loving because that is who he is. He is the definition of it. He is the final authority (please see my supreme court analogy for further explanation.)\n \n So, while your comments are welcome, and understandable, I do think my logic is correct.\n \n Huck.",

I argue their point from their doctrine.\n \n The issue that I have is that non christians try to define god in their own way and then claim that the christian god is a bad god. The problem with that is when you or I impose OUR definition on them and then complain about them, what we are really doing is complaining about OUR definition not theirs.\n \n If you want to complain about the \"christian god\" then you have to accept their definition otherwise you are complaining about your own god.\n \n Huck",
