I don't want this to get too long, but one example that I thought unfair:\n \n The people hurt by 55% death-tax rates are entrepreneurs not rich enough to be the next Rockefellers. Many own businesses they have to break up or sell merely to pay the tax. The point is more moral than economic. It's simply unjust to tax income a third time at death after it's already been taxed as earnings and again as dividends. \n \n This seems to imply that it is the entrepreneurs that are 'triple taxed.' It conjures up the image of the mom and pop business barely making it, and the business having to be disolved after death. Would an estate that is comprised mainly of a small business really have have paid a lot of dividend taxes? Dividend taxes effect people that have large stock holdings, etc. (ie, the rich, not the small business owners)\n \n ...not to mention that the whole 'breaking up the small farms and businesses' thing I feel is not portrayed fairly:\n \n FARMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BE PROTECTED WITHOUT REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX\n \n * The USDA's Economic Research Service recently reported that the average farm household net worth ranged from $576,400 for small farms to $1.5 million for very large family farms. The estate tax already exempts $1 million and rises to $3.5 million (double for couples) and The New York Times has reported no evidence of family farmers having to pay the estate tax in Iowa. Nonetheless, the tax can easily be reformed to ensure that families can pass their farms from one generation to the next without being unfairly taxed.\n \n * A recent Federal Reserve Survey of Small Business Finances indicates that the average net worth of small businesses is $702,566. Only 4% of small businesses have a net worth of more than $3.5 million, which is the amount that will be exempt from taxation before the tax is scheduled to be repealed for one year in 2010. Yet the National Federation of Independent Business has a different image of a \"Mom and Pop\" shop. They claim companies worth $27 million are small businesses and should be exempt from the tax.\n \n * Family farms and small businesses can be protected against unfair estate taxation through common sense reform and simplification. But let's not allow super-wealthy individuals who own large businesses to skip the estate tax by using family farms and small businesses as a cover.\n \n \n http://www.ombwatch.org/estatetax/afet_article.phtml?ombfile=http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/747/1/119/\n \n \n Yeah, I don't know about the increased charity thing. I have not actually seen a study that comments either way.\n ...of course, the case made at deathtax.com is plausable, the same can be made for taxing in general. (if people have more because they are taxed less, then they will give more.) Personally, I am hesitant to agree with this, though some kind of study would be interesting. ( I have never seen one.)\n \n To be honest, I have not been able to find a web site, etc. that tries to be unbias on the whole inheritance tax thing. The site that I posted obvioulsy is bias in favoring keeping the tax (and reforming, while deathtax.com certainly is bias the other way.",

It seems pretty clear that the small buisiness thing is propaganda. Those are good reform ideas, IMO.\n \n However, I'm beginning to wonder about the morality and sensibility of the whole thing. I mean, how do these large companies get and stay big? Efficiency, hard work, and innovation seems to be the best answer. So what do we do? Tax them more! I've been looking up links on the anti-trust law, and it does take care of what the estate tax is about. (preventing wealth concentration) And it does it much more fairly.\n \n The anti-trust laws are essentially anti-monopoly laws. They are meant to encourage short and long-term competition. (which is good for the consumer) The idea is to stop things like price-fixing and 'tying'. (price fixing: the major players in a market get together and all raise the price, tying: a company with a monopoly on product A makes A only buyable in a package with product B) The basic theory is that once a company gets a large share of a market, they are firmly entrenched, can drive out old and new competitors with temporarily very low prices and then raise them when they are the only choice. So this law, in theory, prevents anyone from getting unfair control on a market and preventing competition.\n \n That is certainly a better idea than the estate tax. After all, a person at the recieving end of an estate tax may have become wealthy through fair or unfair means, and it doesn't matter which.\n \n The estate tax is apparently driven by marxist-socialist theory that says once a person gets a certain amount of wealth they get a chain reaction (money makes money) and now are permanently and exponentially more wealthy and can keep their wealth in their own family and to people they like. (the wealth class) Then they force their employees to work at low wages (exploitation of the lower class) and do their best to prevent others from becoming wealthy as well. Its all very interesting. So, since money is power, these people can now control our lives. \n \n Its essentially a parrallel to when the nobles had complete ownership of the land, and forced the peasants to do slave labour all their lives without hope of ever owning much or getting ahead. The control of the land was passed down by inheiritance, so the classes were permanent. Thats why people don't like the idea of people passing estates down to their children. They are afraid that the same thing is happening as in the feudal system.\n \n What I find to be really interesting is that it seems that the democratic-capitalist and marxist-socialist are both meant to prevent the permanent class system. After all, anyone can make it to the top in our society. I think that Bill Gates is a really interesting example. He dropped out of school, started making computers in his garage, and now he's the richest man on earth. The marxist-socialist theory says that this shouldn't be easy to do. Success stories are downplayed by them. What I really like is some marxist-socialists see Gates. He's a clear example of the 'weath class' who is trying to prevent anyone else's success. He is the one who represents the evils of capitalism. Here is an example of why marxists are right! Yet it would seem that Gates is really an example of why they are wrong.\n \n I don't agree with the marxist-socialist idea. I agree that there are a lot of things that aren't good about capitalism, but people who work hard and are smart can often succeed very well, regardless of how rich they were at birth. \n \n Well I'm not sure where I'm going with this! I guess that my ultimate problem with an estate tax is that it really prevents successful people from doing what they choose with their estate",

So anti-trust is to prevent unfair wealth concentration practices in companies, while the estate tax is to prevent wealth concentration in families whether the wealth is fairly gotten or not. Clearly, they are not the same thing. One applies to business and the other to family. What I would say is that at least the anti-trust law targets unfair practices. But, I think you're right - they don't relate in the sense of overlapping. \n \n As a side note, many internet sites I went to argue against anti-trust theory - they seem to say that it too is driven by marxist theory, and the natural forces of competition will quickly dethrone any monopoly that seeks to cash in with high prices. Its very interesting.\n \n \n \n \n \nWell, there is obvioulsy a lot of truth to what you say, but I do think that a lot most people's views a skewed in with respect to this. When you see polls about wealth, something like 40% of people think that they are in the top 10%, and something like 90% of those that don't think that they will be some day. (Sorry, for not posing a link, I will look for some...)\n \n In other words, I think that because there a success stories like Bill Gates, people don't realize both how much wealth in held by a small percentage of the population, and they dont' realize that the odds of them ever becoming wealthy are actually very small.\n\n \n Interesting stats. (that would be the 3rd time I've used 'interesting'!) Yes, it does seem to have to do with worldviews. I recently came across a very interesting site that argues in favor of \"Reganomics\" (cutting taxes, essentially) They say that, in the poorest quintile of people during the Reagan years 14% of the people remained in that quintile - while 15% made it to the top quintile!! Interesting, considering how many people say that Reagan's policy increased the difference between the poor and rich.\n \n \"Reganomics\" site, very thourogh and informative: http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-261.html",
