   "So I say if this is true then the bacon and pork products should be next.\n This is something I've never understood. The admonitions against eating pork, shellfish, etc. are obviously a cornerstone of the Jewish religion. A \"moral issue,\" if you will, far more important and far, far more unequivocally stated in the Old Testament than the alleged \"anti-gay\" passages. Yet why is there no hue and cry to make them U.S. law? Where are the masses of Othodox Jews protesting that we're \"changing the definition of pork\" and that Oscar Mayer is violating their \"deeply held beliefs\" and threatening the \"traditional\" institution of breakfast? After all, as one poster here maintains, you don't have to give any logical reason to justify such a ban. It says so in the Bible, clearly and undeniably. No pork. End of story. \n \n Why is it that a half-dozen passages written by a people whose knowledge of human sexuality was precisely nil (and filled with terms no linguist pretends to know the real meaning of today) about idolatry and ritualistic temple sex are used as justification for constitutional amendments to prevent loving adults from equally enjoying the rights and protections as their neighbors enjoy in this so-called bastion of freedom and equality, while no one, but NO ONE, is raising a stink about making these other, more frequently mentioned, non-disputed, clear-cut no-no's--like most of the ones in the Ten friggin' Commandments, fer Chrissake--illegal in what they keep insisting is a \"Christian nation\" whose laws, they say, derive from that book?",

A total of 3 times all together. How I understand it, the actual meaning of the vision was to be open to outsiders or something.

And that not shaking hands for too long was ridiculous. Who's to determine \"too long?\" And what, exactly, is broadcasting his lifestyle? Is it broadcasting in the active sense, like having an online journal? Or is it by wearing makeup and fabulous clothing? The university's requirements are too vague, and a bit asinine, if i do say so myself. I understand it's a Christian university, and that it has its image to look after, but honestly, this is ridiculous. \n I suppose it just goes to show you that one needs to be careful where one decides to go to college.
