In fact im asking another question not answering it.\n \n Now lets see, from an evolution point, god did not destroy the dinosaurs they died off, slowly over millions of years, if god destroyed them, then it would have been instant, but it wasnt. And man evolved slowly into modern man, not suddenly.\n \n From a creationist point, god may have killed the dinosaurs because they didnt listen to him, maybe they were stupid and didnt pray to him, so he decided to get rid of them and replace them with a better effort, hence us.\n \n Im not sure if ive asked more questions than ive answered.",

   "Hi Pro-Bush: \n You questions are quoted and I pray my answers help you out. Although I am not a theologian...\n \n \nWas creation 7 days or was it in seven steps that actually lasted millions of years.\n \n \n From a straight forward reading of Genesis 1 we can safely conclude that the days of the Creation week were six days of 24 hour literal days. Evening passed, morning came, the nth day. If you read this straight forwardly the only reasonable conclusion can be is that the days of creation were in fact, six literal days. Compromising Christians are trying to put foward the idea of a gap theory, i.e. there is millions of years between the days of Genesis 1. This is not supported by the wording of Genesis 1. If God did really create everything in millions/billions of years, than Genesis 1 would not say, the \"nth day\" - where nth = number of day of creation week.\n \n \nDid dinosaurs rule the Earth before Adam and Eve were created?\n \n \n According to the Bible, all land animals were created on Day six of the creation week. A straight forward reading of Genesis 1 reveals that there is no room for thousands of years, let alone millions. So a literal reading (which is how it should be read) implies that Adam and Eve literally walked with dinosaurs.\n \n \nwas Eden just a Garden or the whole world?\n \n \n Eden was just a Garden that God made. I get this directly from the Bible. In the Fall of Man, i.e. when Adam disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit, Adam had to leave the Garden of Eden to prevent him from eating the fruit from the Tree of Life (i.e. eternal life). This alone strongly suggests that Eden was a Garden not the whole world as Adam and Eve had to leave the Garden.\n \n \nDoes creating Eve with Adams rib have anything today with DNA?\n \n \n I'm not quite sure that I get what you are hinting at. I think that (in my opinion) God made Eve from Adam's rib because this sets the basis for marriage. There is however, a book by the Answers in Genesis Ministry that helps people deal with Adam's rib that can be downloaded from:\n http://www.answersradio.com \n \n \nWas incest okay back then?\n \n \n Incest is a pretty broad definition. Recently it has been shown that there is only one race, The Human Race (via the Human Genome Project). This means that we are all descended from one man. So this means that we are all related. So when a man and a woman get married, they are infact marrying their relation! Because, if you don't marry one of your relation then you don't marry a human, and than you are really in trouble.\n \n You see, incest involves a wide range of things, some of which have always been immoral, but it also covers immoral relationships. That said, it would be wrong for the father to have a sexual relationship with his daughter or mother with her son. But is there anything immoral about a man and a women getting married, as long as it is one man for one woman back then? No, it is just like a man and a woman getting married today. \n \n For them back then before a brother marrying a sister was not considered \"wrong\" as it is today. This is because God only told brothers are not to marry sisters after the time of Moses. So before Moses, brothers and sisters marrying was not considered wrong, but after Moses' time, it was. There are a number of reasons for this. But I would say mainly because if two people have the same parents, they have a greater chance of inheriting genetic mutations. If these two people have a child, the child has a greater chance of inheriting both defects and becoming deformed. \n \n \nWas the snake actually a snake or is it a metaphor?\n \n \n Once again, a straight forward reading of Genesis 1 tells us that the serpent was not a metaphor - remembering that Genesis 1 is not writing in poetic terms, unlike much of the Old Testament.\n \n \nDo animals have souls?\n \n \n I'm not quite sure. I know that we humans have more value in God's eyes than animals, whether or not this implies things. Also, Jesus died for all humanity, not for the animals. This once again, implies that animals do not have souls. Also, the Bible says in several different areas that humans are made in the image of God (hence, we have an immortal soul - like God). The Bible says that animals have no such characteristic. However, Revelation says that Heaven is a place in which the \"wolf and the lamb will lie down together\". Is this a metaphor, or is it meant to be taken literally? Perhaps God will create new animals in the New Heavens and New Earth?\n \n \nIs lucifer the Devil?\n \n \n Yes.\n \n \nIf God is a forgiving one, why is there the Devil?\n \n \n The Devil got jelous of God and went batty. He led an uprising against God with his little band of traitors. This uprising obviously failed. As a result, God banished him to Hell.\n \n \nCould Hitler have gone to Heavan?\n \n \n I am not to say. If Hitler (who was an atheist) believed that Jesus was his LORD and Saviour and asked Him for forgiveness and to take away his sins, than Hitler may have went to Heaven. That just shows how loving and forgiving he really is. No matter how bad we are, or become, God still loves us and is willing to forgive us even when we don't deserve it.\n \n \nIs gay marriage the Anti-Christ?\n \n \n God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. That statement says it all. God set the standards for marriage with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. One man for one woman. Several verses in the Bible say that homosexual marriages are immoral and considered wrong by God (from where we get our standards from).",

   "Was creation 7 days or was it in seven steps that actually lasted millions of years?\n \n Nah, it was seven days. That's kinda why we call them seven days. Day is a measurement of time and the light and darkness that defines this period of time for us now was created even before the sun and the moon were. You also have to realize there was nothing, there wasn't even space. Space also had to be created along with everything else and I think anyone who can do that doesn't need millions of years to get it right. (plus a million years requires years and years require days and there were only seven days for the millions of years to take place)\n \n Did dinosaurs rule the Earth before Adam and Eve were created?\n \n Nope, no one ruled there wasn't even death till the fall of man. Were dinosaurs alive? Yes. How did they die? Did God destroy them? Well, he didn't destroy them but if you think about it dinosaurs did go onto the ark (there was plenty of room, the dimensions of the ark in the Bible can tell us that) but then there were only two of each kind and most people know that lizards don't reproduce that well or that often. So if you think about it the giant lizards didn't have that great of shot. \n \n Was Eden just a Garden or the whole world?\n \n It was the \"Garden of Eden\" we don't know how big this garden was but it didn't cover the earth. It was destroyed in the flood anyway.\n \n Does creating Eve with Adams rib have anything today with DNA?\n \n Yes, and no. Eve had DNA, so DNA was involved. Adam had DNA and so the rib did as well. God created the dust, he made Adam from the dust and Eve from Adam (thats where the phrase \"dust to dust\" comes from refering to when we die). Could God have made Eve from more dust? Yes, but then Eve would have been something different and not united to Adam (not like a dog is different but she would be something different then Adam was insted of a +/- half of a whole) the taking of the rib is a bond that Adam and Eve had as the first Humans for Male and Female unity, maybe this has something to do with marriage and maybe it doesn't but it does have to do with humanity overall.\n \n Would it be considered cloning?\n \n That's a very interesting question and to tell you the truth, I don't know. But it was ordained by God, human cloning is humans try to play God (AKA, not a good idea).\n \n Was incest okay back then?\n \n Well, if I may I'd like to rephrase that.\n Was it okay to have relations with your relations in biblical times?\n \n If you were married. Later God gave Moses the law, including the ten commandments along with many many other laws (most people just focus on the \"Big Ten\"). At that time the law from then on stated that you could no longer marry your direct relation. Incest wasn't okay out of marriage ever but then again neither was any kind of physical relations between the unmarried.\n \n Was the snake actually a snake or is it a metaphor?\n \n It was a snake as stated by the Bible, evolution is not a factor in the snakes non-legs.\n \n Do animals have souls?\n \n I dunno, maybe. Will animals be in heaven? Yes, (many verses state this). Will they be the same ones you see here on earth? The Bible doesn't say either way. But there are many books about that subject.\n \n Is Lucifer the Devil?\n \n Yep. The most beautiful angel who's beauty was only matched by God's was cast out of heaven to wonder the earth is called the devil, the beast along with many other names all through the Bible.\n \n If God is a forgiving one, why is there the Devil?\n \n Because not everyone wants to be forgiven. The devil is waging war against God the Bible says he will forgive whoever asks in faith and repentance by the grace of God through the Lord Jesus Christ, which brings us to...\n \n Could Hitler have gone to Heaven?\n \n He could if he asked in faith and repentance by the grace of God through the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved from the penalty of his sin. The Bible teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God so Hitler would get the same punishment that someone who took God's name in vain would get. The law demands death to those who break his law if you've ever put something or someone above God then you sinned, if you've ever lied (even white lies count) then you are a liar, if you've ever taken something that isn't yours then you are a thief, if you've ever coveted (desired to have something of another's to be yours instead) then you've sinned if you've ever said \"Oh My God\" in a non religious way (such as a substitute for a cuss word) then you have sinned and if you have dishonored your parents or lusted after someone (which Jesus said is as bad as actually sleeping with the person) YOU HAVE SINNED. And I'm not saying I haven't, I do every day actually I can name five lies I've told this morning actually, I'm not saying I'm proud of this fact and I'm not saying I want justice upon me. I want mercy and that's exactly what God does, he dives mercy to those who ask him for it. He sent his son to die to pay the penalty (death) for my debt (the breaking of His law) along with anyone else's when they ask him to. lol sorry if I started preaching but my point is if someone who is bad as Hitler was repented (which I don't believe he did) he would get to go to heaven.\n \n Is gay marriage the Antichrist?\n \n No. It is breaking God's law in the same way theft is, but it's not the antichrist. Bush doesn't believe it is the antichrist, but he believes homosexuality is sin though. In almost the same way I do. I mean, do I think it is wrong? Yes, But then again I also think that lying is wrong and I do that. So I dunno, it's almost like the incest deal. If someone had an attraction to their sister would it be wrong to do anything about it? Yes, and the same is with homosexuality. Is it wrong to feel an attraction to someone of the same sex? Not really as long as it isn't a sexual lust or physical attraction, is it wrong to do anything about it? Yes, according to God's law. But those who gay-bash have to realize they to have sinned as badly if they have ever lusted, disobeyed their parents, cussed using God's name, coveted, put themselves first, stole (even something from work or your parents), or lied. For all sin is the same in God's eyes.",
