   "My vote for the worst movie of 2005 goes to \"War of the Worlds\" - a boring, incoherent, and mawkish fantasy. Even the special effects were risible in this masterpiece of drivel. From the second I saw Tom Cruise operating a crane in the opening scene, I knew I was going to hate the film. \n \n An unexpected pleasure which I enjoyed was \"The Aviator\": but Martin Scorsese seldom lets you down.",

   "I have not seen many movies this year but I guess of the movies that I did see, the one I thought to be the worse was probibly War Of The Worlds (Although as I said, I didn't see many movies so if I had seen more it would have probibly been another one that was the worst.) I thought War Of The Worlds was okay but there were various little things that I just didn't like. I think it was the whole viewing expierence or something. Also, I thought so many parts were taken from other movies. I don't mean like a spoof uses items from other movies but as though the scene called for something similar to a scene in Jurassic Park or something. I like Jurassic Park but to see a movie and say that a scene in the movie \"was so Steven Spielberg\" suggest unoriginality. I know, it was a remake anyway, but still.\n \n I would say that the best movie was either Fantastic 4 because I enjoy super hero movies or Hitchhicker's Guide To The Galaxy because it was finally a movie based off of a book that I actually had read.\n \nAn unexpected pleasure which I enjoyed was \"The Aviator\": but Martin Scorsese seldom lets you down.\n\n Were you refering to this year for this one? Because \"The Aviator\" came out last year. Otherwise, it would not have been able to be up for any Oscars last year.",

I was with friends, none of whom enjoyed it either. It seems like it was made for a younger audience than it was marketed towards.\n \n I wasn't much of a fan of Saw II either. A lot of my friends liked it, but I found the \"gore\" rather boring, and the whole idea behind him not really being a killer was incorrect, considering he actively poisoned them/put them in traps/etc. It would be equivalent to me going up to someone with a gun, saying \"defend yourself\" and shooting the person in the face, except that would be slightly more obvious to those who were watching.",

To jump around from scene to scene is one thing. But it seemed to jump around from time to time. It was like, first he was in prision, then he was a kid. Then he tried to kill the man who shot his parents and then he was released from prison and started training. The first half hour (+) seemed to lack continuity. Then when he came back and started to become Bat Man and actually became Bat Man, it made more sence and followed the timeline more acurately. (Except for that fact that the first movie hinted or played around with the idea that it was the Joker who killed Bruce's parents.)",
