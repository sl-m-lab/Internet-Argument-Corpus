   "For those of you who love to drive high horsepower muscle cars on the street but have trouble keeping the wheels from spinning, I've found the solution. Mickey Thompson make a new DOT legal drag radial, the ET Street. Unlike the old ET Street tires, this one has a softer compound as well as a radial design and it bites. I replaced my street tires with a set of 275 x 28 x 15's on Weld Draglite rims and put skinny MT Sportsman tires on Weld Draglites on the front and the car launches on the street almost as hard as it does at the track. The only downside is it's tougher to roast your tires on demand. emoticon_xgood",

Due to the reduced tread depth these tires should be used on dry pavement only and are not suitable for normal highway use!\n That said, it is a good thing to be able to hook up that power to the pavement. By the way, how did the maiden launch of your son's car go?",

By the way, how did the maiden launch of your son's car go?\n\n \n With a 3.70 rear, stroker motor and no overdrive in a TH400, highway driving isn't an option.\n As for \"junior's\" twin turbo LS-1, it's still a work in progress. :xbanghead \n We spent a couple of months chasing gremlins that prevented the car from reving above ~6700rpms. We replaced coil packs, checked spring tensions, fuel system, and even replaced the Big Stuff 3 fuel/spark management system. Finally, my son enlisted the help of the master himself, the inventor of all of the major aftermarket fuel/air management computers, John Meanie, who also happens to live in Michigan. \n One afternoon with John and he found that the computer was losing its crank signal at higher rpms. (no distributer, just a reluctor and sensor ) My son installed a new external crank trigger and sensor on the harmonic balancer and is bringing it back to Meanie to program the computer. Hopefully, it'll be running low 9's by the end of summer and low 8's next season after my son gains some seat time in the car.",
