   "Bassman? The american left is hardly worthy of the name. In any case the soviet union had far more in common in terms of social attitudes with US conservatives than liberals. The soviet union was very anti-gay, for example, and in favour of a very specific ideal of \"the family\". The soviet union was also very keen, like the \"Christian\" right, on making its own morality and views the law of the land. The last, in particular, is about as far from liberalism, in either the proper sense or the commonly used US sense, as it is possible to go. The soviet union also favoured the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, rather than the many, much like US concervatives do. Incidentally, a lot of soviet communism had links to patriarchal authority, hence the glorification of leaders, the statues of Stalin and Lenin etc.",

But I've always thought it was ironic that many of the people who seem to NOT mind a male-leadership culture are women. There are a LOT of women who like husbands who are the \"man of the house\" sort. My experince is that many, if not most women like men who are take-charge types. And let's face it--there hasn't exactly been a social upheaval by women over the fact that we've never had a woman president in this country. It's not like women are a real minority. If anything they are equal in numbers to men, and possibly there are MORE women. \n \n The biggest problem feminism faces as a political movement is not acceptance by men, but by women.\n \n Regarding your article, it doesn't seem to be about what you are addressing. it's another vain attempt to claim there was election fraud because it was so close. This sort of thing always follows close elections; it would be there if the Democrats had won as well.",

   "We're talking anglo-saxon here aren't we rather than white I suppose, though I'm not sure how the US's white population breaks down into various ethnicities but I personally would include a slavic population as white (apologies to any Ukranians if you're not, not totally sure of the name for 'Russians').\n \n Even then I'm pretty sure that patriarchial authority is a largely universal thing, surely the Dictator is the complete embodiment of this and they are hardly confined to western europe throughout history. Even Gorillas and Orangutangs are very sensitive to this kind of authority.\n \n I'd say the electoral fraud (and to a degree dictators) is that people are quite happy to live with something to an amazing degree, mere electoral fraud is nothing in the grand scheme of the 'living with it' we are capable of.\n \n I'd say more interestingly, it seems more people distrust the government the more its able to get away with. It just becomes expected rather than an outrage.",
