The principal and oft-repeated assertion I have seen is the assertion that the second law does not apply to open systems, which is nonsense. I would be interested to hear about specific failings of 2nd law arguments.\n \n Comment by Eric Anderson - March 3, 2006 @ 3:38 pm\n\n \n No, ID is not creationism, no siree. But the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics forbids evolution!!\n \n \n http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/880\n \n \n[Off Topic] Spore\n \n http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&q=spore\n \n If you ever felt the need to play the role of the Intelligent Designer here is the game for you!\n \n I think Spore could be more aptly titled \"Intelligent Design: The Game\". After all, notice in the presentation that evolution is always via design by the player and not a mechanism like the modern synthesis. Of course, that game would take forever and would likely go nowhere. ;)\n \n Now let's just hope our own Intelligent Designer isn't like Will Wright and decides to take his UFO and nuke our planet. :)\n Filed under: Intelligent Design, Off Topic - Patrick @ 12:26 pm \n\n \n Yes, feel what it's like to be the Intelligent Designer!! \n \n There is only one, He is the Alpha and the Omega...\n \n I've always wanted a detailed model of how intelligunt desine is supposed to work and I didn't realize that all I had to do is play the game Spore!!\n \n http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/852\n \n \nPeer-Reviewed Stealth ID Classic : The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (1987)\n \n Frank Tipler co-authored a book with John Barrow entitled The Anthropic Cosmological Principle which was a peer-reviewed book published by Oxford University in 1987.\n \n The principle thesis:\n \n Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.\n \n They derive the thesis from Schrodinger's equation\n Schrodinger's Equation\n \n From Schrodinger's equation they derive the following formula:\n \n Universal Wave Function\n \n which predicts, through physical first principles alone, at the end of time that there must be an Intelligent Entity that is conscious, all-powerful, all-knowing, non-material, eternal. By all counts, such an entity would properly be called, \"God\".\n\n \n No, ID isn't about God. We don't try to identify THE Intelligent Designer. We just let the evidence of Schrodinger's equation and the Heisenberg Uncertaint principle lead us to the fact that God exists. emoticon_wow \n \n \n \n I don't know if anyone can actually \"debate\" me on this. I just wanted to point out some ID ideas that are comical and wouldn't be so scary if ID people didn't take them seriously.",

   "http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/894\n \n \nHow's this for ID research ...\n \n Check out the article below. It explicitly refers to a process that produces modified enzymes as \"Intelligent Design.\" Further, it distinguishes between directed evolution and the process introduced by these researchers: their process more thoughtfully chooses the residues to mutate. Both are in fact examples of Intelligent Design, but one has to appreciate, especially in the current climate of controversy, that the researchers are being up front about how intelligent design is at the center of their work and also that they resisted the urge to suck up to the establishment by offering ritualistic deference to Darwin and conventional evolutionary theory.\n \n At Berkeley: Intelligently Designed Molecular Evolution\n Contact: Lynn Yarris (510) 486-5375 lcyarris@lbl.gov\n \n BERKELEY, CA - Evolutionary paths to new therapeutic drugs, as well as a wide assortment of other enzyme products, have been created through, of all things, intelligent design. A team of researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the University of California at Berkeley have developed a technique in which the evolution of an important class of proteins is steered towards a desired outcome.\n \n MORE\n\n \n The researchers use the term intelligent design in the article and Demski sees fit to include it as an example of \"Intelligent Design Research.\"\n \n So funny!\n \n First off, let me fill you in on directed enzyme evolution. It's a technique that is proving to be quite promising for new non-natural enzymes that can be useful to us as industrial catalysts or specialized catalysts. The standard technique is done through the use of combinatorial libraries of randomly mutated (by error-prone PCR) genes recombined into the plasmid of E coli which then expresses the new mutant enzyme. They screen through thousands of these mutants and select the ones that work the best. It's basically like dog breeding, but on the molecular level.\n \n Now, this new research cuts out a lot of the randomness by using site-directed mutagenesis to arrive at pre-screened targets selected by theoretical calculations, hence the \"intelligent design.\" They would normally use the term \"rational design\" but I'm sure since the research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they were having a stab at the Discovery Institute, another Gates recipient. \n \n This is also a funny coincidence because after a colleague of mine told me about his research in directed enzyme evolution to arrive at a new catalyst for ribavirin monophosphate, an antiviral. When I realized how random the process was and that the most successful of his hits had mutations far away from the active site, I suggested looking into using site directed mutagenesis to be a little less random (SDM need specific sites not necessarily pertinent to every enzyme active site). It was just an out of the blue suggestion, and then I see this article linked to by uncommondescent. Small world I guess.\n \n Well, anyway, I'd love for someone to explain to me how Demski sees this as Intelligent Design Research or how he extrapolates what these people are doing to how the Intelligent Designer formed all the species of life we see today.",

   "Hey! Now that we have some comments on the above mentioned blog post, a poster left an interesting problem.\n \n \n \n#\n \n From the article:\n \n The idea would be to one day be able to design an enzyme synthase that would evolve along a specific functional pathway to yield a desired molecular product, then introduce it into microbes for mass production. In addition to synthesizing therapeutic drugs, other possible applications would include flavors, fragrances and nutraceuticals.\n \n So let's say 500 from now all records of this of this research are lost, but the molecular products are still out there and are discovered. Would a future scientist assume it was produced by evolution and construct an evolutionary history accordingly, or would there be hallmarks of its intelligently designed origin? If it is the latter, then why assume that nothing we observe today could have the same intelligently designed origin. If it is the former, then clearly the history of its origin is incorrect. 500 years from now, would it still be the case that the correct, intelligently designed origin hypthesis would be considered religious, but the the incorrect evolutionary origin story would be considered scientific?\n \n Makes me wonder...\n \n Comment by DonaldM - March 7, 2006 @ 10:31 pm\n \n\n \n Forget most of what he said, but reword the question a bit and we have an excellent proposal for some actual Intelligent Design research. Let's say it was 500 years into the future and the above scenario did play out. There would be no record of the directed evolution research that altered the genes, but the bacteria from the research were still living and reproducing. Some of the bacteria were inadvertantly sampled and were being studied. How would anyone be able to tell that the DNA had been tinkered with? \n \n Another scenario is that you find a random culture of E. coli in a random microbiology lab. How would you propose going about the task of figuring out whether or not the genome had been altered artificially? How would you differentiate naturally mutated and evolved genes from ones that had been artifically tinkered with?\n \n If ID is valid, there should be some method that can reliably distiguish designed genes from evolved genes. Even if the bacteria were not tinkered with, then the method should be able to determine that also. \n \n The ID \"researchers\" say that this is what they are all about. They are all about detecting design in nature. I'm not saying that ID people have to perform such a difficult task. I would just be happy if they could outline a general strategy. I just want to hear some concepts from which a method might be derived. Anything. So how's that for Intelligent Design Research?",

   "http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/900#comments\n \n \nThe universe-as-computer concept may also play into the current strife about intelligent design. It might be argued that a computer implies a programmer. However, this may be taking the analogy too far. What the universe is computing, in Lloyd's picture, is not some external output but rather its own behavior. And a very large portion of its computing power seems to be tied up in such behavior as random collisions of atoms.\n \n What a way to spin this. This actually favors ID. If the majority of the computational resources are wasted, it reduces the amount of probabilistic resources.\n \n \"monkeys typing on computers can produce simple code that would generate a wide variety of outputs.\"\n \n I'd like to see that. (Is he trying to make monkeys out of Stephen Wolfram et al?)\n \n Elsewhere, Seife uses terminology that is likely to create confusion. He posits a possible \"law of conservation of information,\" without noting that Intelligent Design theorist William Dembski has used the same wording to propose a different law. Seife is referring to [blah blah blah]. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski's claim that organisms contain information that could not have been produced naturally.\n \n Transparent, intellectually dishonest obfuscation. \n \n Comment by j - March 9, 2006 @ 6:47 am \n\n \n Well, j, the blah blah blah part was pretty important.\n \n It said, \"Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper's content, albeit impossible to reconstruct, and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski's claim...\" which is true. One definition has nothing to do with the other. Blah blah blah.\n \n \n http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/903\n \n \nID sympathetic peer reviewed paper accepted\n When Bill posted Debugging the Universe, it reminded me to post that an ID sympathetic paper had been accepted in the journal of Chaos, Solitons & Fractals Volume 25, Issue 4 , August 2005, Pages 845-859: Computational Universes by Karl Svozil of Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Vienna, Austria:\n \n Suspicions that the world might be some sort of a machine or algorithm existing \"in the mind\" of some symbolic number cruncher have lingered from antiquity. Although popular at times, the most radical forms of this idea never reached mainstream. Modern developments in physics and computer science have lent support to the thesis \n \n ....\n discrete computational physics certainly represents an interesting, speculative and challenging research area. Many ideas from system science, interface design, to dualism (e.g., the Eccles Telegraph) enter. The issue has metaphysical connotations.\n \n Filed under: Intelligent Design - scordova @ 10:57 am \n\n \n Two instances of selective quoting in the same day.\n \n \nscordova quotes this sentence, but cuts it off abruptly:\n \"Modern developments in physics and computer science have lent support to the thesis \"\n \n Here is the rest of the sentence:\n \" but empirical evidence is needed before it can begin to replace our contemporary world view.\"\n \n Quite a different connotation when the amputation is undone.\n \n So scordova is right that there is a parallel: ID, like the idea of a computational universe, is a philosophically possible idea, but empirical evidence is needed before it can begin to replace our contemporary world view. \n \n Comment by woody - March 9, 2006 @ 12:04 pm \n",

It looks as though Philip Kitcher, a prominent philosopher of science at Columbia University, is taking a different tack in the science wars.

He will try to show why it died, why it should remain dead, why he will kill it again if necessary, why others should take up the task of killing it, why scientific cleansing of dead science is an intellectual imperative, and what consequences for religious belief follow from its death.
