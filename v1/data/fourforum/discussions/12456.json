   "Could marijuana be the answer to the economic misery facing California? Democratic State Assembly member Tom Ammiano thinks so. Ammiano introduced legislation last month that would legalize pot and allow the state to regulate and tax its sale - a move that could mean billions for the cash-strapped state. Pot is, after all, California's biggest cash crop, responsible for $14 billion in annual sales, dwarfing the state's second largest agricultural commodity - milk and cream - which brings in $7.3 billion annually, according to the most recent USDA statistics. The state's tax collectors estimate the bill would bring in about $1.3 billion in much-needed revenue a year, offsetting some of the billions in service cuts and spending reductions outlined in the recently approved state budget.\n\n \n Can Marijuana Help Rescue California&#39;s Economy?",

   "Hemp could save our nation's economy if that bastard William Randolph Hearst hadn't made it illegal because he wanted to make millions from paper manufactured from tree pulp:\n \nDennis Carlson sold his first wheat, grown on a field borrowed from his parents, in 1975, when he was 14 years old. He earned $4.51 a bushel and resolved to follow his father, grandfather and great-grandfather into farming.\n \n Nearly 24 years later, spring wheat is selling for $2.91 a bushel, and Mr. Carlson worries whether he can afford to plant in April. ''We're going to get a low price,'' he said. ''And if we get a bumper crop, it's going to get lower.''\n \n Battered by sinking commodity prices and rising costs, Mr. Carlson and other wheat farmers are looking across the Canadian border at a crop they say could help save them -- if only it were legal here. That crop is hemp, a non-intoxicating look-alike cousin of marijuana grown around the world for its fiber, seed and oil. But long identified with marijuana both by law enforcement and the counterculture, it is banned in the United States as part of the war on drugs.\n\n http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html\n \n \n * George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers GREW HEMP; Washington and Jefferson Diaries. Jefferson smuggled hemp seeds from China to France then to America.\n \n * Benjamin Franklin owned one of the first paper mills in America and it processed hemp. Also, the War of 1812 was fought over hemp. Napoleon wanted to cut off Moscow's export to England; Emperor Wears No Clothes, Jack Herer.\n \n * For thousands of years, 90% of all ships' sails and rope were made from hemp. The word 'canvas' is Dutch for cannabis; Webster's New World Dictionary.\n \n * 80% of all textiles, fabrics, clothes, linen, drapes, bed sheets, etc. were made from hemp until the 1820s with the introduction of the cotton gin.\n \n * The first Bibles, maps, charts, Betsy Ross's flag, the first drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were made from hemp; U.S. Government Archives.\n \n | Illuminati News | The Marijuana Conspiracy - The Real Reason Hemp is Illegal",

   "Hemp could save our nation's economy if that bastard William Randolph Hearst hadn't made it illegal because he wanted to make millions from paper manufactured from tree pulp\n\n Actually, had hemp and marijuana been legal and cultivated widely in this country since 1937, it would have tanked along with the rest of our economy. Right now as an outside industry looking in, it has the potential to generate billions of dollars in California alone. The taxes generated alone from the sale of marijuana could be massive. \n \n The Obama administration has made clear that it is no longer going to support the practice of raiding so called cannabis clubs in California, where \"medical\" marijuana is dispensed. Many in California want to take it a step beyond, and move towards decriminalization and regulation of cannabis in the same way we regulate alcohol. \n \n Will the federal government step in and stop this, or are they going to actually do the constitutional thing and support state's rights to make and enforce their own laws? Will the federal government consider amendment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970?",
