   "In a previous thread, I enquired as to what Britain would ban next (after guns, swords, and evidently, soon to be knives)\n \n It evolved into a discussion about how a violent encounter was (by some) preferable to be entered with fists rather than guns, as it would be less dangerous.\n \n I have since seen additional threads conveying the same line of thought: Guns = bad = criminal = barbaric.\n \n Here is my reply. I intended it as an answer to those elitists who seem to be assured of their own moral superiority because of their aversion to firearms, but since witnessing more recent threads that continue to place blame upon a single inanimate object (as if it were \"more evil\" than another inanimate object) rather than it's user, I decided to place it in an entirely new thread. This way I can invite others, who may not have participated in the previous thread, to offer counterpoints. (And witness the inevitable attempts to obfuscate, rather than address the point)\n \n I am unsure of the original author, but this is my response to those who look down their noses at my barbaric carrying of a firearm while proclaiming their moral superiority by reliance on their civilized manner:\n \n \nHuman beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories, without exception. Reason or force, that's it.\n \n In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.\n \n When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.\n \n There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that we'd be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the mugger's potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat--it has no validity when most of a mugger's potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.\n \n Then there's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don't constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon that's as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldn't work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn't both lethal and easily employable.\n \n When I carry a gun, I don't do so because I am looking for a fight, but because I'm looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don't carry it because I'm afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn't limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation...and that's why carrying a gun is a civilized act.\n\n \n \n Just in case you missed it:\n \n \n \nPeople who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.\n",

This simply isn't the case.\n \n \nWell DUH! What would you expect it to be carried for otherwise, a belt buckle!? Of course it's going to be used against someone else in a defensive situation, that's why they have it!\n \n Despite all the brain washing that's been pumped into you, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using lethal force to protect oneself against harm from another person. The person seeking to cause purposeful and intended harm to another has forfeited their right to not be hurt or even killed by another private citizen.\nA life for an eye? Or, better, a life for trespass?\n As I've said before, I have nothing against lethal force being used where necessary. However, that is rarely the case.\n \n \nBy this logic anyone with a concealed carry permit is more likely to cause harm to another than a criminal. But there's no evidence to support this statement.\nHow?\n However, there is evidence to support the fact that there are more gun crimes than gun self-defences. Feel free to try and argue that line if you want - the last (many) times you've tried, you've reverted to the 2nd amendment within a few posts as an old digression.\n \n \nNot good enough. This is akin to saying the police can only be trusted while armed when they're on duty, but the second the work day is over they've gotta turn them in back at the station or else they might get crazy and start killing people with their duty weapons.\nAgain, how?\n You're projecting your own argument here; we are saying that we trust builders to handle their tools regardless of whether they#re at work or not. It's you who is saying they shouldn't carry outside of hours.\n \n \nWhat's more paranoid: believing that you're safer when carrying a weapon for your own protection; or believing that the only way to be safe from harm is to disarm everybody in the entire city, state, or nation?\n\n If no guns existed, would you still fear being shot?",

   "Way to dismiss almost 12% of the population of the US!\n \n Since when has \"acting like NATOs idealism of Americans\" been an actual qualifier for citizenship?\n\n \n My beef is with the state, not the majority of the people living there.\n \n \nYou realise you're contradicting yourself here, yes? First, you say that just because a builder uses a knife in their job it isn't a good reason for them to be allowed to have one. Then you say that if the government doesn't allow people to have knives based purely on this reason (which you have already dismissed), they would be denying people their jobs - implying that it is a good reason after all.\n \n Make your mind up!\n\n \n I'm not being contradictory. I don't believe job necessity qualifies as a good enough reason why you should be allowed to carry a bladed item, but only for certain applications and not for others.\n \n \nThen you deny that the near-majority of the people who are currently serving time in jail for murder in the US could have legally brought a gun at the time of their crime?\n\n \n \"Could\" doesn't mean the same thing as will, do, or did. I don't believe in preemptive strikes against people who haven't done anything wrong to deserve punishment. Going down that route leads to arresting and imprisoning people when there's no evidence to justify the arrest in the first place.\n \n I don't feel like playing the \"it could've happened\" game. A police officer could suddenly and without warning go on a killing spree with his duty weapons and take out 50 people at a public rally, but that's not good enough reason to insist that all of our officers go disarmed for carrying out their duties.\n \n At any given point of time of any day, any one of a billion possibilities could happen without warning. I personally don't feel like trying to implement bans and restrictions to address each and everyone of these possibilities, no matter how likely or unlikely they are.\n \n \nAllowing 'self-defence' as a valid reason for carrying a weapon removes entirely the point of needing a reason to carry in the first place, as anyone can claim 'self-defence' in the first place.\n\n \n What?\n \n \nI realise that this is your goal in the first place; however, it digresses hugely from the original point where a valid reason is required.\n\n \n I fail to see why anyone should be required to provide a reason at all for carrying a weapon. Despite the rabid mistrust and outright fear of regular people who choose to be armed, there's absolutely no justifiable reason to believe that regular everyday people pose a threat to you or anyone else.\n \n The real people you should worry about are the known criminals who are currently on probation instead of locked away behind bars like they should be.\n \n \nNo, I believe that allowing criminals to make such an argument removes the possibility that a criminal (or soon-to-be) will have their weapon confiscated in the first place.\n\n \n Criminals aren't allowed to possess weapons at all, therefore they can't claim self defense as a reason for being armed. In America we viciously prosecute felons who are found to be in possession of firearms, even if they claim that they had to protect themselves. Felony history = no weapons for you, it's as simple as that.\n \n \nYour 'vision of the real world' is one where criminals meticulously plan every crime they commit beforehand and only carry their weapons when they are on the way to break the law. This simply isn't the case.\n\n \n How about all the cases where the killer took months to plan out their crimes well ahead of the actual date of the incident?\n \n \nA life for an eye?

However, that is rarely the case.\n\n \n Necessary by whose decision? Yours? Or are you going by the model where what qualifies as necessary is judged well after the fact, and not using the standard of what the person actually defending themselves at the time would consider necessary?\n \n The courts in the UK don't have a favorable attitude toward people who dare to fight back against their attackers. In these courts the victim is treated more harshly than the criminal who was attacking them. \n \n \nHowever, there is evidence to support the fact that there are more gun crimes than gun self-defences.\n \n \n What evidence are you referring to? What have you got to back up your argument?\n \n If anything, this statement suggest that we should better focus our attention on taking criminals out of society, instead of leaving them and removing the weapons from the hands of the innocent people.\n \n Can you give a justified excuse for why our efforts to fight crime should focus on trying to take weapons out of the picture, while doing nothing to address those that actually use weapons to abuse others?\n \n \nFeel free to try and argue that line if you want - the last (many) times you've tried, you've reverted to the 2nd amendment within a few posts as an old digression.\n\n \n Just because you don't like the argument of \"It's a right and part of the supreme law of the land\" doesn't mean that it's not a real answer with measurable substance.\n \n However if you want a different argument, here's one: I don't think people who have never done anything wrong, should be punished for the crimes of criminals that we choose to just keep releasing back into the streets; do you?\n \n \nAgain, how?\n You're projecting your own argument here; we are saying that we trust builders to handle their tools regardless of whether they#re at work or not.

I've been looking for them for quite a while now...\n \n Of all the premeditated murders (assuming proportional representation), what about all the cases (~50%) where the killer could legally own a gun at the time of the killing? You have a medley of choices here - either say that premeditated killings are the minority in the US which do not involve firearms, or try to argue that someone who planned a shooting in advance and could legally buy a gun waited until the last minute to steal someone else's on the way to the killing. Or, you could admit that chances are a large proportion of premeditated shootings were committed with legally brought weaponry.\n \n \nWhat part of \"against harm from another person\" gave you the impression that I'm talking about murdering trespassers?\nThe castle doctrine.

In fact, I've addressed the 'freedom vs security' issue before, as well.\n \n To your new argument - as I've said before, do you support age restrictions on firearms?\n \n \nTheir own tools, maybe. Yet you don't trust them with things like pocket knives, because apparently they don't have a good enough reason to be in possession of them.\nMore inconsistency?

Are the above laws good and Constitutional? I don't know, we will see. However, what is important is that I can Conceal Carry a gun or a knife or I can Open Cary a firearm, if I wish, to protect myself and family. \n \n What the California State legislature legislates, and if it has a Liberal Justice system that will go along with it, can be in collusion to ignore the Constitution. That is just a fact. It takes a long time to get the corruption out of the system, and one must be willing to spend a Million Dollars or more, (Heller decision) in order to get your Rights back. Otherwise one must elect legislators who will do the job for you. Like we did here in Ohio.\n \n \nConstitutional rights can be withheld by due process - laws are due process. Laws can go against the constitution, otherwise you'd have felons able to buy guns.\n\n It is absolutely amazing to me how you used the 14th Amendment in the reverse of the reason it of why it was passed in the first place. The State Governments were abusing our Constitutional Rights without due process and We the People passed the 14th. in order to prevent this abuse. Now you point out just how reasonable the Constitution is. Yes, one who commits a bad enough crime, (I.E. Murder) forfeits his or her Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable Rights, but the law-abiding citizen is protected from Governmental abuse by the Bill of Rights.. And YET, courts have also held that a Criminal can use a gun to protect themselves just as long as the law was actually followed. Hence, the Original Right of Self-defense. \n \n \nYour legal quotes seem to contradict each other. The first says that nothing should go against the constitution, but the second says that the people can 'unmake' the constitution - presumably by adding further amendments to it. As the 18th and 21st amendments show, laws based on the constitution are not to be considered as permanent.\n\n I primarily think of Article 5's reason to exist ( to amend the Constitution) is partly below. To correct abuses of the Governmental system. Their are, however, such things called First Rights, Fundamental Rights, and all power belongs in the hands of the citizens. (the 9th Amendment) My second link says \nOne of the Court's most fundamental powers is judicial review&#8211;the power to judge the constitutionality of any act or law of the executive or legislative branch.\n \n The word of the Supreme Court is final. Overturning its decisions often requires an amendment to the Constitution or a revision of Federal law.\n\n Note the two ways of fixing the abusive problem. If the Legislature will not fix it, We the People are the final word. We can amend the Constitution to fix this arrogant abuses, like our predecessors did with the 14th Amendment. \n \n For complete understand, one really needs to ask some pretty fundamental questions. Can one make an amendment that strikes the First Amendment? Or is that Right considered so Fundamental that one needs to overthrow the entire Governmental system, and start a new one, in order to read that out of the Constitution? That is generally how one can unmake the Constitution.

Trying to keep the power in the hands of where it belongs. In the Hands of We the People. \n \n \nAll this is besides the point. NATO has said that California, as an entity, is not 'American'. I'd like to see his proof.\n \n Why is it important to you that the protesters are armed?\n \n Question the second: historically, how often do peaceful armed protests stay peaceful?\n\n What I am interested in, is that EVERYBODY to include the Government, Law Enforcement, and We the People, obey the laws but especially the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land. \n \n Government is to be a servant to the People. We are never supposed to fear our Government. Never! Any time we fear our Government, our Government is abusing the authority We the People granted them in order to get the jobs done.",

   "excerpt -IX. The Lessons of Athens\n Those who took up arms in Athens, Tennessee:\n \n wanted honest elections, a cornerstone of our Constitutional order; \n had repeatedly tried to get Federal or State election monitors; \n used armed force so as to minimize harm to the law-breakers; \n showed little malice to the defeated law-breakers; \n restored lawful government. \n The Battle of Athens clearly shows:\n \n how Americans can and should lawfully use armed force; \n why the Rule of Law requires unrestricted access to firearms; \n how civilians with military-type firearms can beat the forces of \"law and order\". \n Dictators believe that public order is more important than the Rule of Law. However, Americans reject this idea. Criminals can exploit for selfish ends, the use armed force to restore the Rule of Law. But brutal political repression - as practiced by Cantrell and Mansfield - is lethal to many. An individual criminal can harm a handful of people. Governments alone can brutalize thousands, or millions.\n \n Since 1915, officials of seven governments \"gone bad\" have committed genocide, murdering at least 56 million persons, including millions of children. \"Gun control\" clears the way for genocide by giving governments \"gone bad\" far greater freedom to commit mass murder.\n \n Law-abiding McMinn Countians won the Battle of Athens because they were not hamstrung by \"gun control\". McMinn Countians showed us when citizens can and should use armed force to support the Rule of Law. We are all in their debt.\n \n This is a bare bones summary of a major report in JPFO's Firearms Sentinel (January 1995). To learn how the gutsy people of Athens, Tennessee did the Framers of the Constitution proud, send $3 to JPFO, 2872 South Wentworth Avenue; Milwaukee, WI 53207; and request the January 1995 Firearms Sentinel.

   "Hence you saying \"they sure don't act like they are [part of America]\"? Very well, I will rephrase the question. Since when has 'having laws which meets NATOs ideology' been a qualifier for a state to be part of the US?\n\n \n It isn't, but California has made themselves a laughing stock to the rest of America. They continually legislate and look for solutions when there's no problem. They banned the use of lead ammunition for hunting, based not on any scientific evidence but rather animal rights extremist BS, that lead ammunition was poisoning the condors and would drive them to extinction.\n \n They passed the highly flawed microstamping law, claiming that it couldn't fail because criminals are too stupid to know how to properly take their guns apart, find these mark locations, and obliterate them with a file.\n \n Twice San Francisco passed a law that would outright ban handgun ownership in the city, and twice they've been b****slapped by the courts, telling them they don't have the authority to do that. Then the city banned bottled water.\n \n They've also banned commonly available single shot rifles, even though they were never used in any crimes.\n \n California has no respect anymore. We know them as the People's Republic of Kalifornia now because of the way they act.\n \n \nSo you don't think people should be allowed to carry their tools to work, but should be allowed to carry knives for 'self-protection'?\n\n \n Basically. Because it's job equipment isn't a good excuse for why you can carry a bladed tool during established work hours, but after the day's over you no longer have \"good reason\" to be in possession of a potential weapon. To me this is no different than the anti-Second Amendment crowd claiming that only the military and police have a reason to be armed, while everyone else has no reason to be.\n \n \nDo you support laws enforcing an age limit on the possession of weaponry?\n\n \n Not really.\n \n \nDo you support laws which prevent felons from owning weaponry? Both of these are simply addressing 'possibilities'.\n\n \n Yes I do, because this doesn't qualify as a \"could've happened\" incident.\n \n \nCrime in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n How many of these crimes were carried out by 'criminals currently on probation'?\n\n \n We've already covered this, countless times. Federal Bureau of Investigation - Press Release\n \n \"Criminal gangs commit as much as 80 percent of the crime in many communities, according to law enforcement officials throughout the nation. Typical gang-related crimes include alien smuggling, armed robbery, assault, auto theft, drug trafficking, extortion, fraud, home invasions, identity theft, murder, and weapons trafficking.\"\n \n \nPlease note that, if you trace this strand of the debate backwards, you changed the wording from my use of the word 'thugs' to your use of the word 'criminals' a few posts back. It looks like my mistake was hoping that you were simply being figurative and choosing to match your use of the language - ah well. Substitute 'thugs', or 'gang members without a criminal history', or whatever term you feel to be appropriate here. \n The point stands.\n\n \n Nice attempt to try and derail the argument. But it won't work. Whether I use one term of a violent criminal individual or another is irrelevant to the discussion.\n \n \nIf you have the figures on what proportion of murders are premeditated, I'd love to see them. I've been looking for them for quite a while now...\n\n \n I refuse to believe the majority of the murders that take place in America are random acts that the killer decided on five seconds before actually doing it. Being stabbed by an abusive spouse in the kitchen, granted that's not a long thought out process with heavy premeditation. However I see no evidence to support the concept that somebody will just randomly walk up to some person and, for no reason, shoot and kill them just because they were both there.\n \n \nOf all the premeditated murders (assuming proportional representation), what about all the cases (~50%) where the killer could legally own a gun at the time of the killing? You have a medley of choices here - either say that premeditated killings are the minority in the US which do not involve firearms, or try to argue that someone who planned a shooting in advance and could legally buy a gun waited until the last minute to steal someone else's on the way to the killing. Or, you could admit that chances are a large proportion of premeditated shootings were committed with legally brought weaponry.\n\n \n In round numbers, exactly how many people are we talking about here?\n \n As I've said before, I really don't care. I don't give a single damn about these people who had clean records, who later committed their first offense and got caught. And I don't see why you're making such a big damn deal about it either. S**t happens and things aren't always as we like them to be. Get over it.\n \n \nThe castle doctrine. To quote your words: \"It shields you from lawsuits against the person who sought to harm you, or had no legal right to be in the same location as you, if they become injured ... through action on your part\".\n\n \n Because criminal trespassers have sued homeowners for injuries sustained on the property. Before the Castle Doctrine, somebody could climb over your locked fence, walk up to your front door, and break their ankle by stepping in a mole hole, and they'd be able to sue you for that.\n \n Notice how you omitted the last part of my sentence, \"or through their own stupidity\".\n \n \nDoes NCVS ring any bells? I can go dig up the threads if you really want, but I'm sure you should be able to remember them...\n\n \n Is this another one of those \"studies\" that tries to pull the old correlation/causation bait and switch trick to try and prove that gun owners are more likely to be violent than anyone else?\n \n \nConfiscating a weapon 'pre-emptively' is much better than locking someone away 'pre-emptively'.\n\n \n No it isn't, because you never manage to confiscate the weapon that would be used to harm someone. You can pass all these laws restricting a person's ability to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, but not one of them is gonna keep a criminal entity from acquiring a gun through other channels and using it on their intended victim. All you're doing is keeping the victim from being able to protect themselves. You might as well be tying their hands up and presenting them to the criminal as a gift.\n \n \nI agree that more should be done after the fact. But more should be dne to prevent it in the first place, as well.\n\n \n Prevent what exactly?\n \n \nTo your new argument - as I've said before, do you support age restrictions on firearms?\n\n \n School shootings were almost non-existent before we introduced age restrictions. Now they're happening all over the place an in greater numbers. I don't think the restriction has done anything meaningful, so I don't support them.\n \n I refuse to support something that offers absolutely no detectable or measurable benefit.\n \n \nMore inconsistency? I thought you'd just said that you didn't trust them...\n\n \n No, I said that being job related isn't what I consider \"good reason\", just as I feel your standard of \"good reason\" for being allowed to own a gun is unacceptable.\n \n I'm going to explain how I see it. Being able to carry a tool that might qualify as a weapon, for the purpose of doing your job, is in the best interest of the government. If you have your tools, you can do your job, earn your income, and pay your taxes that go back to the government. It's in their best interest that you stay working, that's why you get to be \"armed\" during working hours. But when you wish to be armed when it's in your best interest instead of the government, because you don't want to be attacked by yobs or be mugged for the fifth time in a two month period, that's not alright and they won't allow it.\n \n When your job connects you to the government, your job isn't \"good reason\" to have bladed tools.\n \n \nAs to pocket knives - they're fully legal to carry in the UK as long as they're shorter than 3 inches long. Speaking as a previous scout, pocket knives are fine and legal.\n\n \n No they aren't. The jacket to die for: TK Maxx takes hooded coat with concealed 2.5 inch blade off its shelves | Mail Online \n \n \nConsider your original hypothetical scenario: \"What's more paranoid: believing that you're safer when carrying a weapon for your own protection; or believing that the only way to be safe from harm is to disarm everybody in the entire city, state, or nation?\".\n\n \n What of it?\n \n \nFirearms were simply an example I used to show that - if you really could disarm everyone - the world would, indeed, be a much safer place.\n\n \n No it wouldn't! If you remove guns then you go back to the old standard where the strongest person wins by default whether they're right or wrong. The most physically fit could freely abuse anyone simply because nobody would be able to match them in strength. Anybody capable of being a professional NFL player would automatically become \"right\" because nobody could stand up to them without being their back broken.\n \n You're obviously not a student of human behavior. Nobody bent on causing harm to another is just going to quit their activities if they have to take a route that would get their hands dirty and force them to get within choking distance of their victim.\n \n \nI agree that this is not possible (ban rocks?), but firearms regulation is a step in the right direction.\n\n \n Again, no it isn't. No matter the law that gets passed, you'll never, under any circumstances, be able to regulate the guns current in the hands of criminals and flowing through the black market. There are tens of millions in existence, all of them beyond the scope of legal limitations, and there's not a single thing any law can do about it.\n \n \nHave you found your evidence that no brits can buy walking sticks yet?\n\n \n Upon further research I discovered I was wrong. It wasn't a government passed mandate, but rather the adopted policy of pharmacies and other companies that sell walking aids; no prescription from a doctor, no cane. Just like with the store that refuses to sell pizza cutters unless you can prove you're old enough to legally own one.\n \n \nHow about evidence that builders can't carry their tools to work in the UK?\n\n \n I don't remember saying they couldn't. I remember saying that doing your job so you can pay the government the tax money they're charging you doesn't qualify as \"good reason\" for why you get to be \"armed\" while on the job. It isn't \"good reason\" when it's in the best interest of the government.",

   " Constitutional rights can be withheld by due process - laws are due process. Laws can go against the constitution, otherwise you'd have felons able to buy guns. \n\n \n I would disagree with this. Laws which \"go against the Constitution\" do not survive contact with it. Laws that prohibit possession of firearms by felons exist because the RKBA is not so broad in scope as to protect a felon's right to have firearms. Thus the restriction within the law is deemed constitutional: \n \n \"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. . . Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\n \n District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 54-55 (2008) See also Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 68 (1980) (mentioning in a footnote laws which prohibit felons from possessing firearms):\n \n \"These legislative restrictions on the use of firearms are neither based upon constitutionally suspect criteria, nor do they trench upon any constitutionally protected liberties.\"\n \n However, I would note that in at least my state the law recognizes that a felon who is otherwise prohibited can arm himself with a firearm for self-defense in an emergency situation. \n \n I'm not sure that fighting over whether England bans items which neither England nor the United States recognize a right to possess has much value, but I still invite all to comment/agree/disagree with what is said here. I got into this thread more because T.Q.'s behavior has attracted my curiosity.\n \n I'm sorry, T.Q., but the condescension in what you said to Iangb struck a nerve with me. Why not adopt the same attitude as Iangb and others and get into the discussion? It can be done without rancor. Although we frequently disagree he respects me, and so I show him respect in return. It may be safer to treat those who disagree with you by endorsing a policy of silent contempt, but don't you find the give and take of honest debate more stimulating?\n \n In my opinion Iangb and others like him deserve credit for their willingness to enter the arena and engage others in debate.\n \n ---\n \n \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\"\" Theodore Roosevelt \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France April 23, 1910.",

   "From The Times\n March 6, 2008\n Police face new test: how to stop child of 8 armed with a gun?\n Adam Fresco, Crime Correspondent\n Recommend?\n \n It is only a matter of time before an armed officer is faced with having to shoot a child pointing a gun at them, a senior Home Office official has said.\n \n Children as young as 8 are growing up with guns in their lives and think nothing of storing or transporting firearms for gang leaders, said Jon Murphy, head of the gun crime task force.\n \n \"It's a classic no-win situation,\" he added. \"The volatility of these kids may make them pull the trigger. If they are challenged by an armed officer it is their inability to rationalise what is happening that will put the officer in a difficult position.\n \n \"I cannot see a way, with the way that things are going, that this awful scenario is not going to happen. As soon as they point the gun at the officer the officer will have no choice but to shoot. Fifteen years ago a gang feud may have been settled with a fist fight, ten years ago with a knife fight but now it will be guns.\"\n \n In the past five years the number of young people prosecuted for firearms offences has risen by 20 per cent.\n \n Speaking at the first European Serious Organised Crime Conference, in Liverpool, Mr Murphy told The Times that for many youngsters gangs took the place of a family.\n \n Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, told the conference about a Lithuanian gang that had \"steadily been increasing the flow of illegal firearms\". The guns ended up \"in the hands of those too young, too bad or too foolish to do other than shoot each other with them\", he added.\n \n - Police in Merseyside have a plan aimed at key criminals, based on a successful US operation to cut gun crime in Boston. They have drawn up a hitlist of the main suspects and have promised they will get \"very special attention\". Detective Chief Superintendent Stephen Moore said: \"If you use a gun you will be seeing us sooner rather than later.\"",

   "Isle of War: England's social collapse - violent crime wave\n National Review, Dec 31, 2002 by Theodore Dalrymple\n \n \n \n For many years, Britons consoled themselves for their loss of global influence with the reflection that at least they lived in a civilized and relatively crime-free country, unlike the all-conquering Americans, whose savagery and violence was the subject of condescending self- congratulation. In like fashion, Americans tended to think that Britain was an admirably law-abiding and honest society, unlike their own.\n \n Things have changed dramatically in the last few decades, though perceptions lag behind. From being one of the most crime-free societies that have ever existed, Britain has gone straight to the top of the crime standings. Figures recently published by the United Nations show that Britons are now several times more likely to be the victim of every kind of violent crime, with the admittedly important exception of murder, than Americans. No house is safe from theft, no car, no possession whatsoever.\n Related Results\n \n * Substance Abuse Raises Crime Risk in Schizophrenics\n * World Tonight: Crime figures\n * Recorded violent crime down and overall crime stable.\n * Two sides to crime stats in Kirklees\n * First knife crime figures published\n \n One sign of the general reign of insecurity in Britain is the traffic jams on our roads in the mornings and afternoons during the school year. Ninety percent of British children are now driven to school by their parents, all other means of going there being too dangerous. During school vacations, our roads are much freer of traffic.\n \n Of course, it is the poorer sections of society that are most affected by the crime tsunami. (Burglars are lazy or stupid or simply poorly supplied with transport: They mainly burgle the houses of people who live near them.) It is extremely difficult to get this rather elementary fact into the heads of the British intelligentsia, which for decades has preferred to believe that, by siding with the criminals rather than with their victims, and by promoting measures that have made it ever more difficult to catch and punish criminals, it is expressing sympathy for the poor. In fact, the poor need the protection of the police and the law far more than the rich do.\n \n Large areas of Britain are now effectively beyond the reach of the law. My patients not infrequently relate that their houses have been broken into three times in a year. The criminals are merciless and have no respect for age, or compassion for the unfortunate. They will rob people in wheelchairs and wait outside banks for the elderly and infirm to emerge. An old working-class patient of mine, who lived through the Depression and lost members of her family during the war, both in the armed services and during air raids, has been robbed and burgled so many times that she now treats all her possessions as temporary or disposable. The mentally handicapped are favored prey, as they cannot fight back and hardly even realize what is happening to them. If there is honor among thieves, I have yet to see it.\n \n The level of violence in British society beggars description. Last night, the body of a man who had been shot dead was unceremoniously dumped outside the door of my hospital. When I was in training as a doctor -- not so very many years ago -- I would be called to the emergency room to see a man with a stab-wound because it was felt by my teachers that there would not be many chances for me to see another such injury, so rare were incidents of violence at the time.\n \n Casual violence is now woven into the fabric British life. No baseball is played in Britain, and it is all but impossible to buy a baseball here, but sales of baseball bats are extremely strong, as weapons against one's neighbors. Whenever a young man tells me that he has suffered a head injury such as a fractured skull, I ask, \"Baseball bat?\" to which the answer, nine times out of ten, is yes.\n \n Likewise, machetes are sold in large numbers, though sugar cane does not generally grow in our slums. Machete wounds, by contrast, are commonplace. In some areas, the majority of children as young as seven and eight carry knives, and are ready -- perhaps \"eager\" would be a better word -- to use them. No sensible adult would dare any longer to challenge the misbehavior on buses and elsewhere of children older than seven or eight: As a nation, we are now scared of our own children. This is because they are well aware of their own legal impunity, and are ready to take advantage of it.\n \n Impunity and judicial leniency create a vicious circle. The Metropolitan Police report that more than a half of all summonsed witnesses to crimes do not show up at trial for fear of reprisals by criminals, their families, and friends. Many of the prisoners on remand in the prison where I work assure me that they will be acquitted for lack of evidence: Not that there is any such lack of evidence against them, but that there is no one to testify. A man has little to lose by intimidating witnesses, for even if caught -- the chances of which are slight -- he will be dealt with leniently.\n \n I am not talking here of members of organized-crime syndicates, but rather of the ordinary petty criminals who have proliferated in working-class areas. Anyone who complains to the police in such areas of having had his house burgled, or of having been viciously attacked, is known and treated as an informer. It is thus the moral duty of every freeborn Englishman to allow his house to be burgled and his person to be assaulted without demur.",

   "\" In Britain, anyone looking to get high without the criminal side effects can go online or walk into a head shop and buy perfectly legal alternatives to a whole host of illegal drugs, from marijuana to ecstasy to cocaine. But not for long. On Tuesday, Aug. 25, the U.K. government announced it is set to ban these so-called legal highs by the end of the year. The ban on designer drugs such as stimulant BZP, narcotic alternative gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and cannabis imitator Spice is being described as a precautionary measure, with the aim of getting the substances off the shelves before they've gained much notoriety - and before thorough studies have been done on how much harm they do to users.\n With this new legislation, Britain joins the growing number of European countries that have tackled legal highs over the past several years. For now, dozens of U.K.-based websites and shops are still free to market and sell alternatives to illegal drugs and to ship them to any country that doesn't yet prohibit them. It's these legal drug dealers that the British ban seeks to target. \"The priority will be to chase suppliers rather than users,\" says Martin Barnes, head of Drugscope, a nonprofit that studies drug use in the U.K., and a member of the advisory board that recommended the new bans. ...... \"\n \n \n The War on Designer Drugs: Britain Bans Legal Highs - TIME",
