   "Resolved; The terms \"atheism\", and \"evolution\" are closely related, because of what they mean, and how they are used, both politically and scientifically. \n\n obvious_child, do not accept this resolution. It is utterly ridiculous. What the hell does \"closely related\" mean? What conclusions can we draw if \"atheism\" and \"evolution\" are \"closely related\"? All marc would have to do to \"win\" with this resolution is cite half a dozen creationist wacko websites (e.g. AiG, ICR) and say, \"See? They use the two terms interchangeably, and they talk about 'science' and politics. I win!\"\n marc continually calls evolution positively atheistic; if he's so damn sure that evolution is atheistic, he shouldn't have come up with such an impotent resolution. I personally see this as a lame attempt to sneak a quick one by someone who is eager to deliver a well-deserved kick in the pants.\n \n I suspect that marc might come up with a retort like, \"if you're so damn sure that they're not 'closely related,' then why can't you accept the resolution?\" One reason is that the resolution means nothing; it can be met without any significant statement being made. For example, one might claim that because most atheists are evolutionists, atheism and evolution are \"closely related.\" But this tells us nothing about the nature of evolution. (In fact, we could make the same argument replacing for Catholicism and evolution.)\n Another reason is that just because a certain ilk uses the terms in a related way doesn't mean they actually are related. After all, marc could just point to his own numerous assertions in the Creation/Evolution forum that evolution is atheistic and \"prove\" that the terms are used in a related way. Again, this is absurd.\n \n The resolution needs to completely non-vague and free of wordplay. You'll have enough trouble with the two main terms.\n \n \nAtheism\n :a disbelief in the existence of deity b : the doctrine that there is no deity\n\n Because marc has a tendency to be highly dishonest, not to mention a tendency to equate nonreligion/secularism with atheism, I think you should consider clarifying from the get-go that non-theism is not atheism.\n \n \nEvolution:\n : The change in allele frequencies over time\n\n While this is perfectly acceptable, I expect nothing less than a virtual hissy fit from marc on this one. The good news is that even more profound statements of evolutionary theory (e.g. common descent, RM+NS) are not atheistic, so you might even let him fudge a notch or two toward his goal.\n \n \nI'm not going to enter into one of your little definition changing idiot matches.\n\n Oh, well in that case, there may be no debate at all... emoticon_xgood",

   "Here's how all this got started;\n\n How this got started is that marc repeatedly made a claim that he couldn't and therefore refused to even attempt to back up.\n \n \nI was having one of my usual discussions (myself, vs 9 (count em, 9) atheists in the Creation vs. Evolution forum.\n\n As has been pointed out, notice how everybody who disagrees with marc is considered an atheist. (I wonder if he thinks that's an insult...)\n \n \nKnowing that Richard Dawkins, a militant atheist, made this statement;\n\n I'll just echo obvious_child here....\n \n \nKnowing that Willaim Provine said this;\n\n And here.\n \n \nKnowing that \"the only democratic national atheist organization in the United States\" enthusiastically puts \"The wonders of evolution\", and it's importance in teaching it to the smallest of children at the top of it's web page;\n\n As has been pointed out multiple times by myself alone, just because a viewpoint is endorsed by people who hold another viewpoint does not mean the two viewpoints must be \"related,\" at least in the sense that marc uses when the chips aren't down. For example, I suppose most atheists support atomic theory, but does that mean that atomic theory is atheistic? According to marc's logic, it must be. (We can also conclude that evolutionary theory is Catholic while it's busy being atheistic...)\n \n \nI can't help but be just a tad annoyed when, for the umpteenth time, an atheist mocks me for thinking that there just might be a chance that evolution and atheism could have a relationship with each other.\n\n And the backtracking continues. Notice how marc's claim morphs from the positive assertion that evolution is atheistic to a mere assertion that atheism and evolution are related. It's marc's attempt at revisionary history, but the record shows that marc is simply spouting bald-faced lies with this claim. I addressed the discrepancy between the claim he's making here and the claim he's made dozens of times in the C/E forum above.\n \n \nI suggest he make a formal resolution, and he refuses - his helper suggests that ~I~ make a resolution, even though I didn't start that thread.\n\n marc apparently despises me so much that he refuses to use my name. No matter, really; I'll fess up. Yes, I've contributed to the thread. Whatever marc is insinuating by repeated referring to me as a \"helper\" is probably simply due to his conspiracy theorist way of thinking; nobody has asked me for assistance.\n I suggested that marc make the formal challenge because he is the one repeating the assertion ad nauseam, and he suggested a formal debate. I felt that his making the proposal himself would give him some sort of defense against our claims that he refuses to support his position.\n \n \nAnd then he and his helper cry about it, and refuse to accept it, even though it was on topic. The key word was \"related\", and it fit with his assertion about my \"asinine idea that evolution is atheistic\".\n\n More lies. Whether A is \"related\" to B is not whether A is B. marc did not simply claim that atheism and evolutionary theory have some relationship of some level of severity, he claimed that evolutionary theory is atheistic. When the chips were down, he chose to avoid defending his own assertion, and instead set the bar so low that he tripped over it. As evidenced by his current hemming and hawing, it is clear that he purposely formulated the resolution to be vague and meaningless.\n \n \nThen, he has a renewed interest in making his own resolution, with the words -based-, and -dependent upon-, which were nowhere to be found in his taunt thread.\n\n Part of agreeing to a debate is deciding on a resolution, which often takes compromise. The counter-resolution is in perfect harmony with your repeated insistence throughout the C/E forum that evolution is atheistic.\n \n \nMy word \"related\" followed his taunts perfectly. \n\n Bull chips. The word \"related\" does not appear in the entire thread until he updates the thread with your antics in this thread (that is, after you've floated your poor excuse for a resolution and have avoided a meaningful one).\n \n \nI'm not complaining - this place cracks me up. I don't expect to ever see obvious_child or electrolyte enter a formal debate here.\n\n I don't see you making any challenges toward me, so you can keep your misplaced, self-righteous arrogance on hold. You know perfectly well that I'd rip you a new one would you ever agree to a meaningful resolution I'm qualified to debate.\n \n \nBecause it's simply too obviously true?\n\n How many times do we have to explain that it's meaningless?\n \n \nAll he'd have to do is load that up with materalistic, scientific jargon by Kenneth Miller, and there's no way I could connect it positively to atheism.\n\n There's no way you could connect it positively with atheism if all he did was sit there twiddling his thumbs and not posting. That's how weak your position is.\n What's sad is that obvious_child could avoid Miller altogether and still make mincemeat out of marc with a meaningful resolution.\n \n \nHow about; \"Atheism is neither based on nor dependent upon evolutionary principles\". I'd do the negative on that one. That's more relevant, more in line with what was going on in the \"Question for both sides\" thread.\n\n Whoa! Talk about a complete one-eighty. First evolution is atheistic (A is based on B), then we backtrack to A is related to B, now atheism is evolutionistic (B is based on A)? Does marc really think that there were no atheists before Darwin?\n Ironically, that resolution could be interpreted as considering atheism an evolving belief (i.e. it adapts to changes in environment a.k.a. available information), which some might consider it to be.\n \n \nI did, and they won't accept it\n\n You quite clearly haven't proposed an alternative wording until this post. How could you say that \"we\" (not obvious_child, says the conspiracy theorist) won't accept something when you haven't even proposed it, unless you know your alternative is ridiculous too?\n \n \nWithout a judge, and without trolls. Telling them to stay out probably wouldn't work. Would you delete trolls posts as soon after they happen as possible? \n\n Wait, you want a formal debate without a judge? Not unheard of, but interesting nonetheless, especially after your repeated references to wins and losses and accusing your opponent(s) of being afraid of losing.\n By all means, delete all posts in the formal debate thread that don't belong there. That's what Ringside is for. And we don't have to worry about trolls there, because -- as a debate participant -- marc can't post there until after the conclusion of the debate.",

   "No, I'd have to show that Dawkins' opinion has influence, in politics and public schools. He's a scientist and a best selling author, and if any public school teacher or politician wants to use his words as an example, no matter how blatent or subtle his reference to atheism might be, it's not considered by the courts to be a violation of separation of church & state. \n\n \n You'd have to show that Dawkins' statement is actually quoted in public schools. I've asked several creationists on several boards to provide a documented case where evolution is taught as atheism in public schools. I've yet to hear of a single case. Do you have one?\n \n Using Dawkins' comments on how evolution works would not count.\n \n BTW, how would you deal with these remarks by Dawkins, where he acknowledges it would be possible for God to introduce favorable mutations and, thus, affect evolution?\n \n \"Darwinism is widely misunderstood as a theory of pure chance. Mustn't it have done something to provoke this canard? Well, yes, there is something behind the misunderstood rumour, a feeble basis to the distortion. One stage in the Darwinian process is indeed a chance process -- mutation. Mutation is the process by which fresh genetic variation is offered up for selection and it usually described as random. But Darwinians make the fuss that they do about the \"randomness\" of mutation only in order to contrast it to the non-randomness of selection, the other side of the process. It is not necessary that mutation should be random in order for natural selection to work. Selection can still do its work whether mutation is directed or not. Emphasizing that mutation can be random is our way of calling attention to the crucial fact that, by contrast, selection is sublimely and quintessentially non-random. It is ironic that this emphasis on the contrast between mutation and the non-randomness of selection has led people to think that the whole theory is a theory of chance. ...\n One could imagine a theoretical world in which mutations were biased toward improvement. Mutations in this hypothetical world would be non-random not just in the sense that mutations induced by X-rays are non-random: these hypothetical mutations would be systematically biased to keep one jump ahead of selection and anticipate the needs of the organism ...\n Darwinians wouldn't mind if such providential mutations were provided. It wouldn't undermine Darwinism, though it would put paid to its claims for exclusivity: a tailwind on a transatlantic flight can speed up your arrival in an agreeable way, and this doesn't undermine your belief that the primary force that got you home is the jet engine.\" R Dawkins, Climbing Mt. Improbable, pp 80- 82.\n \n \nIn today's politics and public schools, what subject other than the purposelessness of evolution would an atheist use to convince someone of his political beliefs?\n\n \n Who says evolution is \"puroseless\". Eugenie Scott (an atheist) got that term removed from the BSC definition of evolution. Precisely because it does not belong there.\n \n \nAt least one of them, and maybe more, are teachers. Do you think they take pains to avoid projecting their beliefs to their students?\n\n \n Yes, I do. Can you document they don't?\n \n Your argument depends on innuendo, not facts. Unless you can document where evolution is being taught as atheism, you have no case.",

   "He has to prove that evolution itself independent of politics and religion and everything else is athiestic. \n\n \n That's true, but that's a separate claim than the one I was addressing. The major claim is that evlolution is atheistic. But there is a minor claim that evolution is being taught as atheistic. I was, in what you quoted, only addressing the minor claim. I've addressed the major claim elsewhere.\n \n \nThere's a obvious reason why he's in huge definance of accepting the textbook definitions of atheism and evolution because he knows he has no argument structure without the ability to ignore or change the terms as he sees fit. Zachvac obviously understands this and refuses to accept the debate without predefined definitions.\n\n \n Well, most evolutionary biologists don't accept the \"textbook\" definition of \"change of alleles with time\". That leaves out too much that is crucial to evolution. That \"definition\" is favored by population geneticists and molecular biologists. Ernst Mayr, Francisco Ayala, and Douglas Futuyma don't like it, for the reasons I stated. However, we could use the longer definition found in Futuyma's Evolutionary Biology.\n \n In the strategy of a debate, I think your analysis of Marc's position is correct. In the larger context, however, creationists see evolution as atheistic because it does deny their god: a literal inerrant Bible. The reason we say evolution is not atheistic is because evolution doesn't deny God.\n \n So the problem with definitions is not really about the definitions of atheism or evolution, it's the definition of \"god\" and what Marc considers his god.",
