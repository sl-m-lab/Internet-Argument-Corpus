   "NOW Joins Call for Emergency Gulf Coast Renewal Plan\n Statement of NOW President Kim Gandy\n Five months after Hurricane Katrina revealed the complete inability of the Bush administration to respond to domestic disaster, I am proud, as a New Orleanian myself, to stand with the People's Hurricane Relief Fund, the Hip Hop Caucus, Rainbow/PUSH, UP for Democracy, and others in demanding that the Administration and its friends in Congress stop stalling, stop giving out no-bid contracts to people who can't do the job, stop punishing the survivors because FEMA still hasn't managed to process their applications -- and start cooperating in the restoration of our ravaged Gulf Coast and its people.\n \n As we gathered today on Capitol Hill to strategize sorely-needed Katrina assistance legislation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is trying again to evict thousands of Katrina survivors from their temporary housing. These survivors are struggling to find jobs, clothing, food for their families -- and now the federal government wants to take away the roof over their heads...again. While agencies bicker, the survivors are falling off of the nation's radar screen. It's long overdue for them to be a central part of the process.\n \n While Bush and his fellow Republicans congratulate themselves for passing a budget that slashes programs to help the poor, the costs of this partly-Bush-made disaster have surpassed $150 billion. Unfortunately, actual survivors have seen very little of that money, and even now Bush and his pals are planning more tax cuts for their wealthy friends, which will again increase the federal deficit and make it even more difficult to find the funding to help these survivors continue to rebuild their lives. \n \n As allies in the Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign, we will be calling for a rebuilding plan that focuses on survivors, not developers; temporary and long-term housing assistance; jobs and training; family reunification; funding for quality public education; health care (especially mental health care and reproductive health care); recognition that Katrina assistance is not welfare; preference for local businesses and labor in rebuilding contracts; and much more. This past-due plan will require support from compassionate leaders and progressive activists if it is to succeed.\n \n This country must do whatever it takes to alleviate the misery and uncertainty of Katrina survivors and help them rebuild their lives. Their government failed them, and many lost their lives. For others, their lives will never be the same. There have been enough questions; now it's time for answers.",

Same with \"not-so-bright\" Californians who continue to build on the fault lines, on hills and ledges and with a \"little\" rain, their hilltop home is now in the valley, but let's rebuild they say. Same with Floridians who have many, many, many trailer parks in the HURRICANE STATE. Come on now, laws in florida should outlaw loosely attached \"mobile\" housing, which once detached are mobile! When Million dollar beach front homes are washed away on both coasts are we really going to act suprised????\n \n While most natural disasters can be uncertain, many are certain and if we know of a environmental/nature danger that is consistant year after year and we continue to build in these zones, well, they, who live there need to assume full responsibility for themselves and their property, and insure accordingly, and LEAVE when danger is knocking on your doorstep.",

   "what burns me up about the current mess in LA, particularly NO, is that the entire areas was designated by FEMA as a flood area, so subsidized flood insurance was available to those folks. CHEP flood insurance, but only about 5% of the population took advatage of it because they figured if it ever flooded, the governement would pay for everything.\n \n It is time to stop subsidizing stupidity in this country. These anti-natural selection measures are expensive and bad for the country. If people are foolish enough to live in a city built below sea level in a huricane zone, do we really want them breeding?\n \n If you live in a house on filled marsh ladn in florida and your house gets swept out to sea, I don't think you have any right to complain, and should not expect the taxpayers to compensate you for your loss. The same goes for people who choose to live on fault lines. Sure, it is their right to live there. It is not their right to expect the rest of us to pay for their stupidity. If you live on the slopes of an active volcano, expect no sympathy from me when the lava comes rolling across your lawn. \n \n Granted sometimes nature throws us a curve ball.

If you choose to take a gamble like that, expecting others to pay off the debt from that gamble is pretty sad.",

Not so. We are just returning to the norm after a 50 yr stretch of relative calm. Last years hurricane season was actually mild when you consider the average number of hurricanes over the last 100 years. The relative complacency has led some to forget the dangers of living somewhere idiotic like New Orleans.\n \n By the time Katrina hit NO, it was only a category 2 storm. There have been category 2 storms every year in history. Any one of them could have hit NO and wiped it out. They have just been very, very lucky. Their luck ran out. If the alst couple of years are any indicator, we are returning to a more normal storm pattern, which means that it will probably not be too terribly wrong before NO gets \"unlucky\" again, and those stupid enought to live below sea level in hurricane country are once again holding their hands out for more federal aid.",

I think it is about time for NOW to change their name to National Organization of Hateful Egotiscal Liberal People aka NO-HELP.
