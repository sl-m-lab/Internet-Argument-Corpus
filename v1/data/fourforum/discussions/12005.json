The left must want another 9-11. Biden was dead wrong when he said that Obama had a spine of steal. I'd be amazed if he had a spine at all. He thinks that he can talk his way out of every problem. I garuntee you that no Jihadist will be charmed by his silver tounge.\n \n \nSupport the troops?\n \n You bet. I support them so much that I want them home before a single one more of them is KIA.\n\n \n Why? So you can greet them by spitting on them and calling them \"baby-killers\"? The hippies always did that in the 60s, what makes you so sure people have become so much better? Kids don't even respect their parents anymore, I see parents called the most vile things by their kids. Witness the fruits of positive reinforcement. \n \n \nOf course, if control of Iraqi oil is the motivation...\n\n \n Preventing another 9-11 is the motivation. That's why I don't like hippies. They depict anyone who disagrees with them as a thoroughly vile, evil, despicable person who deserves to rot in the firey depths of hell for the heinous crimes against humanity he's committed. Sorry, but it doesn't work that way.",

   "Eth,\n \n Still can't describe what \"Victory in Iraq\" will look like, we see.\n\n \n Protecting the Iraqis until their military is self-sufficient. I thought I explained this to you. \n \n \nHow many times must the evidence that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 before you believe it?\n\n \n How many times must the evidence be presented that I'm not refering to him before you believe it?\n \n \nIf an attack on the USA comes from Iraq, it will be solely and completely as a result of our brutal occupation.\n\n \n This is sad. It seems you don't have as much respect for the troops as you say you do. Did you even donate a penny to them? Thought not. Don't you have any idea what the Army Corps of Engineers have done to improve the lives of Iraqi residents? For the first time in history, many towns in Iraq have plumbing and electricity. But are ignorant and apathetic, and you have proven many times in the past that you don't care about another human's suffering as long as your round belly is full.\n \n \nBTW, that's the reason I have no use for righties. Like Mao, they think that all power comes from the barrel of a gun.\n \n Such ANGER!!emoticon_angry \n \n SHEESH!!\n\n \n Can you support this, or is this just more of your preposterous generalizations and intolerance? It's odd that you always complain about others not \"disagreeing without being disagreeable.\" What goes around comes around.",
