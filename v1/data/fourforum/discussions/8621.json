   "Romanian officials are enduring some crisis which has to do with some force departments and special services' chiefs leaving their posts. According to official information the reason for it is disappearance of a suspect in kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. The fact is that the latter was released from prison according to medical reasons. After this he disappeared without a trace. And officials declared that the leaders of intelligence service, information service and leader of information control service in Ministry of Internal Affairs sent in their resignation as a result. \n It's a BS I think. It's well-known that Romanian legislation isn't providing for engagement of any authorities to watch after the accused who have been exempted by a law-court decision. \n There's only one conclusion that can follow. I think you heard that Romania dreams about 'Great Romania' creation which will include Moldova with the TransDniestrian district. The fact is that Romanian side with Moldavian Special Services planed to realize force variant of TransDniestrian problem resolve. And most likely the chiefs of force departments and special services refused to take part in this shady deal. In contrast to Romanian president Traian Besescu and his administration they were aware that this affair was doomed and resigned.",
