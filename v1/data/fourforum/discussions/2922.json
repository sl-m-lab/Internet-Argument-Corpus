An 86 year old man \"lunged toward him\" and he became so concerned for his safety that he determined handcuffs were required? It's comical.

These are suppossedly trained peace officers.\n \n Further to that, why on earth was the situation ever allowed to escalate to the point that the officers felt there was a threat from Wallace?

These are suppossedly trained peace officers.\n\n \n \n \n Like many others have said, I don't know what exactly happened with this incident. I know this may sounds absurd, but what if Wallace had a gun or knife? He obviously didn't, but what if he did? The law doesn't state that once you hit 85 you can lunge at an officer. It applies to everyone. So if he did what they said he did, I agree that they should have cuffed him. Then they should have sat him down and asked why he did what he did. I do not think he should have went to jail.\n \n \n \nFurther to that, why on earth was the situation ever allowed to escalate to the point that the officers felt there was a threat from Wallace?

Remember the lady who drove her car repeatedly over her husband, killing him. I doubt that he knew it was coming. Look at Martin Lawrence and Robert Blake. Some people just harness in all of their anger and one little thing can put them over the edge. I'm not saying that Wallace fits this category, but it often happens.",

IMHO, that means answer his question, be blunt but polite, and difuse the situation rather than escalate it and create a mountain out of a mole hill. That was all that was required. These guys, contrary to what they might think, are not CIA operatives hunting down terrorists. An 86 year old man with meatloaf and potatoes in hands did not pose a threat to their safety.\n \n I'm sure there are two sides to the story, my point is, there shouldn't be a story if the \"cops\" acted properly.\n \n Waxy",
