   "Oh dear, I just read Brownback's essay on evolution in the New York Times...\n \n What I Think About Evolution \n \n Where on earth to begin? Maybe it's better just to forget about it, as obviously Brownback doesn't think much about evolution at all, if, indeed, he thinks about anything besides how to get the GOP nomination without annoying the religious nutcases who run his party and being thought a total idiot by everyone else. Still, perhaps there's stuff here worth discussing.\n \n This, for example, is a very Catholic position:\n  The heart of the issue is that we cannot drive a wedge between faith and reason. I believe wholeheartedly that there cannot be any contradiction between the two. The scientific method, based on reason, seeks to discover truths about the nature of the created order and how it operates, whereas faith deals with spiritual truths. The truths of science and faith are complementary: they deal with very different questions, but they do not contradict each other because the spiritual order and the material order were created by the same God. \n It's not particularly objectionable if he just left it there: religious faith would have to conform to reality, and who could object to that? But he doesn't.\n  The question of evolution goes to the heart of this issue. If belief in evolution means simply assenting to microevolution, small changes over time within a species, I am happy to say, as I have in the past, that I believe it to be true. If, on the other hand, it means assenting to an exclusively materialistic, deterministic vision of the world that holds no place for a guiding intelligence, then I reject it. \n \n There is no one single theory of evolution, as proponents of punctuated equilibrium and classical Darwinism continue to feud today. Many questions raised by evolutionary theory - like whether man has a unique place in the world or is merely the chance product of random mutations - go beyond empirical science and are better addressed in the realm of philosophy or theology. \n Here he just admits, contra his initial claim, that faith and reason can part company, because he refuses a place for reason in trying to figure out humanity's -- I do wish these old-fashioned patriarchs who refer to \"man\" would just go extinct -- place in the universe. He claims that such investigations must go outside the empirical realm of science, and that subjective philosophy and theology are the only legitimate tools of enquiry.\n \n Now, if he were just talking about humanity's moral position, or how people see themselves in relation to nature and the universe, or \"creation\" if you're of a theistic bent, he just might have a case. At the very least, he could argue you can't leave philosophy out of it, and I suppose some people might consider theology a kind of philosophy. But I think for Brownback, and certainly for the sort of religious zealots he is attempting to avoid upsetting with this triangulation that leaves more unsaid than said, it goes a lot further than that. He says:\n  While no stone should be left unturned in seeking to discover the nature of man's origins, we can say with conviction that we know with certainty at least part of the outcome. Man was not an accident and reflects an image and likeness unique in the created order. Those aspects of evolutionary theory compatible with this truth are a welcome addition to human knowledge. Aspects of these theories that undermine this truth, however, should be firmly rejected as an atheistic theology posing as science.\n Brownback claims he \"know(s) with certainty\". How anti-scientific can you possibly get? He already has his answer, so of course he thinks that science is pointless, and he'll never accept a scientific answer that contradicts his superstition.\n \n Brownback is wrong. Reason IS incompatible with his faith. His own words prove it, because he'll accept no answer other than the one his faith requires. Scientific enquiry is open-ended. It assumes no particular answers. Once you assume that \"man\" -- not \"woman\"? -- is created in \"god's image\", as Brownback obviously does, you've left science and reason and embarked on a voyage of subjective navel gazing.",

   "He's not an idiot, but writing this article was definitely a mistake.\n You're right chemist, he is sitting on a fence in a way it cannot be sat upon.\n \n lesz, you're right about that first part there definitely. He is right about faith and reason there, and he attempts to lure intelligen people in with that opening remark and then go a different direction. But the only people he is going to fool with this article are people who are already with him and a few others.\n Well, I suppose it might not be a mistake in that he will win over a few pseudo-intellectuals amongst religious conservatives who aren't quite fundamentalists. And the only people he's going to turn off are people who already don't like him.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n On a very different note regarding Brownback, I'm from Kansas, so he's one of my Senators. As much as I disagree with him in just about every other respect, he is the only person in Congress that I am aware of that has attempted to do anything about the Sudan or spoken up consistently about it.\n If he doesn't get the presidency and he runs for Senate again, I don't know that I could vote against him. That said, I'm not sure that I could vote for him either, but I don't think I could be happy about voting against what is essentially the lone voice in Congress speaking out for Darfur.",

You have to go with the statistics though. I was till recently from Wisconsin and I supported Feingold. I believe he may have also spoken out on Dafur, probably between his efforts to repair the Iraq disaster.\n \n I do not think I could ever vote for Brownback unless his opponents were markedly worse with regard to retreating from the facts. But hey I am fairly liberal and probably biased.",
