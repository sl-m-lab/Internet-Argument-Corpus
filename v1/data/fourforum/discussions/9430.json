   "The religious right was trounced last night. An attempt to neuter new laws protecting gay people against discrimination was defeated, 199 votes to 68. \n \n This stunning three-to-one victory happened in the House of Lords - the traditional stomping ground of religious, conservative and homophobic parliamentarians. Only a few years ago, the Lords repeatedly blocked attempts to equalise the age consent, with cries that it was a \"paedophiles charter.\" \n \n How times have changed. And so quickly. The vast majority of their lordships are now, it seems, the steadfast defenders of lesbian, gay and bisexual human rights. They backed the government's new sexual orientation regulations, which extend to gay people the anti-discrimination laws that currently protect women, black, disabled and religious people. \n \n It was mostly a sad, embittered posse of elderly, die-hard, anti-Cameron Tories and Ulster Unionists who voted to allow religious organisations the right to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They wanted to permit religious doctors, schools, hoteliers and charities to turn away gay people - all in the name of \"freedom of religion\". \n \n The massive House of Lords vote against homophobia was, however, much more than a victory for gay rights. It was a victory for modern, liberal Britain. Tolerance vanquished intolerance. Compassion and justice triumphed over heartlessness and inequality. We are all winners, gay and straight. \n \n The Lord's vote was also a huge setback for attempts to import into Britain the zealous, authoritarian tactics of US Christian fundamentalism. \n \n The leaders of Tuesday night's protest outside parliament against the sexual orientation regulations included evangelical activists who have been to the US to study the tactics of the religious right. The mobilisation of ultra-conservative Christian voters is widely credited with helping secure electoral victory for George Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. \n \n Some of our home-grown religious fundamentalists now want to use the same tactics to mobilise religious people into a voting bloc, with the aim of promoting their own moral agenda on issues like abortion, homosexuality and embryo research. \n \n Much of the success of the religious right in the US has been based on scaremongering tactics, deliberately designed to frighten Christian voters into backing hardline Republicans. American evangelical fundamentalists routinely spin gay equality as a bid for \"special rights\" or \"privileged status;\" suggesting that ending homophobic discrimination will give gay people rights not enjoyed by the heterosexual population. \n \n The organisers of last night's protest in London realised their arguments are weak and off-putting. So, taking a lead from their US religious counterparts, they resorted to naked untruths, as Polly Toynbee \n and AC Grayling have pointed out. \n \n The protest leaders claimed the sexual orientation regulations would \"curtail freedom of religious belief and expression\"; alleging that believers who condemned gay sex as a sin would face criminal charges. Rubbish. The regulations do not concern beliefs or opinions. \n \n Another whopper put about by the fundamentalists is that the regulations would force all schools, including faith schools, to \"promote homosexuality.\" As Lord Rooker pointed out, this is nonsense. The regulations are not about the content of the school curriculum. \n \n These falsehoods were typical of the many \"Big Lies\" on which the religious fundamentalist campaign was based. It has succeeded in scaring the pants off many Christians, who have now rallied to the ignoble cause of homophobic discrimination.\n More at: http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/peter_tatchell/2007/01/religious_right_defeated_1.html",

They backed the government's new sexual orientation regulations, which extend to gay people the anti-discrimination laws that currently protect women, black, disabled and religious people. \n\n How true.\n Even in America, poll after poll show that the only issue gay equality does not have majority support on is the \"gay marriage\" issue.\n And if those against gay marriage would wise up, they would realize that their best chance preventing gay marriage is to pre-emptively grant gay \"civil unions\" instead...\n \n \n \nThe mobilisation of ultra-conservative Christian voters is widely credited with helping secure electoral victory for George Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. \n\n I'd say the validity of such \"credit\" was thoroughly questioned in the 2006 election.\n \n \n \nMuch of the success of the religious right in the US has been based on scaremongering tactics, deliberately designed to frighten Christian voters into backing hardline Republicans. American evangelical fundamentalists routinely spin gay equality as a bid for \"special rights\" or \"privileged status;\" suggesting that ending homophobic discrimination will give gay people rights not enjoyed by the heterosexual population. \n\n It's kind of fun to argue against people who attempt such a \"front\".\n It's impossible to intelligently argue \"special rights\" and \"privileged status\" while at the same time pretending that gays have equality, yet invariably that is exactly the contradictory dual stance that they typically attempt.\n \n \n \nThe protest leaders claimed the sexual orientation regulations would \"curtail freedom of religious belief and expression\"; alleging that believers who condemned gay sex as a sin would face criminal charges. Rubbish. The regulations do not concern beliefs or opinions. \n\n I have frequently seen this attempted in one-way \"broadcast\" medium, where nobody can question the validity of the claim.\n When it is attempted on message boards, where refutation of the claim is possible, it is typically quickly shot down.\n \n Colorado's Amendment 2, which was later shot down by SCOTUS, was spread with similar deceit, trying to scare people with ideas of \"gay affirmative action\". To date, I have seen only one case of people talking about it / instituting it (in Canada I believe), and the gay equality supporters on this board overwhelmingly disapproved. (With NOBODY supporting the affirmative action idea, if I remember correctly.)\n Colorado's Amendment #2 went a lot farther than \"gay affirmative action\" and actually required that anti-gay employment discrimination NEVER be banned in the state of Colorado. The lie promulgated by the religious right was necessary, because the truth is that a majority SUPPORT banning anti-gay employment discrimination.",
