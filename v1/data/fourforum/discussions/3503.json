It was around the idea of twins. People such as yourself asked religious people when was the soul 'formed'? Many said at conception. Then science-minded people and those such as yourself would go a-ha! Twins aren't separated until later, does this meant hhat they have half a soul?\n \n How, by the way, are you dealing with arguing about something you don't believe in? If anyone, say, were to say \"A soul comes into being at 'x'...\", how do you debate them when you don't believe in a soul, you don't believe in evidence for a soul (so you can't ask them to prove it by what you believe constitutes proof) etc.\n \n Or are you just interested in asking for people's opinions?\n \n I feel free to ask you this, seeing as you felt a need to question why I'd post a thread to discuss multi-regional theory of evolution.",

   "So, when a man and a woman create a new life, a child, does your religion teach that it's embodied with a soul?\n\n Yes.\n \nWhat qualifies a life for a soul? Is it two humans or can intelligent apes also be the recipients of a soul? Would a disabled child with only very basic brain functioning be able to receive a soul, if they are incapable of knowing god?\n\n Only mankind was made in the image of God, and only mankind received the Breath of God during creation. As far as a child that was born mentally disabled, they also have a soul. Sometimes I think their souls are more protected from the &#8220;evil ways of the world&#8221; than &#8220;normal&#8221; folks &#8211; but that&#8217;s just my opinion.\n \nWhat about when a child is cloned (doesn't seem to be very far off, may as well discuss it now)? \n\n Since a person&#8217;s soul is not created, but sent by God to that person, then God can give souls as He desires. I cannot speak for God, but I would have to say that if God saw fit to give that soul, then that person, despite how he/she was formed, would receive it.\n \nIf we were to, theoretically, create artificial life, something that does not seem impossible, and we achieved sentience with this artificial life, would it be a recipient for a soul if it could know god through teachings?\n\n Animals are aware, but not with the awareness of humans. It&#8217;s hard to tell, though. It is my belief than humans are far above animals, but realize that scientifically we are classified as the same. However, to God, we are not. So, with that in mind, would that creature be considered a human being capable of receiving a soul? \n \n What would mankind consider it? I think most people would say that if it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck &#8211; then it&#8217;s a duck. But, honestly, are we not looking at a whole new species?\n \n My opinion is that only humans can have souls, despite the condition in which they are born, despite their opinions, and despite their beliefs. Frankenstein&#8217;s monster could, in the eyes of God, be considered His child, an AI being, with the likeness of man, who is in the likeness of God, possibly could not. If that AI being learned of God through teachings, then there could be two scenarios: (1 &#8211; It would be akin to a computer, storing this information, but having no way to receive nor convey that information for his own salvation, much less anyone else. Or (2 &#8211; He/She would immediately receive the Spirit of God and receive all the things any other person could. It is a very good question, one I think religion would instantly dispel owing to their belief that it&#8217;s an abomination/blasphemy (similar to stem cell utilization), thus classifying it as a beast. However, man should take all things into consideration when &#8220;creating&#8221; new forms of life and be careful what to name it. Names carry a lot of weight in a world so bent on believing in rituals and methods with a pinch of God in it for emphasis.",
