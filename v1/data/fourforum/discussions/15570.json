   "Looks like some more waffling is in order from the Brady's and other gun control supporters.\n \n The wonderful, and all glorious ATF who is lovingly admired for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals....\n \n ...seems to be putting guns into the hands of criminals....again.\n \n Why do anti-gunners heap praise and admiration upon the ATF while reviling me for simply being a law abiding citizen expressing his natural rights?\n \n I haven't given any criminals any firearms. NOT ONE....and I'm the bad guy?\n \n Yet, the ATF is now under fire for giving guns to criminals in FLORIDA, and they're admired by anti-gunners? How's this work? I thought anti-gunners were for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals? Maybe someone could explain why I...a private law abiding citizen...am reviled when I haven't given any firearms to criminals, yet the ATF who has done so on numerous occasions gets kudos?\n \n Makes one suspicious of the anti's supposed claims of altruism, huh?\n \n operation castaway - Google Search",
