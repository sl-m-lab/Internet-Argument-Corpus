Sorry, but this screams fear-mongering, guilty-until-proven-innocent, McCarthyesque witchhunt. \n \n\n Looking at other than Muslims would be religious repression, which is wrong because it is a violation of liberty even if religion has no merit.\n \n This is simply because even though Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhist, and even Wiccans may be destroying the best in youth through their multitude of indoctrination techniques none have done so with terrorism in mind for a hundred years.\n \n 'looking at' them you will certainly find radicalization going on but there is simply no national security justification.\n \n Therefore including them in your net is merely useless political gesture that is supposed to mean 'hey look Christians can be just as bad as Muslims'.\n \n They can, and have been; in fact in theory faith in general lends a great deal of unpredictability and general lack of objective morality to anyone who relies on it. BUT they aren't being 'bad' now.\n \n I would like to make a corollary point here, but it is not a response to your post.\n \n To those who say that profiling Muslims is 'racism', you are wrong. Let me talk a little bit about discrimination between humans and which kinds are proper and which are not.\n \n The proper kind are rational, the improper kinds are irrational.\n \n Is it that simple? Yes, every piece of moral advice you receive about prejudice, racism, equality is a result of this or wrong itself.\n \n Let's look at prejudice, why is it improper to assign attributes to a person based on their 'group'?\n \n When you hear about this it refers almost in all cases the collectivist fallacy, collectivism is the idea that the unit of humanity is a collective; those who believe in collectivism will attempt to deal with human beings as instances of a particular collective.\n \n This is improper because a collective is an abstraction which means 'the sum' not a particular which means 'all', the unit of humanity is the individual and one derives the shape and extent of the groups or collectives from individuals and not the other way around. The 'pre' in prejudice means 'before you know if the individual has the properties of the group you are assigning the group to the individual'.\n \n Now if you have followed me till here this is the important part:\n \n You never judge an individual by any but his/her own properties BUT that does not mean you cannot define and judge a collective or group.\n \n Now armed with this correct perspective on collectives and individuals you can see that it is sound and in fact somewhat necessary to judge groups; the important part you have to remember is that it is a persons individual properties which determine if they belong to that group/collective/category, if those properties do not warrant their placement into a category then you may not apply the judgement of the category to them.\n \n So what is racism? It is a particular kind of categorization which is not wrong because people cannot belong to a race, it is wrong because the term implies that one is making irrational judgements about the group.\n \n It is improper (as said before) to discriminate between humans based on irrational categorizations and further it is irrational to assign a human to a category which the individual properties do not merit.\n \n In racism ancestry, genetic sets, phenotypes are isolated and assigned all sorts of variables, sometimes good sometimes bad. Almost none rational. Take for instance someones skin pigment, is it rational to think that this has anything at all to do with any property except perhaps resistance to radiation? No, that means any categorization which has properties beyond that is irrational.\n \n Racism is well hated and talked about, but few understand the fallacy behind it. I will give another example which is also wrong and for the same reason.\n \n Bikers are fit, like trees, and homosexual.\n \n 'Liking trees' and 'homo sexual' do not rationally follow from biking, liking bikes and being fit does.\n \n Someone who is a biker could be homo-sexual or like trees and statistically there could be some correlation but so long as it is not a consequence of the definition of the category it does not belong as a property of the category.\n \n Observe this use of a 'biker' category:\n Bikers all use bikes (by definition), jill is biker so she uses a bike.\n \n That works, it is rational; If jill did not use a bike she did not belong in the bikers category.\n \n Now let's use the group to make a generalization.\n \n Bikers all use bikes, so they all need to buy bikes or bike parts. We should determine the number of bikers to see how many people are going to need bikes.\n \n This is a literal application of a category or group to many many individuals and there is nothing incorrect about it.\n \n So what's my issue with calling profiling Muslims as 'racism'\n \n First and foremost Islam is not a race, it's a religion; so immediately that word is discounted but it is also clear that what is meant is 'prejudice'.\n \n Which means the issue is whether or not properties are being applied to the group 'Muslim' which do not follow from it's definition.\n \n Since those who are doing the profiling are working from the premise that the religion of Islam, even if only some elements; are encouraging violent radicalism they see no problem in applying 'risk of being encouraged to violent radicalism' as a property.\n \n This is not just a statistical correlation it is a casual relationship. Being taught by some Muslims about Islam is literally causing the dangerous behavior.\n \n So long as the property of violent radical is not applied to the entire category these profilers haven't yet committed a fallacy, however even though they have far more justification than just a statistical correlation they are merely doing this as a way to narrow the vectors they need to consider.\n \n As an analogy have you noticed that police will describe the fundamental visual characteristics of suspect, including race and gender.\n \n Does this mean they are racist and sexist? Of course not they are merely narrowing their search parameters via known groups to which the suspect belongs, this is the proper flow individual -< group not group-<individual\n \n They know full well that 'suspect' is an attribute of one person and not his/her visual appearance.\n \n Similarly profilers know that their suspects are suspects because of their violent beliefs, they are hardly going to ignore however the statistical and causal relationship with Islam anymore than a policeman would ignore the appearance of the suspect.\n \n The extent of the 'unfairness' here is that Muslims would (and probably do) have to go through more hassle in screening processes than others.\n \n There are however only two alternatives to that, give everyone the same hassle or lower your standards and thereby security.\n \n How about another analogy, people who carry guns with them are much more scrutinized than people without in security matters; does this reflect on some moral character of anyone who owns a gun? No, simply statistical correlation of risk and owning a gun.\n \n You wouldn't have everyone checked for weapons even if they went through the metal detector without going off would you?\n \n Why then would you have everyone checked for violent religious extremism when it exists almost entirely in Islam?",

Any that utilized terms such as \"elitist\", \"socialist\", \"facist\", \"godless\", or any other knee-jerk, emotional, propogandist tactics, and/or spent more time smearing the opponent rather than telling me WHY they were actually qualified for the job using actual arguments against their opposition, automatically did not get my vote.

I am comfortable saying they are pigs since they all molest/have molested children. You can't say something like that with Muslims. Profiling them may not be racism, but it is prejudice.
