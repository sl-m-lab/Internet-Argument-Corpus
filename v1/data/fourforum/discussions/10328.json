   "(CBS 3) PHILADELPHIA A murder charge was filed against a 71-year-old man who shot and wounded a Philadelphia Police Officer more than 40 years ago.\n \n 71-year-old William Barnes, who has spent nearly half of his life in prison, was charged Monday morning, two weeks after the death of former Officer Walter T. Barclay. Barclay, 64, passed away August 19 at a Bucks County nursing home from an infection.\n \n \"When you set in motion a chain of events, a perpetrator of a crime is responsible for every single thing that flows from that chain of events, now matter how distant, so long as we can prove the chain is unbroken,\" said District Attorney Lynne Abraham during a Tuesday morning news conference.\n \n In 1966, rookie officer Walter Barclay, then 23, was shot multiple times while responding to the report of a robbery in the 6600 block of North 5th Street. The rookie officer was left a paraplegic and forced to retire.\n \n Williams Barnes was convicted in the shooting and served a 15-year sentence for attempted murder.\n \n Barnes, who had been living in a halfway house and working in a supermarket, was taken into custody Monday and will face a new trial, this time for murder.\n \n \"The medical examiner determined that the death was a result of complications stemming from his being shot and then their subsequent ruling is that the death is a homicide,\" said Chief Inspector Joseph Fox.\n\n \n What are your thoughts on this? This has sparked diffuse public outrage in Philadelphia, a city plagued by murder and violent crime that the city government seems unable/unwilling to take control of. This seems to me like more of a political grandstanding ploy by D.A. Lynne Abraham.",
