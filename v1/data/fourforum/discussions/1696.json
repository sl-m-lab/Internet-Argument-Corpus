   "In laymen's terms my faith does not have an \"afterlife\". You are alive on earth; exist in heaven, or plum dead. We have no limbo, and no \"soul\" or \"spirit\" that exist after you die. \n \n I just want to know the other afterlifes around on the forum and if you actually believe in them or are they just part of church doctrine. I believe in mine because it is common sense that once you body decays there is no more of \"you\" left. \n \n Also the interesting duality of this view is you are temped to live life to the fullest because it is the only life you have, but then their is the realization that if you \"play it by the book\" you'll have unlimited life if God likes you. You also have a slight envy of the few that may have lived uproarious lives and then get \"saved\" anyway, but thats just sinful human nature.",
