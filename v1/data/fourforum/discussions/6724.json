This raises the question of abridging a mother's right in order to bestow rights to the fetus.\n \n If rights are to be granted to fetuses then it would seem fair that parents should have certain rights as well.

There are instances where it is lawful for one person to take the life of another. You need to be wary in how you apply such a term in this debate. In general the law and foetuses varies from country to country- in the UK the foetus legally becomes a person at the 24th week of gestation.\n \n \nI do not think reliance on the mother is necessarily a fair basis by which the rights of a developing child should be determined. Could it be said that the unborn has any choice but to be dependant? Should that be held against the unborn?\n\n \n No the unborn has zero choice in this matter. But it is a bit of an oxymoron to refer to the choice of the unborn as it can only ever have what legal protections/privilages are bestowed by others on its behalf, until such a time as it becomes recognised as a person in law.\n \n With regard to the latter part of this statement we have two conflicting interests to consider here- the desire of a person(s) to be free of an unwanted pregnancy for whatever reason and the obligation of the state to protect the lives of its citizens. With such disparate matters there are no straight forward answers that do not completely ignore one set of needs so a compromise has to be found.\n \n \nShould we continue to deny the father any rights until birth just because the father cannot bear the child? quote Except for cases of rape it seems that any child that is the result of consentual sex between two people should convey to each an equal right on determining that fate of the conceived.
