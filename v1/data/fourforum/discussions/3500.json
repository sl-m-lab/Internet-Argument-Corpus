   "In light of the recent crisis involving the shortage of flu vaccines, I decided to go in search of some facts about the flu. Here is an excerpt from the CDC's website giving statistics:\n \n Every year in the United States, on average: \n \n 5% to 20% of the population gets the flu; \n more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications; and \n approximately 36,000 people die from flu. \n \n Notice the number of people that die from the illness, that's more than the number killed in Iraq, the world trade center, and the Edward Murray building in Oklahoma City combined. Since the vaccine seems to be one of the best methods of preventing the illness, should the government take a more active role in assuring that there is an adequate supply for the general population? It seems we have placed the well being of our citizens on the shoulders of just two companies, both of which are global and aren't necessarily dependent on the United States. It seems low profit margins, unstable demand, strict FDA requirements, as well as product liability lawsuit awards all contribute to discouraging pharmaceutical companies from manufacturing vaccines. I think it's in our best interest to encourage domestic manufacturers to produce the medicines needed to keep our population healthy.\n \n Here are a couple of links with additional facts:\n \n http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004936.php\n \n http://198.246.96.2/flu/keyfacts.htm",

   "Did you see a couple things in the news:\n \n 1. Vaccine manufacturers already have protection under the law for liability. (scratch liability problems)\n \n 2. Chiron had been sited repeatedly by British inspectors/auditors for shortcomings in their cleanliness and procedures. The U.S. didn't inspect them. (scratch FDA regulatory problems -- the Brits are tougher.)\n \n 3. Chiron is actually an American company. They just manufacture there.\n \n 4. Britain had 4 manufacturers and is not currently having the issues we are having.\n \n Still looking for the reason. Could it be #3?",
