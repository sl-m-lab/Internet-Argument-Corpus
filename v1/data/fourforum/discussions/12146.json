   "-\n \n Hi, Satan here! I hope you are all enjoying this festive season. I love this time of year ---- so many pagan rituals!\n \n It is usually beneath my dignity to communicate with you monkey-brains, but what the Hell! This is the time of year to loosen up, right?\n \n Besides, I'm a little ticked off at the way relilgious goof-balls on these fora misrepresent me! The way they write, the weaker lambs of the flock might be led astray into thinking that humans were not inferior to Me in every way ---- including morally!\n \n I am an upstanding member of the Court of Heaven (read the Book of Job), and I occupy an important office there! SATAN, which is my official title, not my personal name, means \"accuser\" in Hebrew (as does diabolos in Greek), and my official function in the Aura of Glory surrounding the Throne of the All-High is that of Prosecuting Attorney in the jurisprudence of Paradise.\n \n Without Me, all Hell would break out in Heaven, for there would be no one checking to see if everyone who came knocking at the Pearly Gates were worthy to enter or not. Without My critical mind and discriminating intelligence, any old riff-raff might squeeze their way in here ---- Hitler, Stalin, even George W. Bush!\n \n The inhabitants of Paradise are all vey nice, in their way, very trusting and forgiving, but between you and Me, anyone can pull the wool over their eyes! (I never did approve of all this recent influx of Lambs here)\n \n Though you perverse humans seem to insult and bad-mouth Me whenever you can, I have always been a friend to Humankind. In one of my incarnations, I brought fire down from Heaven and gave it to you poor, shivering apes. If it had not been for my selfless labor in the Garden of Eden, you would have remained in that boring patch of greenery forever, just mindless, domestic animals in La-La Land!\n \n Anyway, I've decided to give you a sneek preview of Final Things, and what the Last Judgment is really going to be like!\n \n Give your full and undivided attention to this pious and edifying text!\n \n \n THE LAST JUDGMENT\n \n \n It is the Last Judgment. God stands before the Pearly Gates dividing \n the people into two groups. To the group on His right He says, \"Oh, \n My true and faithful Atheists, well done! I created the world without \n any evidence of My existence; indeed, all the evidence led in the \n opposite direction! I gave mankind the god-like power of reason, and \n you, noble atheists, used that gift properly and courageously! The \n false promises of religion did not mislead you; you resisted the lure \n of fables backed by authority; childish hopes of comfort and \n salvation did not deter you from uncompromisingly following the path \n of reason, as you saw it, to its final conclusions. Even ridicule, \n discrimination and persecution did not daunt you; the talents which I \n gave you, you used and increased; for your intelligence and courage, \n for your ability to reject folly and seek wisdom ---Welcome! Enter \n into eternal glory!\"\n \n Then God turns to the group on His left and says, \"You religious \n fools! You infantile cowards! Through fear you refused to grow up and \n become adults. You clung to fables and just-so stories. You were \n unwilling to exercise the intelligence which I gave you as my most \n priceless gift! No absurdity was too great, no fairy tale too \n outrageous, provided it gave you childish comfort and the vain hope \n that no matter what crimes you committed, some Outside Power would \n reach down and save your unworthy butts! You have wasted and \n corrupted My gifts! My universe has no place for such as you; I \n reject you utterly! Into the lake of eternal fire with you, and be \n consumed!\"\n \n -",

   "-\n But don't be alarmed. I run a very well-organized establishment, and do all I can to make the stay of my guests comfortable. In fact, I keep the temperature of Hell well below that of Heaven.\n \n Yes, you read correctly: Heaven is hotter than Hell.\n \n The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority is the Bible. Isaiah 30:26 reads: \"Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days.\" Thus, heaven receives from the moon as much radiation as the earth does from the sun, and in addition seven times seven (forty nine) times as much as the earth does from the sun, or fifty times in all. The light we receive from the moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the sun, so we can ignore that. With these data we can compute the temperature of Heaven: The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation. In other words, Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the earth by radiation. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann fourth-power law for radiation:\n \n (T/E)^4 = 50\n \n where E is the absolute temperature of the earth, 300K (273+27). This gives T the absolute temperature of Heaven, as 798K (525\u00baC).\n \n The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed but it must be less than 445\u00baC, the temperature at which brimstone or sulfur changes from a liquid to a gas. Revelation 21:8 says: \"But the fearful and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.\" A lake of molten brimstone [sulfur] means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, which is 444.6\u00baC. (Above that point, it would be a vapor, not a lake.)\n \n We have, then, temperature of Heaven: 525\u00baC (977\u00baF). Temperature of Hell: less than 445\u00baC (832\u00baF). Therefore Heaven is hotter than Hell.\n \n -",
