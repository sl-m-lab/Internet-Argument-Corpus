That doesn't mean that debate between two people with different worldviews is impossible - but it does mean that 'agree to disagree' may well be the outcome.\n \n I'd say that the only time that debate becomes impossible is when people with different axioms ignore the other persons axiom and just keep making statements based on their own. In such a situation the only thing to do is directly contend the axioms (kinda hard to do successfully), or for one person to (sometimes temporarily) adopt the other's axiom and argue within it - for example, me talking about biblical interpretations of homosexuality/abortion/etc with Archie and Easy, or a Creationist trying to make science-based attacks on evolution.

   "No, both base them on feelings and interpretations of their own experiences.\n\n \n Not all interpretations are equal, however. \n \n We each construct a model of the world around us by interacting with it and getting feedback. What we call 'material' or 'real' or 'true' is just another way of describing meaningful feedback: information that constrains our model.\n \n Some models cannot be constrained because they make no falsifiable predictions; it's impossible for 'reality' to disagree with them. This category of models is what - in recent times - we mean when we say 'supernatural'.\n \n I say in recent times because personal models of god and other supernatural entities have not always been unfalsifiable. If you were to take the scientific method back in time and explain it to early believers they would say that of course god's existence could be scientifically verified; of course prayer would have a statistically measurable effect; of course radiometry would confirm the biblical age of the earth - and so forth. Methodological naturalism only came to be perceived as a threat to theism when those expectations turned out to be unfounded. Subsequently theism has converged upon the relatively modern 'non-overlapping magisteria' model, in which it is impossible for any observation to disprove the existence of god.\n \n The upshot is that taking the existence of such a god as axiomatic is not the same as not taking his existence as axiomatic.
