   "Ken Ham, President of the Apologetics Ministry of AnswersInGenesis, weighs in here on whether God made animals carnivores.\n \n Refuting Compromise: Where Did Carnivores Come From?\n \n According to Ham, the Bible clearly teaches that humans and animals were originally vegetarians before the Fall. \n \n \"Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the fact of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for good. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground -- every thing that has the breath of life in it -- I gave every green plant for food.\" And it was so.\"\n \n Genesis 1: 29-30",

It was from a T-Rex, yes.\n \n Dinosaur Shocker\n \n \nNeatly dressed in blue Capri pants and a sleeveless top, long hair flowing over her bare shoulders, Mary Schweitzer sits at a microscope in a dim lab, her face lit only by a glowing computer screen showing a network of thin, branching vessels. That's right, blood vessels. From a dinosaur. \"Ho-ho-ho, I am excite-e-e-e-d,\" she chuckles. \"I am, like, really excited.\" \n \n After 68 million years in the ground, a Tyrannosaurus rex found in Montana was dug up, its leg bone was broken in pieces, and fragments were dissolved in acid in Schweitzer's laboratory at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. \"Cool beans,\" she says, looking at the image on the screen. . . . \n",
