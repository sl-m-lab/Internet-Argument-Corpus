   "Recently the Bush Administration put forth a rule change restoring our right to keep and bear arms in some national parks and wildlife refuges. These rule changes do not supercede state and local laws. So in a nut shell, Alaska's gun laws would apply to Denali National Park, California's would apply to Yosemite, and so on. Predictably the Brady Campaign has filed a law suit to block this rule change. Below is some of the misinformation and just plain dumb things they said in their press release.\n \n \nThe suit was filed on behalf of the Brady Campaign and its members, including school teachers in the New York and Washington, D.C. areas who are canceling or curtailing school trips to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and the National Mall in Washington, D.C now that the Bush Administration will be allowing guns in these national park areas.\n\n \n If the part about the teachers is true it makes me glad my kids go to private school. Being as the locations mentioned are in New York City and Washington, DC. the chances of anyone carrying a gun is pretty slim. The Bush administration did not \"allow guns in these national parks\", they simply lifted some of the federal restriction, the state and local laws still apply.\n \n \n...asking that the court strike down a last-minute Bush Administration rule change allowing concealed, loaded firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.\n\n \n Again they conveniently forgot to mention that this is only the case if the state allows concealed carry. Actually they do give it a glancing mention about five paragraphs further down.\n \n \nThe rule also violates the National Park Service Organic Act and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, which created the parks and wildlife refuges as protected lands for safe enjoyment of all visitors.\n\n \n More misinformation/ lies, it does not violate the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act since many National Wildlife Refuges are open to hunting and already allow guns. Also, I'm not sure why they site the National Park Service Organic Act since it is completely silent on the subject.\n \n Once again the Brady Campaign uses scare tactics and misinformation to fool the gullible and ignorant. Just another version of the old streets will run red cry, only this time its the trees will run red.",

   "This is from a different part of the Brady Campaign website, but I had to post it because it has got to be one of their dumbest statments ever and they keep using it year after year.\n \n \nThere is no state law restricting the sale or possession of large capacity ammunition magazines that can fire 30, 50 or even 75 rounds without reloading\n\n \n Silly me, I've been buying guns all this time when according to the Brady campaign all I needed to do was buy the magazine. And were suppose to take these people seriously when they talk about firearms?",

   "Which Nat'l Parks will now allow guns?\n\n \n Just those in places where CCW is already legal. If you can carry in your state, you can now carry in Nat'l parks...in that state.\n \n If you live in Illinois or Wisconsin, you must do like everyone else: call 911 out on the trail, wait for police to find you, then protect you from the rapist who has patiently waited for them to arrive.\n \n I can't figure it out. This law simply makes it legal for those who have their CCW to carry in Nat'l parks too.\n \n They ALREADY carry everywhere else. The Brady bunch makes it sound like there's something about the border of a park that will make us drooling, neanderthal gun owners flip our lids....but just in the park. Why are we perfectly safe everywhere else, but all of a sudden, we're dangerous......in the park?",
