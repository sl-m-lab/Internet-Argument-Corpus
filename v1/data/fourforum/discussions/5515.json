In example, will job losses from military base closings be offset by new jobs by participating contractors when closure funding is reallocated to overseas efforts in the forward operating location strategy? Surely the American public can't be so naive as to believe Rummy's widely publicized 'base closure savings' will be lopped off the military budget, but they will believe 'new jobs' with little question. \n \n One statistic I followed which now escapes my searches is the breakdown of new jobs by industry, including government. I'd like to again see that.",

Up until recently a friend was linked to a spreadsheet that displayed industry and government employment (together) by month with percentages, but I can no longer access it. I have too many spreads going and am lazy enough avoid building/ maintaining another one. \n \n Interesting that government employment, without government contractor numbers, has increased by almost 1-million since this administration has taken office. 250k/yr would average 21k/mo, which certainly helps overall new job statistics. Slow this year, but there's no national election. Also some interesting concentrations, which would support Lord T's query regarding manipulation.",

   "Here's the calculation for the other statistic, unemployment, so revered by most administrations:\n \n In simple terms, the unemployment rate is the number of people looking for work divided by the total number of workers in the labor force.\n \n The national unemployment rate is computed solely from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of 60,000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census. Residents of selected households are interviewed about their work experience. From these responses, the Bureau of Labor Statistics then estimates the size of the labor force and the number of people who are jobless. \n \n Selected households. How's that for some real wiggle room? \n \n There are currently 108 million US households, including one-person households. That means the unemployment sampling is potentially from .0005% of all households, with actual numbers coming from a survey of selected households from within that .0005%. Government numbers with little association to reality.",

With critical trade imbalance creating capital flight, negative balance of payments and national debt eroding the USD, consumer confidence is the major remaining criterion for economic stability. That makes for motivation of serious political control. Using the foot on the other shoe viewpoint, manipulation of unemployment and new jobs would seem the most efficient manner of exercising that control to maintain public confidence.
