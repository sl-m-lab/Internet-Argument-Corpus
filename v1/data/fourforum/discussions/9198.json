   "BALTIMORE, Md. (Catholic Online) - U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Iraq \"at the earliest opportunity\" and the Bush administration and the new Democratic-controlled Congress must move beyond \"shrill and shallow debate,\" the American bishops urged.\n \n In a statement approved by voice vote by the full body of bishops gathered here on the first day of the Nov. 13-16 meeting, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have said that \"increases in sectarian violence and civil strife have made the challenge of securing a responsible transition in Iraq\" urgent today. \n \n \"The situation in Iraq is perilous - taking the lives of so many Iraqis, Americans and others, and undermining the dignity of many more. The current situation is taking a terrible toll - on the Iraqi people and our military personnel, as well as on the region, our nation, and the world,\" said Bishop William S. Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., in the statement, \"Call for Dialogue and Action on Responsible Transition in Iraq,\" written under his signature on behalf of the bishops' conference.\n \n \"The war's costs are measured in lives lost and many more injured, in widespread sectarian strife, civil insurgency and terrorist attacks, and in the daily struggles of Iraqis to build a decent future for their devastated nation,\" the statement said. \n \n The 1,200-word bishops' statement updates their Jan. 12 document, \"Toward a Responsible Transition in Iraq,\" and incorporates the results of the midterm elections that saw Democrats seize control of Congress. The Iraq war statement was a late addition to the bishops' agenda, which includes a number of controversial issues, such as pastoral care of gays and lesbians, contraception and clergy sex abuse. \n \n Noting that the U.S. bishops and the Vatican has expressed \"grave moral concerns\" about military intervention in Iraq, pointed to \"the unpredictable and uncontrollable negative consequences of invasion and occupation\" and questioned the morality of \"preventative war,\" the statement urged the federal government's executive and legislative branches to engage in \"collaborative dialogue\" to assess the situation on the ground and build agreement on concrete steps to move forward. \n \n \"We hope our nation has moved beyond the divisive rhetoric of the recent campaign and the shrill and shallow debate that distorts reality and reduces the options to 'cut and run' versus 'stay the course,'\" the bishops said. \n \n \"This national dialogue should not re-fight past battles,\" the statement said. \"Our nation cannot just look back.\" \n \n \"Our nation needs a much more substantive, civil and non-partisan discussion of ways to plan and secure a responsible transition in Iraq.\" \n \n The bishops said they believe a new broad international engagement is necessary to promote stability and reconstruction, and stressed that \"our nation's military forces should remain in Iraq only as long as their presence contributes to a responsible transition.\" \n \n \"Our nation should look for effective ways to end their deployment at the earliest opportunity consistent with this goal,\" the statement said. \n \n \"The administration and the new Congress need to engage in a collaborative dialogue that honestly assesses the situation in Iraq, acknowledges past difficulties and miscalculations, recognizes and builds on positive advances (e.g., broad participation in elections), and reaches agreement on concrete steps to address the serious challenges that lie ahead,\" Bishop Skylstad said. \n \n \"The administration and the new Congress need to engage in a collaborative dialogue that honestly assesses the situation in Iraq, acknowledges past difficulties and miscalculations, recognizes and builds on positive advances (e.g., broad participation in elections), and reaches agreement on concrete steps to address the serious challenges that lie ahead,\" Bishop Skylstad said. \n \n Bishop Skylstad sketched out broad \"benchmarks for a responsible transition in Iraq,\" including: the fostering of security; curbing terrorist attacks and sectarian violence; strengthening the rule of law; promoting economic reconstruction; and supporting further development of political structures and strategies that \"advance stability, political participation and respect for religious freedom and basic human rights.\" \n \n While noting that \"this work must be done by Iraqis\" as must the resolution of sectarian violences \"engulfing the Shia and Sunni communities,\" the statement stressed that the \"United States and its coalition partners have a moral obligation to continue and intensify efforts\" with Iraqis, countries in the region and the international community to meet those goals. \n \n The bishops urged \"Arab nations and the countries of Western Europe to take concrete steps against terror.\" \n \n Stability in the Middle East would be improved, they said, if the United States and other nations of the world pursue \"a just peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\" \n \n Alarmed by \"the deteriorating situation of Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq,\" the U.S. bishops called for \"effective efforts\" to end all sectarian violence. \"Their vulnerability is dramatic evidence of the serious and growing dangers facing the entire nation of Iraq.\" \n \n Noting the \"heroic sacrifices\" of and their concern for the safety of the U.S. military forces, the bishops called Catholics to pray for those who serve honorably and their families, those who have lost loved ones and for the Iraqi people \"who have suffered so greatly under a brutal dictator and now face continuing violence, instability and deprivation.\" \n \n \"At this critical time, our nation needs open and courageous dialogue to examine where things stand in pursuing justice and peace in Iraq, assess what is achievable there, and evaluate the moral and human consequences of alternative courses of action,\" the statement said. \n \n At the beginning of the year, Bishop Thomas G. Wenski, chairman of the U.S. bishops' Committee on International Policy, said \"our nation is at a crossroads in Iraq.\" \n \n In a 3,600-word Jan. 12 statement, the Orlando, Fla., bishop called on the U.S. government to hold \"serious and civil discussions\" on what must be done to prepare for \"a responsible transition\" to full Iraqi self-rule. \n \n \"Our nation's military forces should remain in Iraq only as long as it takes for a responsible transition, leaving sooner rather than later,\" he said. \n \n Bishop Wenski, who recalled the strong opposition of church leaders to the U.S. intervention in Iraq in early 2003, urged \"serious and civil discussions of alternatives that emphasize planning for a responsible transition in Iraq.\" \n \n He called for \"clearer signals that the goals of U.S. policy are to help Iraqis assume full control of their governance and not to occupy the nation for an indeterminate period.\" \n \n \"Despite past missteps and current difficulties, our nation urgently needs to seek to broaden international support and participation in the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq,\" he said.",

American and Britian can still be a deterant to Iran without occupying Iraq. I cant see why the british and Americans would be needed if the Iraqi government had a suitable police force, legal system and armed forces.\n \n If you read the post you will find it says \"at the earliest opportunity\"",

   "Yada yada yada....\n \n First, the trade imbalance for buying more and more foreign oil means more money has to be borrowed to pay for it - hence we have to pay the interest juice to finance it, not to mention the principal. So there's a very real and substantial cost to the American taxpayer for not producing more domestic oil.\n \n Obvious Child: Oil procurement from existing fields is expanding. Several smaller companies are buying up used fields and using new models and technology to extract the hard to reach oil.\n \n A band aid in a bloodletting is what you're trying to advance.\n \n HOUSTON -- Increasing U.S. refining capacity requires expanding existing plants as well as building new ones, ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva told oil and gas industry executives Tuesday. \n \n Hurricanes Katrina and Rita heightened concerns about refining capacity when the storms left more than a dozen refineries along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana idle. Even if Congress cuts lengthy permitting and regulatory approvals required to build new refineries, oil majors and other refinery operators need to beef up capacity to meet growing demand, he said. \n \n \"Our country has had a wake-up call on energy,\" Mulva told an energy conference in Houston. \n \n Eleven refineries responsible for about 3 million barrels per day of gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel production remain closed in the hurricane aftermath. Also, more than 70 percent of daily oil production and more than 60 percent of daily natural-gas production was down in the Gulf of Mexico. \n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/10/11/215602.shtml\n \n New oil refineries are needed.\n \n Obvious Child:  Furthermore, you're extremely ignorant of the ANWR position. The oil industry itself has admitted that it will take 8 years before any of that oil comes to market. The USGS has a estimate of 10-12 years. \n \n No ignorance here. Oil drilling facilities and transportation infrastructures, etc., need to be approved, built, tested, and activated, which undoubtedly takes time. But your short-sighted ignorance is in arguing that because it takes time, we shouldn't do it at all! That's really swell! \n \n Finally, I figure new nuclear energy plants should be built and alternative energy products such as cellulosic biomass ethanol, etc., should be perfected, and hydrogen fuel cells and more fuel efficient vehicles should be built to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

   "Uh...I just proved that we are allowing extraction from existing fields. And it's hardly a bandaid given that there are huge amounts of old oil fields. \n \n \nNew oil refineries are needed.\n\n \n Of course. Doesn't mean they are going to build them. You seem to lack the basic understanding of how a business works. The Oil industry is going to restrict refining supply to drive prices up and produce a huge profit. They blame enviromentalists for not letting them build new refineries, but there hasn't been a push by the oil industry for decades to seriously build new ones. Sure they've added capacity to existing but no push for new refiniers has occured on their part for a long, long time. Why would you willingly reduce your ability to make money?\n \n Even you can figure that out. \n \n \nBut your short-sighted ignorance is in arguing that because it takes time, we shouldn't do it at all! That's really swell! \n\n \n No, I'm arguing that it won't make a difference. By the time we can actually use it, it as you clearly didn't want to deal with, will be priced at international commodity market rates AKA, NOT CHEAP. We'll simply be paying for our own oil at exorbiant prices. Furthermore, increasing the reliance on oil only prolongs our shift to alternative. The ANWR is not a solution. It's not even a short term fix. Alberta is not engaging in serious tar sands because they knows that in 10 years that oil will be worth far more then it is now. \n \n \nFinally, I figure new nuclear energy plants should be built and alternative energy products such as cellulosic biomass ethanol, etc., should be perfected, and hydrogen fuel cells and more fuel efficient vehicles should be built to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Will you support that?\n\n \n Sure, but the GOP doesn't, Cheney's energy bill was essentially a giant welfare check to the industry. Republicans support a free market, what a joke. I'd support the construction of pebble reactors which have shown that by design they cannot reach meltdown stage. I don't like corn ethanol as it is BTU deficient. Sugar however, results in a BTU surplus. IMO, the best way to solve our current problem is a mandatory 15% fuel efficency increase. Something like 70% of all oil is used in vehicles. a 15% increase could drastically cut need, which it inself would reduce price and reduce the speculation (assuming nothing goes horribly wrong in oil producing areas or that China/India see a huge spike in demand). \n \n Get use to it, the age of cheap oil is gone",
