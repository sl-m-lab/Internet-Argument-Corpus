   "The disrupted natural gas supplies from Russia force some European countries to use 'alternative sources of energy' in order to save their economy. But quite disappointing things have surfaced in wake of this gas story. We are not equals in EU! \n \n In East Europe some part of enterprises has begun to use black mineral oil but Slovakia is reanimating the nuclear power station forbidden by EU as ecologically unfriendly! Look, as I know the shut downing of this reactor was the main contract for Slovakia's joining to EU! \n \n Certainly all it will bring to exceeding the quotas for atmospheric emission of dangerous pollutants and ecology situation will be dangerously damaged! \n \n Now I wonder who will pay for ruined contracts and ecological quota exceeding. I think that Ukraine have to pay for it! Europe needs to do Yuschenko to court along with Americans who put that swindler and thief into president chair!",

   "Shalom! My name is Abram, I am a Jew from Latvia. I got to once again raise an issue of rising neo-fascism in Eastern Europe as people in Western Europe seem to disregard it, which I find terribly wrong! You wear a mask of indifference and make believe that there is no such problem at all, but it really exists! And this constitutes a threat to all Jews who live here, for instance in Estonia! This week an Estonian youngster wrote on a forum of Estonian nationalists that he is going to enter Tartu commercial high school and open fire in the building. For your information, there are quite many Estonian Jewish students in Tartu commercial high school. It also got known that the young man is a member of Estonian neo-fascist organization Taastamine. Fortunately, he was arrested but Estonian police doesn't find his intentions serious. Is it was only a reprieve? What can stop him from carrying out his intentions? Why EU authority don't interfere into it?!",

Why EU authority don't interfere into it?!\n\n \n Hi Abram, welcome to this forum from the resident american born arab. Although I was born into islam, I became a born again believer in Christ at 22 yrs. old and have a deep love for Israel and the Jew. We are half brothers after all since Abraham is both of our peoples father. \n \n I agree with you that we will continue to see a rise in anti-semitism as we approach the end of this Age. I constantly pray for the Jew and know that Yahweh will never forget or forsake his covenant with the children of Abraham. Sadly though I have no advice or words of comfort other than to encourage you that the reason the Jew is hated so much is because the spiritual darkness of this world hates the spiritual light and since salvation came to the world by way of the Jew, the world will always hate you as the chosen people of God. \n \n Hopefully understanding why you are the target of such irrational hatred will make it easier to endure the persecution. At least you can be assured that you are on the right side of history and the truth is still available to you as a Jew. Those who have sold out to hatred are lost, in the end. Be at peace and I hope you will remain with us here at 4forums.",

   "Will EU or Sarkozy to be more exact manage to resist a regular Byelorussian ploy? I mean that recent absurd idea of president Lukashenko he rendered to Lithuania. That's building of a nuclear power plant by joint effort and for joint use. Mind that both countries have neither funds, nor specialists or technology to put that grandiose project into reality! \n And France does possess this! France is a EU member together with Lithuania. So Lukashenko clearly made his stake at Lithuania as key to magic door leading to EU coffers and possibilities!! He's set to get the desired by hook or crook so to say... Sure thing he kept mainly France in mind.\n Wily cat he is, that Byelorussian leader. Still I hope both Lithuania and France will show up as more sophisticated and abandon that tricky project of Lukashenko. \n Look, France experiences no shortage of such NPP contracts. And Lithuania in her meeting of the energy challenge will do just stupidly if share EU attention and care with someone else. Especially when it relates highly unpredictable Byelorussian leader!",
