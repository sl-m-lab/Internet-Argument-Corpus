   "What Freedom \"is\" depends on your paradigm, and more importantly...who controls that paradigm. In this world the United States defines what freedom \"is\"...To everybody else on this planet \"we are the best examples of it\" and being the \"Best Example\" of something in life...over time...ultimatly gives you the power to redefine it.\n \n Just last night the President said \"We are bringing Freedom to the middle east...(Again)\" A.k.a. Democracy. Of course its a good thing! They had crazy lives before we were there...(weather they liked it or not...thats another story.) Instead I ask you to bring your attention to the Countries that brought freedom upon themselves...ever been to one? I have..in fact I lived in many. I tell you that it is in those places that the true definition of freedom roams. Living in America and never traveling out...watching American TV\\News...You are told what your definition of freedom is...Guess what...Thats the way they want it...and thats what they dont want you to understand. You dont think the Government thinks this hard about things? I promise you they do...thats their Business. Why would they sit back and \"hope\" you see things their way...when they can make you see things their way...and on top of it...make it seem like it was your bright idea in the first place! Look at the Patriot Act! We got ****ed in the XXX on that one..ever read it?\n \n Life is changing for everybody on this planet...everybody has the potential to be hit by terrorists...guess what... \"terrorists\" were not invented on Sept 11...getting attacked on our own soil HAS happened before... so dont give me that line. Do not think I am cracking on \"America\" ...I am cracking on you if you dont notice the removal of our freedom.\n \n I have posted the following on another thread please permit the redundancy:\n \n If you dropped a frog in boiling water, it would instantly jump out. However, if you dropped a frog in cool water and very gradually raised the heat, the frog would adjust... and not notice how hot it was until it was too late...\n \n Forget that its about a stupid frog for a minute...and recognize that we do the same thing in our lives everyday...\n \n Free? Compaired to who? Korea Yes, but to the rest of the FREE world...we are fools with blind folds on. Our industry attracts people here, not our so called \"freedom\".\n \n Did you notice the Gov was turning up the heat? Dont feel bad...most people dont.",
