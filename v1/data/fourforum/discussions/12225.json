   "\n 1. REPEAL THE TIAHRT AMENDMENT&#8217;S UNWARRANTED RESTRICTIONS ON ATF \n -REPEAL RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF CRIME GUN DATA \n One Tiahrt rider severely limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, \n Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (&#8220;ATF&#8221;) to disclose crime gun trace data \n to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (&#8220;FOIA&#8221;), bars \n admissibility of such data in civil suits against the gun industry, and restricts \n disclosure of the data to law enforcement.\n \n -REPEAL THE 24-HOUR BRADY RECORD DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT\n Another Tiahrt-sponsored appropriations rider codified the Bush \n Administration policy destroying certain National Instant Criminal Background \n Check System (&#8220;NICS&#8221;) records after 24 hours....21Without retained NICS \n records, law enforcement has no opportunity to retrieve guns mistakenly \n sold to prohibited purchasers.\n \n -REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON ATF&#8217;S POWER TO REQUIRE DEALER INVENTORY\n AUDITS\n A third Tiahrt appropriations rider bars ATF from implementing its proposed \n regulation requiring gun dealers to conduct annual inventory audits to \n address the problem of guns &#8220;disappearing&#8221; from gun shops with no record of \n sale.\n \n 2. REPEAL NEW RULES ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRY IN NATIONAL PARKS\n \n 3.REPEAL OR AMEND THE FEDERAL GUN INDUSTRY LEGAL PROTECTION \n STATUTE TO RESTORE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS\n As Senators, President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden opposed the gun lobbybacked\n Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (&#8220;PLCAA&#8221;) signed by President Bush in 2005.\n The law exempts from basic common law principles gun companies who arm criminals &#8211; and treats\n gun violence victims as second class citizens, without the full rights to seek civil justice that are\n enjoyed by those injured by any other product or activity. The law should be repealed or amended.\n The PLCAA radically alters state law, essentially overruling decisions by numerous courts holding that gun dealers, \n distributors, and manufacturers can be held liable under state common law for\n injuries caused by their negligent sale or design of guns.35 The PLCAA also eliminates promising\n incentives to curb gun violence. During the Clinton years, litigation made great strides in forcing the\n gun industry to become part of the solution to gun violence, including a settlement the Clinton\n administration secured with Smith & Wesson, which agreed in specific ways to distribute its guns\n more responsibly and to include safety devices in guns.\n \n 5. EXTEND BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ALL GUN SALES, INCLUDING ALL\n GUN SHOW SALES\n \n 6. FULLY FUND THE NICS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n On January 8, 2008, President Bush signed into law the National Instant \n Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which \n provides for financial assistance to aid states in sending records to NICS \n and financial penalties if they fail to provide records. This law was passed \n after the Virginia Tech massacre, where the killer was able to arm himself\n because a court order that should have blocked his gun purchase was not \n reported to NICS.\n \n 7.CLOSE THE &#8220;TERROR GAP&#8221; TO DENY FIREARMS TO TERRORISTS \n \n 8. PROHIBIT GUN POSSESSION BY VIOLENT MISDEMEANANTS AND PERSONS\n CONVICTED OF VIOLENT ACTS AS JUVENILES \n \n 9. RESTRICT LARGE-VOLUME HANDGUN SALES TO REDUCE TRAFFICKING\n \n 10. GIVE ATF STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE\n LAW AGAINST CORRUPT DEALERS \n Almost 60% of the nation&#8217;s guns traced to crime come from only about\n 1% of the country&#8217;s gun dealers, yet ATF is severely hindered in its ability \n to inspect, sanction, or shut down rogue dealers...Restrictions enacted in \n 1986 as part of the gun lobby-backed Firearm Owners Protection Act \n (&#8220;FOPA&#8221;) placed severe constraints on ATF&#8217;s ability to enforce the law, \n including: requiring years of repeated violations before ATF can revoke the \n license of a corrupt gun dealer; limiting ATF&#8217;s inspection powers to a single,\n unannounced inspection of a gun dealer in any 12-month period; \n classifying serious violations of firearms record-keeping laws as \n misdemeanors rather than felonies; and imposing a heightened &#8220;willfulness&#8221; \n burden of proof for most gun law violations.\n \n \n 11. REQUIRE GUN OWNERS TO REPORT LOST OR STOLEN GUNS \n This is needed to prevent gun owners from covering up sales to prohibited purchasers by later claiming &#8211; when those guns are traced to crime &#8211; that their guns were stolen. ATF has reported that in 88% of the firearms traced to crime, the purchaser of the gun is not the same person as the criminal from whom the gun is recovered.\n \n 12. REQUIRE LICENSED DEALERS TO ADOPT MINIMUM SECURITY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT GUN THEFTS\n ATF should promulgate regulations requiring gun dealers to take mandatory steps to secure their inventory to prevent theft.\n \n 13.

PREVENT DEALERS FROM LIQUIDATING THEIR INVENTORY WITHOUT\n BACKGROUND CHECKS AFTER THEIR LICENSES HAVE BEEN REVOKED \n Even after ATF revokes a dealer&#8217;s license for violating federal law, it has allowed those dealers to transfer their inventory &#8211; frequently hundreds of guns &#8211; to their &#8220;personal collections,&#8221; and then sell them.\n \n 15.

RESTRICT MILITARY-STYLE [ASSAULT] WEAPONS \n \n 18. REQUIRE CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS AND CHILDPROOF SAFETY FEATURES FOR FIREARMS \n One third of children live in homes with firearms, and in almost half of those homes a gun is kept unlocked.76 Yet when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created, the gun lobby ensured that guns &#8211; the one product\n designed to cause death and injury &#8211; were exempt.77 Thus, many handguns do not include life-saving safety features. For example, many guns fire when dropped, and many semiautomatic handguns lack adequate chamber loaded indicators, so untrained users often do not know when a gun is loaded. Handguns should also include feasible childproof safety features that prevent guns from being fired by an unauthorized user. Several models currently on the market have internal locking mechanisms, and technology is being created that could read the palm print or fingerprint of its owner.\n \n 20. REQUIRE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS FOR HANDGUN OWNERS AND IMPROVE RECORDKEEPING OF HANDGUN TRANSFERS\n To reduce gun violence, Congress should enact a law that treats handguns like cars, with handgun owners required to be trained in safe storage and handling of guns; and with sales recorded to help stop interstate gun trafficking. \n \n 20.

   "Most of these restrictions are aimed at reducing the criminal misuse of guns. The fact the gun lobby has opposed a lot of these restrictions shows that their dedication to fighting crime must be seriously questioned.\n\n \n None of the proposals by the Brady Campaign would help fight crime. They're nothing more than freedom ending tactics.\n \n \n \n1. REPEAL THE TIAHRT AMENDMENT'S UNWARRANTED RESTRICTIONS ON ATF -REPEAL RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF CRIME GUN DATA One Tiahrt rider severely limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") to disclose crime gun trace data to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), bars admissibility of such data in civil suits against the gun industry, and restricts disclosure of the data to law enforcement.\n\n \n So even though both the BATFE and the Fraternal Order of Police have both come out in support of keeping gun trace data private, even though if it became public record and a criminal could obtain a shopping list of gun owners by filling out an FOIA request, you still think the Tiahrt Amendment should be done away with?\n \n \n-REPEAL THE 24-HOUR BRADY RECORD DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT\n Another Tiahrt-sponsored appropriations rider codified the Bush\n Administration policy destroying certain National Instant Criminal Background\n Check System (\"NICS\") records after 24 hours....21Without retained NICS\n records, law enforcement has no opportunity to retrieve guns mistakenly\n sold to prohibited purchasers.\n\n \n So the FBI is known for making mistakes?\n \n \n-REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON ATF'S POWER TO REQUIRE DEALER INVENTORY AUDITS A third Tiahrt appropriations rider bars ATF from implementing its proposed regulation requiring gun dealers to conduct annual inventory audits to address the problem of guns \"disappearing\" from gun shops with no record of sale.\n\n \n Prove it.\n \n \n2. REPEAL NEW RULES ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRY IN NATIONAL PARKS\n\n \n So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks, and you can legally hunt within the parks, somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous?\n \n \n3.REPEAL OR AMEND THE FEDERAL GUN INDUSTRY LEGAL PROTECTION STATUTE TO RESTORE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS As Senators, President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden opposed the gun lobbybacked Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\"PLCAA\") signed by President Bush in 2005. The law exempts from basic common law principles gun companies who arm criminals - and treats gun violence victims as second class citizens, without the full rights to seek civil justice that are enjoyed by those injured by any other product or activity. The law should be repealed or amended. The PLCAA radically alters state law, essentially overruling decisions by numerous courts holding that gun dealers, distributors, and manufacturers can be held liable under state common law for injuries caused by their negligent sale or design of guns.35 The PLCAA also eliminates promising incentives to curb gun violence. During the Clinton years, litigation made great strides in forcing the gun industry to become part of the solution to gun violence, including a settlement the Clinton administration secured with Smith & Wesson, which agreed in specific ways to distribute its guns more responsibly and to include safety devices in guns.\n\n \n So lemme get this straight. A Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver is stolen from its rightful owner, found by a police officer, later sold to a known and wanted criminal, who kills an innocent person with said Model 29, and Smith & Wesson should be faced with a lawsuit because of it?\n \n You need a good slap upside your head, you know that? The law already allows for lawsuits to be brought if there's evidence of criminal negligence on the part of the dealer or manufacturer, that's all you need. If you manage to shoot yourself in the leg because you didn't know the gun would go off when you pulled the trigger then you shouldn't have ground for bringing a lawsuit against anyone, except for the doctor who delivered you when you were born because he obviously didn't do it right.\n \n \n5. EXTEND BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ALL GUN SALES, INCLUDING ALL GUN SHOW SALES\n\n \n And...how would this be enforced exactly?\n \n \n7.CLOSE THE \"TERROR GAP\" TO DENY FIREARMS TO TERRORISTS\n\n \n First, prove that you're talking about real and known terrorists, not just people who have their names on some list that the public doesn't have access to.\n \n Second, prove that FFLs in America are selling to known terrorists.\n \n Third, being denied a firearms sale because your name is on a secret list is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n \n Fourth, since there's no qualification to be met before being added to the list, you could easily become a suspected terrorist for living in the same apartment complex as a terrorist.\n \n Does that really sound fair to you?\n \n \n8. PROHIBIT GUN POSSESSION BY VIOLENT MISDEMEANANTS AND PERSONS CONVICTED OF VIOLENT ACTS AS JUVENILES\n\n \n I thought such was already the case.\n \n \n9. RESTRICT LARGE-VOLUME HANDGUN SALES TO REDUCE TRAFFICKING\n\n \n ATF Online - Firearms FAQs\n \n (F5) As a licensed dealer, must I advise ATF if I sell more than one handgun to an individual?\n \n If you sell or dispose of more than one handgun to any non-licensee during a period of 5 consecutive business days, the sale must be reported on ATF Form 3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers, not later than the close of the business day on which you sold or disposed of the second handgun. The licensee must forward a copy of the Form 3310.4 to the ATF office specified thereon, and another copy must be forwarded to the State police or local law enforcement agency where the sale occurred. A copy of the Form 3310.4 also must be attached to the firearms transaction record, ATF Form 4473, documenting the sale or disposition of the second handgun.\n \n A business day for purposes of reporting multiple sales of pistols or revolvers is a day that a licensee conducts business pursuant to the license, regardless of whether State offices are open. The application of the term \"business day\" is, therefore, distinguishable from the term \"business day\" as used in the NICS context. Example: A licensee conducts business only on Saturdays and Sundays, days on which State offices are not open. The licensee sells a pistol to an unlicensed person on a Saturday. If that same unlicensed person acquires another handgun the next day (Sunday), the following Saturday or Sunday, or the Saturday after the reporting requirement would be triggered, the subsequent acquisition of a handgun would have to be reported on a Form 3310.4 by the close of the day upon which the second or subsequent handgun was sold.\n \n [18 U.S.C. 923(g)(3), 27 CFR 478.126a] \n \n Are you INTENTIONALLY playing stupid? Or do you just not believe that the ATF knows what they're talking about?\n \n \n10. GIVE ATF STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW AGAINST CORRUPT DEALERS Almost 60% of the nation's guns traced to crime come from only about 1% of the country's gun dealers, yet ATF is severely hindered in its ability to inspect, sanction, or shut down rogue dealers...Restrictions enacted in 1986 as part of the gun lobby-backed Firearm Owners Protection Act (\"FOPA\") placed severe constraints on ATF's ability to enforce the law, including: requiring years of repeated violations before ATF can revoke the license of a corrupt gun dealer; limiting ATF's inspection powers to a single, unannounced inspection of a gun dealer in any 12-month period; classifying serious violations of firearms record-keeping laws as misdemeanors rather than felonies; and imposing a heightened \"willfulness\" burden of proof for most gun law violations.\n\n \n As it stands right now, the ATF are abusing their authority by repealing an FFL license over an unchecked question box or an incorrect county. I highly doubt that they need ANY more power for dealing with dealers.\n \n \n11. REQUIRE GUN OWNERS TO REPORT LOST OR STOLEN GUNS\n This is needed to prevent gun owners from covering up sales to prohibited purchasers by later claiming - when those guns are traced to crime - that their guns were stolen. ATF has reported that in 88% of the firearms traced to crime, the purchaser of the gun is not the same person as the criminal from whom the gun is recovered.\n\n \n On local levels, counties that have such a requirement have never used it, and have never prosecuted a single person for violating it. Nor is there any proof that a gun is easier to find within 72 hours than it is within 74 hours.\n \n \n12. REQUIRE LICENSED DEALERS TO ADOPT MINIMUM SECURITY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT GUN THEFTS ATF should promulgate regulations requiring gun dealers to take mandatory steps to secure their inventory to prevent theft.\n\n \n Minimum security safeguards could be interpreted as a Fort Knox type vault, or a billion dollar insurance policy. Sounds like nothing more than a scheme to end gun sales through a defacto ban.\n \n \n13. REQUIRE LICENSED GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS TO PERFORM BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THEIR EMPLOYEES Although convicted felons and other prohibited persons are barred from possessing or buying guns, there is no requirement that federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers conduct background checks on employees who sell guns.\n\n \n Evidence please.\n \n \n14. PREVENT DEALERS FROM LIQUIDATING THEIR INVENTORY WITHOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS AFTER THEIR LICENSES HAVE BEEN REVOKED\n Even after ATF revokes a dealer's license for violating federal law, it has allowed those dealers to transfer their inventory - frequently hundreds of guns - to their \"personal collections,\" and then sell them.\n\n \n Evidence please.\n \n \n15. REQUIRE ALL NEW GUNS TO HAVE MICROSTAMPING CAPABILITY BY A DATE CERTAIN A federal microstamping requirement would allow pistols used in crime around the country to be traced by police from the cartridges left behind at crime scenes.69\n\n \n So even though microstamping is unproven, and the whole idea was proposed by the owner of this technology, it should still be implemented?\n \n \n16. REQUIRE DEALERS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS SOLD TO MANUFACTURERS TO STREAMLINE TRACING OF CRIME GUNS Tracing of crime guns is often cumbersome and unsuccessful because ATF must make contact first with the manufacturer, then with the distributor and dealer to complete a trace. As nearly half of traces initiated by law enforcement are not completed to the point of identifying a retail purchaser,70 law enforcement is deprived of valuable leads in solving gun crimes. ATF can streamline and significantly improve tracing by requiring dealers to report simple details about the sale of each gun to the manufacturer.\n\n \n You people are always saying to let the police handle matters and not get involved ourselves. Now you want us to do the police work for them even though we're not qualified? Forget it! That's the job of the police who're charged with investigating crimes!\n \n \n17. RESTRICT MILITARY-STYLE [ASSAULT] WEAPONS\n\n \n Why?\n \n \n18. REQUIRE CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS AND CHILDPROOF SAFETY FEATURES FOR FIREARMS One third of children live in homes with firearms, and in almost half of those homes a gun is kept unlocked.76 Yet when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created, the gun lobby ensured that guns - the one product designed to cause death and injury - were exempt.77 Thus, many handguns do not include life-saving safety features. For example, many guns fire when dropped, and many semiautomatic handguns lack adequate chamber loaded indicators, so untrained users often do not know when a gun is loaded. Handguns should also include feasible childproof safety features that prevent guns from being fired by an unauthorized user. Several models currently on the market have internal locking mechanisms, and technology is being created that could read the palm print or fingerprint of its owner.\n\n \n Sounds like another defacto ban to me. It's 100% impossible to make a childproof gun, and since one can't be made that'd mean that no more guns could ever be sold.\n \n \n20. REQUIRE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS FOR HANDGUN OWNERS AND IMPROVE RECORDKEEPING OF HANDGUN TRANSFERS To reduce gun violence, Congress should enact a law that treats handguns like cars, with handgun owners required to be trained in safe storage and handling of guns; and with sales recorded to help stop interstate gun trafficking.\n\n \n In the early 20th century the country had literacy requirements to keep black people from being able vote.\n \n To me this sounds like just one more in a series of defacto bans. If the test is made hard enough then nobody could ever pass it, so nobody could own any guns. What's keeping the people from who make the test from putting in a question like \"What is the exact ratio of chromium to silicone in the certified storage locking bolts?\" Who the hell would know that?\n \n \n20. IMPROVE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM DATA, AND RESTORE FIREARMS RESEARCH FUNDING FOR THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\n\n \n Forget it. We're in a recession, the government shouldn't be throwing away money to research something stupid like this. You might as well fund an expedition to prove that bigfoot exists.",

   "1. REPEAL THE TIAHRT AMENDMENT'S UNWARRANTED RESTRICTIONS ON ATF \n -REPEAL RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF CRIME GUN DATA \n One Tiahrt rider severely limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, \n Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") to disclose crime gun trace data \n to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), bars \n admissibility of such data in civil suits against the gun industry, and restricts \n disclosure of the data to law enforcement.\n\n \n This also restricts this information from the general public. The Brady's are asking that information of who has guns also be made available to criminals as well. And I thought they wanted to keep guns OUT of the hands of criminals. How do you do this by providing a \"shopping list\" of where guns can be stolen?\n \n \n-REPEAL THE 24-HOUR BRADY RECORD DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT\n Another Tiahrt-sponsored appropriations rider codified the Bush \n Administration policy destroying certain National Instant Criminal Background \n Check System (\"NICS\") records after 24 hours....21Without retained NICS \n records, law enforcement has no opportunity to retrieve guns mistakenly \n sold to prohibited purchasers.\n\n \n I'm all for this one! Since these records will now be kept on hand, there's no reason I should have to have a background check again! You already have my spotless record on file! No reason to continue instant checks!\n \n \n-REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON ATF'S POWER TO REQUIRE DEALER INVENTORY\n AUDITS\n A third Tiahrt appropriations rider bars ATF from implementing its proposed \n regulation requiring gun dealers to conduct annual inventory audits to \n address the problem of guns \"disappearing\" from gun shops with no record of \n sale.\n\n \n What problem? I didn't know dealers were willing to just let these guns \"dissappear\" without monetary reimbursement. Seems to me, if this was happening, dealers would be going out of business left and right since all these guns purchased from manufacturers would result in massive losses when their cost couldn't be recouped through sales.\n \n \n2. REPEAL NEW RULES ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRY IN NATIONAL PARKS\n\n \n Why? Is there something about these parks that make people who carry everywhere outside them \"go bonkers\" when their feet get inside the perimeter of a park?\n \n \n3.REPEAL OR AMEND THE FEDERAL GUN INDUSTRY LEGAL PROTECTION \n STATUTE TO RESTORE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS\n As Senators, President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden opposed the gun lobbybacked\n Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\"PLCAA\") signed by President Bush in 2005.\n The law exempts from basic common law principles gun companies who arm criminals - and treats\n gun violence victims as second class citizens, without the full rights to seek civil justice that are\n enjoyed by those injured by any other product or activity.

During the Clinton years, litigation made great strides in forcing the\n gun industry to become part of the solution to gun violence, including a settlement the Clinton\n administration secured with Smith & Wesson, which agreed in specific ways to distribute its guns\n more responsibly and to include safety devices in guns.\n\n \n Moronic. Can I sue Ford if I get hit by an F-150? Can I sue Bic Corporation when someone uses a lighter to burn down my house? How about I sue Chicago Cutlery if I get stabbed? I guess I can sue Rawlings if I get assaulted with a baseball bat. How does an individual's choice of action imply responsibility for the manufacturer of an inanimate object? If it's good for firearms manufacturers, it must be good for everything else, or else it would be BLATANT UNFAIRNESS. I guess I'll sue Microsoft for my carpal tunnel.\n \n \n5. EXTEND BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ALL GUN SALES, INCLUDING ALL\n GUN SHOW SALES\n\n \n Since you already have records kept, (See above repeal of 24-hour Brady record destruction requirement) there is no need for these as this would be - REDUNDANT!\n \n \n6. FULLY FUND THE NICS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n On January 8, 2008, President Bush signed into law the National Instant \n Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which \n provides for financial assistance to aid states in sending records to NICS \n and financial penalties if they fail to provide records. This law was passed \n after the Virginia Tech massacre, where the killer was able to arm himself\n because a court order that should have blocked his gun purchase was not \n reported to NICS.\n\n \n Again. See \"repeal of the 24 hour Brady Record Destruction Act\". No need for this one since you already have my clean record on file.\n \n \n7.CLOSE THE \"TERROR GAP\" TO DENY FIREARMS TO TERRORISTS \n\n \n \"TERROR GAP\"? Don't forget. YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR WONDERFUL NICS CHECKS THAT YOU SAID WERE THE SOLUTION TO THIS! I thought NICS checks were supposed to do this? ARE YOU SAYING YOU WERE WRONG?\n \n \n8. PROHIBIT GUN POSSESSION BY VIOLENT MISDEMEANANTS AND PERSONS\n CONVICTED OF VIOLENT ACTS AS JUVENILES \n\n \n Duh! ALREADY ILLEGAL - REDUNDANT!\n \n \n9. RESTRICT LARGE-VOLUME HANDGUN SALES TO REDUCE TRAFFICKING\n\n \n Duh! ALREADY REQUIRED - REDUNDANT!\n \n \n10. GIVE ATF STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE\n LAW AGAINST CORRUPT DEALERS \n Almost 60% of the nation's guns traced to crime come from only about\n 1% of the country's gun dealers, yet ATF is severely hindered in its ability \n to inspect, sanction, or shut down rogue dealers...Restrictions enacted in \n 1986 as part of the gun lobby-backed Firearm Owners Protection Act \n (\"FOPA\") placed severe constraints on ATF's ability to enforce the law, \n including: requiring years of repeated violations before ATF can revoke the \n license of a corrupt gun dealer; limiting ATF's inspection powers to a single,\n unannounced inspection of a gun dealer in any 12-month period; \n classifying serious violations of firearms record-keeping laws as \n misdemeanors rather than felonies; and imposing a heightened \"willfulness\" \n burden of proof for most gun law violations.\n\n \n By \"corrupt dealers\" Do you mean dealers like Bud's Gun Shop who's licence was revoked by ATF for USING ABBREVIATIONS like \"ID\" instead of IDAHO? or \"St.\" instead of Street? or \"Rd.\" instead of Road? WOW! These are really corrupt dealers! Such evil villains! They had the AUDACITY to write Mr. instead of MISTER! REVOKE THEIR LICENCE! Such horrible \"corruption\"!\n \n \n \n11. REQUIRE GUN OWNERS TO REPORT LOST OR STOLEN GUNS \n This is needed to prevent gun owners from covering up sales to prohibited purchasers by later claiming - when those guns are traced to crime - that their guns were stolen. ATF has reported that in 88% of the firearms traced to crime, the purchaser of the gun is not the same person as the criminal from whom the gun is recovered.\n\n \n I actually don't have a problem with this. As long as the word \"knowingly\" is included. If a firearm is \"knowingly\" stolen from me. If it isn't known, how can I report it? Certainly, you wouldn't require me to report a gun missing from my safe if i didn't KNOW it was missing from my safe?\n \n \n12. REQUIRE LICENSED DEALERS TO ADOPT MINIMUM SECURITY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT GUN THEFTS\n ATF should promulgate regulations requiring gun dealers to take mandatory steps to secure their inventory to prevent theft.\n\n \n Duh! They do this already. I suggest also having a requirement to require banks to adopt safeguards to prevent money theft. I think there are many businesses that should be required to lock their doors after closing, too.\n \n \n13. REQUIRE LICENSED GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS TO PERFORM\n BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THEIR EMPLOYEES \n Although convicted felons and other prohibited persons are barred from possessing or\n buying guns, there is no requirement that federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers\n conduct background checks on employees who sell guns.\n\n \n Duh! Felons are ALREADY forbidden from being in personal posession of a gun. They ALREADY can't sell me one, so this is - REDUNDANT!\n \n \n14. PREVENT DEALERS FROM LIQUIDATING THEIR INVENTORY WITHOUT\n BACKGROUND CHECKS AFTER THEIR LICENSES HAVE BEEN REVOKED \n Even after ATF revokes a dealer's license for violating federal law, it has allowed those dealers to transfer their inventory - frequently hundreds of guns - to their \"personal collections,\" and then sell them.\n\n \n So, which is it? You don't want violators of Federal law to have guns, yet you don't want them to get rid of them either. Can't possibly do both, now can you? Which one? Do the law breakers keep them, or not? Make it against the law to keep the guns...now make it against the law to sell them. DUH! I guess we'll just hang out in limbo-land!\n \n \n15. REQUIRE ALL NEW GUNS TO HAVE MICROSTAMPING CAPABILITY BY A DATE CERTAIN \n A federal microstamping requirement would allow pistols used in crime around the country to be traced by police from the cartridges left behind at crime scenes.69\n\n \n How? What if I steal blank cartridges from a range and leave them at a crime scene? What if i pick up my empties? WHAT IF I USE A REVOLVER? DUH! What if I buy stock in the only company with a patent on microstamping, then advocate federal law to require it, causing any company who doesn't to go bankrupt? This would be cool! I could make millions while putting all firearm companies out of business!\n \n \n16. REQUIRE DEALERS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS SOLD TO\n MANUFACTURERS TO STREAMLINE TRACING OF CRIME GUNS\n Tracing of crime guns is often cumbersome and unsuccessful because ATF must make contact first with the manufacturer, then with the distributor and dealer to complete a trace. As nearly half of traces initiated by law enforcement are not completed to the point of identifying a retail purchaser,70 law enforcement is deprived of valuable leads in solving gun crimes. ATF can streamline and significantly improve tracing by requiring dealers to report simple details about the sale of each gun to the manufacturer.\n\n \n Huh? I thought manufacturers MADE the guns? Why would they buy them? Wouldn't they just make their own?\n \n \n17. RESTRICT MILITARY-STYLE [ASSAULT] WEAPONS\n \n \n Why? Because they have pistol grips, bayonet lugs, folding stocks, and heat shields? And I thought it was the bullets that killed.\n \n \n18. REQUIRE CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS AND CHILDPROOF SAFETY FEATURES FOR FIREARMS \n One third of children live in homes with firearms, and in almost half of those homes a gun is kept unlocked.76 Yet when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created, the gun lobby ensured that guns - the one product\n designed to cause death and injury - were exempt.77 Thus, many handguns do not include life-saving safety features. For example, many guns fire when dropped, and many semiautomatic handguns lack adequate chamber loaded indicators, so untrained users often do not know when a gun is loaded. Handguns should also include feasible childproof safety features that prevent guns from being fired by an unauthorized user. Several models currently on the market have internal locking mechanisms, and technology is being created that could read the palm print or fingerprint of its owner.\n\n \n Mumbo-jumbo. I think we should require guns to be developed that fire by mind control, and have a laser beam projected from the front of the gun that performs an instant background check and won't let the gun fire if there's an innocent person in front of the gun. I also think we should develop technology that performs a chemical test on any finger that touches the trigger and prevents the gun from firing if it senses illicit drugs. I also think we should develop technology that automatically senses the age of the person firing it and won't let the gun go off if the person is underage. Oh, and we should also develop technology that telepathically senses the mood of the person holding the gun and won't let it fire if that person is angry. This should all be a Federal requirement.\n \n \n20. REQUIRE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS FOR HANDGUN OWNERS AND IMPROVE RECORDKEEPING OF HANDGUN TRANSFERS\n To reduce gun violence, Congress should enact a law that treats handguns like cars, with handgun owners required to be trained in safe storage and handling of guns; and with sales recorded to help stop interstate gun trafficking. \n\n \n Duh. Already can't purchase a gun without a clean record. See \"repeal of the 24 hour Brady Record Destruction Requirement\" above. You already have it on file. - REDUNDANT!\n \n \n20. IMPROVE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM DATA, AND RESTORE FIREARMS RESEARCH FUNDING FOR THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION \n \n \n Huh? What does the CDC have to do with firearms? Didn't know owning a firearm was a disease. Let's also restore firearms research funding for the National Badminton Players Association. How about restoring firearms research funding for the National Fruit Growers Association?\n \n http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/...ition-memo.pdf",

   "http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/pdf/politics/obama-transition-memo.pdf\n \n Most of these restrictions are aimed at reducing the criminal misuse of guns. The fact the gun lobby has opposed a lot of these restrictions shows that their dedication to fighting crime must be seriously questioned.\n\n \n Many of these laws are targeting guns, not people. I seriously don't think you know what you're talking about. By that brand of logic, any gun law is specifically aimed at reducing criminal use of guns, including a complete ban. However, any intelligent person will know that this isn't true. A gun law that is aimed at reducing criminal use of guns targets the people, not the firearm. Background checks, for example, are aimed at reducing criminal use of firearms.\n \n REPEAL NEW RULES ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRY IN NATIONAL PARKS\n \n This certainly sounds like it's aiming more at the guns than the people.\n \n REPEAL OR AMEND THE FEDERAL GUN INDUSTRY LEGAL PROTECTION \n STATUTE TO RESTORE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS\n \n Sometimes it amazes me what crafty justifications these crybabies can come up with. \"Restore equal justice (a redundancy that reflects on the intelligence of many people within that organization :)) for gun violence victims\"? It is obvious to anybody (even you) that this is a backdoor strategy to take guns out of our hands.\n \n And finally, would it be \"reasonable\" for me to sue Camel because I get lung cancer? Would it be reasonable to sue Jack Daniel's if I become an alcoholic? Would it be resonable for me to sue McDonald's if I get fat? Would it be reasonable for me to sue Honda if I get run over? Would it be reasonable for me to sue Tigonderoga if I get stabbed with a pencil? Would it be reasonable for me to sue Sam Adam's if somebody breaks a beer bottle, and uses it to stab my buddy to death? Would it be reasonable for me to sue Eastsport if my buddy gets smothered by a hoody? Would it be reasonable for me to sue Mongoose if I get into a bike accident? If not, then why would it be reasonable to sue the gun industry if my buddy gets shot?\n \n \n CLOSE THE &#8220;TERROR GAP&#8221; TO DENY FIREARMS TO TERRORISTS \n \n What defines a terrorist? Where is the line drawn? And more importantly, how would you identify a terrorist? If we have sold to identifiable terrorists, then how come they never end up in prison?\n \n Otherwise, good luck enforcing that. :)\n \n RESTRICT LARGE-VOLUME HANDGUN SALES TO REDUCE TRAFFICKING\n \n This is obviously targeting the guns rather than the people.\n \n GIVE ATF STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE\n LAW AGAINST CORRUPT DEALERS \n \n From what I see, the only way to identify a dealer as being corrupt is if they don't follow the laws (this makes their dealings illegitimate, so scratch that) or if their guns are used in a crime. This is just another backdoor strategy to take away as many guns as possible.\n \n REQUIRE GUN OWNERS TO REPORT LOST OR STOLEN GUNS \n \n This is pathetic. I've seen all kinds of strategies to take firearms away, but this is probably the first backdoor strategy to arrest as many gun owners as possible. This is desperation, plain and simple. \n \n Anyone who is vaguely aware of the Brady Campaign's existance will know that they advocate holding the original owner of a firearm responsible for a crime if his/her firearm is stolen and used to commit a crime. So in other words, if a crime is committed with a stolen firearm, then the original owner would have to say \"Here I am! Come and arrest me!\" Both of these laws are unreasonable. It's like saying that a rape victim should be charged as an accomplice to rape.\n \n REQUIRE LICENSED DEALERS TO ADOPT MINIMUM SECURITY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT GUN THEFTS\n \n And if something happens and they can't afford it?\n \n REQUIRE LICENSED GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS TO PERFORM\n BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THEIR EMPLOYEES \n \n What difference does this make?\n \n PREVENT DEALERS FROM LIQUIDATING THEIR INVENTORY WITHOUT\n BACKGROUND CHECKS AFTER THEIR LICENSES HAVE BEEN REVOKED \n \n Why? So you can arrest them for selling without a liscense? What happens to all those poor leftovers? People in factories around the world worked hard to make them, you know.\n \n REQUIRE ALL NEW GUNS TO HAVE MICROSTAMPING CAPABILITY BY A DATE CERTAIN \n \n What evidence do you get from that? A number? Further, of all the Brady campaign's lies and deceptive strategies, this is the most crafty. For the company that has a patent on microstamping tech, well, good for them. Every other firearm company would go bankrupt. And then the one remaining company would be charged with monopolizing. It's just another backdoor strategy. And finally, the possiblities of how the particular cartridge with ended up at the crime scene are countless. The number doesn't really help solve anything. It's a number; nothing more.\n \n REQUIRE DEALERS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS SOLD TO\n MANUFACTURERS TO STREAMLINE TRACING OF CRIME GUNS\n \n First off, the manufacturers don't purchase firearms. And second, why do you want to know all about that bullet's history? The only two things that matter are:\n \n 1. The bullet is in that guy.\n \n 2. Who pulled the trigger.\n \n Once again, this is just another lame law that targets the guns, not the people.\n \n RESTRICT MILITARY-STYLE [ASSAULT] WEAPONS \n \n I distinctly remember you saying that these laws are designed to reduce criminal ownership. It was either on this very thread (this very page, even) or I was hallucinating. Somehow, I find the earlier more likely.\n \n Second, Emperor Clinton's AWB defined Assault weapons based on cosmetic features, not the functionality of a firearm.\n \n IMPROVE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM DATA, AND RESTORE FIREARMS RESEARCH FUNDING FOR THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION \n \n What's next? You want us to pay our taxes directly to the Brady Campaign? Because frankly, the CDCP isn't much better. You would know if you learned more about them, but alot of work can be spared if I just point out to you that in the line above, the Brady Campaign is endorsing these people, presumably funding by our tax dollars. I can't believe that these people want me to pay for the government to confiscate my firearms. emoticon_wow",

   "1. REPEAL THE TIAHRT AMENDMENT'S UNWARRANTED RESTRICTIONS ON ATF\n -REPEAL RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF CRIME GUN DATA\n One Tiahrt rider severely limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol,\n Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") to disclose crime gun trace data\n to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), bars\n admissibility of such data in civil suits against the gun industry, and restricts\n disclosure of the data to law enforcement.\n \n This is a load of dung. Law Enforcement is not prohibited on investigating crimes and that includes firearm traces. Also the Freedom of Information act does not apply not individuals who are not part of the government to some extent.\n \n I quote:\n \n \n Like all federal agencies, the Department of Justice (DOJ) generally is required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose records requested in writing by any person. However, agencies may withhold information pursuant to nine exemptions and three exclusions contained in the statute. The FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, or by state or local government agencies. Each state has its own public access laws that should be consulted for access to state and local records.\n \n -REPEAL THE 24-HOUR BRADY RECORD DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT\n Another Tiahrt-sponsored appropriations rider codified the Bush\n Administration policy destroying certain National Instant Criminal Background\n Check System (\"NICS\") records after 24 hours....21Without retained NICS\n records, law enforcement has no opportunity to retrieve guns mistakenly\n sold to prohibited purchasers.\n \n Another load of dung. Records are already kept for every transaction made. They are destroyed after a certain amount years. You know who keeps them? The FFL dealers.\n \n -REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON ATF'S POWER TO REQUIRE DEALER INVENTORY\n AUDITS\n A third Tiahrt appropriations rider bars ATF from implementing its proposed\n regulation requiring gun dealers to conduct annual inventory audits to\n address the problem of guns \"disappearing\" from gun shops with no record of\n sale.\n emoticon_rolleyes Umm....they do know that audits are already done right?\n \n 2. REPEAL NEW RULES ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRY IN NATIONAL PARKS\n \n Why? No harm done. I can open carry one you know...emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 3.REPEAL OR AMEND THE FEDERAL GUN INDUSTRY LEGAL PROTECTION\n STATUTE TO RESTORE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS\n As Senators, President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden opposed the gun lobbybacked\n Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\"PLCAA\") signed by President Bush in 2005.\n The law exempts from basic common law principles gun companies who arm criminals - and treats\n gun violence victims as second class citizens, without the full rights to seek civil justice that are\n enjoyed by those injured by any other product or activity. The law should be repealed or amended.\n The PLCAA radically alters state law, essentially overruling decisions by numerous courts holding that gun dealers,\n distributors, and manufacturers can be held liable under state common law for\n injuries caused by their negligent sale or design of guns.35 The PLCAA also eliminates promising\n incentives to curb gun violence. During the Clinton years, litigation made great strides in forcing the\n gun industry to become part of the solution to gun violence, including a settlement the Clinton\n administration secured with Smith & Wesson, which agreed in specific ways to distribute its guns\n more responsibly and to include safety devices in guns.\n \n \n This is the most stupidest one of them all. They basically want to sue the bejesus out of the gun companies because some ##### shot some kid or something. That's like suing Ford because some drunk ##### ran his explorer in some car filled with kids. It's NO different.\n \n 5. EXTEND BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ALL GUN SALES, INCLUDING ALL\n GUN SHOW SALES\n \n Brady background checks are pointless. They are big nuisance in fact. The NICS is a lot more accurate and faster.\n \n 6. FULLY FUND THE NICS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n On January 8, 2008, President Bush signed into law the National Instant\n Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which\n provides for financial assistance to aid states in sending records to NICS\n and financial penalties if they fail to provide records. This law was passed\n after the Virginia Tech massacre, where the killer was able to arm himself\n because a court order that should have blocked his gun purchase was not\n reported to NICS.\n \n This I can agree with. I don't mind the financial aid if it helps keep guns away from people who shouldn't have firearms.\n \n 7.CLOSE THE \"TERROR GAP\" TO DENY FIREARMS TO TERRORISTS\n \n I really hate this one. Want to know why? Because it relies on the Patriot Act on which almost anyone can be put on the list. Until that is fixed I'm not in favor of it.\n \n 8. PROHIBIT GUN POSSESSION BY VIOLENT MISDEMEANANTS AND PERSONS\n CONVICTED OF VIOLENT ACTS AS JUVENILES\n \n No argument here.\n \n 9. RESTRICT LARGE-VOLUME HANDGUN SALES TO REDUCE TRAFFICKING\n \n Against it. Again where is the proof that this works?\n \n 10. GIVE ATF STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE\n LAW AGAINST CORRUPT DEALERS\n Almost 60% of the nation's guns traced to crime come from only about\n 1% of the country's gun dealers, yet ATF is severely hindered in its ability\n to inspect, sanction, or shut down rogue dealers...Restrictions enacted in\n 1986 as part of the gun lobby-backed Firearm Owners Protection Act\n (\"FOPA\") placed severe constraints on ATF's ability to enforce the law,\n including: requiring years of repeated violations before ATF can revoke the\n license of a corrupt gun dealer; limiting ATF's inspection powers to a single,\n unannounced inspection of a gun dealer in any 12-month period;\n classifying serious violations of firearms record-keeping laws as\n misdemeanors rather than felonies; and imposing a heightened \"willfulness\"\n burden of proof for most gun law violations.\n \n This is something I certainly cannot support. The ATF has been known to lie on record to prosecute people. There is no way in heck I'd ever give them more power. FFL dealers have it hard enough, you want it even harder? You know they even complain to dealers about not writing the entire state name on the forms? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 11. REQUIRE GUN OWNERS TO REPORT LOST OR STOLEN GUNS\n This is needed to prevent gun owners from covering up sales to prohibited purchasers by later claiming - when those guns are traced to crime - that their guns were stolen. ATF has reported that in 88% of the firearms traced to crime, the purchaser of the gun is not the same person as the criminal from whom the gun is recovered.\n \n Again...I'm against this. Gun owners report their guns 99% percent of the time if stolen. To put certain restrictions on this would not only prevent them from doing so, but would require that owner prove they didn't know it was stolen. It should be the other way around.\n \n 12. REQUIRE LICENSED DEALERS TO ADOPT MINIMUM SECURITY SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT GUN THEFTS\n ATF should promulgate regulations requiring gun dealers to take mandatory steps to secure their inventory to prevent theft.\n \n ...this is already done......\n \n 13. REQUIRE LICENSED GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS TO PERFORM\n BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THEIR EMPLOYEES\n Although convicted felons and other prohibited persons are barred from possessing or\n buying guns, there is no requirement that federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers\n conduct background checks on employees who sell guns.\n \n There is no requirement but you can be they still do the background check.\n \n 14. PREVENT DEALERS FROM LIQUIDATING THEIR INVENTORY WITHOUT\n BACKGROUND CHECKS AFTER THEIR LICENSES HAVE BEEN REVOKED\n Even after ATF revokes a dealer's license for violating federal law, it has allowed those dealers to transfer their inventory - frequently hundreds of guns - to their \"personal collections,\" and then sell them.\n \n ..and this is a problem how?\n \n 15. REQUIRE ALL NEW GUNS TO HAVE MICROSTAMPING CAPABILITY BY A DATE CERTAIN\n A federal microstamping requirement would allow pistols used in crime around the country to be traced by police from the cartridges left behind at crime scenes.69\n \n Stupid and unreliable. Maryland does this and it doesn't work. It costs wayyyy to much money to maintain, they are much better off just doing unique matches from casing to barrels.\n \n 16. REQUIRE DEALERS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS SOLD TO\n MANUFACTURERS TO STREAMLINE TRACING OF CRIME GUNS\n Tracing of crime guns is often cumbersome and unsuccessful because ATF must make contact first with the manufacturer, then with the distributor and dealer to complete a trace. As nearly half of traces initiated by law enforcement are not completed to the point of identifying a retail purchaser,70 law enforcement is deprived of valuable leads in solving gun crimes. ATF can streamline and significantly improve tracing by requiring dealers to report simple details about the sale of each gun to the manufacturer.\n \n Trust me it's a lot faster than what they. Dealers have more record keeping to do (which is what they the Brady Campaign are trying to accomplish, which is limit gun dealers)\n \n 17. RESTRICT MILITARY-STYLE [ASSAULT] WEAPONS\n \n ....why do I need to argue this. It's pointless to do so.\n \n 18. REQUIRE CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS AND CHILDPROOF SAFETY FEATURES FOR FIREARMS\n One third of children live in homes with firearms, and in almost half of those homes a gun is kept unlocked.76 Yet when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created, the gun lobby ensured that guns - the one product\n designed to cause death and injury - were exempt.77 Thus, many handguns do not include life-saving safety features. For example, many guns fire when dropped, and many semiautomatic handguns lack adequate chamber loaded indicators, so untrained users often do not know when a gun is loaded. Handguns should also include feasible childproof safety features that prevent guns from being fired by an unauthorized user. Several models currently on the market have internal locking mechanisms, and technology is being created that could read the palm print or fingerprint of its owner.\n \n Even with all these accidents still happen. Want to know why? It's called irresponsible parents. Beside less than 200 children a year die from accidental gun shots. That is it is not significant compared to the population. While tragic yes, the best solution is education.\n \n 20. REQUIRE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS FOR HANDGUN OWNERS AND IMPROVE RECORDKEEPING OF HANDGUN TRANSFERS\n To reduce gun violence, Congress should enact a law that treats handguns like cars, with handgun owners required to be trained in safe storage and handling of guns; and with sales recorded to help stop interstate gun trafficking.\n \n Again..pointless. Even with licensing standards of cars, we still tons of accidents. This is just more loops to jump through.\n \n 20. IMPROVE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM DATA, AND RESTORE FIREARMS RESEARCH FUNDING FOR THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\n \n The centers of DISEASE control and prevention should just stick to that.
