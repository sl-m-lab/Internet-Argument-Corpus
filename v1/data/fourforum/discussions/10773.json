In the end I don't care which of the 3 wins as long they beat the repubilcan. I loved what Edwards said about corporate greed and I can only hope that more taxes and regulations are comming the corporate way if Edwards wins. Huckabees speech on the other hand was sickening. He looks, sounds, and has some of the same body language as Nixon. Apearantly, from Huckabees past statements, the We, as he kept saying, doesn't include aids patiences or gay people. Since Huckabee wants to quarentine people with aids and is opposed to civil rights for gay people. And I almost forgot he believes women must submit to their husbands. People you want to quarentine, make second class citizens, and have submit to other people can not be apart of the \"We\".",

And finally, at the very bottom is the eye witness who saw the explosion before the crash. \n \n http://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/CRASH/JFK_JR/upi.html\n At 9:39 p.m. Friday, Kennedy radioed the airport and said he was 13\n miles from the airport and 10 miles from the coast, according to WCVB-TV\n news in Boston. He reportedly said he was making his final approach. \n Moments later, radar operated by the Federal Aviation Administration\n showed the plane went into a dive and dropped 1,200 feet in just 12\n seconds, according to ABC News. In his final approach message, WCVB-TV said Kennedy told controllers\n at the airport that he planned to drop off his wife's sister and then\n take off again between 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. for Hyannis Airport. Kennedy's family then called Hyannis Airport - around 2:15 a.m.,\n reports say - when he failed to arrive. The airport then checked with\n the Martha's Vineyard airport, and the search began.\n The plane took off from Essex County Airport in Caldwell, N.J., at\n 8:38 p.m. Friday and lost contact with the FAA on its final approach to\n Martha's Vineyard, Mass., said Coast Guard spokesman Steve Carleton.\n An emergency beacon thought to belong to the plane was activated and\n heard by the Coast Guard in Long Island, N.Y., at 3:40 a.m. But as the\n search went on, authorities seemed to discount the relevance of the\n beacon signal.\n Kurt Hartman, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard's district\n headquarters in New Haven, Conn., said this morning, \"We received a\n call from our district office in Boston directing us to conduct a\n shoreline search off Horton Point, in Long Island Sound, for an\n emergency locating transmitting beacon.\"\n But by 10:30 a.m., the Coast Guard was no longer receiving a signal\n from the emergency beacon that was believed to be on Kennedy's small\n plane.\n Petty Officer Virginia Adams in Boston confirmed to United Press\n International that the Coast Guard lost the signal Saturday morning.\n Adams also confirmed that Kennedy was piloting the plane, and that his\n wife and sister-in-law were aboard.\n Jamie Gaspar, spokesman for Martha's Vineyard Airport, told UPI that\n \"someone was at the airport to pick up the passengers on the plane, but\n it never arrived.\"\n  A reporter for the Vineyard Gazette newspaper told WCVB-TV in Boston\n that he was out walking Friday night about the time of the crash and saw\n \"big white flash in the sky\" off Philbin Beach.

One is: who will be ready to lead from day one? The second, who can we nominate who will go the distance against the Republicans?\"\n \n During that second round, Time reported, Mrs. Clinton was forced to pause as boos from the crowd mixed with cheers from her own supporters.\n \n The Swampland concluded that if the dinner \"is any bellwether - Barack Obama will handily win here.\"\n \n \u00a9 2008 Newsmax.

   "New Hampshire has a bad record as well. I guess they are kinda the opposite of Iowa haha.\n\n \n Yep. I remember when people actually thought it was important to win those two states, now if you win in Iowa you may as well drop out of the race and NH is not much better. \n \n NH will be an important state for Paul because it will be a good test of whether he is gaing to be able to actually get his supporters out to vote. In that way the Paul campaign is much like the Dean campaign. Both put heavy reliance in non traditional voting blocks. Deans supporters could not be bothered to get up off their butts and go vote.

Read this!\n \n http://www.ilanamercer.com/Failure.htm\n Only weeks back, health care experts celebrated the imminent infusion into the Canada Health and Social Transfer system of some $21.2-billion dollars. There was a sense of being back on track. The experts, for the most, claimed a renewed pledge had been made to the health care Leviathan, although they gingerly proffered that more of a change in delivery of services was required. This has been forgotten. Defection of specialists continues unabated, waiting times for life saving treatment grow, and much of the diagnostic equipment is obsolete.\n \n Make no mistake; I am not here accusing the Feds of good will. But even they, however, are powerless to give the nation what it demands, because no amount of money will do, not ever. A socialized system by nature midwives the dilapidation we are witnessing.\n \n Show me a company in the private sector (which is not the recipient of government handouts) that is shielded from bankruptcy. An audit doubtless would reveal that Medicare is insolvent, yet the fact that the taxpayer is forced to bankroll it indefinitely with tax dollars, immunizes the system against fiscal accountability. Medicare, it can be said, is a perfect system of unaccountability. Compounding this, prices of services are pegged at zero. This drives consumers to use the service voraciously, with the result that endemic shortages are built into the system.\n \n And why are the experts in a tizzy attempting arbitrarily to figure out where the latest cash is needed most? They can't seem to decide whether it should go to technology, staff, or maybe towards new databases to keep tabs on Canadians. In a free market, the institute of private property ensures that we have prices. Prices are like a compass: pegged to supply and demand they ensure the correct allocation of resources. Conversely, in a nationalized system there are no prices because there is no private property. Absent such knowledge, misallocation of capital is inevitable. The attitude, however, seems to be that of \"let the people use derri\u00e8re doctors (proctologists)\" if misallocation causes shortages of surgeons.\n \n By design, a monopoly produces a different kind of worker. Unwilling to have their wages capped and freedoms restricted, the best inevitably leave. Mediocrity, unfortunately, gives rise to fewer malcontents and thus is a prerequisite for stability in the system. Put it this way: if a socialized system wants to survive, it must expunge the most driven and gifted from its midst. When wages, moreover, are tied to a negotiated deal with labour, rather than, in the case of a competitive market, to the individual physician's performance, the position of the mediocre practitioner is further reinforced.\n \n In Canada, who takes her cues from North Korea and Cuba, medical professionals can only but work for one Firm, so to speak, if they want to practice their skills. If their instinct for freedom overcomes them, they must flee Canada's jurisdiction. While many medical professionals have been driven away by such fascism, the perverse incentive scheme operating in a socialized system soon subdues the rest. Rewarding competency with increased workload, but no extra pay, is one hell of a way to ensure professionals become sluggish, if only for the sake of their own self-preservation.\n \n Medicare is in fact a pit of perverse incentives. It's hard to get kinkier than to make failure tantamount to success. If a hospital consistently underperforms the administration has cause to celebrate. Why? Because it is rewarded with more funds to ostensibly \"fix the problem\". To underperform is to have your budget increased. With no out-of-pocket payment for the odd slip of the scalpel, the underperformers shoulder little responsibility. The eternally patient or comatose Canadian taxpayer is the one who must pony up for such pooling of risks or insurance. Absent competition, Canadians are trapped in the dilapidated corridors of this national symbol.\n \n The system is not beyond pressing doctors into occasional slavery by making it an offense for them to refuse to treat defaulting patients. In British Columbia some doctors are now suing one of Medicare's front organizations for \"not receiving payment for performing medical services\". Guess who pays?\n \n Food is undisputedly more vital to the survival of the species than is health care. Without the seed growers, the farmers and the retailer we would starve. How then can we abandon this life-giving industry to the free market? The reason the leaders have not nationalized the entire food industry, although they have recklessly regulated aspects of it, is because even they know that if they did, we would all starve. Yet such a scenario with its attendant parallels is well underway in Medicare. Why then do we refuse to draw the inevitable conclusions?\n ",

Well, as a card carrying \"Lefty\", I would have to say he's a putz. I don't like Limbaugh, I think he's a XXXXX. But if people want to listen to him, that's their problem. I think the same thing about Fox news. I have it in my cable package. Never watch it though.\n \n \nBut Hillary proved the Left will eat their own when she had her own PAC, Media Matters successfully go after Don Imus even though he is a regular supporter of the liberal Washington elite. What he isn't though is a Hillary supporter and called her satan on his show most every day of the week. And for that he had to go.\n\n \n Oh, do you have a transcript of the meeting she held where she stated that he had to go?\n \n \nSo she set Media Matters on him for his nappy headed ho statement\n\n So in your opinion, it's ok to resort to people as \"nappy headed ho's\"?\n \n \nfaster than bill clinton can pull down his pants for a 17 year old hooker. \n\n Nice, you just accused your former president of pedophilia and child abuse. Any support for that statement?\n \n \nSo don't even try to infer that if this crowd doesn't get my jokes that it's my fault cuz you guys need a serious personality tune up.\n\n \n As I stated above, your \"jokes\" aren't funny. Degrading, demeaning, and name calling are not funny.\n \n \nEnjoy the read, according to your idea of solid evidence, this is irrefutable.\n\n \n Yeah, the first paragraph is full of the typical \"why do liberals hate X?\" that is common to these neocon a**holes.\n \n \"What is it like to be a far left liberal? I mean, how does it feel to be miserable, pessimistic, and full of hatred? \"\n Uh, I'm not.\n \n \"What is it like to wake up everyday and call for somebody new to resign, be fired, or impeached?\"\n I think anyone who doesn't believe that Bush and Cheney have taken part in impeachable offences is delusional.\n \n \"What is it like to despise America, despise Christianity, and despise masculine men?\"\n Typical neocon ####. If you don't follow blindly, you're not an American. If you're not a Falwell/Robertson puppet, you hate Christianity. What's this part about \"masculine men\" though? Or has he bought into Bush's photo ops on the aircraft carrier and chopping wood on the ranch, just like a good ole boy (from Connecticut)?\n \n \"What is it like to be so freaking unhappy that you are unable to laugh at anything?\"\n I actually laugh at quite a bit. But I don't find mean spirited comments whose only purpose is to demean \"funny\"",

   "Hi TQ, how you doin ole buddy? :) \n \n \nNo, we \"lefty's\" just don't find degrading people funny. Al Franken is a \"lefty\", I think he's got a pretty good sense of humour.\n\n \n Speaking of Franken and his famous sense of humor...\n \n http://www.radioink.com/listingsEntry.asp?ID=204288&PT=industryqa\n Al Franken: \"I'm A Liberal, Dammit!\" (04/12/04)\n By Reed Bunzel, Editor-In-Chief \n \n For the last few years, the liberal left has looked upon humorist Al Franken as its talk-show-host-in-waiting, the progressives' answer to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly - essentially, the counterpoint to all things conservative. \n \n The conventional wisdom goes something like this: \"The right wing has such a head start in political talk radio, liberals can never hope to catch up.\" Add the notion that liberals take their politics too seriously to ever be able to be funny, and - as Laura Ingraham told Radio Ink last fall, \"The liberals have National Public Radio...all the liberals I know listen to it.\" The general conservative consensus here is: \"Why would the left want to risk being unfunny on commercial talk radio, especially when they have NPR and all the rest of the 'liberal' media?\" \n \n That's where Al Franken enters the picture. The New York Times best-selling author of Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right, a self-avowed liberal, an Emmy-winning writer/producer and a political activist, Franken embodies the left's greatest hope for making up the great lead that conservatives have built up in talk radio. \n \n \"Once Rush Limbaugh made the medium what it was, a lot of Rush imitators came in,\" Franken observes. \"The landscape very quickly became right-wing, and it became very difficult for liberals to get in there. I felt that the best way for this to work was to build a network and give people a place where they could go for liberal talk.\" The result: Fledging liberal network Air America Radio last month announced Franken as the centerpiece of its talk show schedule, setting him squarely in the 12:00 noon-3:00 p.m. midday time slot. \n \n Of course this was written just as Air America was being launched with their liberal poster boy, with a sense of humor no less, as their great liberal hope. What's it been, 2 years now since he was pulled from the Air waves because they couldn't pay their bills? So much for the liberal sense of humor. emoticon_xlove",

Her belief in the possibilities of change in America, and her sometimes unbashed willingness to take it on without second-guessing a backlash or whether or not the dream is or isn't popular. So, while I think politicians are all fake to some extent, she is more genuine than many, in that way. Without calculation, she just did what she thought was the right thing -- and what was achievable because this is America.\n \n Also. Many men politicians, liberal or conservative, see one seat in an office as a road to another. But they are not called opportunistic bitches, nor are their thighs and other body parts discussed. It's just the normal road mapping of a career in government.\n \n Another note on genuineness. I listened to the Bill Clinton interview on Charlie Rose and Hillary's mom's comments on a commercial. They both spoke of how she is always doing for others. I found them both very believable. I also see her daughter on stage with her and I think she loves her mom very much.

The first time I saw that, after puking, I started yelling at the TV for her to explain her 35 years of public service to me. Where and in what life did that happen. Does being an unelected first lady now qualify one as a public servant? It didn't used to. Does being a Corporate Lawyer, and a corrupt one at that qualify as a public servant? Not in the real World it doesn't, but in hillary's World it evidently does.\n \n The point is antonia, the woman is a criminal, a liar and a self serving elitist. If I really believed she had America's best interest at heart then I could overlook her human foibles as nobody's perfect, but I truly believe she is a scumbag and is unredeemable as a human being. Like I said earlier, she's a political whore, and the only question mark that remains is what the price will be to buy her allegiance, and which enemy of America will pay it.",

Our political system seems to have become very corrupt, so it's difficult to know who's tainted and who isn't -- or if anyone isn't. I don't think corruption is acceptable, but I don't think we can conclude people are corrupt on the basis of our intuitions. Each of us is just a human being and we can have dramatically different intuitions and views of the same person in a public office. Who knows who's right? Personally, I think we're all too influenced by the media, as well. They lead us around by the nose. Even a simple photograph, for example, can be altered to make the same person wonderful or awful.

There's a long way to go though so It's way to early to make any predictions for me.\n\n \n I've been starving to ask why we haven't heard any reference to the word \"Nepotism\" or even the idea of it. Isn't it kind of double barrelled overpowerment to have an exPresident dominating the Hillary spotlight?? I wonder why the Republican commentators aren't saying that it is just bad form. \n And if Mrs. Clinton is a women's rights advocate, shouldn't she be trying to prove that she can run for President on her own, without Bill's dominance drowning her out? If she wants the women's votes, why is she showing so blatantly that she can't do it on her own? Will he be the \"real\" president, and is that what they both are after? \n Seems to me that the Republicans could do a lot with these ideas. \n Anyway, do we need the Democrats to stumble all over themselves and make themselves appear so un-Presidential?

Plus what your cut n paste missed from my post - that is, high corruption, drug and gun running, murder and kidnapping of innocent Nicaraguan villagers.\n \n Is that stomping out the spread of the Soviets? Letting freedom ring? I think not.\n \n Have you forgotten how hard the American public worked lobbying Congress to stop funding those Contras? Because it was unAmerican to kidnap young boys and force them into indentured servitude as child soldiers? Or drive into villages, machine gunning down wedding parties? That is, provide illegal weapons and funding to a Central American terrorist campaign? \n \n Those were fruits of your beloved Reagan administration.\n \n Saturday Night Live used to run a little number on Ronald Reagan. They'd show him with his dumb and innocent number, jokes interjected, during his public appearances. Then, when the doors were shut, how suddenly he changed, ruthlessly articulating his true aims, with a much more sophisticated command of the English language than the American audience ever suspected.\n \n As to what kind of change I myself am refering to for this country, see my yesterday, 5:26 PM post in the Chelsea and America thread under Elections. A number of those changes are professedly Barack's goals, as well as Hillary's and John's.\n \n Cry, Bassman. For your Reagan to Bush disaster of a Republican party is going down, down, down!",

   "Unless Barack really is a conservative?...\n \n \n\n \n Obama conservative? Decide for yourself: http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=9490\n \n A sample: \n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the NARAL Pro-Choice America 100 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Planned Parenthood 100 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State 100 percent in 2006.\n \n 2005-2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the American Civil Liberties Union 83 percent in 2005-2006.\n \n 2005-2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Human Rights Campaign 89 percent in 2005-2006.\n \n 2005-2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 100 percent in 2005-2006. \n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Conservative Index - The John Birch Society 18 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Eagle Forum 0 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 According to the National Journal - Composite Conservative Score's calculations, in 2006, Senator Obama voted more liberal on economic, defense and foreign policy issues than 14 percent of the Senators.\n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Children's Defense Fund 100 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 Senator Obama supported the interests of the Family Research Council 0 percent in 2006.\n \n 2006 According to the National Journal - Composite Liberal Score's calculations, in 2006, Senator Obama voted more liberal on economic, defense and foreign policy issues than 86 percent of the Senators.\n \n \nPersonally, I was dismayed by his remarks about Reagan and do not find his presentation unifying, but rather divisive. ...\n \n How an astute, well educated Democratic candidate who cares about this country and the common people -- could miss the implications of such public statements, before making them, I find troubling. IMO, he does not seem well poised politically to bring about the kind of change in America that's needed. But needing too much to cater to the Republican party in order to get elected.\n\n \n Here's what he actually said: \n \n \"Obama: \"I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like with all the excesses of the '60s and the '70s, and government had grown and grown, but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is, 'We want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.'\n \n \". . . I think we're in one of those times right now, where people feel like things as they are going aren't working. That we're bogged down in the same arguments that we've been having, and they're not useful. And the Republican approach, I think, has played itself out.\n \n \"I think it's fair to say that the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10 to 15 years in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom.\"\n \n Here's what Hillary said he said: \n \n \"Clinton: \"The facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10 to 15 years. . . . \n \n \"Now, I personally think they had ideas, but they were bad ideas. They were bad ideas for America. They were ideas like privatizing Social Security, like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt.\" http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-trailvoices25jan25,1,2236668.story\n \n \"The facts are...\"?\n \n No, he DID NOT say that \"he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10-15 years.\" In fact, he explicitly stated that the Republican approach had \"played itself out\". \n \n Hillary's certainly smart enough to parse Obama's meaning in these comments, which I regard as pretty much on target and reflecting the reality of the \"Reagan Democrats\", so I consider her interpretation as deliberate distortion and a style of campaigning that really really turns me off.",

   " I consider her interpretation as deliberate distortion and a style of campaigning that really really turns me off.\n\n \n Hello JL, I have seen every single candidate in this campaign distort others, not the least of which has been Obama.\n \n That is just one reason why I am never a true believer. Politicians are exactly that -- political animals -- their competitions among each other, IMO, for voters, should be mostly an opportunity to make them perform for the People. By making solid commitments on issues and goals, showing how they are going to achieve them.\n \n Perhaps that makes me overly cynical, which is not what Mr. Obama calls for in his speeches, but I am also a bit older than Mr. Obama. And ... I am not running for public office, nor am I here to help him cover his butt when he gets there. \n \n To me, his Reagan comments, as a candidate, reflected nothing more than pandering to the right. Otherwise, he's either extremely naive, misinformed about the Reagan administration in a larger context, or, poor public communication skills. None of which I believe are the case with an accomplished gentleman like Mr. Obama.\n \n The comments were divisive, not unifying. \n \n Mr. Edwards also blasted Mr. Obama for what he said.\n \n Mr. Obama is apparently setting some trails with his mixture of positions falling in any number of political categories. I am troubled by where some of that could lead. I see certain issues in America as simply needing strong stands, without compromise or (as the last youtube showed) licking.\n \n Some people won't be happy about it, but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I think Mr. Obama should face that, if he hasn't already.",
