   "Chechens 'cultural' centers are mushrooming in European cities. But beware those mushrooms are poisonous!\n September 1, 2006 the opening of new CHRI cultural center happened in Austria. I see it as threat. Not that I don't like Chechen culture. I just know that CHRI and Chechnya is not the same. CHRI and its government in exile are mere terrorists who showed off as beasts in Beslan!\n Activity of so called 'cultural' centers is secret only to our authorities. They have been engaged in fundraising allegedly for refugees but in reality for terrorist missions. They've been recruiting volunteers including locals to take part in terror attacks in Europe! Chechens refugees took control over crime business of Europe. And money which they got by weapons, drugs and people trade is spreading for rebels support. \n IMO European officials generally and our politicians in Australia just don't want to defend us from terrorists unlike Bush and his command in USA. There they are treating Chechen terrorists as international terrorists. And there have been no new attacks on them since 9/11. Here it's not the case. We still see them as like political force, Zakaev, Salamov and their like. They are threat to Europeans' security.",
