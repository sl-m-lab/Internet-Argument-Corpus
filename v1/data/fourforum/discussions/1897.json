When was the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church officially started and why was there a split and the forming of your Synod, the ELCA, as well as the Wisconsin Synod?\n\n \n No problem. \n 1. We really don't have much of a heirarchy. There is the pastor, then the regional offices (beurocratic mostly), then the district offices. If you want to include all of the Lutheran denomination (including the Wisconsin Synod and ELCA), I believe that there may be a higher governing body.\n 2. It's just easier to control, manage that way. Mostly, the policies are carried out by the individual churches through elected committees or through the sermens of the pastor.\n 3. I believe that the sacrements are only Baptism and Communion (possibly marriage as well, I'd have to check on that). The reason that we do not include confirmation, confession, and those is that there is not a physical symbol of God's grace involved. Baptism = water, Communion = his body and blood in the bread and wine.\n 4. I am not sure exactly when the Missouri Synod started, though Lutheranism started after the split with the Catholic church when Martin Luther tried to get the Catholic leadership to ammend their procedures with his 95 theses. Among his problems were the selling of salvation (indulgences), the services being in Latin (not the language of the people), and the focus on the Pope and relics instead of Jesus, where it should be. I'm not quite sure when the different Synods split, but they rank (in order of most conservative to least) from Wisconsin, to Missouri, to ELCA.\n \n One thing that has always been a point of friction between some of my Catholic friends and I is the insistence on a confession to a priest. Why do Catholics do that? As Lutherans, we believe that when Jesus died, and the temple curtain to the most holy of holies was split, we were given a mediator to God so that we do not have to go through other men to relay our prayers to him. While we confess as a group, and through the Lord's Prayer, we see no need for a private confession to a leader of the church. \n \n Also, why do Catholics say the Hail Mary? One thing that both my friends and I agree on is that Catholics do worship Mary (which he feels is a big misconception that many ignorant people believe about Catholics), but why pray to her to relay prayers to Jesus? Also, I have heard that it is a Catholic tradition that Mary stayed a virgin throughout her life. Is that accurate?",

Also, I have heard that it is a Catholic tradition that Mary stayed a virgin throughout her life. Is that accurate?\n\n \n It is a Catholic Tradition that Mary stayed a virgin throughout her life. It is a Christian tradition that has been forgotten by Protestants. Luther and other prominent reformers adhered to the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary.\n \n Consider that Luther honored her and upheld most, if not all, of Catholic Marian doctrine.Yet why do modern day Lutherans not hold to Luther's beliefs on this? \n \n Luther accepted the Perpetual Virginity of Mary:\n \n \"Christ...was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him... \"brothers\" really means \"cousins\" here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers.\" \n \n \"He, Christ, our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.\"\n (Sermons on John, chapters 1-4, 1537-39)\n \n Belief in the Immaculate Conception of Mary although he believed this should not be imposed on all believers:\n \n \"It is a sweet and pious belief that the infusion of Mary's soul was effected without original sin; so that in the very infusion of her soul she was also purified from original sin and adorned with God's gifts, receiving a pure soul infused by God; thus from the first moment she began to live she was free from all sin\" (Sermon: \"On the Day of the Conception of the Mother of God,\" 1527)\n \n \"She is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin-something exceedingly great. For God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. (Personal {\"Little\"} Prayer Book, 1522)\n \n Other quotes showing Luther's veneration of Mary:\n \n \"The veneration of Mary is inscribed in the very depths of the human heart. (Sermon, September 1, 1522)\n \n [She is the] \"highest woman and the noblest gem in Christianity after Christ...She is nobility, wisdom, and holiness personified. We can never honor her enough. Still honor and praise must be given to her in such a way as to injure neither Christ nor the Scriptures.\" (Sermon, Christmas, 1531)\n \n \"No woman is like you. You are more than Eve or Sarah, blessed above all nobility, wisdom, and sanctity.\" (Sermon, Feast of the Visitation, 1537)\n \n \"It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. Mary is his true Mother, Christ is his brother, God is his father. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)\n \n Quotes of Martin Luther were obtained on Dave Armstrong's website at http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ95.htm\n \n \n Catholic Veneration of Mary\n Concerning the veneration of Mary as a path to holiness that you mention...\n \n Catholics do not seek their salvation in Mary but in Christ. Mary is a path that leads to Christ. I propose to you that Catholics honor Mary because SCRIPTURE HONORS MARY. Protestants and others who do not honor Mary do not honor scripture and they in fact ignore scripture. Let me break this down into several points:\n \n 1.We honor and venerate Mary. We do not worship her. She is not on the same level as Christ. Refer to the 4th commandment: Honor your father and your mother. Jesus was without sin as it says in Hebrews. Jesus kept the commandments perfectly. If Jesus kept the commandments then he honored his mother. Can anyone keep the commandments better then Jesus? Then how must he have honored his mother? Do YOU honor YOUR MOTHER MARY? She is YOUR mother. She is the mother of us all-see Revelation 12:17. She is the mother of salvation.\n \n The simplest explanation is this: Mary brings people to Christ. Mary stated, \"My soul magnifies the lord.\" What does a magnifying glass do? It allows you to see something more clearly without changing the object whatsoever. This is what Mary does. As apologist Dwight Longenecker states, \"Devotion to Mary results from Devotion to her Son-and Vice Versa\" \n \n 2. Mary \"is blessed among women.\" Mary states also that \"ALL generations shall call me blessed.\" (Luke 1:48) Does our generation call her blessed? Blessed among women? Yes. Blessed among any human past, present, or future? Yes. Why do I say this? Because Jesus was not created, he was begotten. He was not a human creation. Mary, on the other hand, was a human creation. However, she had a more intimate union with God than any human has experienced and will ever experience. No one has been closer to God than Mary. Consider this quotation, \"I have long recognized the unique vocation of our Lady, called to the highest honor among all created beings. It is a fact of history that, if true honor  is not paid to her as the Mother of God, people put our Lord in her place as the highest of creation  rather than adoring him as God Incarnate.\" Rev. Msgr. Graham Leonard from The Path to Rome  (emphasis mine). \n \n Mary is our model as humans. She shows us how a human can rise to God's standards. She is a perfect example of how we can all become saints if we just say yes to God with the devotion that Mary did.\n \n **3.The Hail Mary prayer  itself is nothing more than a recital of and referral to scripture. \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\" (Luke 1:28) \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.\" (Luke 1:42) \"Holy Mary, Mother of God\" (Luke 1:43) \"Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\" (John 19:26-27)**\n \n 4. Mary is the ark of the New Covenant. Do you know how sacred the Ark of the Covenant was in the Old Testament? If anyone but the high priest touched it or looked on it then they died (1 Samuel 6:19 and 2 Samuel 6:7). The ark contained manna and John 6:31-33  proclaims Jesus as the true manna. It contained the rod of Aaron, the high priest and Hebrews 3:1 states that Jesus is our true high priest. It contains the Ten Commandments but John 1:14  states that Jesus is the Word made flesh. Jesus was the priest and the sacrifice of the New Covenant. Mary was the bearer of this New Covenant.\n \n 5. Mary is not only the mother of God but also the bride of God. It is written in scripture that the Holy Spirit overshadowed her. A Christian mystery but all the more reason to honor her. \n \n 6. Mary was the perfect disciple. She was stronger than Peter who denied Christ 3 times and the other apostles that fled at Christ's crucifixion. Her words show how willingly she followed God, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" (Luke 1:38) Jesus gave her to the \"disciple whom he loved\" at the Cross. Why is he entrusting her to someone else's protection if he took her lightly? Why to the disciple whom he loved? Mary had an intimate relationship with the apostles as seen with her relationship with John and her presence with the apostles praying shortly after the death and appearance of Christ. (Acts 1:12)\n \n 7. More on scripture reverencing Mary: Mary is the Queen of Heaven and the Mother of us all. As stated earlier, she is the mother of salvation. Read Revelation 12.\n \n Think of your feelings toward your mother. The appreciation, the respect, and the love you have for her. Think of the willing sacrifice Mary made. She has experienced the most intimate relationship with God of any human on the planet--past, present, and future. She is your mother in Christ. Please honor her accordingly.",

   "First of all, I misspoke (typed?) when I said that Catholics worship Mary. I meant to say that they do not worship Mary. Sorry for any confusion that caused.\n \n Also, while Luther is the founder of our denomination, he is not the one from whom we take all of our doctrine. We do not believe that Mary stayed a virgin because of these verses:\n \n Matthew 12:47 \"Someone told him 'Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.'\"\n Mark 3:31 \"Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.\"\n Mark 6:3 \"'Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?' And they took offense at him. Jesus said to them, 'Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.'\"\n \n Your proof is only through the writings of Luther and some others, not through the words of the Bible. While Luther believed that she was a virgin, that does not mean that the church still believes it. Churches change with time, though they do not move from the moral foundations on which they were built (at least most churches, I'm not sure about the East Coast Episcopalians).\n \n On confession . . . \n While I am in no way attacking private confession, I am just asking why it is necessary. I heard from a friend (Catholic) that you must attend two or three private confessions in a year to still be considered a practicing Catholic. Why is such an emphasis placed on it? In the Lord's Prayer and in the Confession/Absolution portions of our services, we are granted forgiveness as well as when we take part in Holy Communion.\n \n On the use of Revelation as proof . . .\n I try to shy away from using that book as proof. The problem (situation) with much of it is that it is symbolic or metaphorical (like the number 666 probably stands for any demonic symbol, not 666 specifically). While I recognize your using it, I would try to stay with the Gospels and Letters.\n \n But why is the Hail Mary used in confession? Why do people have to say ten Hail Marys or have to say it so many times during the wake (I'm not sure what the technical term is for it, my uncle who is a priest performed it for my great grandmother's funeral)? If it is just a recital of scripture, why don't people say \"John 3:16\"s or other verses? Why is it the Hail Mary?\n \n Also, thanks to all for keeping it civil.

   "Justification and Sanctification: What is the Difference?\n \n Understanding the difference between justification and sanctification can be as important as understanding the difference between salvation and damnation. Rightly dividing between the two is of crucial importance. When you understand the what they are, you can then draw a line in the sand and say, \"This is what saves. This is not what saves.\" \n Justification is the work of God where the righteousness of Jesus is reckoned to the sinner so the sinner is declared by God as being righteous under the Law (Rom. 4:3; 5:1,9; Gal. 2:16; 3:11). This righteousness is not earned or retained by any effort of the saved. Justification is an instantaneous occurrence with the result being eternal life. It is based completely and solely upon Jesus' sacrifice on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24) and is received by faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9). No works are necessary whatsoever to obtain justification. Otherwise, it is not a gift (Rom. 6:23). Therefore, we are justified by faith (Romans 5:1). \n Sanctification, on the other hand, involves the work of the person. But it is still God working in the believer to produce more of a godly character and life in the person who has already been justified (Phil. 2:13). Sanctification is not instantaneous because it is not the work of God alone. The justified person is actively involved in submitting to God's will, resisting sin, seeking holiness, and working to be more godly (Gal. 5:22-23). Significantly, sanctification has no bearing on justification. That is, even if we don't live a perfect life, we are still justified.\n Where justification is a legal declaration that is instantaneous, sanctification is a process. Where justification comes from outside of us, from God, sanctification comes from God within us by the work of the Holy Spirit in accordance with the Bible. In other words, we contribute to sanctification through our efforts. In contrast, we do not contribute to our justification through our efforts. \n \n Does this mean that those justified by grace can sin as much as they want? \n \n Romans 6:1-2 says, \"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?\" \n 1 Thess. 4:7 says, \"God has called us not for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.\" \n The Scriptures teach us that we are to live holy lives and avoid sin (Col. 1:5-11). Just because we are saved and eternally justified before God (John 10:28), that is no excuse to continue in the sin from which we were saved. Of course, we all sin (1 John 1:8). But the war between the saved and his sin is continuous (Rom. 7:14-20) and it won't be until the return of Jesus that we will be delivered from this body of death (Rom. 7:24). To continually seek sin and use God's grace to excuse it later is to trample the blood of Christ underfoot (Heb. 10:29) and to reveal the person's true sinful, unsaved nature (1 John 2:4; 2:19). (Other verses worth checking out are: Heb. 12:14; 1 Pet. 1:14-16; and 1 Pet. 2:21-22.) \n \n What the cults do with justification and sanctification \n \n The cults consistently blur the meanings of the two terms and misapply the truths taught in God's word. The result is a theology of works righteousness, of earning their salvation which only leads to damnation. This is because by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified (Gal. 2:16). Man cannot contribute to his salvation (Gal. 5:1-8). Because man is sinful even his best deeds are stained and filthy before God (Isaiah 64:6). Therefore, making a person right before God can only be God's work (Gal. 2:20). \n Typically, in cult theologies, a person is not justified (declared righteous in God's eyes) until the final day of judgment when his works are weighed and a reward is given or he is found worthy of his place with God. Thus, a person with this errant theology can not claim 1 John 5:13 as their own which says, \"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.\" \n Contextually, \"These things\" refers to loving God, being obedient to Him, belief in Christ, and eternal life in Jesus. Therefore, 1 John 5:13 can be considered a test. If you are believing and doing the right things, then you will know if you have eternal life. Can a cultist know he has eternal life? No. He cannot. But a Christian can. \n People in cults don't understand the difference between justification and sanctification. Therefore, they must depend upon a cooperative effort with God to have their sins forgiven which is, essentially, combining the filthy works of man (Isaiah 64:6) with the holy work of God. They don't mix. They can't. Hence, salvation is by grace through faith, alone. To believe anything else is to miss salvation. \n _________________________________\n \n The Doctrine of Justification...The sinner is saved by God's grace alone, through faith alone, because of Christ alone.",

Because sin and lack of repentance can kill your soul (1 John 5:16-17). \n \n Your friend's information is not fully accurate. It is required that one go to confession once a year if he has serious sin to confess (see the Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 1457). But three times would be even better.\n \n As long as I can sit back at home or in church and confess my sins in my mind then I am very comfortable. I can justify this or that and say that this is not really a sin due to circumstance, or I was having a bad day, or he made me do it, or this sin is not really that bad, etc., etc. But do you realize how much differently you view an event than the other person sitting next to you? When I have to come before the priest and tell my sins openly to God through another person then I have to be much more honest. This is much different than confessing my sins through the person of myself. I have to realize that the stories I have told myself to justify my actions may be less believable to the priest (and God). Do you realize how much a person must humble himself to confess his sins to God through another person--a real, live person right in front of you? It is so much more humbling and enlightening than confessing to God in one's mind. This is the Christian humility that is needed to live a practical Christian life. We must humble ourselves in this way before others every day. This is true Christianity. This is the way Jesus humbled himself, submitting to God before others in the face of ridicule and persecution. This prepares us for the last day when we must go in front of Christ and God the Father and confess our sins. We will be right there before them and we will have no choice but to be honest and we will see very clearly our sins as we have not seen them before. \n \n \nBut why is the Hail Mary used in confession? Why do people have to say ten Hail Marys or have to say it so many times during the wake (I'm not sure what the technical term is for it, my uncle who is a priest performed it for my great grandmother's funeral)? If it is just a recital of scripture, why don't people say \"John 3:16\"s or other verses? Why is it the Hail Mary?\n\n The Hail Mary is often times used as penance after confession.\n \n At a wake a rosary is said. It is not a requirement. The rosary is an old form of meditative prayer in which the Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory Be are recited. Each \"decade\" of ten Hail Marys are prefaced by a scriptural event of Jesus' life called a mystery on which to meditate when praying. So, even the rosary as a grouping of Hail Marys is focused on scripture and Jesus. It is a devotion that honors Mary and asks for her intercession (that she pray for us) and a devotion that honors Jesus.",

   "What the cults do with justification and sanctification \n \n The cults consistently blur the meanings of the two terms and misapply the truths taught in God's word. The result is a theology of works righteousness, of earning their salvation which only leads to damnation. This is because by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified (Gal. 2:16). Man cannot contribute to his salvation (Gal. 5:1-8). Because man is sinful even his best deeds are stained and filthy before God (Isaiah 64:6). Therefore, making a person right before God can only be God's work (Gal. 2:20). \n Typically, in cult theologies, a person is not justified (declared righteous in God's eyes) until the final day of judgment when his works are weighed and a reward is given or he is found worthy of his place with God. Thus, a person with this errant theology can not claim 1 John 5:13 as their own which says, \"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.\" \n Contextually, \"These things\" refers to loving God, being obedient to Him, belief in Christ, and eternal life in Jesus. Therefore, 1 John 5:13 can be considered a test. If you are believing and doing the right things, then you will know if you have eternal life. Can a cultist know he has eternal life? No. He cannot. But a Christian can. \n People in cults don't understand the difference between justification and sanctification. Therefore, they must depend upon a cooperative effort with God to have their sins forgiven which is, essentially, combining the filthy works of man (Isaiah 64:6) with the holy work of God. They don't mix. They can't. Hence, salvation is by grace through faith, alone. To believe anything else is to miss salvation. \n\n Are you saying Saint James was a cultist? \n \n A more complete response will follow as time permits.\n \n Peace.",

   "Are Roman Catholics Christians? They are if they have trusted in Jesus alone for the forgiveness of their sins. However, if they believe that the are saved by God's grace and their works, then they are not saved -- even if they believe their works are done by God's grace -- since they then deny the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice.\n Being a Christian does not mean being a member of the Roman Catholic Church. It means being a member of the body of Christ which is accomplished by faith and trust in Jesus alone for the forgiveness of your sins. It means that you do not add your works to His work. Sincerity doesn't forgive sins. Membership in a church doesn't forgive sins. Doing works of penance doesn't forgive sins. Praying to Mary doesn't forgive sins. Forgiveness is received in the faithful trust and acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. You must trust Jesus, God in flesh, for the forgiveness of sins, not a man made ritual and certainly not the catholic saints. Even though Roman Catholic Church affirms the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and His physical resurrection, it greatly errs in its doctrine of salvation by adding works to salvation.\n The official Roman Catholic doctrine of salvation is that the grace of God is infused into a baby at baptism -- making him/her justified before God.1 This justification can be lost through sin and must be regained by repeated participation in the many sacraments found in the Roman Catholic Church. These sacraments increase the measure of grace in the person by which he or she is enabled to do good works which are in turn rewarded with the joy of heaven:\n \n \"We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to those who love him and do his will. In every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere 'to the end' and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God's eternal reward for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ,\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, par. 1821).\n \n No one can say whether a Roman Catholic is truly a Christian or not since we cannot know people's hearts. But, if anyone, Catholic included, openly denies essential doctrines2 then he is not saved, and this is the problem. It appears that the Roman Catholic church is denying the essential doctrine of justification by faith. It says...\n \n \"If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema.\" (Canon 9, Council of Trent). \n \"If any one saith, that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified, because he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified; or, that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified; and that, by this faith alone, absolution and justification are effected; let him be anathema.\" (Canon 14, Council of Trent). \n \n Notice that justification by faith alone is denied and heaven is the reward for doing good works. This is the problem. The RCC does not teach the biblical doctrine of justification by faith. It teaches justification by faith and works.",

   "ARchimedes,\n \nHowever, if they believe that the are saved by God's grace and their works, then they are not saved -- even if they believe their works are done by God's grace -- since they then deny the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice.\n \n Are all men  saved? Or simply Christians? If Christ's work is sufficient then it should be sufficient for all of God's creation--all men on earth, correct? But I would guess that you would say that only Christians are saved. If so, then how does one become a Christian? I would guess that you would say by making a profession of faith. But isn't a profession of faith an action (a work) on your part to cooperate with God? If so then aren't you taking part in some way in your own salvation? If no action is needed then all men are saved, not simply Christians. What is your thinking on this? Must you take action and cooperate with God or not? If not then are all men automatically saved? \n \n God calls men to him by grace as a free gift. We are saved by grace alone. But then men must decide to cooperate with God or to reject him--not by faith alone but by faith and works.\n \n \nIt means that you do not add your works to His work.\n \n Colossians 1:24  \"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church of which I became a minister according to the divine office which was given to me for you...\"\n \n 2 Corinthians 1:5 \"For as WE SHARE ABUNDANTLY in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.\"\n \n Phillipians 1:29, \"For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should no only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, engaged in the same conflict which you saw and now hear to be mine.\"\n \n Philippians 2:17, \"Even if I am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.\"\n \n \nDoing works of penance doesn't forgive sins.\n \n Matthew 3:7-9 \"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit  that befits repentance...every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n \n Mark 1:15  \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.\"\n \n Luke 13:2-3 \"I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.\" \n \n Acts 26:19-21: ...first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles also, that they should repent  and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance. \n \n \nYou must trust Jesus, God in flesh, for the forgiveness of sins, not a man made ritual and certainly not the catholic saints. \n \n Are you speaking of confession when you say a \"man made ritual?\" If you are then you are wrong. Confession was instituted by Christ: John 20:23.\n \n \nEven though Roman Catholic Church affirms the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and His physical resurrection, it greatly errs in its doctrine of salvation by adding works to salvation.\n\n We have not added anything that is inconsistent with the Revelation of God given us by Jesus.\n \n Is Saint James a cultist? Did he add works to salvation?\n \n James 2:14-24: \"What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?...So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead...You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone...\"\n \n \nThe official Roman Catholic doctrine of salvation is that the grace of God is infused into a baby at baptism -- making him/her justified before God.\n\n 1 Peter 3:21 \"Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you.\"\n \n \n1 This justification can be lost through sin and must be regained by repeated participation in the many sacraments found in the Roman Catholic Church. \n \n Romans 11:22  \"remain in his kindness or you will be cut off\"\n \n Hebrews 10:26-27  \"For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.\"\n \n \nNotice that justification by faith alone is denied and heaven is the reward for doing good works. This is the problem. The RCC does not teach the biblical doctrine of justification by faith. It teaches justification by faith and works.\n\n Justification by faith alone is denied by the Church because it wasn't a part of Christian teaching for 1500 years until the Reformation. Justification by faith alone is denied because scripture denies it. Can you tell me where in the Bible it is stated that justification is by faith alone? There is only one place in the bible where the words \"faith alone\" appear. It is in James when he says that man is not justified by \"faith alone.\"\n \n On justification by faith and works:\n Romans 2:2-8 \"We know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do such things. Do you suppose, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works...\"\n \n 2 Corinthians 5:10  \"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body.\"\n \n 1 Peter 1:17  \"And if you invoke as Father him who judges each one impartially according to his deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile.\"\n \n Revelation 20:12-13  \"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done.\"",

So that is not a question. So, no, not all denominational pastors teach the truth and they are not infallible. There are many interpretations of the Bible which are incorrect. There are many denominations which have false, invented doctrine based on the traditions of men. There are over 33,000 Christian denominations and the truth can't be splintered that way. There is one truth and one true Church. (This is not to say that some of these Christians are not striving to find the truth and are not good, God-loving Christians. There are elements of truth in Protestant denominations. But the fullness of truth of the Revelation of God can only be found in one place, the place ordained by God, the Catholic Church).\n \n Why is the Catholic Church infallible when the others are not? Because of what I said above. There is one Church that was started by Christ, one Church that maintains all of Christ's teaching if you look back through history for ~2000 years.
