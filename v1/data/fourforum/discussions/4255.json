It's been happening. The sky is not falling,\" said Bay State pollster Russell K. Mayer, the director of the Center for Public Opinion Research at Merrimack College.\n \n The poll found 52 percent of respondents do not want to see the amendment on the ballot. \n",

If we assume the lowest number of people (48%) don't want to see it on the ballot, and if we assume the highest number of people (52%) actually do want to see it on the ballot, then it would be possible that the majority of people wants to see it on the ballot.\n \n Though since the poll does not suggest that there is not any number of undecided opinions on this question, it seems likely that more people do not want to see it on the ballot than do.\n \n But whether most people want to see it on the ballot or not, the majority cannot be trusted to make decisions which preserve the freedom, equality, and happiness of others.",
