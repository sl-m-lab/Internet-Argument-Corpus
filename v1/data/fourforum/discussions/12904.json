   "Fundamentally, Intelligent Design is nothing more than Animism. What is too complex to understand or explain now is credited to a higher being. That is absolutely no different from crediting lightning to Zeus, the rain to the Tlaloc, volcanic activity to Pele, so on and so forth. The reason those beliefs have died out is because people actually know what causes volcanic activity, lightning and the rainy seasons. All ID does is replace lightning with current modern day subjects. There is no principle difference. \n \n If intelligent design was taught in schools in an honest fashion, it would be painfully clear that it is nothing more than Animism. With a complete lack of acceptance and hard rejection from the youth, ID would die a slow painful death as its believers would have no one to replace them. \n \n So, I argue that among the educated IDers (who are using this for political gain) that they do not want ID taught in schools as it would destroy the movement. Instead, they want to use it as a cudgel against modern science for their own gain. Persecution complex if you will.",

   "Fundamentally, Intelligent Design is nothing more than Animism. What is too complex to understand or explain now is credited to a higher being. \n\n \n Oh no, it's not too complex for us to understand. So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism. But first, here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting.\n \n \nJust because we dismiss it does not mean we have not explored it. ID is a failure because it is Animism at its core logic. \n Good luck proving that my depiction of ID isn't what ID is. \n\n \n Your error in stating that Intelligent Design equals animism is the epitome of ignorance as you once again reveal how little you understand about that which you speak. Now I realize that you will take this evidence and squirm in 3 different directions as you insist you are right. But that wont change the fact that you are as wrong as only you are capable of being. \n Animism:Greeks, Romans, Santeria, Voodoo, American Indians, Mayas, Witches, Ancestors, Hindus...\n \n The \"Primitive Religions\" were born in the five Continents, more than 3,000 years ago, mostly in the form of \"Animism\", because they believed that everything has a \"soul\", an \"anima\" in Latin, a \"spirit\"... including animals, plants, rocks, mountains, rivers, stars... each \"anima\" is powerful, spiritual, that can help or hurt them, including the souls of the dead, the \"ancestors\".\n \n For thousands of years they deified animals, stars, idols of any kind... and practiced Spiritism, witchcraft, divination, astrology... and they used magic, spells, enchantments, superstitions, prayers, amulets, talismans, charms... often with the worship of an Absolute, or the Great One...\n \n Today Animism is represented, among others, by the Mormons, Hinduism and the New Age. They proclaim that every human is God, and their practices will help each one to realize it.\n \n The Bible destroys this way of thinking in the first verse of he Bible:\n 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen.1:1). There is only one God, everything else in the heavens or earth are \"creatures of God\". The sun and the moon are \"creatures of God\", and the rocks and animals and oceans, and all the mountains and stars, and each man and woman is also a \"creature of God\", is not God.\n \n But they usually did not care much about a Creator God, only about the \"spirits\" that can help or hurt them... and what they sometimes called \"gods\", are \"demons\"... or simply a \"lie\"... and this is why the Bible condemns them with very strong words: abominations to God, stone them to death, the fire shall burn them (Deut.18, Lev.20, Isa.47).\n - 10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 11Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deut.18:10-12)\n - 27 \" 'A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.' \" (Lev. 20:7).\n - 12Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 13Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 14Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. (Is.47:12-13)\n \n God, for the Animist, is not a person... as for the Hindu, god is the Energy, the Force, the Power, the Universal Mind, the Absolute, the Unknown, the Divine Being... is not a \"he\" but an \"it\"... it is not somebody but something... but something powerful able to get wonderful things for you using Magic... and worshiping it!... yes, worshiping the Force or the Energy...\n \n Since god is not a person, there are no revelations from a non-person... you never find in Animism or Wicca or Hinduism, God said... Yahweh calls...\n \n The gods never existed, they are the product of novels or the imagination... they are myths, legends... but they never existed and they do not exist today.\n \n The big problem is that \"Today\" an estimated 40% of the world's population is animistic (Van Rheenen), including all kinds of occultism, often in syncretism with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism...\n \n The Animism is attractive because infuses the sacred into the real life, and mainly, because offers people a way to cope with one's everyday needs and problems: Healing of an illness, to be successful in a business, or in love, or to find a job, or to restore a soured relationship, to find a mate, to gain guidance for the future...\n \n The animist views the \"formal religions\" as being relevant with respect to \"ultimate\" issues, but irrelevant when it comes to addressing the \"immediate\" issues of everyday life... which is totally wrong!, because Christianity, Islam, and all \"formal religions\" deal with issues of every day's life... but this is the reason why a Christian or a Jew go to the witch or consult the Zodiac... They go to church on Saturday or Sunday to take care of their soul, and they go to the witch or astrologer on Monday to take care of their business or illness... absolutely wrong!...\n \n Come to Jesus... Believe in him!... is the solution of all the problems in this life, and on top of the glorious life on earth, he offers you eternal life of joy in Heaven.\n \n \n The World View of Animism: \n \n Pantheism is the first logical consequence of Animism: All the world is divine: A mountain is god, a rock, an animal... you are god!... though you can't make stars not even atoms, but you are god!... a planet, and even a cockroach is god!... they are the \"idols\" often mentioned in the Bible.\n \n Polytheism is the next obvious consequence: There are thousands of gods... the concept of 333 million deities is believed to emphasize the fundamental doctrine of Animism, Hinduism, Wicca... \n \n The first verse of the Bible contradicts these views: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... so, in the Bible, there is one God, a person, and everything else in the world are creatures of God... God created and is the soul and life and is inside everything, but everything is not God... there is only one God, Creator.\n \n Of course, for Animists or Hindus, the aim of this life is to stop the relentless and frightful reincarnation, and become nothingness, not-a-person, but the drop of water in the ocean of the Absolute... for a Christian, an eternal life of joy is waiting, and not like a drop of water, but as a person, recognizable by God and by every neighbor... a person!, an individual!, eternally!, as God is an eternal Person!... eternally in Hell or in Heaven!...Religion and Cults - Animism\n \n So you see, those who worship idols and such are the practitioners of animism. Judaism and evangelical christianity condemn such practices as abominations before God. And that is because the God of the Old and New Testament also condemns such practices throughout His word. So you have once again blatantly and ignorantly misrepresented what the bible and God Himself stands for and represents to us as His Truths. So in short order I have easily proven that according to what animism is, it plays no actual part in the scriptural perspective of how, why and who Man is according to our relationship with the living God.",

Not in the same way that Archie seems to require, but that's not their problem.

The 'essence of gravity' isn't 'no God is involved', nor is the 'essence of thermodynamics', the 'essence of quantum mechanics' or the 'essence of Newtonian mechanics'. Why should evolution be any different?\n \n On a second note, ID != Creationism, as I'm sure Jakers would agree. ID referrs to a non-specific 'intelligent designer' - personal or impersonal, omnipotent or simply very smart, internal (see: Jakers) or external. Creationism, however, names that designer as the God of the Bible.\n \n The argument of the premise here, then, is that the reasoning behind ID is 'we don't know how it was done, so it must have been an intelligent agent who has knowledge we do not'.

Without theistic evolutionists, court decisions like the Dover case would be looked at in a completely different light. Theistic evolutionists seem to never debate the authors of the above books. Theistic evolutionists seem to know or care little about Christianity. With the tremendous difference theistic evolutionists make in this political divide, it only makes sense to question their honesty - to ask them to separate themselves from atheist who pose as theistic evolutionist, and common sense tells us they exist. They don't seem concerned about it. \n \n \nThe presence (or absence) of a deity is irrelevant to a scientific process. The 'essence of gravity' isn't 'no God is involved', nor is the 'essence of thermodynamics', the 'essence of quantum mechanics' or the 'essence of Newtonian mechanics'. Why should evolution be any different?\n\n \n Because it's used as a weapon against religion, unlike other secular subjects. But we've been through all this before. The problem in this thread is, when obvious child compares animism with ID, it seems that atheists spring to his defence, not noticing the double standard they apply. \n \n \nOn a second note, ID != Creationism, as I'm sure Jakers would agree. ID referrs to a non-specific 'intelligent designer' - personal or impersonal, omnipotent or simply very smart, internal (see: Jakers) or external. Creationism, however, names that designer as the God of the Bible. \n\n \n It doesn't matter who the designer is, anymore than it matters to evolution where the beginning of life came from. \n \n \nThe argument of the premise here, then, is that the reasoning behind ID is 'we don't know how it was done, so it must have been an intelligent agent who has knowledge we do not'. The reasoning behind the origins of 'animism' (as a general term) was 'we don't understand how it works, so it must be an intelligent agent with knowledge we don't have'. See the similarity? I didn't even have to use big red font. \n\n \n The argument of the premise here, then, is that the reasoning behind evolution is \"we don't know how life originated\", but it could have been by godless processes. The reasoning behind the origins of atheism was \"we're uneducated (this is the 1700's - we can't even read or write) but we don't see a god and don't believe in one\". See the similarity? \n \n \nThe agent of ID then becomes God via Christianity and the Bible and the agent of Animism becomes Thor, Odin, Zeus etc via the myths of a variety of cultures. From there, we descend into the mire of 'my scripture beats all the others'. \n\n \n The agent of evolution them becomes God is not necessary / God does not exist. From there, we decend into the mire of 'scientists are the smartest people in existance. \n \n \n \nWith regards to the OP - I would say that 'they' do want ID taught in schools - but taught in 'their' way, to 'their' standards. That is; a highly biased one where you discuss all the strengths and none of the weaknesses. Were ID to be treated with the same critical zeal that IDers treat evolution, it wouldn't last five minutes in a (science) classroom.\n\n \n And 'those who wrote the above books' want evolution taught in schools, but taught in 'their' way, to 'their' standards. That is, a highly biased one where you discuss all the strengths of naturalism, and none of the problems involved with origins of life. Were evolution to be treated with the same critical zeal that the authors treat God, you just might have an ACLU that doesn't notice, a news media that doesn't notice, and a country with statistics showing increasing numbers of young adults being atheists.",

Furthermore, I'm fairly sure Archie has been going around saying that it's entirely possible to be a Christian evolutionist (as it isn't a salvation issue, apparently) - it's simply that God hasn't 'made clear the truth of Creation' to them.\n \n \nBecause it's used as a weapon against religion, unlike other secular subjects. But we've been through all this before. The problem in this thread is, when obvious child compares animism with ID, it seems that atheists spring to his defence, not noticing the double standard they apply.\n\n You mean \"it's currently being used as a 'weapon' against certain interpretations of the Bible\". 'Religion' as a whole is not being targeted; well, it probably is by some, but 'evolution' is by far the smallest of the concepts they use in their arguments.\n \n Evolution cannot disprove 'religion' as a concept.\n \n Furthermore, a several hundred years ago certain members of the Church would be using more or less an identical copy of your argument about Galileo's use of a concept such as heliocentrism. Is 'the essence of heliocentrism' that 'there is no God'?\n \n \nIt doesn't matter who the designer is, anymore than it matters to evolution where the beginning of life came from. \nFor ID? Indeed. But for YEC? That 'designer' is God. YEC != (is not equal to) YEC.\n I don't think we particularly disagree here, unless I'm misreading. Moving on...\n \n \nThe argument of the premise here, then, is that the reasoning behind evolution is \"we don't know how life originated\", but it could have been by godless processes. The reasoning behind the origins of atheism was \"we're uneducated (this is the 1700's - we can't even read or write) but we don't see a god and don't believe in one\". See the similarity?\n\n Atheism was around a loooooooong time before Christianity. The base state of humanity is not Christianity - it's atheism. Did you believe in God before you were told about Him? Nor is atheism 'targeted' specifically at Christianity. Furthermore, you don't need to mention God in describing the origins of evolution.\n \n I guess what you're trying to say with all of this is that '[the vast majority of] science is atheistic in nature, because all science ignores the presence of God, regardless of the personal faith of the scientist'. While the argument is pretty much true, your conclusions are not; it doesn't mean that the 'fundamental essence of science' is that 'God doesn't exist'. If you really want to find a 'fundamental essence of science' with regards to God, it would be 'God may or may not exist - but I don't particularly care right now, I'm running an experiment'. Science is apathetic/agnostic with regards to God - the only theistic assumption that scientists make is that God isn't mysteriously changing their results, which we all do every day when we go to sleep fully expecting to wake up (more or less) the same shape.\n \n \nThe agent of evolution them becomes God is not necessary / God does not exist. From there, we decend into the mire of 'scientists are the smartest people in existance.\n\n No, that's the argument of atheists, not the argument of scientists. Often, those people are the same - but just because many scientists are atheists doesn't mean you can equate science with atheism, because that simply isn't the case.\n \n As to the 'mire' line, I'm going to ignore it, as an ad hom/attempt to parody my post.\n \n \nAnd 'those who wrote the above books' want evolution taught in schools, but taught in 'their' way, to 'their' standards. That is, a highly biased one where you discuss all the strengths of naturalism, and none of the problems involved with origins of life. Were evolution to be treated with the same critical zeal that the authors treat God, you just might have an ACLU that doesn't notice, a news media that doesn't notice, and a country with statistics showing increasing numbers of young adults being atheists.\nI could re-re-write the above quote with 'heliocentrism' instead of 'evolution/ID' just to make my point, but I can't be bothered. I'll just finish with this: the difference is that the overwhelming mass of evidence supports evolution and there is minimal/no evidence supporting ID. You've contested this, but you've been trying to prove that point on this forum for almost five years now, and have yet to do so.",

It is obvious that you are too thick or stubborn to accept that opinion. So here are all of my responses for the objected observers to see how consistently you have twisted reality by claiming that ID has any foundation in animism at all. IF ID taught that stones and trees had souls you would be onto something, but you must pervert what ID represents in order to attach it to animism. And every post I have written has stayed on topic in pointing that out to you. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nOh no, it's not too complex for us to understand. So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism. But first, here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting.\n \n \n \n Your error in stating that Intelligent Design equals animism is the epitome of ignorance as you once again reveal how little you understand about that which you speak. Now I realize that you will take this evidence and squirm in 3 different directions as you insist you are right. But that wont change the fact that you are as wrong as only you are capable of being. \n Animism:Greeks, Romans, Santeria, Voodoo, American Indians, Mayas, Witches, Ancestors, Hindus...\n \n The \"Primitive Religions\" were born in the five Continents, more than 3,000 years ago, mostly in the form of \"Animism\", because they believed that everything has a \"soul\", an \"anima\" in Latin, a \"spirit\"... including animals, plants, rocks, mountains, rivers, stars... each \"anima\" is powerful, spiritual, that can help or hurt them, including the souls of the dead, the \"ancestors\".\n \n For thousands of years they deified animals, stars, idols of any kind... and practiced Spiritism, witchcraft, divination, astrology... and they used magic, spells, enchantments, superstitions, prayers, amulets, talismans, charms... often with the worship of an Absolute, or the Great One...\n \n Today Animism is represented, among others, by the Mormons, Hinduism and the New Age. They proclaim that every human is God, and their practices will help each one to realize it.\n \n The Bible destroys this way of thinking in the first verse of he Bible:\n 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen.1:1). There is only one God, everything else in the heavens or earth are \"creatures of God\". The sun and the moon are \"creatures of God\", and the rocks and animals and oceans, and all the mountains and stars, and each man and woman is also a \"creature of God\", is not God.\n \n But they usually did not care much about a Creator God, only about the \"spirits\" that can help or hurt them... and what they sometimes called \"gods\", are \"demons\"... or simply a \"lie\"... and this is why the Bible condemns them with very strong words: abominations to God, stone them to death, the fire shall burn them (Deut.18, Lev.20, Isa.47).\n - 10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 11Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deut.18:10-12)\n - 27 \" 'A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.' \" (Lev. 20:7).\n - 12Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 13Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 14Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. (Is.47:12-13)\n \n God, for the Animist, is not a person... as for the Hindu, god is the Energy, the Force, the Power, the Universal Mind, the Absolute, the Unknown, the Divine Being... is not a \"he\" but an \"it\"... it is not somebody but something... but something powerful able to get wonderful things for you using Magic... and worshiping it!... yes, worshiping the Force or the Energy...\n \n Since god is not a person, there are no revelations from a non-person... you never find in Animism or Wicca or Hinduism, God said... Yahweh calls...\n \n The gods never existed, they are the product of novels or the imagination... they are myths, legends... but they never existed and they do not exist today.\n \n The big problem is that \"Today\" an estimated 40% of the world's population is animistic (Van Rheenen), including all kinds of occultism, often in syncretism with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism...\n \n The Animism is attractive because infuses the sacred into the real life, and mainly, because offers people a way to cope with one's everyday needs and problems: Healing of an illness, to be successful in a business, or in love, or to find a job, or to restore a soured relationship, to find a mate, to gain guidance for the future...\n \n The animist views the \"formal religions\" as being relevant with respect to \"ultimate\" issues, but irrelevant when it comes to addressing the \"immediate\" issues of everyday life... which is totally wrong!, because Christianity, Islam, and all \"formal religions\" deal with issues of every day's life... but this is the reason why a Christian or a Jew go to the witch or consult the Zodiac... They go to church on Saturday or Sunday to take care of their soul, and they go to the witch or astrologer on Monday to take care of their business or illness... absolutely wrong!...\n \n Come to Jesus... Believe in him!... is the solution of all the problems in this life, and on top of the glorious life on earth, he offers you eternal life of joy in Heaven.\n \n \n The World View of Animism: \n \n Pantheism is the first logical consequence of Animism: All the world is divine: A mountain is god, a rock, an animal... you are god!... though you can't make stars not even atoms, but you are god!... a planet, and even a cockroach is god!... they are the \"idols\" often mentioned in the Bible.\n \n Polytheism is the next obvious consequence: There are thousands of gods... the concept of 333 million deities is believed to emphasize the fundamental doctrine of Animism, Hinduism, Wicca... \n \n The first verse of the Bible contradicts these views: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... so, in the Bible, there is one God, a person, and everything else in the world are creatures of God... God created and is the soul and life and is inside everything, but everything is not God... there is only one God, Creator.\n \n Of course, for Animists or Hindus, the aim of this life is to stop the relentless and frightful reincarnation, and become nothingness, not-a-person, but the drop of water in the ocean of the Absolute... for a Christian, an eternal life of joy is waiting, and not like a drop of water, but as a person, recognizable by God and by every neighbor... a person!, an individual!, eternally!, as God is an eternal Person!... eternally in Hell or in Heaven!...Religion and Cults - Animism\n \n So you see, those who worship idols and such are the practitioners of animism. Judaism and evangelical christianity condemn such practices as abominations before God. And that is because the God of the Old and New Testament also condemns such practices throughout His word. So you have once again blatantly and ignorantly misrepresented what the bible and God Himself stands for and represents to us as His Truths. So in short order I have easily proven that according to what animism is, it plays no actual part in the scriptural perspective of how, why and who Man is according to our relationship with the living God.\n\n \n \nOh, I see now, you must pervert and completely redefine what animism is in order to apply it to your corruption of what christianity is according to the bible. I have accurately defined what animism is above in comparison to the Old and New Testament which it has nothing in common with. But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.\n \n BTW, your explanation above which I have posted in its entirety is nothing more than self indulgent gibberish. Religion and Cults - Animism\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/358204-post2.html\n\n \n \nIs more dishonesty and distorting of reality all we can expect from you? Isn't Intelligent Design defined universally as the biblical account for how life came to be? So by you are saying that, and I quote you: Fundamentally, Intelligent Design is nothing more than Animism. You are directly stating that the biblical creation account is representative of the pagan belief of animism. This is a complete distortion of what ID represents which is based on the creation account as outlined in Genesis. GET IT? You are dead wrong in every conceivable way, but being the liar you are you will refuse to just admit you are completely redefining what animism is in order to assert it has anything in common with ID. Here, read what animism is again. It has no bearing at all with what ID proposes. Religion and Cults - Animism\n\n \n \nIf you can show that Intelligent Design attributes a soul to plants, rocks, trees and all types of inanimate objects, and natural phenomena in causing the creation of the world and everything in it, then I will agree with you because that is what animism asserts. But you can't do that because it is a patently ridiculous proposition. Intelligent Design proposes that God, an all powerful intelligent being created all that is, not that everything created by the intelligent designer has a soul which animism clearly proposes. You must corrupt what ID is in order to equate it to animism. No matter how you slice it ID does NOT propose that everything in creation has a soul so even discussing animism with ID is to corrupt what ID is and represents from the outset.\n\n \n \nan\u00b7i\u00b7mism (n-mzm)\n n.\n 1. The belief in the existence of individual spirits that inhabit natural objects and phenomena.\n 2. The belief in the existence of spiritual beings that are separable or separate from bodies.\n 3. The hypothesis holding that an immaterial force animates the universe.\n \n ^ This is animism above ^. Show where ID asserts any of these beliefs at all or stop lying about any practical similarities between animism and Intelligent Design.\n\n \n \nLike I said...\n an\u00b7i\u00b7mism (n-mzm)\n n.\n 1.

Show where ID asserts any of these beliefs at all or stop lying about any practical similarities between animism and Intelligent Design.\n \n Your core logic is as bogus as your irrational and illogical reasoning which is corrupting what Intelligent Design represents.

You declare us wrong on the basis that Animism is a belief in Anima and Souls. Nowhere did you even attempt to discuss the why. \n \n I knew you were ignorant, but I didn't think you were so ignorant as to fail to know the differences between \"why\" and \"what.\" \n \n \nIF ID taught that stones and trees had souls you would be onto something\n\n \n Again, failure to understand the difference between what and why. \n \n \nbut you must pervert what ID represents in order to attach it to animism. And every post I have written has stayed on topic in pointing that out to you. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Only you think that.",

   "It has been a long while since I posted here (though I have occasionally stopped by to see what's going on). But I can't let this one go unanswered.\n \n \nTheistic evolutionists seem to never debate the authors of the above books.\n\n \n Consider books like Ken Miller's Finding Darwin's God or Francis Collins The Language of God, for example. In each of those books, you can certainly find criticism of different varieties of creationism and intelligent design, of course -- and you can just as certainly find criticism of atheism.\n \n That's just two who sprang readily to mind. There are others (e.g. Francisco Ayala now springing to mind). You can state that theistic evolutionists don't address themselves to atheism if you like, but that statement is simply false.\n \n \nTheistic evolutionists seem to know or care little about Christianity.\n\n \n Come on. Ayala is a biologist who used to be a priest, and I daresay he knows a little about Christianity. As do Miller and Collins, which -- although they lack formal training -- clearly comes through in their own writings.\n \n For that matter, there are theologians among theistic evolutionists, too. John Haught is perhaps the best-known example.\n \n That covers what they know. Maybe if you'd read their books, you'd find out how much they care about Christianity, too.\n \n \nWith the tremendous difference theistic evolutionists make in this political divide, it only makes sense to question their honesty...\n\n \n I'll do you the favor of not questioning your honesty. I will ask, however: How many theistic evolutionists have you ever read?\n \n \n...to ask them to separate themselves from atheist who pose as theistic evolutionist, and common sense tells us they exist.\n\n \n What more can they do than they've already done?\n \n They can profess belief in God and Christ. They can attend worship regularly and celebrate the holidays. They can behave in accordance with Christian moral ideals and encourage others to do the same. They can pray in private and even criticize what they consider atheistic abuses of science in public.\n \n But apparently none of this matters, since they believe in evolution.\n \n You are running a very serious risk of poisoning the well here. If you won't even do theistic evolutionists the courtesy of presuming that their words and actions express what they really believe, how can anything they say or do ever convince you of the sincerity of their beliefs?\n \n \nThey don't seem concerned about it.\n\n \n I won't presume to speak for other theistic evolutionists. After all, you can read their books if you choose, whereupon you can read for yourself what their concerns are.\n \n But I will say that I am far more concerned with (so-called) Biblical \"literalism\" than with atheists. In my experience, it's frequently the literalistic view of the Bible thatmakes atheism so attractive to so many in the first place.\n \n Personally, I have no axes to grind with atheism in terms of metaphysics. Or in terms of morality, for that matter: Many of the atheist philosophers whom I have had the good fortune to know have given vastly more thought to ethics, in theory and in practice, than have most Christians. I do have problems when any atheist invokes evolution (or any other portion of science) as a refutation of theism. But the fact is, most atheists -- whether scientists, philosophers, or otherwise -- don't do that.\n \n I pick and choose my battles. As I said, I think Biblical literalism is a much bigger problem for Christianity. Literalism doesn't have a leg to stand on. Not internally, as can be seen hermeneutically by (for example) the utter impossibility of trying to reconcile all four Gospel accounts of the crucifixion and resurrection without contradiction (e.g. when and where Christ appeared to whom). Not externally, as can be seen historically by (for example) considering how Paul could write letters (e.g. to Timothy) referencing a church structure that didn't exist until after Paul was dead.\n \n Biblical literalism turns the Bible itself -- leave evolution aside -- into a nonsensical mess. If the only alternatives were Biblical literalism and atheism, I'd choose atheism myself.\n \n But I don't think these are the only alternatives.\n \n \n...a country with statistics showing increasing numbers of young adults being atheists.\n\n \n Indeed. But this inclines me to ask what we Christians are doing wrong rather than to blame non-Christians or scientific ideas. You know, remove the plank from my own eye before I start pointing out the speck in someone else's and all that.\n \n Evolution is a part of natural science. As such, it has no bearing whatsoever on the question of whether or not there is a deity that transcends the observable, material world that natural science explains according to observable, material mechanisms. It cannot say what are the characteristics of this deity (if the first question be answered in the affirmative), or how it supernaturaly interacts with the natural world it transcends, or what its personal concern is with the various parts of that world, human and otherwise.\n \n This doesn't mean that evolution presupposes that there is no such deity. It merely means that evolution also doesn't presuppose that there is. It's neutral. There is one natural explanation for the natural world that every human being shares. Whether our personal beliefs about what, if anything, transcends nature are Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or Islamic, Hindu or Buddhist, or even -- the horror! -- atheistic, is completely irrelevant.\n \n As I see it, creationism, including ID, is an attempt to eliminate this scientific neutrality with respect to transcendent metaphysics and to bias science in favor of theism. Maybe young people turn to atheism because they don't like such religious bias -- and because people like me haven't done enough to make the middle path more compelling.\n \n Like I said, plank before speck.",

   "In other words, \"they don't behave as I expect them to, so they can't be real Christians\"? \n\n \n You make it sound as if I apply only my personal, narrow interpretation of Christianity to others actions. If I question a Christian's winking and nodding at books called \"The God Delusion\" or \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\", it's more than just one narrow view. Those are oppostions to ALL forms of Christianity. \n \n \nSomehow, I don't think that's for you to judge. \n\n \n I'm not judging, pointing something out is much different than judging it. \n \n \nFurthermore, I'm fairly sure Archie has been going around saying that it's entirely possible to be a Christian evolutionist (as it isn't a salvation issue, apparently) - it's simply that God hasn't 'made clear the truth of Creation' to them. \n\n \n There are all kinds of variations of \"Christian evolutionists\" - I'm one, in some ways. I believe in variations within species, for example, and I'm not locked into a belief in a \"young earth\". But I believe in original sin by the first fully formed people in the image of God. \n \n \nYou mean \"it's currently being used as a 'weapon' against certain interpretations of the Bible\". 'Religion' as a whole is not being targeted; well, it probably is by some, but 'evolution' is by far the smallest of the concepts they use in their arguments. \n\n \n Uh, yes it probably is by some, if you noticed the titles of the 15 or so books I mentioned. I don't agree with you that evolution is the smallest of the concepts - people like Dawkins use it as the biggest. The main starting point for the \"weapon\" is common ancestry, the evolutionary belief that humans are not special creatures, more special than animals. \n \n \nEvolution cannot disprove 'religion' as a concept.\n \n Furthermore, a several hundred years ago certain members of the Church would be using more or less an identical copy of your argument about Galileo's use of a concept such as heliocentrism. Is 'the essence of heliocentrism' that 'there is no God'? \n\n \n That could be, but it's also safe to say that atheists in the time of Darwin's grandfather were doing some pretty primitive things too. But there's no real comparision between heliocentrism and common ancestor evoluton, concerning Christian behavior. \n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] It doesn't matter who the designer is, anymore than it matters to evolution where the beginning of life came from. \n\n \n \nFor ID? Indeed. But for YEC? That 'designer' is God. YEC != (is not equal to) YEC.\n I don't think we particularly disagree here, unless I'm misreading. Moving on...\n\n \n We shouldn't if you're honest. :) My point is that the relationship between ID and Christianity is EXACTLY the same as the relationship between evolution and atheism. ID and evolution are subjects. It just so happens that Christians have an enthusiasm for ID just like atheits have an enthusiasm for evolution. \n \n \nAtheism was around a loooooooong time before Christianity. \n\n \n Agreed, since Christianity has only been around for about 2000 years - humans have been around for 4000 or so years before that. \n \n \nThe base state of humanity is not Christianity - it's atheism. Did you believe in God before you were told about Him? Nor is atheism 'targeted' specifically at Christianity. Furthermore, you don't need to mention God in describing the origins of evolution. \n\n \n Prehistoric atheism wasn't targeted at Christianity, that didn't happen until atheists were told about God. If all the writers of the above 15 books that I mentioned weren't told about God, they wouldn't have written them, would they? \n \n \nI guess what you're trying to say with all of this is that '[the vast majority of] science is atheistic in nature, because all science ignores the presence of God, regardless of the personal faith of the scientist'. While the argument is pretty much true, your conclusions are not; it doesn't mean that the 'fundamental essence of science' is that 'God doesn't exist'. If you really want to find a 'fundamental essence of science' with regards to God, it would be 'God may or may not exist - but I don't particularly care right now, I'm running an experiment'. Science is apathetic/agnostic with regards to God - the only theistic assumption that scientists make is that God isn't mysteriously changing their results, which we all do every day when we go to sleep fully expecting to wake up (more or less) the same shape. \n\n \n It's important to distinguish between \"science\" and the \"scientific community\". When I say something about the scientific community, you'll notice several posters claim that I'm addressing \"science\" which I'm not. There is a difference between a subject and a group of people. \n \n \nNo, that's the argument of atheists, not the argument of scientists. Often, those people are the same - but just because many scientists are atheists doesn't mean you can equate science with atheism, because that simply isn't the case. \n\n \n And it's the same with ID. Religious people study it, but just because they believe in God doesn't mean it's impossible to scientifically study for empirical evidence of design in nature. Evolutionists always claim that there's nothing to ID, but they dismiss it too quickly. They've invested a lot of time and money in shouting it down, but there's a difference between shouting down and really analyzing. Whenever you see any analyzation of ID by an evolutionist, watch for the sarcasm/emotion. It's always there. \n \n \nAs to the 'mire' line, I'm going to ignore it, as an ad hom/attempt to parody my post. \n\n \n It's not only ad hom. I know it's cheap, but it can be an effective way to show the pot calling the kettle black. It's one of the biggest problems in the ID/evolution controversy - evolutionists often accuse IDists of the very things they do themselves. \n \n \nI could re-re-write the above quote with 'heliocentrism' instead of 'evolution/ID' just to make my point, but I can't be bothered. I'll just finish with this: the difference is that the overwhelming mass of evidence supports evolution and there is minimal/no evidence supporting ID. You've contested this, but you've been trying to prove that point on this forum for almost five years now, and have yet to do so.\n\n \n I haven't been trying to prove anything, evolution has reached the platau of invincibility, and it's currently politically correct, it's not possible for me to prove anything in these worldview battles. 'Invincibility' is a charasteristic of religion as well, and THAT is what I believe the US founding fathers were afraid of, far more than religion itself, because most of them were relgious. Scientific invincibility shouldn't be established in government anymore than should religion.",

   "I read \"Finding Darwin's God\". Practically no criticism of atheism there.\n\n \n ?!?\n \n Perhaps you stopped reading after Chapter Five? Chapter Six, \"The Gods of Disbelief,\" is Miller's criticism of atheism, especially insofar as it gets mixed with evolution. Chapter 7, \"Beyond Materialism,\" is a criticism of metaphysical materialism more generally, and the notion that it is entailed by the success of methodological materialism. And the final two chapters are his attempt at reconciling religion and science.\n \n \nI haven't read the others - would you say there was an equal balance of criticism for both creationism/ID, and atheism in those?\n\n \n What does \"equal balance\" mean? For example, since Miller devoted three chapters directly to that critical work (three through five), but only two to criticizing atheism and materialism (six and seven), does that mean that he's leaning toward atheism, despite criticizing it?\n \n In any event, Collins devotes time to criticizing both atheism and creationism in his book. He actually begins by discussing how he lost his faith and came back to it.\n \n Haught, best known for God After Darwin, wrote an entire book, God and the New Atheism, in direct response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens.\n \n \nMiller winked and nodded at atheism in his book. He mentioned Dawkins something like 15 times - never a bad word about him.\n\n \n That's simply false. He criticizes Dawkins view of religion repeatedly. And other atheists, as well. Like I said, did you read the whole book? Or did you quite before getting to the criticism of atheism?\n \n \nI don't want to read books - I want to see debates. [Note: Boldface in your original.]\n\n \n That I find very interesting, since you provide a long list of atheistic books as evidence of the power of atheism's spell. Let me ask you this: Did you actually read all those books, or are you just criticizing what you think they say?\n \n In any event, it's a shame you don't want to read books written by theistic evolutionists. There's so much more space to develop an idea than under the constraints of in-person debates, and there's so much less personality and charisma to get in the way. Perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather read a well-thought-out book -- whether I agree with it or not -- than watch a show. Vastly more educational, in my estimation.\n \n That notwithstanidng, there have been such debates. Sometimes they take place in writing, as here: A Templeton Conversation: Does science make belief in God obsolete? , where the headliners are Miller and Hitchens. Although I wasn't able to find it quickly, there was also a debate several years ago between Miller and Dawkins, as part of a larger panel concerning science and religion, I believe at a museum. Regardless, I have confidence that, should you choose to, you can find further examples via an internet search of your own.\n \n \nWith the intensity of the creation/evolution debates here.\n\n \n Personally, I could do with considerably less intensity, myself.\n \n Perhaps it's again a matter of personal preference, but I would prefer to see more careful reasoning, by all sides. I think creationists have a tendency to let their passion for their faith get in the way of their reasoning about nature, while the \"new atheists\" -- claims of rationalism notwithstanding -- have a tendency to let their passion against religion get in the way of their reasoning about their target itself.\n \n \nI want to see a theistic evolutionist bring up the intelligence of God.\n\n \n In what context? As a matter of providing a scientific explanation of natural phenomena? Or as a matter of expounding upon the glory of God?\n \n \nI want to see theistic evolutionists discuss \"wide is the gate that leads to destruction\".\n\n \n What if they believe that while there are many paths to damnation, there are also many paths to salvation?\n \n It sounds to me as if you expect theistic evolutionists to affirm the very theology that many of them oppose!\n \n \nI want to know what a theistic evolutionist considers a false teacher.\n\n \n Speaking for myself, I'll say that the number one example of false teaching is: Biblical literalism. It leads people astray in a twofold way. On the one hand, its affirmation is destructive of our God-given reason and plays into the worldly aspirations of demagogues. On the other, its denial is often accompanied by an outright rejection of Christianity and all religion as such. Nothing good comes from it.\n \n \nThere is a world of difference in thought provocation, use of a readers time etc. in brief back and fourth challanges, rather than hundreds of honey filled pages in a book, written by one person.\n\n \n Again, personal prefernces, I'd say. But I am sad that you chose to characterize books in terms of \"honey filled pages.\"\n \n And of course, surely you'd extend that charge to creationist tracts like Morris' Creation Science and Johnson's Darwin on Trial and Behe's Evolution's Black Box, as well. Right? The criticism applies to the people you like, not just the ones you don't. Right?\n \n \nMiller - that was enough. I wouldn't waste my time with anyone else like him without very good reason to believe that they have at least a teenager confirmand's knowledge of Christianity.\n\n \n I'm sorry you feel that way about him. Maybe you should read some others, though, instead of condemning all theistic evolutionists on the basis of one author.\n \n \nThey could get started with that.\n\n \n They have.\n \n \nCan you link me to anything at all?\n\n \n I'm spending more than enough time writing this as it is. If debates are what you're after, take some responsibility for your own edification and search for it yourself.\n \n \nI prefer on-line debates, much more efficient time-wise.\n\n \n \"Preference\" indeed!\n \n But as I said earlier, not very educational, ultimately. That's the problem with so much of the internet. Heck, with so much of modern culture, period. Busy, busy, busy. No time, in a hurry, gotta go.\n \n If you really think it's important to understand these issues, then make the time. The only one stopping you is you.\n \n [QUOTE]So Christianity is going to be more attractive if it's followers give in to atheist dogma?\n \n How is it \"giving in to atheist dogma\" to affirm an allegorical view of the scriptures?\n \n Yes, it's true: this is how atheists regard the scriptures. But where atheists do not regard scripture as expressing spiritual truths, theistic evolutionists most certainly do. Even if the scriptures aren't literally true, and even if they aren't meant to serve as \"proof\" for truths, they can nonetheless express truth -- most fundamentally, that there is a God who transcends the world, but who created it, interacts with it, and cares for it, especially the human part of it. That's certainly not \"atheist dogma.\"\n \n \nSeveral of these are best sellers.\n\n \n So what? It reads like the atheism shelf at my local Borders. A quick glance at the shelfspace devoted to religious books reveals just how outnumbered they are.\n \n I'm not going to waste my time compiling a list of creationist books here -- but even off the top of my head, I can come up with names like Morris, Johnson, Wells, Behe, Dembski, Denton. What would that prove, exactly?\n \n \nMaybe the atheist philosophers you mentioned far outnumber the writers/buyers of these books.\n\n \n They do. Most labor in obscurity.\n \n \nDo you have evidence that they have anywhere near the public influence that the above books do?\n\n \n Nope. But as long as we're on the subject of \"public influence,\" would you seriously claim that creationism doesn't have even more? Would you further claim that the religious publishing industry has not been even more successful? I mean, you do realize that a slew of books has been published in direct response to the \"new atheism,\" right?\n \n Come on. It's not even close. If there is more publicity -- not more public influence, but more publicity -- surrounding the atheist texts, maybe that has to do with precisely the fact that someone taking a bold stance in favor of atheism is news. The majority of Americans are self-described theists -- even if most of them don't much act like it, and even if still fewer of them know diddly about religion, Christianity, the Bible, or theology.\n \n \nAtheists and theistic evolutionists seem to agree perfectly when it comes to \"putting God to the test\". If they differ, I'd like to see a debate on it.\n\n \n They do differ. They just don't differ about what you want them to differ, so you say they're the same.\n \n You could read a book about it, if you're willing to make the time.\n \n \nIs that good instruction for young people to use as they decide their worldview?\n\n \n Yes, it is.\n \n \nWhat do you think about Biblical references to false teachers?\n\n \n And as I think has become more than clear by now, you and I have very different views of who the false teachers are, eh?\n \n \nYes, athiests agree with you perfectly!\n\n \n So what? I'm willing to bet that there are atheists with whom you would agree on matters of economic or military policy, say. You might justify things theistically, while they'd do it in purely secular terms. Would that undermine you by association?\n \n \nWhen do you think there were more hell-fire-and-brimstone preachers, in the 19th century, or recently/today?\n\n \n I have absolutely no idea. It might be more interesting to note how large their audiences were, given the rise of megachurches -- what a sorry spectacle -- and religious television.\n \n In any event, I think hellfire-and-brimstone is just tough talk. It gets the audience members concerned about themselves, at a base and appetitive level, not about others, which is where the focus should be. Spiritual narcissism.\n \n \nThroughout most denominations, the Christian message has been softened, watered down lately. And people have been proportionatly turning away from Christianity. Why do you suppose that is? Because Christianity isn't softening enough?\n\n \n To the contrary, I consider literalism itself to be soft. It is intellectually soft, turning scripture into contradictory nonsense. It is morally and politically soft, turning the Christian way of life into a matter of unquestioning obedience to rules formulated not by God but by worldly demagogues claiming divine authority.\n \n \nChristians know that passage is about a personal dispute/behavior between two people. It's not about compromising Christianity with non-belief.\n\n \n I thought it was about hypocrisy. About not accusing others when maybe I'm the problem. Go figure.\n \n \nSo it doesn't make sense that the books I listed above were written, or are selling millions of copies?\n\n \n When they catch up to the Bible, let me know.\n \n \nIt's irrelevant, but the books, the court cases, the controversy is a multi million dollar business?\n\n \n Perhaps you hadn't heard, but that controversy has two sides, and the other side has profited quite a bit, too.\n \n \nYou haven't.\n\n \n Not to you anyway!\n \n \nA start would be to study up on what the word of God actually says, and means.\n\n \n Not to worry, I've already started. But of course, this is exactly what a literalistic view can never provide.\n \n Sorry you don't feel that way. But oh, well. Can't win 'em all.",

That is a perfect example of your blatant lies and dishonesty regarding your incredibly bogus recollection of past debates.

From this innocent statement you have repeatedly lied about my position as if I deny that any bees can fly at all. \n \n The reality is that my statement has long been an issue of debate in the scientific community and I believe I posted links to that end at the time. You know links like this one. \n \n The Bumblebee & \"Aerodynamic Efficiency\" \n Posted 1 Month Ago|2 Comments|115 Views\n \n Written by\n The lefteye\n \n CATEGORY\n Internet & Technology\n TAGS\n science, theorys, aerodynamics, law, truth\n \n \n \n Plain curiosity has always made me wonder about the bumblebee... Since I found out about its 'relationship' with the conventional 'Law of Aerodynamics', I have always been glad that the poor creature was blatantly ignorant of the scores of scientists shaking their heads in disapproval of its defiant and 'unlawful flight'. \n Well, now it seems that 'science' has finally cleared the 'crude' aviator of any 'breach or disobedience' of the \n law. \n \n According to Science Daily on May 10, 2009, Oxford University scientists have discovered that \"Brute force rather than aerodynamic efficiency is the key to bumblebee flight\". \n The same article explains that the scientists decided to go back to the insect itself and use smoke, a wind tunnel and high-speed cameras to observe in detail how real bumblebee wings work in free flight. They also found that \"the bumblebee flight is surprisingly inefficient - aerodynamically-speaking it's as if the insect is 'split in half' as not only do its left and right wings flap independently but the airflow around them never joins up to help it slip through the air more easily.\" \n \n Their observations showed that, instead of the aerodynamic finesse found in most other insects, bumblebees have a adopted a brute force approach powered by a huge thorax and fueled by energy-rich nectar,\" said Dr Richard Bomphrey of the Department of Zoology, co-author of a report of the research published this month in Experiments in Fluids. \"This approach may be due to its particularly wide body shape, or it could have evolved to make bumblebees more maneuverable in the air at the cost of a less efficient flying style.\" \n \n Professor Adrian Thomas of Oxford's Department of Zoology, co-author of the report, said: \"a bumblebee is a tanker-truck, its job is to transport nectar and pollen back to the hive. Efficiency is unlikely to be important for that way of life.\" \n \n Apparently, the ol' talk that \"bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly\" was based on the 'old' version of the aerodynamic theory. These early theories suggested that bumblebee wings were too small to create sufficient lift but since then scientists have made huge advances in understanding aerodynamics and how different kinds of airflow can generate lift. \n \n I must confess, I love the bumblebee a lot more after reading this article on the Science Daily! Imagine how such an oblivious creature has had scientists stuck in the lab for decades trying to figure out such an extreme aerodynamic 'difference' that rightfully sets the bumblebee [Bombus terrestris] apart from most other flying animals. \n  Rant - The Bumblebee & \"Aerodynamic Efficiency\"",

You know links like this one. \n \n The Bumblebee & \"Aerodynamic Efficiency\" \n Posted 1 Month Ago|2 Comments|115 Views\n \n Written by\n The lefteye\n \n CATEGORY\n Internet & Technology\n TAGS\n science, theorys, aerodynamics, law, truth\n \n \n \n Plain curiosity has always made me wonder about the bumblebee... Since I found out about its 'relationship' with the conventional 'Law of Aerodynamics', I have always been glad that the poor creature was blatantly ignorant of the scores of scientists shaking their heads in disapproval of its defiant and 'unlawful flight'. \n Well, now it seems that 'science' has finally cleared the 'crude' aviator of any 'breach or disobedience' of the \n law. \n \n According to Science Daily on May 10, 2009, Oxford University scientists have discovered that \"Brute force rather than aerodynamic efficiency is the key to bumblebee flight\". \n The same article explains that the scientists decided to go back to the insect itself and use smoke, a wind tunnel and high-speed cameras to observe in detail how real bumblebee wings work in free flight. They also found that \"the bumblebee flight is surprisingly inefficient &#8211; aerodynamically-speaking it&#8217;s as if the insect is &#8216;split in half&#8217; as not only do its left and right wings flap independently but the airflow around them never joins up to help it slip through the air more easily.\" \n \n Their observations showed that, instead of the aerodynamic finesse found in most other insects, bumblebees have a adopted a brute force approach powered by a huge thorax and fueled by energy-rich nectar,\" said Dr Richard Bomphrey of the Department of Zoology, co-author of a report of the research published this month in Experiments in Fluids. \"This approach may be due to its particularly wide body shape, or it could have evolved to make bumblebees more maneuverable in the air at the cost of a less efficient flying style.\" \n \n Professor Adrian Thomas of Oxford&#8217;s Department of Zoology, co-author of the report, said: \"a bumblebee is a tanker-truck, its job is to transport nectar and pollen back to the hive. Efficiency is unlikely to be important for that way of life.\" \n \n Apparently, the ol' talk that \"bumblebees shouldn&#8217;t be able to fly\" was based on the 'old' version of the aerodynamic theory. These early theories suggested that bumblebee wings were too small to create sufficient lift but since then scientists have made huge advances in understanding aerodynamics and how different kinds of airflow can generate lift. \n \n I must confess, I love the bumblebee a lot more after reading this article on the Science Daily! Imagine how such an oblivious creature has had scientists stuck in the lab for decades trying to figure out such an extreme aerodynamic 'difference' that rightfully sets the bumblebee [Bombus terrestris] apart from most other flying animals. \n  Rant - The Bumblebee & \"Aerodynamic Efficiency\"\n",

   "?!?\n \n Perhaps you stopped reading after Chapter Five? Chapter Six, \"The Gods of Disbelief,\" is Miller's criticism of atheism, especially insofar as it gets mixed with evolution. Chapter 7, \"Beyond Materialism,\" is a criticism of metaphysical materialism more generally, and the notion that it is entailed by the success of methodological materialism. And the final two chapters are his attempt at reconciling religion and science. \n\n \n The best thing for me to do is to c/p from my post #132 of the previously linked thread on Miller;\n \n \"Are you talking about chapter 6, \"The gods of disbelief\"? What it says is fairly typical of the entire book, he quotes statements by Dawkins, Provine, etc. that declare science proves there is no God, then says \"statements like these can provoke powerful reactions\" (page 172) from the likes of Dembski and Morris. He then goes into detailed attacks on Dembski and Morris, and forgets all about Dawkins and Provine!!\n \n In the chapter \"The gods of disbelief\", please start with the quote above and go through most of page 173. I won't quote it all, but to summarize, Miller informally noticed Morris at breakfast the morning after the two of them had a public debate the night before, and Miller wanted to gloat about the \"victory\" he achieved in front of a scientific audience, an audience with a desire for Miller to win of course. He actually quoted much of what Morris said at this little breakfast, including \"you don't realize what's at stake.....scientific data aren't the ultimate authority\". Millers feelings were undoubtedly injured, because he then had this to say to the readers of his book;\n \nQuote:\n ...Nontheless, however one might admire Morris's strength of character, convictions that allow science to be bent beyond recognition are not merely unjustified - they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they corrupt and compromise the integrity of human reason.\n \n My impromptu breakfast with Henry Morris taught me an important lesson - the appeal of creationism is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out graphs and charts and diagrams, to cite laboratory experiments and field observations, to describe the details of one evolutionary sequence after another, but to the true believers of creationism, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else. \n\n \n Now let's change a few words around and see what we get;\n \n Nontheless, however one might admire Miller's strength of character, convictions that allow the BIBLE to be bent beyond recongnition are not merely unjustified, they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they compromise the integrity of human reason.\n \n This impromptu breakfast with Miller teaches us all an important lesson - the appeal of naturalistic evolution is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out charts and graphs and diagrams, citing a reasonable combination of science, history, math, and other subjects, but to true believers of Godless evolution, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else. \n \n If you don't think the promotion of evolution is emotional, please read post #130 of this thread. \n \n He didn't reject and put down any atheist anywhere in the book to the same extent that he did Henry Morris. If you want to claim that my switching around Miller's words was ad hom, there's nothing I can do about that. What it actually was, was proof of how theistic evolutionists are in perfect harmony with atheists, as pots calling the creationist kettles black. \n \n \nWhat does \"equal balance\" mean? For example, since Miller devoted three chapters directly to that critical work (three through five), but only two to criticizing atheism and materialism (six and seven), does that mean that he's leaning toward atheism, despite criticizing it? \n\n \n His personal criticisms of certain people, like Behe/Dembski, were far more severe than they were for Dawkins, Provine, Lewontin. It was that way throughout the book. I understand that a perfectly plausible explanation is because he agrees with them on the science. It's clear that his interest in Christianity is far less intense than his interest in science. That's also his right and freedom to do. But he wrote a book attempting to show middle ground - to address the conflict between the two. He simply said that God exists and is wonderful, without addressing any Biblical details of his intelligence, his purpose, his omnipresence, his omniscience, his omnipotence, and last but not least, his hatred of all that is evil, and what can lead to that evil. On the front of the book it said \"a search for common ground\". He didn't get the job done. \n \n \nIn any event, Collins devotes time to criticizing both atheism and creationism in his book. He actually begins by discussing how he lost his faith and came back to it.\n \n Haught, best known for God After Darwin, wrote an entire book, God and the New Atheism, in direct response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens.\n\n \n I'll definitely check them out when I get time. But I'll have to scan them pretty closely before I buy. If they don't have detailed Christian content, I'm not really interested. \n \n \nThat's simply false. He criticizes Dawkins view of religion repeatedly. And other atheists, as well. Like I said, did you read the whole book? Or did you quite before getting to the criticism of atheism? \n\n \n There was a completely different intensity to his criticism of atheism as opposed to his criticism of Morris, Dembski, etc. To repeat a quote from him that I showed above;\n \n \nNontheless, however one might admire Morris's strength of character, convictions that allow science to be bent beyond recognition are not merely unjustified - they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, \n\n \n That was on page 173; on the very next page, he said this;\n \n \n But unlike mitosis, protein synthesis, or signal transduction, evolution almost begs for exprapolation. The success of the natural sciences have led one analyst after another to extend Darwinian thinking into a series of distinctly nonbiological enterprises, even into the study of religion. \n\n \n What basically follows this is \"darn, I wish they wouldn't do that, but they say this about science, that about science, and I sure do agree with them! He never comes close to calling what they do dangerous in the intellectual and moral sense, nor does he seem to speculate on how successful they are as atheistic recruits. \n \n \nThat I find very interesting, since you provide a long list of atheistic books as evidence of the power of atheism's spell. Let me ask you this: Did you actually read all those books, or are you just criticizing what you think they say? \n\n \n The titles are very indicative of what they say, don't you think? I have two of them - haven't thoroughly read them, but refer to them sometimes. \n \n \nIn any event, it's a shame you don't want to read books written by theistic evolutionists. There's so much more space to develop an idea than under the constraints of in-person debates, and there's so much less personality and charisma to get in the way. Perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather read a well-thought-out book -- whether I agree with it or not -- than watch a show. Vastly more educational, in my estimation. \n\n \n Henry Morris wrote a book titled \"The Long War Against God\". Are you interested? In this book he quotes many of the \"extrapolators\" that Miller spoke of. Ernst Mayr for example;\n \n \nMan's world view today is dominated by the knowledge that the universe, the stars, the earth and all living things have evolved through a long history that was not foreordained or programed. \n\n He lists several similar quotes by others, Huxley, Dobzhansky, George Wald, etc. He says \"That this globalistic view of evolution is held by the leading evolutionists themselves - the ones who know the most about their theory and its implications - should be (though it is not) well known by now\". In the forward, it says \"The average person neither knows nor cares much about the error of evolution, and yet his or her life is constantly being influenced by it\". I hope you'll check it out.\n \n \nThat notwithstanidng, there have been such debates. Sometimes they take place in writing, as here: A Templeton Conversation: Does science make belief in God obsolete? , where the headliners are Miller and Hitchens. Although I wasn't able to find it quickly, there was also a debate several years ago between Miller and Dawkins, as part of a larger panel concerning science and religion, I believe at a museum. Regardless, I have confidence that, should you choose to, you can find further examples via an internet search of your own. \n\n \n That's a good link. \n \n \nPersonally, I could do with considerably less intensity, myself.\n \n Perhaps it's again a matter of personal preference, but I would prefer to see more careful reasoning, by all sides. I think creationists have a tendency to let their passion for their faith get in the way of their reasoning about nature, while the \"new atheists\" -- claims of rationalism notwithstanding -- have a tendency to let their passion against religion get in the way of their reasoning about their target itself. \n\n \n Careful reasoning can get long and drawn out. I love the written word, but I also love 'brief' and consice. I think debates can inspire it. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] I want to see a theistic evolutionist bring up the intelligence of God. \n\n \n \nIn what context? As a matter of providing a scientific explanation of natural phenomena? Or as a matter of expounding upon the glory of God? \n\n \n In the context of application to the origins of life. It makes sense for atheists to vehemently oppose it as science, but it does not make sense for theistic evolutionists to vehemently oppose it, as does Miller, or about any theistic evolutionist that I've ever seen. \n \n \nWhat if they believe that while there are many paths to damnation, there are also many paths to salvation? \n\n \n John 14:6] Jesus answered, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me\". \n \n If they think there are many paths to salvation, they really aren't Christian. It's something that simply doesn't vary in actual Christianity. If theistic evolution allows one to claim that as allegory like Genesis, or subject it to other interpretations, then my point about theistic evolution is largely proven, that is, when Genesis goes, the rest of the Bible can easily follow it. \n \n \nIt sounds to me as if you expect theistic evolutionists to affirm the very theology that many of them oppose! \n\n \n I only expect them to learn some very basics about Christianity before claiming to be a Christian. Being a Christian isn't about choosing/rejecting anything we want. \n \n \nSpeaking for myself, I'll say that the number one example of false teaching is: Biblical literalism. It leads people astray in a twofold way. On the one hand, its affirmation is destructive of our God-given reason and plays into the worldly aspirations of demagogues. On the other, its denial is often accompanied by an outright rejection of Christianity and all religion as such. Nothing good comes from it. \n\n \n Point taken. Sometimes these types of discussions can be fruitful. If theistic evolutionists don't get their information from the Bible, where do they get it from? \n \n \nAgain, personal prefernces, I'd say. But I am sad that you chose to characterize books in terms of \"honey filled pages.\" \n \n And of course, surely you'd extend that charge to creationist tracts like Morris' Creation Science and Johnson's Darwin on Trial and Behe's Evolution's Black Box, as well. Right? The criticism applies to the people you like, not just the ones you don't. Right? \n\n \n Yes, exactly right. I have two of those three, and one by Ann Coulter as well. Haven't found the time to completely read any of them yet. A one sided book with no challange can be boring for a physically active person such as myself. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nI'm sorry you feel that way about him. Maybe you should read some others, though, instead of condemning all theistic evolutionists on the basis of one author. \n\n \n I haven't completely given up on finding one with an actual knowledge of Christianity, but am rather pessimestic that I'll ever find one. It's not like I've never looked. \n \n \nBut as I said earlier, not very educational, ultimately. That's the problem with so much of the internet. Heck, with so much of modern culture, period. Busy, busy, busy. No time, in a hurry, gotta go.\n \n If you really think it's important to understand these issues, then make the time. The only one stopping you is you. \n\n \n The only other thing that could stop me is if there's no such thing as a theistic evolutionist with an actual knowledge of basic Christianity. You know, wide gates and narrow gates, decievers, false teachers, the evil one (that would be Satan, not obvious_child :p) \n \n \nHow is it \"giving in to atheist dogma\" to affirm an allegorical view of the scriptures? \n\n \n Reducing the scriptures to allegory is a large step towards reducing them to nothing. \n \n \nYes, it's true: this is how atheists regard the scriptures. But where atheists do not regard scripture as expressing spiritual truths, theistic evolutionists most certainly do. Even if the scriptures aren't literally true, and even if they aren't meant to serve as \"proof\" for truths, they can nonetheless express truth -- most fundamentally, that there is a God who transcends the world, but who created it, interacts with it, and cares for it, especially the human part of it. That's certainly not \"atheist dogma.\" \n\n \n There is a huge difference in meaning in an allegory vs an actual event. Watching a Hollywood drama movie with actors playing dead is completely different than was watching actual news footage of the world trade center coming down, of people actually jumping to their deaths.\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] Several of these are best sellers. \n\n \n \nSo what? It reads like the atheism shelf at my local Borders. A quick glance at the shelfspace devoted to religious books reveals just how outnumbered they are. \n \n I'm not going to waste my time compiling a list of creationist books here -- but even off the top of my head, I can come up with names like Morris, Johnson, Wells, Behe, Dembski, Denton. What would that prove, exactly? \n\n \n Just about every teenager who attends a science class and wanders through that Borders is going to immediately know one thing - that the list I gave does not receive the criticism from the scientific community to near the extent that Morris, Johnson, Wells, Behe, Dembski, and Denton receive. Which type of book do you think a somewhat newly rebellious teenager is likely to pick up? The ones approved by science or the ones approved by their parents? \n \n \nNope. But as long as we're on the subject of \"public influence,\" would you seriously claim that creationism doesn't have even more? Would you further claim that the religious publishing industry has not been even more successful? I mean, you do realize that a slew of books has been published in direct response to the \"new atheism,\" right? \n\n \n A slew? More than 15 in one or two years? \n \n \nCome on. It's not even close. If there is more publicity -- not more public influence, but more publicity -- surrounding the atheist texts, maybe that has to do with precisely the fact that someone taking a bold stance in favor of atheism is news. The majority of Americans are self-described theists -- even if most of them don't much act like it, and even if still fewer of them know diddly about religion, Christianity, the Bible, or theology. \n\n \n If they don't much act like it and they don't know much about it, they're easy prey for P.Z. Myers, Dawkins, and the authors of the above books. \n \n \nThey do differ. They just don't differ about what you want them to differ, so you say they're the same.\n \n You could read a book about it, if you're willing to make the time. \n\n \n I've read more than one. I've read \"Finding Darwin's God\", and I've read \"The Long War Against God\". As someone who knows something about Christianity and some basics of what's actually going on in the world today, guess which one looked phony to me? \n \n \nAnd as I think has become more than clear by now, you and I have very different views of who the false teachers are, eh? \n\n \n Yes, and Myers and Dawkins have to pick which type needs to be attacked more. Who will they choose? emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] Yes, athiests agree with you perfectly! \n\n \n \nSo what? I'm willing to bet that there are atheists with whom you would agree on matters of economic or military policy, say. You might justify things theistically, while they'd do it in purely secular terms. Would that undermine you by association? \n\n \n Not at all, because if they agree with me on just about any secular subject, they wouldn't be taking exception to what the Bible says, and claiming it to be science. \n \n \nI have absolutely no idea. It might be more interesting to note how large their audiences were, given the rise of megachurches -- what a sorry spectacle -- and religious television.\n \n In any event, I think hellfire-and-brimstone is just tough talk. It gets the audience members concerned about themselves, at a base and appetitive level, not about others, which is where the focus should be. Spiritual narcissism. \n\n \n The reality about eternal separation from God runs the entire spectrum about self concern and concern about others. \n \n \nTo the contrary, I consider literalism itself to be soft. It is intellectually soft, turning scripture into contradictory nonsense. It is morally and politically soft, turning the Christian way of life into a matter of unquestioning obedience to rules formulated not by God but by worldly demagogues claiming divine authority. \n\n \n \"Demagogues\"? 2 Timothy 3:16 \"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\"\n \n An allegory? How many ways can that really be interpreted? \n \n \nI thought it was about hypocrisy. About not accusing others when maybe I'm the problem. Go figure. \n\n \n Yes, go figure. You missed 2nd Timothy all right. \n \n \nWhen they catch up to the Bible, let me know. \n\n \n They're recent - they indicate a change. The title \"The Long War Against God\" indicates a transition. \n \n \nPerhaps you hadn't heard, but that controversy has two sides, and the other side has profited quite a bit, too. \n\n \n But which side appears to be winning? - that's the big question!\n \n \nNot to worry, I've already started. But of course, this is exactly what a literalistic view can never provide.\n \n Sorry you don't feel that way. \n\n \n A lot of atheist posters here sputter with rage because I don't feel that way as well.",

   "Thus the question must be, are these people literalists or are they just interpretating things as they see fit to make themselves feel better about their factless beliefs?\n\n \n It's hard to say. Consider the following contradictions from the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion and resurrection:\n \n 1) Both bandits who were crucified with Jesus mocking him, and one of them rebuking the other and then repenting; and\n \n 2) The first visitor/s to the tomb being greeted by a single divine messenger and by two messengers and even by no messenger at all; and\n \n 3) After the resurrection, Christ first appearing to the disciples in Galilee and first appearing to them in Jerusalem.\n \n I think most people who think of themselves as literalists -- who claim inerrancy for the Bible even on matters of fact and history -- simply don't subject the text to enough scrutiny to recognize such problems. They've constructed a unified story of the crucifixion and resurrection (to keep with the above examples) that draws from all four Gospels, but which cannot be considered a \"literal\" reading of the four of them taken together. So they think of themselves as interpreting scripture \"literally,\" but what they consider the scriptural account isn't even actually what the different scriptures say in the first place!\n \n I don't consider close scrutiny of the text to be equivalent to \"literalism\" myself. To the contrary, close scrutiny of the text simply demands that one not take the scriptures literally, if they are to make any sense whatsoever. (It also demands attention to historical context, which is another thing that \"literalists\" rarely give. But that's a story for another time.)",

   "Marc\n \n As to your view of Miller, I do not understand why you think explicitly disagreeing with atheism on repeated occasions is insufficient to indicate an opposition to atheism. If he agrees with atheists on matters of science, I fail to see how this lessens his disagreement with them on matters of religion.\n \n Does it further occur to you that maybe he considers creationism itself to be a bigger threat to religion than either evolution or atheism? I know I do. Creationism makes God a trickster deity, planting starlight (for example) in such a way as to \"inform\" us about states of distant celestial bodies that never actually were. One might as well worship Loki or Coyote.\n \n Now to your word switch:\n \n \nNow let's change a few words around and see what we get;\n \n Nontheless, however one might admire Miller's strength of character, convictions that allow the BIBLE to be bent beyond recongnition are not merely unjustified, they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they compromise the integrity of human reason.\n\n \n Actually, I think it's Biblical \"literalism\" that distorts the Bible beyond recognition. I challenge you to read the four Gospel accounts of, say, the crucifixion and resurrection each as literally true.\n \n Back to the switcheroo:\n \n \nThis impromptu breakfast with Miller teaches us all an important lesson - the appeal of naturalistic evolution is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out charts and graphs and diagrams, citing a reasonable combination of science, history, math, and other subjects, but to true believers of Godless evolution, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else.\n\n \n I have no doubt that metaphysical naturalism and atheism are not scientific positions. Of course, I also have no doubt that evolution does not entail metaphysical naturalism or atheism.\n \n Evolution is compatible with atheism. But it does not require atheism. Why does the compatibility bother you?\n \n \nIf you don't think the promotion of evolution is emotional, please read [post x].\n\n \n I had no doubt of that already. People get worked up, and I'm not going to defend name-calling and insults on either side of the debate.\n \n But that evolution is promoted with emotion does not mean that evolution is not grounded in science.\n \n \n...theistic evolutionists are in perfect harmony with atheists, as pots calling the creationist kettles black.\n\n \n But who denied that? Yes, you're right: theistic evolutionists agree with atheists that creationism is wrong. What you keep ignoring is that theistic evolutionists disagree with atheists about religion itself.\n \n Why do you keep ignoring that? It's very easy to pretend that things are the same when you won't consider the differences.\n \n \nHis personal criticisms of certain people, like Behe/Dembski, were far more severe than they were for Dawkins, Provine, Lewontin. It was that way throughout the book. I understand that a perfectly plausible explanation is because he agrees with them on the science.\n\n \n Actually, I'd think an even more plausible explanation is that he considers creationism to be the even greater threat to religion itself. I know I do.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s clear that his interest in Christianity is far less intense than his interest in science.\n\n \n His interest in science certainly leads him to a different understanding of Christianity than yours. Why that should mean that he cares about Christianity less than science is not at all clear to me.\n \n Here's one for you. \"It's clear that Biblical literalists' interest in what the Bible actually says is far less intense than their interest in their right-wing political agenda.\" If someone said that to you, how would you take it?\n \n \n...he wrote a book attempting to show middle ground &#8211; to address the conflict between the two. He simply said that God exists and is wonderful, without addressing any Biblical details of his intelligence, his purpose, his omnipresence, his omniscience, his omnipotence, and last but not least, his hatred of all that is evil, and what can lead to that evil. On the front of the book it said &#8220;a search for common ground&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t get the job done.\n\n \n So in other words, you wanted him to write as a theologian, rather than as a scientist. Come on!\n \n \nI&#8217;ll definitely check [Collins and Haught] out when I get time. But I&#8217;ll have to scan them pretty closely before I buy. If they don&#8217;t have detailed Christian content, I&#8217;m not really interested.\n\n \n Well, I can tell you that sadly, Collins is writing as a scientist not a theologian, so you probably won't find him interesting. Haught, on the other hand, is a theologian. But whether he gives enough \"detailed Christian content\" to suit you, I won't hazard a guess.\n \n I fear that you are limiting your reading choices to those who agree with you, and getting a very one-sided view of both science and religion.\n \n [QUOTE][Miller] never comes close to calling what [atheists] do dangerous in the intellectual and moral sense...[QUOTE]\n \n Maybe he doesn't think they are? In my experience, Biblical literalists are much more dangerous, intellectually, morally, politically, and...\n \n \n...nor does he seem to speculate on how successful they are as atheistic recruits.\n\n \n ...spiritually as well. I think speculation is long overdue for how successful Biblical literalists themselves are at \"recruiting\" for atheism.\n \n \nThe titles are very indicative of what they say, don&#8217;t you think? I have two of them &#8211; haven&#8217;t thoroughly read them, but refer to them sometimes.\n\n \n So you really are judging books by their covers?...\n \n \nHenry Morris wrote a book titled &#8220;The Long War Against God&#8221;. Are you interested?\n\n \n Not really. I've read enough Henry Morris to have confidence in where he's coming from.\n \n \nIn this book he quotes many of the &#8220;extrapolators&#8221; that Miller spoke of. Ernst Mayr for example;\n\n \n Am I allowed to point out that I think -- and that Miller thinks -- such extrapolations are erroneous? That there is no purpose and direction to the universe as a whole or to the history of life is compatible with, but not supported by, the scientific account. However, that there is indeed such purpose and direction is also not supported by, but is compatible with, the scientific account.\n \n If Mayr thinks otherwise, so much the worse for Mayr's view of religion and metaphysics. Not necessarily for his view of science, though. I don't have to agree with everything the man says just because I agree with some of it.\n \n \nCareful reasoning can get long and drawn out.\n\n \n It takes work to follow it. Oh well. If the stakes are high enough, it shold be worth the effort.\n \n \nI love the written word, but I also love &#8216;brief&#8217; and consice. I think debates can inspire it.\n\n \n I don't think of debates in terms of brevity and conciseness so much as soundbites and zingers. Not always, of course. But in terms of enhancing people's understanding, I think books work better than debates.\n \n \nIn the context of application to the origins of life. It makes sense for atheists to vehemently oppose it as science, but it does not make sense for theistic evolutionists to vehemently oppose it, as does Miller, or about any theistic evolutionist that I've ever seen.\n\n \n Marc, it does make sense for them to oppose it as science. God's intelligence does not explain the natural origin of life. It may help to explain the origin of life in relation to God's intentions. But that's not what science is about.\n \n Natural science is not a sub-discipline of theology.\n \n \nJohn 14:6 Jesus answered, &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me\". \n \n If they think there are many paths to salvation, they really aren&#8217;t Christian. It&#8217;s something that simply doesn&#8217;t vary in actual Christianity.\n\n \n Baloney. Do you know how much discussion there has been, historically, about the passage you quoted here? What is \"the way,\" for example? What does it mean to \"come to the father?\" \"through Christ?\" or to \"know Christ?\"\n \n Contrary to your claim, interpretations do vary. More \"conservative\" commentators take it as meaning that explicit adherence to Christianity is a prerequisite for salvation. More \"liberal\" interpreters take it to mean that following Christ's example is the key, whether professedly Christian or not. Suffice it to say, matters are considerably more complicated than you make them out to be.\n \n You don't get to decide who's \"really Christian\" and who isn't, Marc. And if you want to know what's responsible for whatever decline in Christianity and rise in atheism there may be -- well, I think that sort of exclusionism is a good place to start looking.\n \n \n If theistic evolution allows one to claim that as allegory like Genesis, or subject it to other interpretations...\n\n \n It is all subject to multiple interpretations! Like it or not, that's the way it is. The book's meanings aren't just smack-you-in-the-forehead obvious. That's why we have centuries worth of theological work trying to make sense of it all.\n \n \n...then my point about theistic evolution is largely proven, that is, when Genesis goes, the rest of the Bible can easily follow it.\n\n \n So go ahead and follow it. Interpret it all as allegory. This doesn't mean atheism wins. It just means the Bible is about spiritual truths rather than worldly truths. Why is that a problem?\n \n \nI only expect them to learn some very basics about Christianity before claiming to be a Christian.\n\n \n With all due respect, \"learning the very basics\" does not require one to interpret scripture literally. On the contrary, I would argue just that it requires just the opposite.\n \n \nBeing a Christian isn't about choosing/rejecting anything we want.\n\n \n Indeed not. So when Mark and Matthew say that both bandits mocked Jesus, but Luke says one repented, while John doesn't mention what the bandits said, which should we say is the account of what really happened? When Mark and Matthew say that one messenger met the women at the tomb, but Luke says two messengers, while John mentions no messengers at all, which account do we literalize? When Matthew says that the disciples first met the resurrected Christ in Galilee, but Luke that they first met him in Jerusalem, which account is right?\n \n You see, I think that we can only make sense out of these kinds of things by taking the texts non-literally. That way, instead of \"choosing/rejecting anything we want,\" we can accept the texts as written, and ask what they really mean. Why would it have been important for the Lucan author to include the story about the bandit who repents? What is the symbolism behind the various messengers at the tomb? What is the significance of Galilee versus Jerusalem as the sites of Christ's appearance to the disciples?\n \n I think that none of this -- none of this -- undermines Christianity. If one takes the leap of faith, exploration of such questions can deepen that faith. It can help one understand the meaning of redemption and eternal life, or the power of God's love for mankind and for his entire creation.\n \n What undermines Christianity is the literalistic attitude that must either nonsensically affirm manifest contradictions or else construct a mish-mosh story other than the actually written Gospels themselves in order to affirm something coherent.\n \n \nIf theistic evolutionists don&#8217;t get their information from the Bible, where do they get it from?\n\n \n On nature, from the use of natural reason. As Galileo said, God didn't give us reason just so we could forego its use.\n \n But theistic evolutionists do take the Bible more seriously than I think you realize.\n \n \nI haven&#8217;t completely given up on finding one with an actual knowledge of Christianity, but am rather pessimestic that I&#8217;ll ever find one. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve never looked.\n\n \n Try Haught; he's a theologian, not a scientist. And maybe start with God and the New Atheism before giving God After Darwin a shot.\n \n But don't necessarily expect him to interpret the Bible as you do! To wit:\n \n \n... a theistic evolutionist with an actual knowledge of basic Christianity. You know, wide gates and narrow gates, decievers, false teachers, the evil one\n\n \n See, here again, I worry that you are essentially limiting what counts as \"knowledge of basic Christianity\" to \"an interpretation of scripture that agrees with my own.\" If it's impossible for someone to \"know basic Christianity\" while disagreeing with your view of Christianity, then the game is rigged. \n \n \nReducing the scriptures to allegory is a large step towards reducing them to nothing.\n\n \n And yet, one need not take that final step. I don't look at it as \"reducing\" the scriptures at all. The allegorical interpretation opens them up. It's literalism that reduces the stories -- to incoherence.\n \n \nThere is a huge difference in meaning in an allegory vs an actual event. Watching a Hollywood drama movie with actors playing dead is completely different than was watching actual news footage of the world trade center coming down, of people actually jumping to their deaths.\n\n \n A better example would be to compare meanings of allegorical and literal interpretations of a single movie. If you take, say, \"The Godfather\" as an allegory about a man's horrible descent into the pit of evil, it means something rather different than if you take it as history. Ditto for the news. If you take the footage of the WTC as real, it would mean something rather different than a fictional account.\n \n And ditto for the Bible. I wouldn't deny that. But just as in the cases of interpreting movies and news footage, some ways of interpreting are better than others. Some make sense and others don't. Some help you understand what's being interpreted correctly, while others lead to error.\n \n \nWhich type of book do you think a somewhat newly rebellious teenager is likely to pick up? The ones approved by science or the ones approved by their parents?\n\n \n Depends. What is the parents' view of science?\n \n [QUOTE] A slew? More than 15 in one or two years?\n \n I don't know the numbers, but the reaction has been very swift. It's readily observable in books like The Dawkins Delusion or God Is Back. Haught's book is another example.\n \n Why are you so caught up in numbers?\n \n \nIf they don&#8217;t much act like it and they don&#8217;t know much about it, they&#8217;re easy prey for P.Z. Myers, Dawkins, and the authors of the above books.\n\n \n That's funny. I was thinking they're easy prey for people like John Hagee or James Dobson or Philip Johnson.\n \n Like I said, you and I have rather different conceptions of who it is that we need to be wary of. If the issue is concern for false teachers -- i.e., for those who lead people astray by claiming to teach the faith when they aren't -- then I think we ought to look within the Christian community, not outside it.\n \n I think Myers and Dawkins are wrong, but I don't think they're false teachers.\n \n \n&#8220;Demagogues&#8221;? 2 Timothy 3:16 &#8220;All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.&#8221;\n \n An allegory? How many ways can that really be interpreted?\n\n \n Again, I think you are simply ignoring the possibilities.\n \n What does \"God breathed\" mean, for example? Does it mean \"divinely inspired?\" Would such divine inspiration imply that the authors' human intentions or human fallibility are inconsequential? Taking this passage as \"evidence\" of scriptural literalism or inerrancy does not hold up to even minimal scrutiny.\n \n You need to stop making things so easy on yourself.\n \n \nYes, go figure. You missed 2nd Timothy all right.\n\n \n No, I just don't think it means what you think it does.\n \n After all, you realize that Paul himself didn't write 2nd Timothy. Right? Nor did he write the 1st.\n \n \"Basics,\" indeed.",

   "Marc\n \n As to your view of Miller, I do not understand why you think explicitly disagreeing with atheism on repeated occasions is insufficient to indicate an opposition to atheism. If he agrees with atheists on matters of science, I fail to see how this lessens his disagreement with them on matters of religion.\n \n Does it further occur to you that maybe he considers creationism itself to be a bigger threat to religion than either evolution or atheism? I know I do. Creationism makes God a trickster deity, planting starlight (for example) in such a way as to \"inform\" us about states of distant celestial bodies that never actually were. One might as well worship Loki or Coyote. \n\n \n I don't believe that God considered the Bible to be satisfactory when it was written, only to later become unsatisfactory as man learned more and more about nature. If we think God is a trickster deity because of what we have recently learned, it may be time to take a look at ourselves. If we think we can see, and measure distances in terms of hundreds of thousands of light years for example, we may be thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought to think. (Romans 12:3)\n \n \nI have no doubt that metaphysical naturalism and atheism are not scientific positions. Of course, I also have no doubt that evolution does not entail metaphysical naturalism or atheism.\n \n Evolution is compatible with atheism. But it does not require atheism. Why does the compatibility bother you? \n\n \n Because political descisons are often two-way decisions, and there is often no going back. Some of those political decisions multiply and spread like wildfire throughout a society, making drastic, irreversible changes. I believe the 1947 \"Separation of church and state\" decision did just that, as I believe the recent Dover decision also did. \n \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] ...theistic evolutionists are in perfect harmony with atheists, as pots calling the creationist kettles black. \n \n \n \nBut who denied that? Yes, you're right: theistic evolutionists agree with atheists that creationism is wrong. What you keep ignoring is that theistic evolutionists disagree with atheists about religion itself. \n \n Why do you keep ignoring that? It's very easy to pretend that things are the same when you won't consider the differences. \n\n \n Their agreement with atheists about creationism is often enough to tip the political scales in the atheists favor, causing ALL Christians to lose yet another battle in the war against God that Henry Morris (or PZ Myers, or Richard Dawkins) makes all too clear. \n \n \nActually, I'd think an even more plausible explanation is that he considers creationism to be the even greater threat to religion itself. I know I do. \n\n \n That's just where we have to agree to disagree. If you think separation of church and state and all that goes with it (public display removal of the ten commandments, removal of Christmas displays, removal of public prayer, etc. etc.) are not THREATS to religon, well.........\n \n \nHis interest in science certainly leads him to a different understanding of Christianity than yours. Why that should mean that he cares about Christianity less than science is not at all clear to me.\n \n Here's one for you. \"It's clear that Biblical literalists' interest in what the Bible actually says is far less intense than their interest in their right-wing political agenda.\" If someone said that to you, how would you take it? \n\n \n That's fine with me, that's probably actually true with me. I think a right-wing political agenda strengthens Biblical guidelines in how we are supposed to live. \n \n \nSo in other words, you wanted him to write as a theologian, rather than as a scientist. Come on! \n\n \n It would have been nice if it was somewhere close to 50/50, since he was comparing the two. \n \n \n \n \nWell, I can tell you that sadly, Collins is writing as a scientist not a theologian, so you probably won't find him interesting. Haught, on the other hand, is a theologian. But whether he gives enough \"detailed Christian content\" to suit you, I won't hazard a guess.\n \n I fear that you are limiting your reading choices to those who agree with you, and getting a very one-sided view of both science and religion. \n\n \n And you're not also guilty of that? :)\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 [Miller] never comes close to calling what [atheists] do dangerous in the intellectual and moral sense...\n\n \n \nMaybe he doesn't think they are? In my experience, Biblical literalists are much more dangerous, intellectually, morally, politically, and...\n\n \n Then there's nothing more for us to discuss on it, and that's fine. But it does nothing to undo my belief that liberalism in politics has close ties with atheism. It seems like every atheist activist (like Myers, Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Stenger) are politically liberal. \n \n \n...spiritually as well. I think speculation is long overdue for how successful Biblical literalists themselves are at \"recruiting\" for atheism. \n\n \n You could start a thread on it. No question you'll get plenty of help from atheists. They'll do vicious put downs Biblical literalists, while claiming they help the atheist cause. I could only hope that you'd look hard for the phoniness. \n \n \nSo you really are judging books by their covers?...\n\n \n It's often possible to do that, yes. I have a copy Stenger's \"How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist\", and amazingly enough, it's filled with what he believes to be scientific evidence that God doesn't exist! Imagine that! I also have Ann Coulter's \"How to Talk to a Liberal If You Must.\" Do you think a lot of liberals hurry home with that book, all mystified about what it basically says? \n \n \nNot really. I've read enough Henry Morris to have confidence in where he's coming from. \n\n \n So you're judging a book by it's cover? How about Pamela Winnick's \"A Jealous God - Science's crusade against religion\"? Is that cover all you need to see, or are you curious about the documented historical facts it may contain? \n \n \nAm I allowed to point out that I think -- and that Miller thinks -- such extrapolations are erroneous? \n\n \n Yes, but you'd simply be wrong. They're not erroneous, because it's documented that they exist. They're stated in black and white, and when they are stated by enough prominent people, they can easily tip the political scalses. If you think they're harmless, then that's your political opinion. Having a liberal political opinion isn't quite as drastic as being factually wrong. (But it's close) :p\n \n \nMarc, it does make sense for them to oppose it as science. God's intelligence does not explain the natural origin of life. It may help to explain the origin of life in relation to God's intentions. But that's not what science is about.\n \n Natural science is not a sub-discipline of theology. \n\n \n But it sure is a sub-discipline of atheism. And that's a big political problem. \n \n [continued in next post]",

   " Originally posted by marc9000] John 14:6 Jesus answered, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me\". \n \n If they think there are many paths to salvation, they really aren't Christian. It's something that simply doesn't vary in actual Christianity. \n\n \n \nBaloney. Do you know how much discussion there has been, historically, about the passage you quoted here? What is \"the way,\" for example? What does it mean to \"come to the father?\" \"through Christ?\" or to \"know Christ?\"\n \n Contrary to your claim, interpretations do vary. More \"conservative\" commentators take it as meaning that explicit adherence to Christianity is a prerequisite for salvation. More \"liberal\" interpreters take it to mean that following Christ's example is the key, whether professedly Christian or not. Suffice it to say, matters are considerably more complicated than you make them out to be. \n\n \n But all that complication often comes down to one two way political decision. Doesn't it make sense to wonder why the Bible warns against false teaching? It can only be because there are consequences to false teachings. It's about deception - a subject that appears in the Bible several times. \n \n \nYou don't get to decide who's \"really Christian\" and who isn't, Marc. And if you want to know what's responsible for whatever decline in Christianity and rise in atheism there may be -- well, I think that sort of exclusionism is a good place to start looking. \n\n \n I'm not deciding, I'm simply analyzing what God/Christ have decided. We can't change the truth into something we wish it to be. I ferfently hope that the more liberal Christians view that heaven is a pretty easy place to enter is true. For myself, and for everyone. None of us asked to be born. But that's my reasoning, not God's. I don't get to tell him what to do. \n \n \nIt is all subject to multiple interpretations! Like it or not, that's the way it is. The book's meanings aren't just smack-you-in-the-forehead obvious. That's why we have centuries worth of theological work trying to make sense of it all.\n \n So go ahead and follow it. Interpret it all as allegory. This doesn't mean atheism wins. It just means the Bible is about spiritual truths rather than worldly truths. Why is that a problem? \n\n \n In the U.S. culture war, it is a big problem. \n \n \nWith all due respect, \"learning the very basics\" does not require one to interpret scripture literally. On the contrary, I would argue just that it requires just the opposite.\n \n Indeed not. So when Mark and Matthew say that both bandits mocked Jesus, but Luke says one repented, while John doesn't mention what the bandits said, which should we say is the account of what really happened? When Mark and Matthew say that one messenger met the women at the tomb, but Luke says two messengers, while John mentions no messengers at all, which account do we literalize? When Matthew says that the disciples first met the resurrected Christ in Galilee, but Luke that they first met him in Jerusalem, which account is right?\n \n You see, I think that we can only make sense out of these kinds of things by taking the texts non-literally. That way, instead of \"choosing/rejecting anything we want,\" we can accept the texts as written, and ask what they really mean. Why would it have been important for the Lucan author to include the story about the bandit who repents? What is the symbolism behind the various messengers at the tomb? What is the significance of Galilee versus Jerusalem as the sites of Christ's appearance to the disciples?\n \n I think that none of this -- none of this -- undermines Christianity. If one takes the leap of faith, exploration of such questions can deepen that faith. It can help one understand the meaning of redemption and eternal life, or the power of God's love for mankind and for his entire creation.\n \n What undermines Christianity is the literalistic attitude that must either nonsensically affirm manifest contradictions or else construct a mish-mosh story other than the actually written Gospels themselves in order to affirm something coherent. \n\n \n What mish-mosh stories do you see being constructed by literalists over these very small details? As far as I know, literalists simply claim these details aren't important, that different eyewitnesses recorded the basics of what they saw as best they could. It is atheists who focus on these details, and try to use them to say that contradictions, however small, are indicators that the whole story is false! It seems that atheists and theistic evolutionists inspect and criticise the Bible in exactly the same way, agree politically on just about everything, and claim to have more drastic disagreement on the depth/non existance of faith than do atheists and creationists! \n \n \nOn nature, from the use of natural reason. As Galileo said, God didn't give us reason just so we could forego its use.\n \n But theistic evolutionists do take the Bible more seriously than I think you realize. \n\n \n I'll have to read some Haught and see if I can find it. It doesn't show in Miller's book, and it doesn't show in your posts. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] ... a theistic evolutionist with an actual knowledge of basic Christianity. You know, wide gates and narrow gates, decievers, false teachers, the evil one \n\n \n \nSee, here again, I worry that you are essentially limiting what counts as \"knowledge of basic Christianity\" to \"an interpretation of scripture that agrees with my own.\" If it's impossible for someone to \"know basic Christianity\" while disagreeing with your view of Christianity, then the game is rigged. \n\n \n The actual words \"wide gate\", \"narrow\", \"deceiver\" \"false teachers\", \"evil one\" are not my words! The honeyed word \"interpretation\" can only be stretched so far. \n \n \nAnd yet, one need not take that final step. I don't look at it as \"reducing\" the scriptures at all. The allegorical interpretation opens them up. It's literalism that reduces the stories -- to incoherence. \n\n \n Two way political decisions often consist of steps, and that final step is often an easy one to take. Allegorical interpretations open them up to ridicule, and political insignificance. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] A slew? More than 15 in one or two years? \n\n \n \nI don't know the numbers, but the reaction has been very swift. It's readily observable in books like The Dawkins Delusion or God Is Back. Haught's book is another example.\n \n Why are you so caught up in numbers? \n\n \n Numbers are important in politics. They're almost always present in political decisions. \n \n \nWhat does \"God breathed\" mean, for example? Does it mean \"divinely inspired?\" \n\n \n Yes, exactly.\n \n \nWould such divine inspiration imply that the authors' human intentions or human fallibility are inconsequential? \n\n \n Not inconsequential, but non-existant. The divine inspiration was that strong. But it didn't prevent the authors writing with their own distnct personalities. \n \n \nTaking this passage as \"evidence\" of scriptural literalism or inerrancy does not hold up to even minimal scrutiny. \n\n \n It always depends on who is doing the scrutinizing. Taking Miller's book as evidence that there's no conflict between Darwinism and Christianity doesn't hold up to the minimal scrutiny of many people, either. \n \n \nYou need to stop making things so easy on yourself. \n\n \n Oh the irony - those who ride the fence between the two distinct positions of atheism and creationism are the ones that make things easy on themselves. Atheists don't ridicule and attack you. \n \n \nAfter all, you realize that Paul himself didn't write 2nd Timothy. Right? Nor did he write the 1st. \n\n \n I realize that that's an atheist claim. \n \n July 2008 Ask an Atheist\n \n This guy claims that the \"majority\" of Bible scholars don't believe Paul wrote 1st and 2nd Timothy. There must be a lot of atheist (and Muslim) Bible scholars. He's obviously trying to ridicule Christianity and the Bible. Is there anything on his page that you disagree with?",

   "From the childs link. Thanks for clarifying what spam is and simultaneously proving your claim of what I am doing is NOT spamming. You constantly shoot yourself in the foot since you haven't a clue about what honest debate is.\n What is spam?\n \n Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. Most spam is commercial advertising, often for dubious products, get-rich-quick schemes, or quasi-legal services. Spam costs the sender very little to send -- most of the costs are paid for by the recipient or the carriers rather than by the sender.\n \n There are two main types of spam, and they have different effects on Internet users. Cancellable Usenet spam is a single message sent to 20 or more Usenet newsgroups. (Through long experience, Usenet users have found that any message posted to so many newsgroups is often not relevant to most or all of them.) Usenet spam is aimed at \"lurkers\", people who read newsgroups but rarely or never post and give their address away. Usenet spam robs users of the utility of the newsgroups by overwhelming them with a barrage of advertising or other irrelevant posts. Furthermore, Usenet spam subverts the ability of system administrators and owners to manage the topics they accept on their systems.\n \n Email spam targets individual users with direct mail messages. Email spam lists are often created by scanning Usenet postings, stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the Web for addresses. Email spams typically cost users money out-of-pocket to receive. Many people - anyone with measured phone service - read or receive their mail while the meter is running, so to speak. Spam costs them additional money. On top of that, it costs money for ISPs and online services to transmit spam, and these costs are transmitted directly to subscribers.\n \n One particularly nasty variant of email spam is sending spam to mailing lists (public or private email discussion forums.) Because many mailing lists limit activity to their subscribers, spammers will use automated tools to subscribe to as many mailing lists as possible, so that they can grab the lists of addresses, or use the mailing list as a direct target for their attacks.

   "I don't believe that God considered the Bible to be satisfactory when it was written, only to later become unsatisfactory as man learned more and more about nature.\n\n \n Who said anything about the Bible becoming unsatisfactory? Not me.\n \n But that's because I don't think the purpose of the Bible is to impart truths about nature. It's still quite satisfactory as an expression of spiritual truths.\n \n \nIf we think God is a trickster deity because of what we have recently learned, it may be time to take a look at ourselves.\n\n \n No, no, no. I certainly don't think of God as a trickster deity myself. And I don't think that the idea that he is such a trickster follows from anything we've learned about nature.\n \n But I think that God would indeed be a trickster if literalism is correct: He'd have set up the world to systematically deceive the very power of natural reason that he himself gave us, and that we use succesfully every day.\n \n \nIf we think we can see, and measure distances in terms of hundreds of thousands of light years for example, we may be thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought to think. (Romans 12:3)\n\n \n How does that follow?\n \n Science works. The very medium by which you and I are carrying on this discussion is proof of that.\n \n But science's success doesn't mean God doesn't exist.\n \n \nBecause political descisons are often two-way decisions, and there is often no going back. Some of those political decisions multiply and spread like wildfire throughout a society, making drastic, irreversible changes. I believe the 1947 \"Separation of church and state\" decision did just that, as I believe the recent Dover decision also did.\n\n \n The funny thing is, those who supported the separation of church and state most strongly in the 18th and 19th century were religious believers themselves. They didn't want government interfering with their minority religious views.\n \n Many also thought that a connection between government and religion was even more damaging to religion than to government. I heartily concur.\n \n \nTheir agreement with atheists about creationism is often enough to tip the political scales in the atheists favor, causing ALL Christians to lose yet another battle in the war against God that Henry Morris (or PZ Myers, or Richard Dawkins) makes all too clear.\n\n \n But Marc, it hasn't \"caused ALL Christians\" to lose against atheism. Theistic evolutionists themselves are living proof of that.\n \n \nIf you think separation of church and state and all that goes with it (public display removal of the ten commandments, removal of Christmas displays, removal of public prayer, etc. etc.) are not THREATS to religon, well.........\n\n \n \"Well\" what? Nobody forced my church to take down its public nativity display last year, and the Ten Commandments still hang from our Sunday school classroom walls. So why should I feel threatened in any way?\n \n I see the separation of church and state as no problem whatsoever.\n \n \nThat's fine with me, that's probably actually true with me. I think a right-wing political agenda strengthens Biblical guidelines in how we are supposed to live.\n\n \n I find that sad. The danger in not separating church from state is that not just state but also church will be corrupted.\n \n \nAnd you're not also guilty of that?\n\n \n With all due respect, not on this. I've read various creationist books, by people like Morris and Johnson and Behe. I've read conservative theologians like Grudem and conservative philosophers of religion like Plantinga. I even read the ultra-conservative political pundit like Ann Coulter, and just today I turned on Rush Limbaugh to see what he'd say about the Ricci case getting overturned. I rarely agree with them, but I try to get at least some idea of what they actually say, by actually finding out.\n \n In my professional life (I teach philosophy), I wouldn't get very far if I only read the people I already agreed with. Not only would I not learn anything, my students would sniff out my prejudicial treatment of the ideas in question in a heartbeat. They may not be able to understand philosophical ideas without a helping hand, but they absolutely know b.s. when they smell it.\n \n \nThen there's nothing more for us to discuss on it, and that's fine. But it does nothing to undo my belief that liberalism in politics has close ties with atheism.\n\n \n Were we talking about \"liberalism in politics?\" I thought the contention was about evolution's connection to atheism. But anyway:\n \n \nIt seems like every atheist activist (like Myers, Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Stenger) are politically liberal.\n\n \n Which just goes to show that maybe you should read them instead of jumping to conclusions. Hitchens has some views on military policy that are actually quite right-wing. And although Dawkins is, as far as I know, a left-leaning fellow, many people have criticized his ideas as lending support to the right; this is certainly how Gould saw him.\n \n Personally, I'm not sure that it's particularly helpful to set up oppositions like liberal/conservative or left/right even just as matters of politics. The realities are more complicated than that. It's certainly not helpful to graft additional oppositions like evolution/creation or theism/atheism to one political perspective or another.\n \n \nYou could start a thread on it. [I.e., on considering the way that Biblical literalists inadvertantly drive people away from Christianity and toward atheism.]\n\n \n Or Biblical literalists could start soul-searching on it.\n \n I mean, for pity's sake. On the basis of some conduct readily visible on this board -- not yours, I hasten to add -- I wouldn't want anything to do with Christianity.\n \n \nIt's often possible to do that, yes. I have a copy Stenger's \"How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist\", and amazingly enough, it's filled with what he believes to be scientific evidence that God doesn't exist! Imagine that!\n\n \n What's there to imagine? That is Stenger's view. What does it prove, other than that it's Stenger's view?\n \n \nI also have Ann Coulter's \"How to Talk to a Liberal If You Must.\" Do you think a lot of liberals hurry home with that book, all mystified about what it basically says?\n\n \n Probably not. I read Godless, though. And I have to say, if you want to talk about sheer \"viciousness,\" no one tops her. Absolutely no one. Again, if I thought she were representative of Christian behavior, I would reject Christianity outright.\n \n \nSo you're judging a book by it's cover?\n\n \n No. I'm judging it by having read other books by the same author and having found nothing of redeeming value in them. At this point in my life, I don't see a need to waste any more time on Henry Morris.\n \n \nHow about Pamela Winnick's \"A Jealous God - Science's crusade against religion\"? Is that cover all you need to see, or are you curious about the documented historical facts it may contain?\n\n \n I'll look for it at my library. (That, I should add, is one excellent way to avoid wasting money on things you're worried you won't agree with.)\n \n And I will be very curious about the historical facts it claims to document. On the basis of that curiosity, I will do what I always do: I will see how much slippage there is between facts and interpretations of facts, which is a common mistake that is certainly not unique to any particular political, scientific, or religious perspectives. I will subject any facts that don't jive with what I think I already know to further investigation; after all, it's certainly possible that I've been misinformed. And finally, I will consider whatever opinions she's offering, and whatever arguments she offers in support of her opinions, on their merits.\n \n Same as I would for any other book.\n \n Honestly, I'm not so closed-minded as you seem to think.\n \n \nYes, but you'd simply be wrong. They're not erroneous, because it's documented that they exist. They're stated in black and white...\n\n \n ?!?\n \n How does their existence or clarity mean that they're not wrong?\n \n I have no doubt that Mayr thought this. But I think he was in error. Evolution doesn't entail what he thought it does about religion.\n \n \n...and when they are stated by enough prominent people, they can easily tip the political scalses. If you think they're harmless, then that's your political opinion.\n\n \n Why is that a \"political\" opinion? Mayr's religious view does not follow from his scientific view. I have no doubt that he thought otherwise, but why should I accept his view of the matter?\n \n I'm sure there are other atheists out there to whom this applies as well. Stenger, perhaps Dawkins. So what? I think they're wrong to draw the implications they do.\n \n \nBut it [natural science] sure is a sub-discipline of atheism.\n\n \n Sorry, but no. Natural science does not require one to be an atheist. Which is probably why plenty of natural scientists aren't.\n \n \nAnd that's a big political problem.\n\n \n Whereas I think Biblical literalism is an even bigger religious problem.",

   "But all that complication often comes down to one two way political decision. Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to wonder why the Bible warns against false teaching? It can only be because there are consequences to false teachings. It&#8217;s about deception &#8211; a subject that appears in the Bible several times.\n\n \n Sure. But your repeated \"two way political decision\" statements don't help us decide which way to go, or which side's teachings are false.\n \n \nI&#8217;m not deciding, I&#8217;m simply analyzing what God/Christ have decided.\n\n \n No, Marc, you are making a decision about what you believe God and Christ to have said on the matter, and about why you believe it, and about what the importance of that belief is.\n \n As you yourself say, you're \"analyzing\" what has been said. So acknowledge what your analysis brings to the table.\n \n \nWe can&#8217;t change the truth into something we wish it to be.\n\n \n Indeed we can't. And having realized that the human perspective is thus limited, we should temper whatever truth we claim for our interpretations or \"analyses.\"\n \n \nI don&#8217;t get to tell him what to do.\n\n \n But who's telling God what to do? Interpreting the Bible isn't equivalent to telling God what to do, and I don't think of either conservative or liberal commentators as doing so. They're trying to figure out what God wants for us, and they disagree.\n \n \nIn the U.S. culture war, it is a big problem.\n\n \n And I repeat: Why? Why is it a problem to construe the Bible as expressing spiritual rather than worldly truths?\n \n I mean, come on: Our country's so-called \"culture war\" is a matter of politics, pure and simple. It's about a worldly kingdom, not the kingdom of heaven. And the greatest problem with the culture-war version of Christianity is that its tactics and even its goals are all-too worldy.\n \n Nietzsche is famous for having proclaimed \"God is dead!\" Less well-known is his characterization of God's death as a murder -- and of believers themselves as the murderers.\n \n Think about it.\n \n \nWhat mish-mosh stories do you see being constructed by literalists over these very small details? As far as I know, literalists simply claim these details aren&#8217;t important...\n\n \n Which means, they're not being \"literal.\" They're not paying attention to what the texts actually say.\n \n Personally, I think such details are anything but \"small,\" incidentally. In Mark and Matthew, the crucifixion is presented in terms of abject suffering. In Luke and John, we get a portrait of Christ that is much more serene in the face of his torments. The famous scene in Luke, where the second thief rebukes the first and then repents, whereupon Jesus tells him he'll be saved, is a perfect example.\n \n \n...that different eyewitnesses recorded the basics of what they saw as best they could.\n\n \n Two points need to be addressed here.\n \n First, the Gospels were simply not written by eyewitnesses to the life of Christ. Mark and Luke certainly don't number themselves among the Twelve, and neither these Gospels nor even Matthew ever claims to have been written by an eyewitness. Mark was written in the late 60's AD, Matthew in the early 80's, and Luke in the late 80's (by a Gentile proselyte, to boot). John, the only Gospel to make a claim of authorship by an eyewitness, was also the last Gospel to be written, around 100 give or take a couple years -- rather to late to have been written by an eyewitness.\n \n Second, even if they were recorded by eyewitnesses, \"as best they could\" is utterly incompatible with the notion that the divine inspiration of scripture is guarantee that what the authors wrote is inerrant, which you defend below. When the chips are down, even you aren't interpreting things literally!\n \n \nIt is atheists who focus on these details, and try to use them to say that contradictions, however small, are indicators that the whole story is false!\n\n \n Not so. These difficulties have been known ever since the 18th and 19th centuries, and were first pointed out not by atheists seeking to destroy the faith but by theologians seeking to understand it.\n \n And in any event, I will repeat the point that literal falsity does not imply spiritual falsity.\n \n \nIt seems that atheists and theistic evolutionists inspect and criticise the Bible in exactly the same way, agree politically on just about everything, and claim to have more drastic disagreement on the depth/non existance of faith than do atheists and creationists!\n\n \n I really don't think there's any basis for any of this. I already mentioned politics. When it comes to faith, I think both theistic evolutionists and creationists would disagree with atheists, they just disagree with each other about what sort of faith is truly valuable.\n \n \nThe actual words &#8220;wide gate&#8221;, &#8220;narrow&#8221;, &#8220;deceiver&#8221; &#8220;false teachers&#8221;, &#8220;evil one&#8221; are not my words! The honeyed word &#8220;interpretation&#8221; can only be stretched so far.\n\n \n The problem is, what you want is for those \"actual words\" to admit of only one interpretation, and that will never happen.\n \n \nTwo way political decisions often consist of steps, and that final step is often an easy one to take. Allegorical interpretations open them up to ridicule, and political insignificance.\n\n \n \"Two way political decisions\" again! -sigh-\n \n In any event, here you use the phrase in a \"slippery slope\" argument. And it suffers from the same problem as all slippery slopes: There is no reason why one must take what is here presented as just one more simple step.\n \n \nNumbers are important in politics. They&#8217;re almost always present in political decisions.\n\n \n But again, I thought we were talking about science and religion. You are relentlessly politicizing, my friend!\n \n In any event, here's a hunch. Total up the number of books sold since 1950 that explain evolution to a lay scientific audience, and those that promote atheism. Then total up books sold since 1950 that explain Christian ideas to non-clergy, and those that criticize evolution and/or atheism. My guess is that while some of the individual books in the first group might outsell most individual books in the second, the overall figures for the second group will be greater than those in the first. And it won't even be close.\n \n Just a hunch. I dont have clue one about where I'd find some reliable figures. Any ideas? And what do you think of the hunch?\n \n \nNot inconsequential, but non-existant. The divine inspiration was that strong.\n\n \n And that's exactly what I don't think is at all plausible. Divine inspiration doesn't eliminate the possibility of human error. After all, if it did, the inconsistencies in detail that you yourself acknowledged above wouldn't happen in the first place.\n \n You can't have it both ways, Marc. You can't say that divine inspiration is so strong it makes human prejudices and fallibility non-existent on the one hand, but then dismiss contradictions between the Gospel accounts as people doing \"the best they could\" on the other.\n \n \nOh the irony &#8211; those who ride the fence between the two distinct positions of atheism and creationism are the ones that make things easy on themselves. Atheists don't ridicule and attack you.\n\n \n I can speak only for myself, but it's true, I generally have not been subjected to ridicule or attack by atheists. At least not personally, in the overwhelming majority of cases. On the other hand, my ideas have certainly been criticized by atheists many times (admittedly not much on this board). Perhaps they don't personally attack me because I don't personally attack them?...\n \n I have, however, received some blisteringly personal attacks from fellow \"Christians.\" I've been called an atheist, and that's a rather kind name for it. On this very board, I've had people inform me that I have no relationship with God or Christ.\n \n By our deeds are we known. Many of the atheists I know are more Christian than all-too many of the Christians....\n \n \nI realize that that&#8217;s [i.e., that 2nd Timothy was not authored by Paul] an atheist claim.\n \n July 2008 Ask an Atheist\n \n This guy claims that the &#8220;majority&#8221; of Bible scholars don&#8217;t believe Paul wrote 1st and 2nd Timothy. There must be a lot of atheist (and Muslim) Bible scholars. He&#8217;s obviously trying to ridicule Christianity and the Bible. Is there anything on his page that you disagree with?\n\n \n In terms of the linguistics? Nope. In terms of \"literalists\" misinterpreting one of their own favorite verses? Nope.\n \n But in terms of his goals? Yes, I find something to disagree with, since I'm not an atheist.\n \n And like it or not, the majority of Christian Bible scholars do think that the letters to Timothy were not written by Paul. In the case of 2nd Timothy, you can at least make a case that the author knew Paul. But in the case of 1st Timothy, the church structure described simply didn't exist during Paul's lifetime.\n \n Perhaps not the majority of scholars at schools and seminaries run by \"religious conservatives\" or \"Biblical literalists,\" I suppose. But this view of the letters is hardly new, and you can find it being taught to future clergymen and future scholars all across the country and all across the world, every day. They generally find that their faith is not shattered by the information.\n \n There's certainly no reason why they should.",

   "Who said anything about the Bible becoming unsatisfactory? Not me. \n\n \n You seem to claim that it's less satisfactory than \"literalists\" do, because you interpret it much more loosely. It begins with \"In the beginning God created\" - the evolutionary concept simply does not follow those words. Isn't it your claim that was fine in the old days before Darwin, yet now it needn't be taken as seriously because of what we now know? \n \n \nBut that's because I don't think the purpose of the Bible is to impart truths about nature. It's still quite satisfactory as an expression of spiritual truths. \n\n \n If the Bible isn't about nature, then the scientific community alone gets to make statements about nature, and it makes biological statements about behavior characteristics, so it becomes the sole authority on human nature. Abortion? - no problem. Gay marriage? - no problem. The sacrifice of human interests for microscopic animals? - no problem. There's more to the Bible than personal spirituality. \n \n \nScience works. The very medium by which you and I are carrying on this discussion is proof of that. \n\n \n The medium by which we're carrying on this discussion is dependent upon science, not philosophy about billions of years, or thousands of light years. Exactly where the science/philosophy line is drawn cannot be defined to everyone's satisfaction, as can't the importance of how speculations of the past relate to scientific accomplishments of today. \n \n \nThe funny thing is, those who supported the separation of church and state most strongly in the 18th and 19th century were religious believers themselves. They didn't want government interfering with their minority religious views. \n \n Many also thought that a connection between government and religion was even more damaging to religion than to government. I heartily concur. \n\n \n That could have been true in the 18th and 19th century, but it's not true today. Practically all those who support separation of church and state today are the non-religious. Since the religious who DO support separation of church and state basically agree politically with the non religious, it is legitimate to question their religious sincerity. \n \n \nBut Marc, it hasn't \"caused ALL Christians\" to lose against atheism. Theistic evolutionists themselves are living proof of that. \n\n \n Yes it has - the sincere theistic evolutionists have lost too. Sincere theistic evolutionists are so uneducated about Christianity, they just don't realize it yet. Of course the phony theistic evolutionists win big. Militant atheism needs their help, and it's logical that some atheists masquerade as theistic evolutionists. Do you deny the possibility of their existance? \n \n \n\"Well\" what? Nobody forced my church to take down its public nativity display last year, and the Ten Commandments still hang from our Sunday school classroom walls. So why should I feel threatened in any way? \n\n \n What can churches accomplish if they are limited within their walls? \n \n \nI see the separation of church and state as no problem whatsoever. \n\n \n Christ's teachings were about influencing the world, not just about a closet relationship with him. If the ethics of the state aren't religious, in many cases they have to be non-religious. There is often little middle \"secular\" ground. Legalized gambling is a good example. Either it does exist in a defined area, or it doesn't. \n \n \nWith all due respect, not on this. I've read various creationist books, by people like Morris and Johnson and Behe. I've read conservative theologians like Grudem and conservative philosophers of religion like Plantinga. I even read the ultra-conservative political pundit like Ann Coulter, and just today I turned on Rush Limbaugh to see what he'd say about the Ricci case getting overturned. I rarely agree with them, but I try to get at least some idea of what they actually say, by actually finding out.\n \n In my professional life (I teach philosophy), I wouldn't get very far if I only read the people I already agreed with. Not only would I not learn anything, my students would sniff out my prejudicial treatment of the ideas in question in a heartbeat. They may not be able to understand philosophical ideas without a helping hand, but they absolutely know b.s. when they smell it. \n\n \n What ages are your students? Have you directed their attention to this discussion you and I are having? :)\n \n \nWere we talking about \"liberalism in politics?\" I thought the contention was about evolution's connection to atheism. But anyway:\n\n \n Evolution, atheism, creationism, it's always about the politics. If this were about nothing but private, personal beliefs, there would be little, if any controversy. It's always about how society is influenced, the culture war, the money. \n \n \nWhich just goes to show that maybe you should read them instead of jumping to conclusions. Hitchens has some views on military policy that are actually quite right-wing. And although Dawkins is, as far as I know, a left-leaning fellow, many people have criticized his ideas as lending support to the right; this is certainly how Gould saw him.\n \n Personally, I'm not sure that it's particularly helpful to set up oppositions like liberal/conservative or left/right even just as matters of politics. The realities are more complicated than that. It's certainly not helpful to graft additional oppositions like evolution/creation or theism/atheism to one political perspective or another. \n\n \n I'm not grafting them like that - they are grafted like that. Thomas Sowell wrote a book called A conflict of visions - ever hear of it? He leaves religion out of it - he's not a direct religion advocate. He divides the distinct liberal /conservative, left/right positions as constrained vs unconstrained visions. I'll attempt to sum up what he says in a few paragraphs, though it's largely impossible to do, and I might even screw it up! But I think the constrained vision goes along with creationism, and the unconstrained vision goes along with both atheism and theistic evolution. Unconstrained follows the change-aspect of evolution - that there is an untapped, never ending potential of human beings - that man is perfectable, \"meaning continually improvable rather than capable of actually reaching absolute perfection\". A constrained vision doesn't see human nature as something that could or should be changed (or evolved), but only how moral and social benefits desired can be produced within that constraint - that constraint (IMO) being the unchangable sinful nature of humans, and the unchanging God of the Bible. \n \n That is where the political divide is - it's what separates \"fundamentalists\" from the unification of atheists and theistic evolutionists. \n \n I recommend that book far more than Winnick's. \n \n \nOr Biblical literalists could start soul-searching on it. \n\n \n I already have - the unconstrained vision requires elite leaders to a much larger extent than the constrained one does. BIG GOVERNMENT. It's been made to look very attractive. The dreams of that have been made to look more attractive than have the constraints of Biblical \"literalism\". \n \n \nI mean, for pity's sake. On the basis of some conduct readily visible on this board -- not yours, I hasten to add -- I wouldn't want anything to do with Christianity. \n\n \n Uh-oh, I thought you were a Christian. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \nWhat's there to imagine? That is Stenger's view. What does it prove, other than that it's Stenger's view? \n\n \n We were talking about judging books by their covers. Most people don't form political opinions (or worldviews, in the case of young people) by detailed readings of several books. Quick, drive-by glances in their everyday lives are the important things. I guarantee Stenger's title of his book has had more influence than its more detailed contents. \n \n \nProbably not. I read Godless, though. And I have to say, if you want to talk about sheer \"viciousness,\" no one tops her. Absolutely no one. Again, if I thought she were representative of Christian behavior, I would reject Christianity outright. \n\n \n I don't know about that, I guess it's dependent on ones point of view. I don't think Coulter has unleashed viciousness on anyone to the extent that Bush 43 or Limbaugh have been on the receiving end of it. I believe they've had slow deaths wished upon them, though it's hard to pinpoint just who says it. But I've seen/heard Dawkins, Ed Shultz, James Carvillle, Janeane Garofalo say some pretty vicious things. \n \n \nNo. I'm judging it by having read other books by the same author and having found nothing of redeeming value in them. At this point in my life, I don't see a need to waste any more time on Henry Morris. \n\n \n I don't think it takes the reading of an entire book to see where someone's coming from. A few minutes of Richard Dawkins on a youtube video or the movie \"Expelled\" can be enough for me. \n \n \nOriginally posted by Matthew] Am I allowed to point out that I think -- and that Miller thinks -- such extrapolations are erroneous? \n\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] Yes, but you'd simply be wrong. They're not erroneous, because it's documented that they exist. They're stated in black and white...\n \n \n \n?!?\n \n How does their existence or clarity mean that they're not wrong?\n \n I have no doubt that Mayr thought this. But I think he was in error. Evolution doesn't entail what he thought it does about religion.\n \n \n \n Why is that a \"political\" opinion? Mayr's religious view does not follow from his scientific view. I have no doubt that he thought otherwise, but why should I accept his view of the matter?\n \n I'm sure there are other atheists out there to whom this applies as well. Stenger, perhaps Dawkins. So what? I think they're wrong to draw the implications they do. \n\n \n A lack of strong oppostion can be practically an acceptance of it, when the only two choices are constrained vs unconstrained. \n \n \n Originally posted by Matthew] Natural science is not a sub-discipline of theology. \n\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] But it [natural science] sure is a sub-discipline of atheism. \n\n \n \nSorry, but no. Natural science does not require one to be an atheist. Which is probably why plenty of natural scientists aren't. \n\n \n But atheism requires natural science - to be intellectually fullfiled. Natural science is the sub - it does not have the requirements that the worldview (theism/atheism) does.",

   "Sure. But your repeated \"two way political decision\" statements don't help us decide which way to go, or which side's teachings are false. \n\n \n But it can weed out the fuzzy middle ground, something that both sides often try to appeal to. \n \n \nNo, Marc, you are making a decision about what you believe God and Christ to have said on the matter, and about why you believe it, and about what the importance of that belief is.\n \n As you yourself say, you're \"analyzing\" what has been said. So acknowledge what your analysis brings to the table. \n\n \n When something is being analzyed/interpreted, the actual text of what is being analyzed is very important. If two people are analyzing the statement \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\", person A can go into detail about how much effort he believes the fox put into it's leg muscles to accomplish this. If person B then says \"There was no fox involved\", then that person's interpretation skill or honesty has to be questioned. Those who actually know Christianity tend to wonder about theistic evolutionists just like they would wonder about person B above. I'm not trying to be offensive, but someone very similar to person B was who I saw in the author of \"Finding Darwin's God\".\n \n \nAnd I repeat: Why? Why is it a problem to construe the Bible as expressing spiritual rather than worldly truths?\n \n I mean, come on: Our country's so-called \"culture war\" is a matter of politics, pure and simple. It's about a worldly kingdom, not the kingdom of heaven. And the greatest problem with the culture-war version of Christianity is that its tactics and even its goals are all-too worldy.\n \n Nietzsche is famous for having proclaimed \"God is dead!\" Less well-known is his characterization of God's death as a murder -- and of believers themselves as the murderers.\n \n Think about it. \n\n \n So you're saying Christianity shouldn't be involved in worldliness? Traditional Christian morals are already involved in a lot of political issues, and if they're taken away, we'll have a radically different society than what we have now. \n \n \nTwo points need to be addressed here.\n \n First, the Gospels were simply not written by eyewitnesses to the life of Christ. Mark and Luke certainly don't number themselves among the Twelve, and neither these Gospels nor even Matthew ever claims to have been written by an eyewitness. Mark was written in the late 60's AD, Matthew in the early 80's, and Luke in the late 80's (by a Gentile proselyte, to boot). John, the only Gospel to make a claim of authorship by an eyewitness, was also the last Gospel to be written, around 100 give or take a couple years -- rather to late to have been written by an eyewitness.\n \n Second, even if they were recorded by eyewitnesses, \"as best they could\" is utterly incompatible with the notion that the divine inspiration of scripture is guarantee that what the authors wrote is inerrant, which you defend below. When the chips are down, even you aren't interpreting things literally! \n\n \n I was a little too brief and careless in making my point. The Gospels were the result of eyewitness accounts, as compiled by the authors. So there were many more than 4 eyewitnessis, with a lot of different times and circumstances involved in compiling it all. \n \n If a \"myth\" is being put forward, it only makes sense that the person or persons doing it are going to try to make every detail match perfectly, or to make the story as complete as possible. If the gospels all matched perfectly, if every year of Jesus' life was detailed thoroughly, to me it would make Christianity less believable. (there are practically no records of Jesus' life from age 12 to age 30) If there were no gaps or questions, it would appear that a person or persons had one organized attempt to put forward a myth. Christianity clearly has no defined earthly organization. The 66 book Bible didn't come together by any defined organization, except God's. \n \n \n\"Two way political decisions\" again! -sigh-\n \n In any event, here you use the phrase in a \"slippery slope\" argument. And it suffers from the same problem as all slippery slopes: There is no reason why one must take what is here presented as just one more simple step. \n\n \n Slippery slopes never have to occur, but the likelihood of their occurance is often strong enough that the \"have too\" occurance is practically a given. History clearly shows us that. \n \n \nBut again, I thought we were talking about science and religion. You are relentlessly politicizing, my friend! \n\n \n Politics is all there is to it! :)\n \n \nIn any event, here's a hunch. Total up the number of books sold since 1950 that explain evolution to a lay scientific audience, and those that promote atheism. Then total up books sold since 1950 that explain Christian ideas to non-clergy, and those that criticize evolution and/or atheism. My guess is that while some of the individual books in the first group might outsell most individual books in the second, the overall figures for the second group will be greater than those in the first. And it won't even be close.\n \n Just a hunch. I dont have clue one about where I'd find some reliable figures. Any ideas? And what do you think of the hunch? \n\n \n I don't know where to find figures on it either. I'm sure you'd be right if the years were 1950 to 1970, or 1950 to 1985. After that, I'd say there'd be a pretty drastic shift. The logical emergence of ID (a search for design, not a designer) coupled with the continuing inability of the scientific community to explain the origin of the simplest forms of life, has caused the evolution/atheist books/promotion to drastically increase. The most recent promotions are the ones most relevent to current thinking. (politics emoticon_xangel )\n \n \nAnd that's exactly what I don't think is at all plausible. Divine inspiration doesn't eliminate the possibility of human error. After all, if it did, the inconsistencies in detail that you yourself acknowledged above wouldn't happen in the first place.\n \n You can't have it both ways, Marc. You can't say that divine inspiration is so strong it makes human prejudices and fallibility non-existent on the one hand, but then dismiss contradictions between the Gospel accounts as people doing \"the best they could\" on the other. \n\n \n I don't claim to completely understand it - I don't think anyone can. There are measures of faith in all beliefs. Mine, yours, and atheists too. \n \n \nI can speak only for myself, but it's true, I generally have not been subjected to ridicule or attack by atheists. At least not personally, in the overwhelming majority of cases. On the other hand, my ideas have certainly been criticized by atheists many times (admittedly not much on this board). Perhaps they don't personally attack me because I don't personally attack them?...\n\n \n You don't have to personally attack some atheists to be personally attacked by them at 4forums, trust me. \n \n \nI have, however, received some blisteringly personal attacks from fellow \"Christians.\" I've been called an atheist, and that's a rather kind name for it. On this very board, I've had people inform me that I have no relationship with God or Christ.\n \n By our deeds are we known. Many of the atheists I know are more Christian than all-too many of the Christians....\n\n \n It is a confusing world - some Christians I want nothing to do with, and I know some atheists who are very nice people. Too many people make the mistake of judging Christianity on that, or I should say, making it (actions of people) a central issue of Christianity. It's not central, Christ and his word are central. \n \n \nIn terms of the linguistics? Nope. In terms of \"literalists\" misinterpreting one of their own favorite verses? Nope.\n \n But in terms of his goals? Yes, I find something to disagree with, since I'm not an atheist.\n \n And like it or not, the majority of Christian Bible scholars do think that the letters to Timothy were not written by Paul. In the case of 2nd Timothy, you can at least make a case that the author knew Paul. But in the case of 1st Timothy, the church structure described simply didn't exist during Paul's lifetime.\n \n Perhaps not the majority of scholars at schools and seminaries run by \"religious conservatives\" or \"Biblical literalists,\" I suppose. But this view of the letters is hardly new, and you can find it being taught to future clergymen and future scholars all across the country and all across the world, every day. They generally find that their faith is not shattered by the information.\n\n \n I'm a religious conservative, and I think liberal interpretations and ideas are dangerous. Why that is, should be clear in my opinions about politics, slippery slopes, etc.",

   "You seem to claim that it's less satisfactory than \"literalists\" do, because you interpret it much more loosely.\n\n \n To repeat, I don't claim the Bible is any less satisfactory in terms of spiritual truths.\n \n As far as interpreting it loosely, my view is that it is \"literalists\" -- i.e., so-called \"literalists,\" for which reason I'm glad you used the scare quotes! -- are the ones whose interpretation is loose. In my experience, they are incredibly dismissive of any textual inconsistencies, know next to nothing about the history of either the texts or the church, and lift passages out of their context routinely.\n \n \nIt begins with \"In the beginning God created\" - the evolutionary concept simply does not follow those words.\n\n \n So what? The Bible also nowhere claims that water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. And yet, whether one is a Christian or an atheist or anything else besides, water is made of hydrogen and oxygen.\n \n Evolution is compatible with atheism (at least the non-science-denying varieties). And evolution is also compatible with Christianity (at least the non-science-denying varieites).\n \n If you want to launch a general assault on the viability of science itself, okay -- and it's for this reason, incidentally, that I think conservative Christians have ironically adopted the same epistemology as the very postmodern relativists they decry. But in that event, there are bigger problems.\n \n \nIsn't it your claim that was fine in the old days before Darwin, yet now it needn't be taken as seriously because of what we now know?\n\n \n If you can show me where I claimed that, let me know.\n \n What I would actually claim is that even most of the earliest interpreters of scripture, both Christians of the first few centuries AD and Jews long before that, did not interpret the text literally either. This claim has the virtue of being true.\n \n Moreover, to repeat yet again, I do not think the spiritual message has become any less serious than ever.\n \n \nIf the Bible isn't about nature, then the scientific community alone gets to make statements about nature, and it makes biological statements about behavior characteristics, so it becomes the sole authority on human nature. Abortion? - no problem. Gay marriage? - no problem. The sacrifice of human interests for microscopic animals? - no problem. There's more to the Bible than personal spirituality.\n\n \n And yet, abortion, gay mariage, and conservation do not follow from anything about evolution. You are committing the \"naturalistic fallacy\" here.\n \n I will happily admit that there are biologists who are also guilty of this fallacy. They, like you, are wrong.\n \n Biology can tell us what the natural basis is for such behaviors. It cannot tell us whether we ought to condone them, morally or legally.\n \n \nThe medium by which we're carrying on this discussion is dependent upon science, not philosophy about billions of years, or thousands of light years.\n\n \n And yet, the reasoning is the same in both cases. Whether designing a microchip or figuring out the age of the universe, one makes an inference based on empirical evidence.\n \n \nThat could have been true in the 18th and 19th century, but it's not true today. Practically all those who support separation of church and state today are the non-religious.\n\n \n That's simply not true. At politically moderate and liberal congregations all over the country, you can find strong support for the separation of church and state.\n \n \nSince the religious who DO support separation of church and state basically agree politically with the non religious, it is legitimate to question their religious sincerity.\n\n \n And I'm sorry, Marc, but that's where I think you are really crossing the lines of fairness in debate. You are legitimizing charges of guilt by association.\n \n There are non-religious supporters of any number of right-wing causes out there. Shall I question your religious sincerity because you agree with these non-religious people?\n \n \nSincere theistic evolutionists are so uneducated about Christianity, they just don't realize it yet.\n\n \n Give me a break. In my experience, the majority -- the majority -- of Biblical \"literalists\" know diddly squat about their own religion. They don't know its history, or the history of its holy book. They don't even possess detailed knowledge of what the book says.\n \n \nOf course the phony theistic evolutionists win big. Militant atheism needs their help, and it's logical that some atheists masquerade as theistic evolutionists. Do you deny the possibility of their existance?\n\n \n Marc, anything is possible. But you have provided absolutely no evidence that any theistic evolutionist is anything but a believer. All you're doing is casting innuendo.\n \n As I noted in an earlier post, I think you've poisoned the well. You simply don't accept their sincerity, so anything they could say to demonstrate their sincerity is just more evidence of how deceitful they are.\n \n \nWhat can churches accomplish if they are limited within their walls?\n\n \n Who said anything about limiting churches to what goes on inside them? They can gather outside their walls, their members can evangelize in any peaceable manner they say fit, they can make outreaches to their whole communities, you name it.\n \n I merely used the public display issues you provided. Because I do think it is entirely inappropriate for governments to promote religion that way. But if religions want to promote religion, that's fine. Indeed, that's protected by the First Amendment.\n \n \nChrist's teachings were about influencing the world, not just about a closet relationship with him. If the ethics of the state aren't religious, in many cases they have to be non-religious. There is often little middle \"secular\" ground.\n\n \n On the contrary, I would say there is often a great deal of middle ground between secular and religious approaches to ethics. \"Non-religious\" isn't equivalent to \"anti-religious.\"\n \n \nLegalized gambling is a good example. Either it does exist in a defined area, or it doesn't.\n\n \n In my own community, this has been a much debated topic of late. I know religious people and non-religious people who oppose it. I also know non-religious people and religious people who support it.\n \n On matters of widespread moral agreement, both the religious and the non-religious tend to agree. Meanwhile, on matters of hotly contested disagreement, there religious and non-religious advocates on all sides. So what?\n \n \nEvolution, atheism, creationism, it's always about the politics.... It's always about how society is influenced, the culture war, the money.\n\n \n Not so. There are also matters of truth to consider. And the truth -- whether scientific or metaphysical -- is not determined by society or money..\n \n \nI'm not grafting them like that - they are grafted like that. Thomas Sowell wrote a book called A conflict of visions - ever hear of it?\n\n \n No. I've read many of his columns before, though, and have never been impressed by the quality of his reasoning.\n \n \nHe leaves religion out of it - he's not a direct religion advocate.\n\n \n So he's an indirect religion advocate? Hm.\n \n \nHe divides the distinct liberal /conservative, left/right positions as constrained vs unconstrained visions. I'll attempt to sum up what he says in a few paragraphs, though it's largely impossible to do, and I might even screw it up! But I think the constrained vision goes along with creationism, and the unconstrained vision goes along with both atheism and theistic evolution.

It's not an unconditional constraint, perhaps, but it's extremely strong.\n \n Attempts to divide up the world into opposed categories like liberal/conservative, left/right, constrained/unconstrained typically fail miserably. Reality is more complicated than that.\n \n \nI already have - the unconstrained vision requires elite leaders to a much larger extent than the constrained one does. BIG GOVERNMENT. It's been made to look very attractive. The dreams of that have been made to look more attractive than have the constraints of Biblical \"literalism\".\n\n \n What constraints? Biblical \"literalism\" makes up its own version of the Bible to affirm \"literally.\" No constraints whatsoever.\n \n Meanwhile, forgvie me if I find the idea that \"the unconstrained vision requires elite leaders to a much larger extent than the constrained one does\" a bit silly. When I see various conservative televangelists whipping up stadium-sized crowds, I think it's pretty clear that the crowd is more than happy to put itself in the hands of \"elite\" leaders.\n \n \nUh-oh, I thought you were a Christian.\n\n \n I was just hinting that I find a great deal of behavior by self-professed \"Christians\" on this board to be utterly antithetical to Christian ethics.\n \n \nI don't know about that, I guess it's dependent on ones point of view. I don't think Coulter has unleashed viciousness on anyone to the extent that Bush 43 or Limbaugh have been on the receiving end of it.\n\n \n Give me a break. Coulter once mocked pro-choice doctors' use of terms by saying that someone should \"perform a procedure with a rifle\" on one of them. Viciousness. I truly cannot think of any conservative pundit I find more offensive to basic decency, or who I take as less indicative of Christian ethics.\n \n Which is saying something, considering that Limbagh once referred to Chelsea Clinton as \"the White House dog.\"\n \n \nI believe they've had slow deaths wished upon them, though it's hard to pinpoint just who says it.\n\n \n If such things have been wished upon them, that too is deserving of condemnation.\n \n \nBut I've seen/heard Dawkins, Ed Shultz, James Carvillle, Janeane Garofalo say some pretty vicious things.\n\n \n Which excuses what, exactly?

   "Matthew", 
   "Had a few minutes this morning, so I decided to respond to the second post in full. Hopefully I won't lose this one. (I've deleted the brief response I made following the loss of the original post last night.)\n \n \nBut it can weed out the fuzzy middle ground, something that both sides often try to appeal to.\n\n \n And I think the irony is, it's the black-and-white, no-middle-ground view that exemplifies \"fuzzy\" thinking. It simply pretends there are no complexities of whatever sort would conflict with its worldview.\n \n \nWhen something is being analzyed/interpreted, the actual text of what is being analyzed is very important.\n\n \n I agree! And this is precisely why I find \"literalism\" ridiculous: it does not pay attention to what it claims to analyze and interpret. Confronted with inconsistencies in the text, it simply ignores them, dismisses them, declares them insoluble mysteries, continues to affirm something other than \"the actual text\" as \"literally\" true.\n \n The better to serve various earthly masters, I think, but more on that in a minute.\n \n \nIf two people are analyzing the statement &#8220;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&#8221;, person A can go into detail about how much effort he believes the fox put into it&#8217;s leg muscles to accomplish this. If person B then says &#8220;There was no fox involved&#8221;, then that person&#8217;s interpretation skill or honesty has to be questioned. Those who actually know Christianity tend to wonder about theistic evolutionists just like they would wonder about person B above. I&#8217;m not trying to be offensive, but someone very similar to person B was who I saw in the author of &#8220;Finding Darwin&#8217;s God&#8221;.\n\n \n And I think that when someone decides to dismiss inconsistencies, it is his \"interpretation skill\" that must be questioned.\n \n \nSo you&#8217;re saying Christianity shouldn&#8217;t be involved in worldliness?\n\n \n No, I'm saying that worldliness has utterly corrupted the church in its \"Christian conservative\" mode. It's become a tool for worldly power, nothing more.\n \n \nTraditional Christian morals are already involved in a lot of political issues, and if they&#8217;re taken away, we&#8217;ll have a radically different society than what we have now.\n\n \n The hypocrisy, intolerance, and authoritarianism shown by conservatively politicized Christianity has itself done severe damage to traditional Christian morals. If society becomes \"radically different\" due to a depoliticization of the church, I think that might well be a good thing. And a good thing for the church itself.\n \n \nI was a little too brief and careless in making my point. The Gospels were the result of eyewitness accounts, as compiled by the authors. So there were many more than 4 eyewitnessis, with a lot of different times and circumstances involved in compiling it all.\n\n \n Sorry but this still doesn't cut the mustard. The Gospels were not eyewitness accounts, nor were they compilations of eyewitness accounts. If you think otherwise, present your evidence.\n \n On the other hand, you could try to open yourself up to some new perspectives on the text. Check out John Shelby Spong's Liberating the Gospels. He examines the liturgical, not biographical, motivations of the authors of the synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew, and Luke). Extremely illuminating.\n \n But he's a liberal and a non-literalist, of course.\n \n \nIf a &#8220;myth&#8221; is being put forward, it only makes sense that the person or persons doing it are going to try to make every detail match perfectly, or to make the story as complete as possible. If the gospels all matched perfectly, if every year of Jesus&#8217; life was detailed thoroughly, to me it would make Christianity less believable. (there are practically no records of Jesus&#8217; life from age 12 to age 30) If there were no gaps or questions, it would appear that a person or persons had one organized attempt to put forward a myth. Christianity clearly has no defined earthly organization. The 66 book Bible didn&#8217;t come together by any defined organization, except God&#8217;s.\n\n \n So it's more compelling because of the inconsistencies?!? \"I'm not trying to be offensive,\" Marc, but that makes no sense.\n \n Keep in mind, the issue is not just gaps or questions. There are outright contradictions between the different Gospel accounts. Try as you might, there is simply no way to reconcile that with your earlier claim -- a claim that's representative of the Biblical \"literalist\" view in general -- that the Biblical authors' divine inspiration renders their accounts infallible.\n \n That's the real problem with the \"literalism.\" It's they who turn the Bible into nonsense, not the non-literalists.\n \n \nSlippery slopes never have to occur, but the likelihood of their occurance is often strong enough that the &#8220;have too&#8221; occurance is practically a given. History clearly shows us that.\n\n \n On the contrary, \"history clearly shows us that\" there's nothing \"given\" about them. The very fact that so many interpreters of the Bible have understood the text allegorically, while nonetheless continuing to believe, continuing to practice, continuing to affirm theism in word and in deed, is a refutation of your claim.\n \n \nPolitics is all there is to it!\n\n \n Exactly my point! For conservative Christianity, politics really is \"all there is to it.\" Power in this world is the end, and the religious interpretation is nothing more than a useful means. The damage thereby done to the church by the very religious conservatives who claim to support it cannot be overestimated.\n \n \nI don&#8217;t claim to completely understand it - I don't think anyone can. There are measures of faith in all beliefs. Mine, yours, and atheists too.\n\n \n Affirming manifest contradictions is not a \"measure of faith.\" The reason why it can't be understood, completely or even minimally, is that such a view is antithetical to our God-given power of reason itself.\n \n \nIt is a confusing world &#8211; some Christians I want nothing to do with, and I know some atheists who are very nice people. Too many people make the mistake of judging Christianity on that, or I should say, making it (actions of people) a central issue of Christianity. It&#8217;s not central, Christ and his word are central.\n\n \n Jesus criticizes hypocrisy throughout the Gospels, so I'd say it's a rather central notion. When prominent Christians behave so hypocritically, it's only natural that non-Christians would question whether they really believe what they say. And when that hypocrisy is coupled to do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do authoritarianism in politics, it's hardly surprising that non-Christians find Christianity unattractive.\n \n More emphasis on an ethics of love for the entire brotherhood of man as children of God. Less emphasis on using government and law to impose the behavioral requirements of particular interpretations of Christianity on those who don't share them. That is how to help the faith these days.\n \n \nI&#8217;m a religious conservative, and I think liberal interpretations and ideas are dangerous.\n\n \n And I think it's the conservative positions that have become dangerous, not just to government, but to religion itself.\n \n Perhaps, as I noted earlier, there really is nothing more to say.",

   "To repeat, I don't claim the Bible is any less satisfactory in terms of spiritual truths.\n \n As far as interpreting it loosely, my view is that it is \"literalists\" -- i.e., so-called \"literalists,\" for which reason I'm glad you used the scare quotes! -- are the ones whose interpretation is loose. In my experience, they are incredibly dismissive of any textual inconsistencies, know next to nothing about the history of either the texts or the church, and lift passages out of their context routinely. \n\n \n What is it that theistic evolutionists try to accomplish with their scrutiny of \"textual inconsistencies\"? An opposition to literalists, and an alliance with atheists? \n \n It's clear that most theistic evolutionists find literalists to be a greater threat to their earthly lifestyle than they do atheists. \n \n \nSo what? The Bible also nowhere claims that water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. And yet, whether one is a Christian or an atheist or anything else besides, water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. \n\n \n You don't seem to be thinking about different levels of importance of scriptural text. The words \"in the beginning God created\" is more general, more central, more important than the details of, for example, the conflict of accounts of the two theives hurling insults at Jesus vs only one. \n \n \nEvolution is compatible with atheism (at least the non-science-denying varieties). And evolution is also compatible with Christianity (at least the non-science-denying varieites).\n \n If you want to launch a general assault on the viability of science itself, okay -- and it's for this reason, incidentally, that I think conservative Christians have ironically adopted the same epistemology as the very postmodern relativists they decry. But in that event, there are bigger problems. \n\n \n \n NOT AN ASSUALT ON SCIENCE, BUT A QUESTIONING OF SCIENTISTS. A questioning of the scientific community as a group. \n \n The \"assault on science\" straw man is always built by atheists and theistic evolutionists alike, and it never matters how clear the truth is made. If there's one \"same old line re-hashed time and again\" thing in creation / evolution debates, that's it - that anyone who's not a Geneis disregarding evolutionist is anti-science. \n \n I wish that could be settled once and for all, but it never is. It won't be any time at all before, somewhere on these forums, a creationist will be accused of being anti-science. It's emotioal, it can be politically helpful, but it's always dishonest. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] Isn't it your claim that was fine in the old days before Darwin, yet now it needn't be taken as seriously because of what we now know? \n\n \n \nIf you can show me where I claimed that, let me know. \n\n \n I may be confusing you with Miller, but you've given no indication that you disagree with him on much of anything. From page 257 of 'Finding Darwin's God';\n \n \nIn order to reveal himself to a desert tribe six thousand years ago, a Creator could hardly have lectured them about DNA and RNA, about gene duplication and allopatric speciation. Instead, knowing exactly what they would understand, He spoke to them in the direct and lyrical language of Genesis. \n\n \n The obvious implication of theistic evolution is that things have changed (evolved) now, that the Bible is to be looked at in a different light now that we know so many scientific things. \n \n \nWhat I would actually claim is that even most of the earliest interpreters of scripture, both Christians of the first few centuries AD and Jews long before that, did not interpret the text literally either. This claim has the virtue of being true. \n\n \n If that were true, the original manuscripts would have been lost/disregarded/rewritten to the extent that King James wouldn't have had anything to work with some 1500 years later. \n \n \nMoreover, to repeat yet again, I do not think the spiritual message has become any less serious than ever. \n\n \n So a lack of literalism does not sacrifice seriousness? It is less serious if it is increasingly disregarded in the political realm. \n \n \nAnd yet, abortion, gay mariage, and conservation do not follow from anything about evolution. You are committing the \"naturalistic fallacy\" here.\n \n I will happily admit that there are biologists who are also guilty of this fallacy. They, like you, are wrong.\n \n Biology can tell us what the natural basis is for such behaviors. It cannot tell us whether we ought to condone them, morally or legally. \n\n \n Sorry, but it can and does. Scientific \"Natural basis for behaviors\" can get legitimate consideration in courts of law. If you tell me that it doesn't, or it doesn't to any noticable degree, there's no question that getting it there is one of the strongest political desires of the activist atheist community. And theistic evolutionists don't seem to mind. \n \n \nAs I noted in an earlier post, I think you've poisoned the well. You simply don't accept their sincerity, so anything they could say to demonstrate their sincerity is just more evidence of how deceitful they are.\n\n \n That goes both ways of course - you seem very dismissive of anything a \"literalist\" would say. \n \n \nNo. I've read many of his columns before, though, and have never been impressed by the quality of his reasoning. \n\n \n I'm not surprised. Here's how the book starts;\n \n \nOne of the curious things about political opinions is how often the same people line up on opposite sides of different issues. The issues themselves may have no intrinsic connection with each other. The may range from military spending to drug laws to monetary policy to education. Yet the same familiar faces can be found glaring at each other from opposite sides of the political fence again and again. \n\n \n As you've pointed out, there are exceptions to the rule, but that doesn't stop it from being the rule. Evolution seems to be one of the strongest political uniters of today. The gradualism, chance, long periods of time, purposelessness, etc. really seem to bring people together on how people should relate to each other. The unconstrained vision - never ending change. \n \n \nSo he's an indirect religion advocate? Hm. \n\n \n He leaves religion out of it. It's possible to do that with the terms constrained / unconstrained. I'm really surprised the terms aren't used more often in political discussions. Without them, liberals/evolutionists often have the advantage of labeling a constrained view of politics as religious, therefore requiring it to be kept separate (or eliminated) from state. A defined view of imperfect human nature is not necessarily religious. The various speculation of the U.S. founders that resulted in our constitution could actually refer to imperfect human nature (in the Federalist Papers for example) without being accused of establishing religion. They wouldn't be able to get by with it today. \n \n \nAttempts to divide up the world into opposed categories like liberal/conservative, left/right, constrained/unconstrained typically fail miserably. Reality is more complicated than that. \n\n \n Maybe not the world, but it works pretty well in the U.S. We have Republicans and Democrats. The \"religious right\" and the non-religious left. The \"atheist right\" or \"religious left\" are not common terms in political discussion. \n \n \nWhat constraints? Biblical \"literalism\" makes up its own version of the Bible to affirm \"literally.\" No constraints whatsoever. \n\n \n Biblical literalists do not make up the ten commandments. They do not make up the need for a savior. They don't make up a lot of things that theistic evolutionists make up. \n \n \nMeanwhile, forgvie me if I find the idea that \"the unconstrained vision requires elite leaders to a much larger extent than the constrained one does\" a bit silly. When I see various conservative televangelists whipping up stadium-sized crowds, I think it's pretty clear that the crowd is more than happy to put itself in the hands of \"elite\" leaders. \n\n \n You're forgiven, if you'll remember one very important thing; conservative televangelists are separated from state, liberal political leaders are often not separated from state. \n \n \nI was just hinting that I find a great deal of behavior by self-professed \"Christians\" on this board to be utterly antithetical to Christian ethics. \n\n \n And the rude atheists get a free pass? \n \n \nGive me a break. Coulter once mocked pro-choice doctors' use of terms by saying that someone should \"perform a procedure with a rifle\" on one of them. Viciousness. I truly cannot think of any conservative pundit I find more offensive to basic decency, or who I take as less indicative of Christian ethics.\n \n Which is saying something, considering that Limbagh once referred to Chelsea Clinton as \"the White House dog.\"\n \n If such things have been wished upon them, that too is deserving of condemnation.\n \n Which excuses what, exactly? My parents had ingrained in me that two wrongs don't make a right before I was ten. \n\n \n What did they say about having double standards? About accusing one political side of viciousness, as if the other side didn't also have it? \n \n Accusing one side of two conflicting groups of behavior that both sides display is an indicator of an earlier alliance with one side. I try to avoid doing it, but I'll admit that I do sometimes. I'll freely admit that I have an earlier alliance with Christianity. Do theistic evolutionists BEGIN with a sympathy towards atheism?",

Confronted with inconsistencies in the text, it simply ignores them, dismisses them, declares them insoluble mysteries, continues to affirm something other than \"the actual text\" as \"literally\" true. \n\n \n This goes back to what I said earlier - there has to be a common sense divide between what's important and what is not. To try to combine them in the hopes of destroying them is what militant atheists do. \n \n What you seem to be saying is that since there are perceived inconsistencies in some text, that it lessens the value of other text, like \"In the beginning God created\". It doesn't - the way some text relates (or does not relate) to other text is important. \n \n \nThe hypocrisy, intolerance, and authoritarianism shown by conservatively politicized Christianity has itself done severe damage to traditional Christian morals. If society becomes \"radically different\" due to a depoliticization of the church, I think that might well be a good thing. And a good thing for the church itself. \n\n \n Has it been a good thing in Europe? It's a fact that Christianity has declined sharply in Western Europe. Any number of analyzations of it don't indicate that an increased militance from fundamentalist Christians has caused it to happen. Separation of church and state is what has caused it to happen. \n \n USATODAY.com - Religion takes a back seat in Western Europe\n \n (From the link)\nIn 2000, the church was separated from the state as part of the country's secular trend. \n\n \n Secular trend - non Christian trend - that's what separation of church and state does!\n \n \nSorry but this still doesn't cut the mustard. The Gospels were not eyewitness accounts, nor were they compilations of eyewitness accounts. If you think otherwise, present your evidence. \n\n \n I have a King James Bible that has descriptions/ timelines etc. of each book. Here is what it says about Luke;\n \n \nLuke states the nature and purpose of his gospel. Although there were other works about Christ, Luke wanted to give an orderly account as a historian who was well informed and capable of offering a literary document, reflecting a reliable account as he secured it from eyewitnesses. In comparison with other gospels, Luke presents all the major facts of Christs life; so the book of Luke has been recognized as the most complete representative account of the life of Jesus. \n\n \n Where do you get your information that the gospels were not compilations of eyewitnesses? Our discussion may be nearing a close. \n \n \nOn the other hand, you could try to open yourself up to some new perspectives on the text. Check out John Shelby Spong's Liberating the Gospels. He examines the liturgical, not biographical, motivations of the authors of the synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew, and Luke). Extremely illuminating. \n\n \n From a website that promotes him;\n \n \nSpong powerfully argues that many of the key Gospel accounts of events in the life of Jesus-from the stories of his birth to his physical resurrection-are not literally true. \n\n \n If something is not true, it is false. \n \n Now from a website that questions him\n \n \n[Spong believes that] Jesus wasn't virgin-born; he was the product of rape. He was not divine, but a fallible human, a good social teacher, was married, suffered the criminal's death of crucifixion. His body was not buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, but thrown in a common criminal's grave. He was not resurrected bodily, but his body rotted along with the other corpses.\n\n \n And you accuse literalists of knowing \"next to nothing about the history of either the texts or the church, and lift passages out of their context routinely\"? \n \n \nBut he's a liberal and a non-literalist, of course.\n\n \n You got that right! Did Jesus have a few girlfriends too - a few illegitimate children as well? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] If a \"myth\" is being put forward, it only makes sense that the person or persons doing it are going to try to make every detail match perfectly, or to make the story as complete as possible.

If there was clearly no earthly organization to put together a myth, it's perfectly logical to take that as a clear indication that there is no myth! That God has revealed the information he has chosen to, and no more. If one decides to reject it on that basis, he is free to do that. \n \n \nKeep in mind, the issue is not just gaps or questions.

Militant atheists try to use it to discredit the entire Bible. Theistic evolutionists apparently try use them to show an allegorical Bible that is more powerful than a literal one! I'm afraid the atheists really smoke you in the logic department this time. But they never seem to want to debate it with you. \n \n \nOn the contrary, \"history clearly shows us that\" there's nothing \"given\" about them. The very fact that so many interpreters of the Bible have understood the text allegorically, while nonetheless continuing to believe, continuing to practice, continuing to affirm theism in word and in deed, is a refutation of your claim.\n\n \n Or it's an indication that Biblical prophesy about false teachers is coming true. \n \n \nExactly my point!

The damage thereby done to the church by the very religious conservatives who claim to support it cannot be overestimated. \n\n \n The difference is, you seem to believe that conservative Christianity is the only one on the offense. It is actually on the defence, as Christianity has declined in western Europe, and is declining in the U.S. As I showed you earlier with the titles of those 15 books, atheism is on the offence. \n \n \nAffirming manifest contradictions is not a \"measure of faith.\" The reason why it can't be understood, completely or even minimally, is that such a view is antithetical to our God-given power of reason itself.\n \n \n \n Jesus criticizes hypocrisy throughout the Gospels, so I'd say it's a rather central notion.

I don't think it's dishonest, it's just sad and wrong, and the Bible warns us about it. I find the following three paragraphs from my above linkto be well written;\n \n \n (Spong) When the power of a great modern secular university ... challenged my life, I experienced my first faith crisis. My philosophy teacher was an atheist. Another professor ... had once been a Congregationalist minister but had ... repudiated his faith, and upon receiving his doctorate, entered the academic world dedicated to destroying 'superstitious religion'.... It was under such experiences as these that a literal reading of the Bible disintegrated.... I met this crisis by abandoning the authority of the literal scriptures. (THL p. 8) \n\n \n \nSpong was not prepared by the church of his youth to answer the questions thrown at him by modern society. When he went to university, he was challenged to defend a faith he was never taught to defend. Naturally, like the raw recruit ordered to defend a hill against a well-trained and heavily armed enemy with a weapon he was never taught how to use, Spong capitulated. Having done so, he feels cheated by his church and disappointed by his literal faith, and now seeks to challenge and destroy both.\n \n In this sense, a study of Spong's life and work should be mandatory reading for Christian pastors and parents. It is a testimony to the failure of our churches to instruct their children and young people in the defence of the faith and the Bible. If we fail in our duty to enable our young people always to be ready to give an adequate explanation for the faith that is in them (1 Peter 3:15) we may well be responsible for raising up a future generation of Spongs. \n\n \n \"entered the academic world dedicated to destroying superstitious religion\" - one of the most important issues of the day, I think.

What they both fail to appreciate or comprehend at all is the living, breathing, personal relationship which is made available between God and Man which is entirely due to the personal sacrifice made by Jesus Christ on our behalf as a result of Gods plan for salvation for us, which He envisioned before we even fell from grace via Adam and Eve.\n \n To them discussing God, religion and faith is an intellectual excercise, or should be, to define the part RELIGION plays in mens lives. They have no concept that religion is a man made ritual, but being born again is a God breathed relationship between Him and all who receive Him. That concept seems totally beyond them to appreciate or comprehend. In all of the alleged depth of their opinions, they miss entirely the importance and value of what it means to have a personal relationship with God which is recived through Grace and based on faith in He who is unseen but evident at the deepest level of ones being.",

   "What is it that theistic evolutionists try to accomplish with their scrutiny of \"textual inconsistencies\"? An opposition to literalists, and an alliance with atheists?\n\n \n No. I won't presume to speak for all theistic evolutionists, but what I hope to accomplish with my scrutiny of the Biblical text, including but by no means limited to its inconsistencies, is a better understanding of the text, with all its profundities all of its flaws. Doing so has, as I see it, given me a better understanding of my faith and has only ever strengthened my relationship to God.\n \n \nIt's clear that most theistic evolutionists find literalists to be a greater threat to their earthly lifestyle than they do atheists.\n\n \n Not so! I consider literalism a threat to the spiritual, not to the worldly.\n \n \nYou don't seem to be thinking about different levels of importance of scriptural text. The words \"in the beginning God created\" is more general, more central, more important than the details of, for example, the conflict of accounts of the two theives hurling insults at Jesus vs only one.\n\n \n And here I must totally disagree. The narrative of the crucifixion and resurrection is the centrally important story of the Christian faith. More important than the birth stories, more importan than the creation. Indeed, even many conservative mainline churches consider the creationism-evolution debate to be a tangential problem, because it's not a salvation issue.\n \n And I think that in order to understand the meaning of salvation and eternal life, we have to explore the differences between the various Gospel narratives. As I said, Christ is depicted as far more serene during the crucifixion in Luke and John than he is in Mark and Matthew. If you think such differences of tone, and the differences of detail by which they are expressed, are unimportant, then I guess all I can really say is, I don't consider that to be a very attentive reading of the scriptures.\n \n \nNOT AN ASSUALT ON SCIENCE, BUT A QUESTIONING OF SCIENTISTS. A questioning of the scientific community as a group. [boldface in original]\n\n \n But it's far from the entire group that claims evolution supports atheism, so how is it fair to go after them all?\n \n I just read a book on the evolutionary ecology of insect sociality in groups other than the justly famous ants, wasps, bees, and termites, James Costa's The Other Insect Societies. At times geared toward a bit more technically proficient reader than myself, but I still enjoyed the heck out of a it. About 700 pages, with all sorts of discussion of the evolution of social behaviors, and not once -- not once -- did Costa use evolution to bash religion or promote atheism.\n \n This is the reality of how biologists use evolutionary theory, day in and day out. Yes, a handful of them use it to grind metaphysical axes, and yes, they get a lot of publicity. But for reasons that have nothing to do with either supporting or opposing any religious ideas whatsoever, biologists use it as a powerful explanatory tool all the time -- and their writings far outnumber the atheists you are so irritated with.\n \n \nThe \"assault on science\" straw man is always built by atheists and theistic evolutionists alike, and it never matters how clear the truth is made. If there's one \"same old line re-hashed time and again\" thing in creation / evolution debates, that's it - that anyone who's not a Geneis disregarding evolutionist is anti-science.\n\n \n How is it a straw man? From what I've seen, the basic tenets of not just biology, but also geosciences and physics would have to be altered to accomodate a literal reading of Genesis. (And which of the two Genesis accounts is to be literalized, one wonders?... But I digress.)\n \n The fundamental epistemological point of Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis is no different from that of culturally relativist strands of postmodernism: it's all about using the incommensurability of initial presuppositions to relativize the conclusions derived from them.\n \n Meanwhile, once again, I think you're misrepresenting theistic evolutionists in order to lump them together with atheists. My turn to boldface: Theistic evolutionists do not \"disregard\" Genesis. They just interpret it differently than you do, as expressing spiritual truths rather than matters of fact.\n \n \nI wish that could be settled once and for all, but it never is. It won't be any time at all before, somewhere on these forums, a creationist will be accused of being anti-science. It's emotioal, it can be politically helpful, but it's always dishonest.\n\n \n Why is it dishonest? I honestly think that creationism is anti-scientific. It refuses to allow that any empirical evidence could conflict with a literal reading of Genesis (however that's possible). It starts with a conclusion, and seeks to conform the evidence to that conclusion. This is virtually a definition of \"anti-scientific.\"\n \n \nI may be confusing you with Miller, but you've given no indication that you disagree with him on much of anything. From page 257 of 'Finding Darwin's God'....\n \n The obvious implication of theistic evolution is that things have changed (evolved) now, that the Bible is to be looked at in a different light now that we know so many scientific things.\n\n \n Actually, I'm not sure I'd agree with Miller on this entirely. There are legitimate questions about whether even the authors themselves understood what they were doing as historiography.\n \n On the other hand, our technology is far better now than then. What good would it have done to teach people about cells when they had no microscopes to see them? Of course, that just raises the issue of why God wouldn't have magicked up some microscopes for them to use....\n \n The fact is, we do know much more about the natural world now than we did thousands of years ago. We've got much farther to go, but we've come a long way, too.\n \n I hasten to add that this does not mean that ancient peoples were a bunch of know-nothing ignoramuses. The \"presentism\" of thinking that we're so much smarter than the ancients is one of my pet peeves. But there's a difference between intelligence and knowledge. We may not be much smarter, but we know a lot more.\n \n \nIf that were true, the original manuscripts would have been lost/disregarded/rewritten to the extent that King James wouldn't have had anything to work with some 1500 years later.\n\n \n Not so! This passage indicates the fundamental flaw in your reasoning. You refuse to decouple the expression of spiritual truth from literal truth. Which, of course, has been my point from the beginning.\n \n The texts are false, in a literal sense. They are not accurate descriptions of historical events (and for the most part do not even claim to be). But that in no way precludes the texts from expressing spiritual truths.\n \n As I said all the way back when this exchange started, Genesis expresses a number of ideas about God and the creation: that there is such a deity, that the world as a whole and in all its parts -- including human beings -- owe their existence to him, that he exercises providential concern for what he has created in whole and in part -- including the human part -- and so forth. Not one whit of that is undermined by interpreting the creation story (stories... but I digress one more time!) as an allegory, rather than as history.\n \n \nSo a lack of literalism does not sacrifice seriousness? It is less serious if it is increasingly disregarded in the political realm.\n\n \n No, I don't think non-literalism sacrifices seriousness. It is non-literal interpretations that actually take the Bible seriously by paying attention to what it actually says instead of sweeping any problematic passages aside as \"not so important.\"\n \n And again, I worry that you are overly politicizing religion. So what if a religious view has little clout in the world of big-time power politics? When it comes to religion, I'm much less interested in political institutions than in ethical behavior.\n \n \nSorry, but it can and does. Scientific \"Natural basis for behaviors\" can get legitimate consideration in courts of law.\n\n \n And the question is, should it? There are lots of \"natural\" things that, from a human perspective, are bad and dangerous, like bubonic plague and earthquakes. And lots of \"unnatural\" things are, in human terms, good and useful, like the the wheel and computers. So the \"natural\"/\"unnatural\" issue doesn't decide what ought to be permitted or prohibited. And I don't care which side is using it.\n \n \nIf you tell me that it doesn't, or it doesn't to any noticable degree, there's no question that getting it there is one of the strongest political desires of the activist atheist community.\n\n \n Is it, now? Really? What's your evidence that this is the sort of things atheists are after?\n \n \nAnd theistic evolutionists don't seem to mind.\n\n \n As always, I'll speak only for myself. As the above makes plain, I am not a fan of attempting to derive moral precepts from nature.\n \n \nThat goes both ways of course - you seem very dismissive of anything a \"literalist\" would say.\n\n \n I've not dismissed literalism. I've examined it and found it wanting. The evidence isn't there.\n \n \nA defined view of imperfect human nature is not necessarily religious.\n\n \n Indeed not! And as philosopher Michael Ruse astutely pointed out in Darwinism and Its Discontents, this is one point about which evolution and religion actually agree....\n \n \nThe various speculation of the U.S. founders that resulted in our constitution could actually refer to imperfect human nature (in the Federalist Papers for example) without being accused of establishing religion. They wouldn't be able to get by with it today.\n\n \n They probably wouldn't get away with some of the specifics, anyway. After all, they for the most part did not consider women to have intellectual capacities equal to men, or non-whites equal to whites. It turns out that some of the things they considered universally \"human\" were actually not so universal after all. As somebody who has given the history of philosophy a great deal of study, I'm well aware of this problem.\n \n But of course, evolutionary biologists don't deny human nature as such. Heck, evolutionary psychologist Stephen Pinker wrote an entire book, The Blank Slate, criticizing modern thinkers for believing that human nature is so malleable.\n \n You should really read more of what evolutionary biologists actually say. Because very often, I think you're fighting what you think they say instead of what they do.\n \n \nMaybe not the world, but it works pretty well in the U.S. We have Republicans and Democrats. The \"religious right\" and the non-religious left. The \"atheist right\" or \"religious left\" are not common terms in political discussion.\n\n \n The \"religious left\" may not be a common term, but it is a common reality. There are a lot more of us out here than you might think, and we're growing. Heck, ever hear of Jim Wallis?\n \n As to the \"atheist right,\" again don't confuse terminology with reality. They're out there, too.\n \n \nBiblical literalists do not make up the ten commandments. They do not make up the need for a savior.\n\n \n No, they don't. But they do make up things like a unified Gospel narrative to affirm \"literally.\" It happens every time someone puts on a Christmas pageant or a passion play. In order to render the story consistently, bits and pieces are pulled from the different Gospels, and anything that's inconsistent with whatever has been pulled is simply left out.\n \n \nThey don't make up a lot of things that theistic evolutionists make up.\n\n \n And what, pray tell, have theistic evolutionists made up? They no more invented the inconsistencies between the Gospels than the \"literalists\" invented the Ten Commandments.\n \n \nYou're forgiven, if you'll remember one very important thing; conservative televangelists are separated from state, liberal political leaders are often not separated from state.\n\n \n I know! Isn't it great? And atheists advocates are \"separated from state\" in exactly the same sense, while conservative political leaders are \"not separated from state.\"\n \n Marvelous thing, that separation of church and state....\n \n Marc, please understand that I'm not trying to be rude in asking this, but I'm going to put it bluntly. To wit: Would you like to see the United States be an officially Christian nation? a theocracy of sorts?\n \n To me, this is what you and other religious conservatives seem to be after. Perhaps I'm wrong, and you can feel free to explain what exactly it is that you want if I am.\n \n Like I said, apologies in advance if that way of putting it offends. I don't intend it to. I'm just trying to figure out where exactly you're coming from.\n \n \nAnd the rude atheists get a free pass?\n\n \n Let me put it this way: They bother me less than rude Christians. (Among whom, I hasten to add, I have no reason to number you.)\n \n \nWhat did they say about having double standards? About accusing one political side of viciousness, as if the other side didn't also have it?\n\n \n But of course, the \"other side\" isn't claiming to represent Christian moral standards. Hence, the reason for my greater botheration.\n \n \nI'll freely admit that I have an earlier alliance with Christianity. Do theistic evolutionists BEGIN with a sympathy towards atheism?\n\n \n Not in my case. Like you I was much more heavily acquainted with Christianity at an early age. My father is a Methodist minister.\n \n Of course, he's also a lifelong political liberal and a college biology major who hasn't interpreted the scriptures literally since well before he finished seminary in the early 70's. So my sympathy toward science is also longstanding.\n \n My sympathy toward atheists didn't start until I actually met some in college, and realized that they weren't out to take over the world, but that they were deeply persecuted by many religious believers.",

   "This goes back to what I said earlier - there has to be a common sense divide between what's important and what is not. To try to combine them in the hopes of destroying them is what militant atheists do.\n\n \n Perhaps. But what non-literalist believers do is try to acknowledge them and understand them.\n \n \nWhat you seem to be saying is that since there are perceived inconsistencies in some text, that it lessens the value of other text, like \"In the beginning God created\". It doesn't - the way some text relates (or does not relate) to other text is important.\n\n \n Marc, I don't know how I could be any more explicit about this than I already have, but I'll try:\n \n I do not think that inconsistencies within the Biblical text lessen the text's value. Nor do I think that inconsistencies prevent that text from expressing spiritual truths. But I do think that they count as evidence against the text's literality. That is all.\n \n I think it comes down to this: Must the Bible be literally true in order to express spiritual truths and have value? I say no. You seem continually to presuppose yes. Therein lies the source of our disagreement.\n \n \nHas it been a good thing in Europe?\n\n \n It's been a decidedly mixed bag. Zealous religious belief has probably looked a lot less attractive all across Europe ever since the Iron Century of 1560-1660, especially 1618-1648.\n \n \nIt's a fact that Christianity has declined sharply in Western Europe. Any number of analyzations of it don't indicate that an increased militance from fundamentalist Christians has caused it to happen.\n\n \n The analyses, as discussed in the article itself, are entirely inconclusive. Having studied Nietzsche in detail, I can certainly tell you that the world's most in/famous atheist developed his ideas in direct opposition to a late-19th-century Chrsistianity that he regarded as hypocritically self-righteous when it wasn't a matter of empty ritualism.\n \n \nSeparation of church and state is what has caused it to happen. \n \n Secular trend - non Christian trend - that's what separation of church and state does!\n\n \n Ever hear of the fallacy known as \"post hoc ergo propter hoc?\" It translates as \"after the thing, therefore because of the thing.\" It's very common, and you've committed it here. Even if separation of church and state comes before declining religiosity, that's not sufficient to show that it causes declining religiosity.\n \n And if anything the very example you quoted shows just the opposite! Look at the table. In 1981, 38% of Swedes said they never or almost never attended church. In 2000, 46% of Swedes answered that way. But the formal separation of church from state happened in 2000! What accounts for that 19-year, 8% rise? Certainly not the separation of church from state. If anything, it would appear that the decline of religion in Swedish culture is what caused the separation.\n \n I don't think you're reasoning about this very carefully.\n \n And besides, I would definitely not want to have the state decide that I am, by birth, a member of such-and-such church. That was what was really at issue in the Swedish example. Is it something you find appealing?\n \n \nI have a King James Bible that has descriptions/ timelines etc. of each book. Here is what it says about Luke...\n\n \n With all due respect, I would seriously question how much that editor really knows. Because...\n \n \nWhere do you get your information that the gospels were not compilations of eyewitnesses? Our discussion may be nearing a close.\n\n \n ...there are so many sources out there it's difficult to fathom how this sort of thing could be missed. Even among contemporary sources written for the laity, there are authors like Spong (Episcopal) or Armstrong (Catholic) or Ehrman (atheist -- but he used to be an evangelical -- coincidence? hmm...). A quick glance through their bibliographies can point you in a thousand different directions for material from all sides of these debates.\n \n \nIf something is not true, it is false.\n\n \n Can't argue with that. But as usual, you seem to be making the mistaken assumption that if something is not literally true, it must be spiritually false.\n \n \n[from an anti-Spong link]:\n \n \n[Spong believes that] Jesus wasn't virgin-born; he was the product of rape. He was not divine, but a fallible human, a good social teacher, was married, suffered the criminal's death of crucifixion. His body was not buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, but thrown in a common criminal's grave. He was not resurrected bodily, but his body rotted along with the other corpses.\n\n \n And you accuse literalists of knowing \"next to nothing about the history of either the texts or the church, and lift passages out of their context routinely\"?\n\n \n Yes, I do. Leaving aside the extremely loaded language -- \"rotted along with the other corpses,\" I love it -- this is at best an oversimplification and at times a flat-out dishonest misrepresntation of Spong's views.\n \n It's true, for example, that he doesn't believe Jesus was born of a virgin. Are you aware of all the textual problems there? Did you read the portion of the site addressing the issue? \"Alma\" means \"young woman.\" The point is not that it could never be used to designate a virgin, but that it never unambiguously connotes viriginity -- not any more than calling someone a \"young woman\" in English does. If you wanted to make sure that your listeners understood that someone was a virgin, would you describe her as a young woman? I doubt it. So if someone is described as being born of an \"alma,\" there is no reason at all to assume that he is born of a virgin. Whence the mistranslation concerning \"parthenos\" in the Septuagint and the Matthean gospel, since \"parthenos\" means \"virign.\" It's a term with a narrower meaning being used to translate a term with a broader meaning.\n \n As to the rape issue, I don't recall Spong ever having raised even the possibility in the books I've read, let alone asserting at as certain. In fairness, I've not read Spong's Born of a Woman, treating the virgin birth at length. But certainly it doesn't arise in Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism or Liberating the Gospels. Issues of Jesus' legitimacy arise. For when he is called \"the son of Mary\" in Mark 6, that's a striking claim. To call a Jewish man the son of his mother, rather than of his father, is to put his paternity into question. (And really, so what? Are lowly origins something a Christian ought to be ashamed of? Please.)\n \n Or on the issue of Jesus' divinity, Spong has said -- accurately -- that the Bible nowhere simply identifies Jesus with God. He is repeatedly characterized as \"the Son of God,\" and as the one in whom God is met. It's all very complicated, certainly more complicated than the author of your link lets on.\n \n Similar cases could be made about the other points raised by the link. Hardly a fair characterization of Spong. And hardly an author who gives evidence of understanding the very text he mocks Spong for failing to understand.\n \n \nDid Jesus have a few girlfriends too - a few illegitimate children as well?\n\n \n You're acting like Spong is just making this stuff up. I hate to break it to you, but he's not. He's addressing the text with far more seriousness than do Biblical literalists.\n \n \nLet me reword the bolded statement above to make it more clear; Christianity's origins have no defined earthly organization. If there was clearly no earthly organization to put together a myth, it's perfectly logical to take that as a clear indication that there is no myth!\n\n \n Baloney. One might just as well say the same thing of Homer's Iliad.\n \n And of course, you realize that there were a whole series of synods in the first four centuries A.D. making decisions about what was canon and what not, right? Like I said, you would do well to study the history of the compilation of the text.\n \n \nThe real problem with theistic evolutionists is that they join with atheists in making a big deal out of \"contradictions\". Militant atheists try to use it to discredit the entire Bible. Theistic evolutionists apparently try use them to show an allegorical Bible that is more powerful than a literal one!\n\n \n Exactly! It's just that I don't consider that \"joining with\" atheists.\n \n \nI'm afraid the atheists really smoke you in the logic department this time.\n\n \n How so? Many of them seem to share your premise, that if the Bible is not literally true, it cannot express spiritual truths. As I have said repeatedly, I think that premise is faulty.\n \n You are of course free to disagree. But disagreeing isn't refuting. What exactly is the problem with my rejection of your premise? Or to put it another way, why must I accept that premise as true? That's what you're not arguing yet.\n \n \nBut they never seem to want to debate it with you.\n\n \n On the issue of literalism, what is there to debate? They don't interpret the Bible literally, and neither do I. Not much to debate on that front.\n \n \n...you seem to believe that conservative Christianity is the only one on the offense. It is actually on the defence, as Christianity has declined in western Europe, and is declining in the U.S. As I showed you earlier with the titles of those 15 books, atheism is on the offence.\n\n \n Again with the book count. For pity's sake, look at the numbers of creationist books that have been coming out for far longer than the last couple years.\n \n \nDID IT WORK IN WESTERN EUROPE?\n\n \n I sincerely doubt that the decline in European religiosity is due to some insidious atheist plot. In fact, I would guess that both declining religiosity and increasing atheism are effects -- of causes that occured largely between 1914 and 1945.",

   "His reference to John Shelby Spong was an eye opener - a clear source of where this type of thinking comes from. I don't think it's dishonest, it's just sad and wrong, and the Bible warns us about it. I find the following three paragraphs from my above linkto be well written.\n\n \n \"Well written,\" perhaps. But poorly reasoned. It starts right away when the authors allege some contradiction/hypocrisy between Spong's explicit claim that words are never the truth and his claim that his own words are true; they manage to skate right past Spong's next sentence, despite having included it, where he explains that words are a medium for truth.\n \n And ultimately, not just poorly reasoned, but a dishonest misrepresentation of what he says. When the authors complain about how fundamentalists are stereotyped and bigoted, I was reminded of Lynard Skynard complaining in \"Sweet Home Alabama\" that Neil Young should remember, Southern Man don't need him around anyhow -- thereby proving Young's point.\n \n I would strongly urge you not to rely on second-hand accounts -- not on these authors, but not even on me, either -- and read Spong for yourself before making any claims about what he does or doesn't mean, and how well he does or doesn't understand the Bible.\n \n \nAtheism and state should be separated.\n\n \n Agreed. So should church and state, however, and that seems to be what you don't want.\n \n Beyond that, I am curious: Do you agree with Archie's claim that I have no relationship with God and Christ?",

Doing so has, as I see it, given me a better understanding of my faith and has only ever strengthened my relationship to God. \n\n \n Doesn't it make sense that the more one understands God, the more one will be disconnected from those who organize against his existance? \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] You don't seem to be thinking about different levels of importance of scriptural text. The words \"in the beginning God created\" is more general, more central, more important than the details of, for example, the conflict of accounts of the two theives hurling insults at Jesus vs only one. \n\n \n \nAnd here I must totally disagree. The narrative of the crucifixion and resurrection is the centrally important story of the Christian faith. More important than the birth stories, more importan than the creation. \n\n \n And more important than the \"inconsistencies? emoticon_xangel\n \n So we both agree that the crucifixion and resurrection is the most important thing. From there we go in different directions as we step down to the next level of details and reinforement of that important thing. We both seek doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness, right? 2nd Timothy, 3:16 says ALL scripture is given by inspiration of God, for doctrine, reproof, correction etc. As you search for FLAWS in scripture, are you seeking to identify them, or seek a purpose for their being there? \n \n And I also have to wonder; Do you believe there will be a second coming of Christ, or is that also allegorical?\n \n \nIndeed, even many conservative mainline churches consider the creationism-evolution debate to be a tangential problem, because it's not a salvation issue. \n\n \n I think they take that debate too lightly - they don't know or care what's at stake. Salvation for many very well could be at stake. Teaching that it's not a salvation issue could be a false teaching. \n \n \nAnd I think that in order to understand the meaning of salvation and eternal life, we have to explore the differences between the various Gospel narratives. As I said, Christ is depicted as far more serene during the crucifixion in Luke and John than he is in Mark and Matthew. If you think such differences of tone, and the differences of detail by which they are expressed, are unimportant, then I guess all I can really say is, I don't consider that to be a very attentive reading of the scriptures. \n\n \n What importance do you see in the differences of detail? That Luke and John were more accurate, or that the differences in how Christ is depicted in different ways somehow reaches more people, who can therefore decide which way they believed things happened on their own? How does that help you to better understand God? Do the differences of detail alter how we should interpret 2 Timothy, 3:16? \n \n \nBut it's far from the entire group that claims evolution supports atheism, so how is it fair to go after them all? \n\n \n Not \"going after\" them - questioning them. If they don't oppose those who claim that evolution supports atheism, it's makes sense to continue to question them. \n \n \nI just read a book on the evolutionary ecology of insect sociality in groups other than the justly famous ants, wasps, bees, and termites, James Costa's The Other Insect Societies. At times geared toward a bit more technically proficient reader than myself, but I still enjoyed the heck out of a it. About 700 pages, with all sorts of discussion of the evolution of social behaviors, and not once -- not once -- did Costa use evolution to bash religion or promote atheism.\n \n This is the reality of how biologists use evolutionary theory, day in and day out. Yes, a handful of them use it to grind metaphysical axes, and yes, they get a lot of publicity. But for reasons that have nothing to do with either supporting or opposing any religious ideas whatsoever, biologists use it as a powerful explanatory tool all the time -- and their writings far outnumber the atheists you are so irritated with. \n\n \n Was Costa's book about insect sociality one of those writings - one that had nothing to do with support or opposition of religion? If so, what was its purpose? You said you enjoyed it - was entertainment its purpose? If so that's fine, but if it's about evolved social behaviors, I suspect there could be something between the lines about application to human behavior. Someone who knows God should be irritated that someone looks to BUGS to try to determine how humans should behave. \n \n \nHow is it a straw man? From what I've seen, the basic tenets of not just biology, but also geosciences and physics would have to be altered to accomodate a literal reading of Genesis. \n\n \n Your definition of \"basic tenets\" and \"literal\" aren't objective, they're subjective. I can say the basic tenets of Christianity have to be altered to accommodate what goes on in science today. \n \n \n(And which of the two Genesis accounts is to be literalized, one wonders?... But I digress.) \n\n \n Both of them. Chapter 2 is not sequential. The word \"then\" should not be substituted, or added to, the word \"and\". \n \n To me, anyone who finds a contradiction between Genesis one and two has to have started out LOOKING for a contradiction. I don't really see most atheists doing it, since most atheists are simply not interested in opening a Bible. I don't see any theist do it, since it requires a stretch of what Genesis 2 actually says to make it indicate a timeline. There seems to be ONE THING that unites those who find this contradiction, and that's evolution. An interest in evolution, a study of evolution, seems to create the mindset that the Bible must be held up to new standards. It seems to be some kind of agitation that the Bible speaks of creation from nothing, an agitation that inspires it to be reduced to earthly standards. Those claims that evolution does not address religion at all are simply false, it clearly inspires in those who study it an agitation to reduce religion to an earthly realm, and earthly scrutiny and inspection. Not to better understand it, but to disregard it. \n \n \nThe fundamental epistemological point of Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis is no different from that of culturally relativist strands of postmodernism: it's all about using the incommensurability of initial presuppositions to relativize the conclusions derived from them.\n \n Meanwhile, once again, I think you're misrepresenting theistic evolutionists in order to lump them together with atheists. My turn to boldface: Theistic evolutionists do not \"disregard\" Genesis. They just interpret it differently than you do, as expressing spiritual truths rather than matters of fact.\n\n \n You draw a huge distinction between spiritual truth and matter of fact. As if spiritual truth is something private, something that we keep bottled up in ourselves to amuse ourselves how ever we see fit, and leave the matter of fact part to society, the political process. \n \n I don't think there are two realms of truth. Spiritual truths concerning how we each should behave concerning our own personal situation is not disconnected from matters of fact. \n \n \nWhy is it dishonest? I honestly think that creationism is anti-scientific. It refuses to allow that any empirical evidence could conflict with a literal reading of Genesis (however that's possible). It starts with a conclusion, and seeks to conform the evidence to that conclusion. This is virtually a definition of \"anti-scientific.\" \n\n \n Atheism starts with a conclusion (Darwinism) and seeks to comform the evidence to that conclusion. I believe evidence shows that scientific study has been influenced by that - that the scientific community doesn't maintain perfect neutrality. If the ToE has flaws in it equal to the flaws found in the belief of a conflict between Genesis 1 and 2, it is filled with flaws indeed. \n \n \nActually, I'm not sure I'd agree with Miller on this entirely. There are legitimate questions about whether even the authors themselves understood what they were doing as historiography.\n \n On the other hand, our technology is far better now than then. What good would it have done to teach people about cells when they had no microscopes to see them? Of course, that just raises the issue of why God wouldn't have magicked up some microscopes for them to use....\n \n The fact is, we do know much more about the natural world now than we did thousands of years ago. We've got much farther to go, but we've come a long way, too.\n \n I hasten to add that this does not mean that ancient peoples were a bunch of know-nothing ignoramuses. The \"presentism\" of thinking that we're so much smarter than the ancients is one of my pet peeves. But there's a difference between intelligence and knowledge. We may not be much smarter, but we know a lot more. \n\n \n I agree - we don't know more because of increased intelligence, we know more because of slight improvements on past ideas and succeses, many of them accidental discoveries. And of course, many of them from breakthroughs by just a few extra-intelligent people. I sure don't think people are smarter in general than they were hundreds, or even thousands of years ago. Today's idolization of Michael Jackson should be proof of that to anyone. \n \n \nNot so! This passage indicates the fundamental flaw in your reasoning. You refuse to decouple the expression of spiritual truth from literal truth. Which, of course, has been my point from the beginning.\n \n The texts are false, in a literal sense. They are not accurate descriptions of historical events (and for the most part do not even claim to be). But that in no way precludes the texts from expressing spiritual truths. \n\n \n When we separate them, we divide them, and one of them is bound to be primary, and the other is bound to be secondary. The secondary one can easily be reduced to obscurity. \n \n \nAs I said all the way back when this exchange started, Genesis expresses a number of ideas about God and the creation: that there is such a deity, that the world as a whole and in all its parts -- including human beings -- owe their existence to him, that he exercises providential concern for what he has created in whole and in part -- including the human part -- and so forth. Not one whit of that is undermined by interpreting the creation story (stories... but I digress one more time!) as an allegory, rather than as history. \n\n \n We have to agree to disagree on it - I think it's undermined by it. An allegory becomes second to reality, just like a Hollywood movie is secondary to a reality like 9/11/01. \n \n \nNo, I don't think non-literalism sacrifices seriousness. It is non-literal interpretations that actually take the Bible seriously by paying attention to what it actually says instead of sweeping any problematic passages aside as \"not so important.\"\n \n And again, I worry that you are overly politicizing religion. So what if a religious view has little clout in the world of big-time power politics? When it comes to religion, I'm much less interested in political institutions than in ethical behavior. \n\n \n You seem to believe that a society isn't going to be much different if it is, or is not, influenced by Christianity. I think it's greatly influenced by it. I'm 54 years old, and the decline of Christianity in the U.S. only since I've been alive has caused amazing changes in how our society works, from the 50's and 60's when I was growing up, to today. We earlier touched on the legalized gambling issue that is raging over much of the country today. There were cases of illegal gambling going on in the 50s of course, but the possibility of the majority of citizens approving its legality simply wasn't an issue. There are countless other behavioral changes in U.S.society only over the last 50 years. I started a thread last October about litigation - not much response to it. But the yellow bus examples there were clear proof of how differently people think after only 30 years. Read through the details (in the link there) of the 1958 accident. It's clear that people back then simply didn't think to blame a manufacturer for a freak accident. Now of course I know that there will be those who will gleefully point out that the 58 accident was secular, that the 88 accident involved Christians and lawsuits. But they know that if it would have been reversed (if the 58 accident would have been a church bus and the 88 accident would have been a school bus) the differences would have been even more drastic - proving my point even more. \n \n \nAnd the question is, should it? There are lots of \"natural\" things that, from a human perspective, are bad and dangerous, like bubonic plague and earthquakes. And lots of \"unnatural\" things are, in human terms, good and useful, like the the wheel and computers. So the \"natural\"/\"unnatural\" issue doesn't decide what ought to be permitted or prohibited. And I don't care which side is using it. \n\n \n The absence or presence of Christianity (in the case of the U.S.) will make a huge difference in the outcome. \n \n \nIs it, now? Really? What's your evidence that this is the sort of things atheists are after? \n\n \n In things like the humanist manifestos, Richard Dawkins writings, atheist websites, or slanted reporting in the mainstream news media. Things that hardly existed in the U.S. fifty years ago. \n \n \nAs always, I'll speak only for myself. As the above makes plain, I am not a fan of attempting to derive moral precepts from nature. \n\n \n Then you should strongly oppose it, because its happening. There should be a theistic evolutionary organization making noise about it. \n \n \n \nI've not dismissed literalism. I've examined it and found it wanting. The evidence isn't there.\n \n Indeed not! And as philosopher Michael Ruse astutely pointed out in Darwinism and Its Discontents, this is one point about which evolution and religion actually agree....\n \n They probably wouldn't get away with some of the specifics, anyway. After all, they for the most part did not consider women to have intellectual capacities equal to men, or non-whites equal to whites. It turns out that some of the things they considered universally \"human\" were actually not so universal after all. As somebody who has given the history of philosophy a great deal of study, I'm well aware of this problem. \n\n \n When it comes to the constitution, or the details that led up to it like the federalist papers etc. is it important to consider the founders opinions of intellectual capacities of white men over those of women or black people? Or their views of slavery? I don't see how those things matter at all. They don't change the text of the constitution, or the systems of how decisions in government would be made. Just like our perceived inconsistencies of the Bible are irrelevant to how we view and study the crucification and ressurection. \n \n \nNo, they don't. But they do make up things like a unified Gospel narrative to affirm \"literally.\" It happens every time someone puts on a Christmas pageant or a passion play. In order to render the story consistently, bits and pieces are pulled from the different Gospels, and anything that's inconsistent with whatever has been pulled is simply left out.\n\n \n What's wrong with that, if it gets the basics right about the crucifiction and resurection, to viewers (children) who may not know a thing about it?\n \n \nAnd what, pray tell, have theistic evolutionists made up? They no more invented the inconsistencies between the Gospels than the \"literalists\" invented the Ten Commandments. \n\n \n That there was no fully formed first man and woman, that Genesis was an allegory, that Christ wasn't born of a virgin, that Christ was married, that Luke wasn't inspired at all from eyewitness accounts........\n \n \nI know! Isn't it great? And atheists advocates are \"separated from state\" in exactly the same sense, while conservative political leaders are \"not separated from state.\" \n\n \n Not when the atheist advocates get themselves jobs as public science teachers. \n \n \nMarvelous thing, that separation of church and state....\n \n Marc, please understand that I'm not trying to be rude in asking this, but I'm going to put it bluntly. To wit: Would you like to see the United States be an officially Christian nation? a theocracy of sorts?\n \n To me, this is what you and other religious conservatives seem to be after. Perhaps I'm wrong, and you can feel free to explain what exactly it is that you want if I am.\n \n Like I said, apologies in advance if that way of putting it offends. I don't intend it to. I'm just trying to figure out where exactly you're coming from. \n\n \n No apology necessary - a good question! A theocracy means \"immediate divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided\". Joseph Story was an early 19th century Supreme court justice, appointed by president James Madison. His writings \n (mainly sections 985 thru 991) give his concise yet detailed interpretations about the relation of religion and government, as he interpreted the Constitution that was largely written by the president who appointed him. Here are two c/p's from it that put it into words far better than I can, where I'm coming from. \n \n \nThe promulgation of the great doctrines of religion; the being, and attributes, and providence of one Almighty God; the responsibility to him for all our actions, founded upon moral freedom and accountability; a future state of rewards and punishments; the cultivation of all the personal, social, and benevolent virtues; --- these never can be a matter of indifference in any well ordered community. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive, how any civilized society can well exist without them. And at all events, it is impossible for those, who believe in the truth of Christianity, as a divine revelation, to doubt, that it is the especial duty of government to foster, and encourage it among all the citizens and subjects. This is a point wholly distinct from that of the right of private judgment in matters of religion, and of the freedom of public worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. \n (boldface mine)\n \n I believe many of the benevolent virtues that he refers to have become matters of indifference today. In 1833 when this was written (or in 1933 for that matter) we didn't have state lotteries, we didn't have legalized gambling springing up everywhere, or fears of global warmng, or $1.4 trillion in national debt. After reading Pamela Winnick's book \"A Jealous God\", I'm wondering how close we are to a scientific theocracy. More from Story;\n \n \nProbably at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and of the amendment to it, now under consideration, the general, if not the universal, sentiment in America was, that Christianity ought to receive encouragement from the state, so far as it is not incompatible with the private rights of conscience, and the freedom of religious worship. An attempt to level all religions, and to make it a matter of state policy to hold all in utter indifference, would have created universal disapprobation, if not universal indignation. \n\n \n That universal indignation is now pretty well gone. It hasn't happened overnight, and it can't be righted overnight. I don't suggest that we can turn back the moral/philosophical clock to 1833 anyway. Exactly where I'm coming from is here; I don't want the U.S. to become a scientific theocracy, or a humanist theocracy. When we have a president who is promising foreign leaders that he is going to make commands concerning human behavior so as to bring about cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the public largely shrugs it off, we have an atheistic theocracy. It's every bit as ridiculous as it would be if the president was making rules and regulations in school curriculums, new tax breaks for churches etc., to fit his speculation about a need for at least a 75% Christian population by the year 2050. \n \n \nLet me put it this way: They bother me less than rude Christians. (Among whom, I hasten to add, I have no reason to number you.) \n\n \n I appreciate it. \n \n \nBut of course, the \"other side\" isn't claiming to represent Christian moral standards. Hence, the reason for my greater botheration. \n\n \n They claim to represent something superior/something that replaces it - humanist moral standards. Why does that make their viciousness less severe? \n \n \nNot in my case. Like you I was much more heavily acquainted with Christianity at an early age. My father is a Methodist minister.\n \n Of course, he's also a lifelong political liberal and a college biology major who hasn't interpreted the scriptures literally since well before he finished seminary in the early 70's. So my sympathy toward science is also longstanding.\n \n My sympathy toward atheists didn't start until I actually met some in college, and realized that they weren't out to take over the world, but that they were deeply persecuted by many religious believers.\n\n \n How could you tell who they were? I'm sure I work with atheists quite a bit, but I have no way of knowing who they are. I wouldn't \"persecute\" them anyway, (in my line of work it would probably get my butt kicked) but if they make it known who they are, how do you know to what extent they do or don't desire to take over the world, or at least, continue to separate church and state, thereby combining atheism and state?",

   "Perhaps. But what non-literalist believers do is try to acknowledge them and understand them.\n \n Marc, I don't know how I could be any more explicit about this than I already have, but I'll try:\n \n I do not think that inconsistencies within the Biblical text lessen the text's value. Nor do I think that inconsistencies prevent that text from expressing spiritual truths. But I do think that they count as evidence against the text's literality. That is all.\n \n I think it comes down to this: Must the Bible be literally true in order to express spiritual truths and have value? I say no. You seem continually to presuppose yes. Therein lies the source of our disagreement. \n\n \n It was considered literally true in the 19th century by much more of the population than it is today. The writings of Joseph Story show that that belief inspires a societal value to a greater extent than the allegory it's largely believed to be today. As I said, there are so many things going on in U.S. politics today that would have been completely unheard of 100, or 150 years ago. Legalized gambling, state lotteries, and trillions of national debt to name only a few. \n \n \nEver hear of the fallacy known as \"post hoc ergo propter hoc?\" It translates as \"after the thing, therefore because of the thing.\" It's very common, and you've committed it here. \n\n \n It's common, because history shows us how it happens all the time. After one little tax increase, another little tax increase. After no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less, no smoking on airlines at all. After one little gas milage requirement for new cars, another little gas milage requirement for new cars. Today's multi-trillion dollar federal government got there in very small steps over the last 100 years. \n \n \nEven if separation of church and state comes before declining religiosity, that's not sufficient to show that it causes declining religiosity. \n\n \n I think it's sufficient enough. A declining religiousity is a slope that's just as slippery as a growing government. What's not nearly as slippery are the claims that science will be completely ruined - that atheists will be hog-tied and dragged into church if we allow a public study of ID. Listen to some of the post hoc ergo propter hoc from atheism concerning ID sometime. \n \n \nAnd if anything the very example you quoted shows just the opposite! Look at the table. In 1981, 38% of Swedes said they never or almost never attended church. In 2000, 46% of Swedes answered that way. But the formal separation of church from state happened in 2000! What accounts for that 19-year, 8% rise? Certainly not the separation of church from state. If anything, it would appear that the decline of religion in Swedish culture is what caused the separation.\n \n I don't think you're reasoning about this very carefully. \n\n \n There are lots of things going on in a society besides direct government changes - secular ethics changes, secular moral changes, for example - that could have plenty to do with that 8% rise. \n \n \nAnd besides, I would definitely not want to have the state decide that I am, by birth, a member of such-and-such church. That was what was really at issue in the Swedish example. Is it something you find appealing? \n\n \n No, not at all. But equally, I don't want the state to decide that I am, by birth, a statistic in one of their philosophical scientific projections about what's going to be going on with earths global temperatures 40 years from now. \n \n \nWith all due respect, I would seriously question how much that editor really knows. Because...\n \n ...there are so many sources out there it's difficult to fathom how this sort of thing could be missed. Even among contemporary sources written for the laity, there are authors like Spong (Episcopal) or Armstrong (Catholic) or Ehrman (atheist -- but he used to be an evangelical -- coincidence? hmm...). A quick glance through their bibliographies can point you in a thousand different directions for material from all sides of these debates. \n\n \n It's easy to miss them if I believe the truth of the matter is already established. No matter how many contempory challenges there are to the truth, it still doesn't change the truth. There is a difference between seeking knowledge about something vs putting it to the test. \n \n \nCan't argue with that. But as usual, you seem to be making the mistaken assumption that if something is not literally true, it must be spiritually false. \n\n \n I think it's all the same. Actual truth, and actual fallacy, are on one level. If something spiritually false works for one person's application of it, it still doesn't make it any less false. \n \n \nYes, I do. Leaving aside the extremely loaded language -- \"rotted along with the other corpses,\" I love it -- this is at best an oversimplification and at times a flat-out dishonest misrepresntation of Spong's views.\n \n It's true, for example, that he doesn't believe Jesus was born of a virgin. Are you aware of all the textual problems there? Did you read the portion of the site addressing the issue? \"Alma\" means \"young woman.\" The point is not that it could never be used to designate a virgin, but that it never unambiguously connotes viriginity -- not any more than calling someone a \"young woman\" in English does. If you wanted to make sure that your listeners understood that someone was a virgin, would you describe her as a young woman? I doubt it. So if someone is described as being born of an \"alma,\" there is no reason at all to assume that he is born of a virgin. Whence the mistranslation concerning \"parthenos\" in the Septuagint and the Matthean gospel, since \"parthenos\" means \"virign.\" It's a term with a narrower meaning being used to translate a term with a broader meaning.\n \n As to the rape issue, I don't recall Spong ever having raised even the possibility in the books I've read, let alone asserting at as certain. In fairness, I've not read Spong's Born of a Woman, treating the virgin birth at length. But certainly it doesn't arise in Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism or Liberating the Gospels. Issues of Jesus' legitimacy arise. For when he is called \"the son of Mary\" in Mark 6, that's a striking claim. To call a Jewish man the son of his mother, rather than of his father, is to put his paternity into question. (And really, so what? Are lowly origins something a Christian ought to be ashamed of? Please.)\n \n Or on the issue of Jesus' divinity, Spong has said -- accurately -- that the Bible nowhere simply identifies Jesus with God. He is repeatedly characterized as \"the Son of God,\" and as the one in whom God is met. It's all very complicated, certainly more complicated than the author of your link lets on. \n\n \n emoticon_confused John 10:30 \"I and my Father are one\". What leads up to that makes clear that His Father is God. \n It looks like Spong uses complications to try to overturn basics. \n \n \nSimilar cases could be made about the other points raised by the link. Hardly a fair characterization of Spong. And hardly an author who gives evidence of understanding the very text he mocks Spong for failing to understand.\n \n You're acting like Spong is just making this stuff up. I hate to break it to you, but he's not. He's addressing the text with far more seriousness than do Biblical literalists.\n \n Baloney. One might just as well say the same thing of Homer's Iliad.\n \n And of course, you realize that there were a whole series of synods in the first four centuries A.D. making decisions about what was canon and what not, right? Like I said, you would do well to study the history of the compilation of the text. \n\n \n A whole series, yes, and I think they eventually got it right. I have no reason to doubt them anymore than atheists doubt all the scientific things they're told about evolution. \n \n \nExactly! It's just that I don't consider that \"joining with\" atheists.\n \n How so? Many of them seem to share your premise, that if the Bible is not literally true, it cannot express spiritual truths. As I have said repeatedly, I think that premise is faulty.\n \n You are of course free to disagree. But disagreeing isn't refuting. What exactly is the problem with my rejection of your premise? Or to put it another way, why must I accept that premise as true? That's what you're not arguing yet. \n\n \n It's not possible for increased study of the same thing to increase support for two conflicting conclusions about it. It's not logical to drop something from a reality realm to an allegorical realm and claim an increase in its significance. \n \n It is possible for creationists to share certain premises with atheists! There are several of them. \n \n \nOn the issue of literalism, what is there to debate? They don't interpret the Bible literally, and neither do I. Not much to debate on that front. \n\n \n The debate is in the ever increasing distance between the conclusions that you and them come to. \n \n \nAgain with the book count. For pity's sake, look at the numbers of creationist books that have been coming out for far longer than the last couple years. \n\n \n Horny, rebellious teenagers don't much like to look at creationist books when they're looking for excuses to do whatever they want to do. Atheism has a surface attraction to those who are the most vulnerable, and who are at the same time the most influential in the direction a society will go. \n \n \nI sincerely doubt that the decline in European religiosity is due to some insidious atheist plot. In fact, I would guess that both declining religiosity and increasing atheism are effects -- of causes that occured largely between 1914 and 1945.\n\n \n I don't think they have a thing to do with history. Maintaining a moral good society takes effort. It takes more effort to eat a plate of carrot sticks than it takes to eat a plate of glazed donuts. But the carrots are more beneficial in the long run. It's the same way with lots of human choices of behavior.",

   "\"Well written,\" perhaps. But poorly reasoned. It starts right away when the authors allege some contradiction/hypocrisy between Spong's explicit claim that words are never the truth and his claim that his own words are true; they manage to skate right past Spong's next sentence, despite having included it, where he explains that words are a medium for truth.\n \n And ultimately, not just poorly reasoned, but a dishonest misrepresentation of what he says. When the authors complain about how fundamentalists are stereotyped and bigoted, I was reminded of Lynard Skynard complaining in \"Sweet Home Alabama\" that Neil Young should remember, Southern Man don't need him around anyhow -- thereby proving Young's point. \n\n \n I never paid that much attention to exactly what Young was trying to say in \"Southern Man\", probably because there likely was nothing exact about it - music like that is often open to several interpretations. I do remember that rare back and fourth musical exchange he and LS had. :) Wasn't Young's innocent little \"Walk On\" tune a follow up to \"Sweet Home Alabama\"? \n \n \nI would strongly urge you not to rely on second-hand accounts -- not on these authors, but not even on me, either -- and read Spong for yourself before making any claims about what he does or doesn't mean, and how well he does or doesn't understand the Bible. \n\n \n If I'm still around 10 or 15 years from now I plan on doing some more reading. Too physically active to do much right now. But I'm not sure how good it is for someone to read something that obviously 'puts to the test' his worldview. \n \n \nAgreed. So should church and state, however, and that seems to be what you don't want. \n\n \n I don't think Story thought so either. He thought they could work together, and at the same time not interfere with personal freedom of choice. \n \n \nBeyond that, I am curious: Do you agree with Archie's claim that I have no relationship with God and Christ?\n\n \n I'm not going to say that, no. But I believe Archangel says that as his personal opinion, not as a judge. There is a difference. But it's my personal opinion that the line can be crossed if the Bible is bent too far beyond recognition. I'm not sure exactly where that line is, and I'm not all that concerned with finding it, and applying it to others.",

Let me know if you're interested in resuming this thread.\n \n \n...music like that [Neil Young's \"Southern Man\"] is often open to several interpretations.\n\n \n And so is the Bible! :)\n \n \nBut I'm not sure how good it is for someone to read something that obviously 'puts to the test' his worldview.\n\n \n And I suppose that's the difference between us! I really don't mind having my beliefs challenged. Sometimes, I find myself gaining more rigorous reinforcement for my views as I consider them more carefully. Other times, I find myself changing my views for the better.\n \n Regardless, I look at such tests as positive opportunities for spiritual growth, not as threats.\n \n \n[Joseph Story] thought [church and state] could work together, and at the same time not interfere with personal freedom of choice.\n\n \n Of course, he also once wrote that the way to guarantee this would be to have government provide a subsidy to all religions, without preferential treatment for any.
