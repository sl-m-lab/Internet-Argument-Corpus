   "Still, why is it dying down so much? Why would gay activists want marriage redefined if they aren't even going to take advantage of it?\n\n \n Pent-up demand. Perhaps you did not read the second page of your article. It would indeed be incredible if the gay and lesbian minority could sustain percentages of the total marriages like this(from your article)....\n \n \"A Globe survey of the largest communities in Massachusetts shows that in some cities and towns same-sex couples have sought licenses in numbers that far exceed their proportion of the overall population.\n \n In Boston, gay or lesbian couples made up 491 of the 2,365 couples who have applied for licenses since May 17, or 21 percent of the total. Although exact numbers are hard to come by, the percentage of gay and lesbian adults in Boston is probably no more than 10 percent, according to Gary J. Gates, a demographer at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., and the author of the \"Gay and Lesbian Atlas.\"\n \n Some Boston marriages probably involve people coming to the city because it offered an accepting environment. Gates said the relatively high number of gay and lesbian couples getting married probably reflects pent-up demand.\n \n \"You have to remember that same-sex couples haven't had the ability to marry, so you would expect a surge that probably would not be sustained over time as it becomes a much more normalized process,\" Gates said.\n \n In Provincetown and Northampton, same-sex couples made up the majority of people who received marriage licenses in the last six months.\n \n In Provincetown, 912, or 97 percent, of the 937 couples who have applied for licenses since May 17 are same-sex couples. In Northampton, 325, or 66 percent, of the 494 couples who got licenses were gay or lesbian.\n \n In Provincetown, 225 of the same-sex couples applied for licenses during the first week after May 17, and in Northampton 114 did. Other cities and towns also had relatively high percentages of same-sex couples applying: In Somerville 32 percent of the applicants were gay or lesbian couples, and in Springfield the percentage was 12 percent.\"",
