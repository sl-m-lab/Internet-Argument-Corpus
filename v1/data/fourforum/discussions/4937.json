   "What I fail to understand, #1 pointed out by a Saud spokesman, is why the US would push for increased oil production when:\n \n 1. US refining capability is actually diminishing when compared to consumption increases. \n 2. Oil is a commodity, price driven by supply and demand with no potential surplus as requirements for China and India are forecast to take big jumps.\n 3.

   "The White House is facing growing consumer unease over oil prices that have steadily risen during the past year, reflecting the rising demand for energy in China and India and little new global production. \n \n \n Oil prices have not risen that much. The dollar has dropped. Maybe it is time for Americans to catch on to this. When other coutries are reporting a 14% increase in fuel prices in the last 5 years, and we are seeing a 60-70% increase, this is the result of a weak dollar.\n \n \n \n\"Obviously, with the states like China, India and others coming on line, there is a concern about demand and supply. And those issues have to be addressed, not by jawboning, but by having a strategic plan for dealing with the problem,\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said. \n \n \n Especially since states like China and India have already cut their deals for oil, and the chinese are working a deal with the Canadians. Our current \"strategic plan for dealing with the problem\" seems to be to invade oil rich nations. \n \n \nBoth Saudi and U.S. officials focused on a previously announced long-term plan, in which Saudi Arabia pledged to invest $50 billion to expand its crude oil production capacity to about 12.5 million barrels a day by the end of the decade, and even more in the next decade. But officials said it was unclear whether it would lower oil prices in the near-term. \n \n \n And yet the suadi oil ministry has announced that they (the sauds) cannot possibly produce over 10 million BPD. Right now, they are at peak capacity and there are pumpos sitting idle, which would heavily suggest that they are on the downward side of their oil production either due to a natural peak, or because they have overpumped and damaged their fields. Keep the sheep headed towards the cliff.....\n \n \n\"Our policy is to ensure that the markets are adequately supplied. We have been doing so in the past. We are doing so now. We will do so in the future,\" he said\n\n \n No,their policy has always been to keep the price of oil as high as possible without making it so high as to decrease demand.\n \n \nThe American invasion of Iraq in 2003 angered Saudis. But U.S.-Saudi ties strengthened after the kingdom took steps to capture or kill senior al Qaeda members within its borders\n\n \n Yes, after they started atacking Saudi interests.",

I believe they're the largest single producer in the world, with customers other than the US. Even as the most repressive regime in the ME, if not the world, they and Kuwait are also the last ME oil producers using USD on an exclusive basis. That forces some of their customers to purchase US treasury issues to buy their oil, a circumstance that will become very interesting and possibly fluid when China decides the time is right to use their Yuan as economic clout.\n \n As Asia and others continue moving away from USD and going to mixed currency baskets for reserves, pressure to trade oil in currencies other than the USD will affect the Saud portfolio and the US Treasury.",

The company I worked for has doubled the number of wells we intend to drill per year, and put nearly triple the funds into raw exploration - and this is in the VERY mature Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.\n \n The Canadian oil sands project is juggernaut in and of itself.\n \n Many of the major oil companies are taking advantage of the current high prices to sell out of mature development oil properties and re-invest in exploration properties, some in NA, but many overseas.\n \n IMHO, their will be continued addition of new reserves through new discovery, but also very importantly, through technological advancement, and the application of that technology to new areas ie Russia.\n \n http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-060/\n \n Waxy",

While I'm not well-versed enough to agree/disagree with either camp, their consumption expansion numbers seem pitifully low based on demand of non-petroleum natural resource requirements by developing nations including Asia and India. \n \n Especially since the Sauds publicly consider their product fairly priced.

Regardless of how much is left, it is a more or less a finite resource and like any other non-renewable consumable will be priced accordingly.",

   "First, in 1992, the US governemtn was still refusing to admit that peak oil would ever be a problem. The Bush administration was still suggesting that the center of the earth may be made of oil until last year. \n \n \n Second, I think the real question in determining when oil productionmay peak is essentially a question of whose numbers you want to believe regarding reserves. If you reeally believe that the reserves of Abu Dabi increased from 32 billion barrels to 92 billion barrels between 1987 and 1988, or that Kuwaits reserves increase literally over the course of a month in 1984, from rougly 60 billion barrels to roughly 90 billion barrels, and has actually INCREASED every year, despite the fact that Kuwait is considered to be fully explored, and they have been pumping steadily since. \n \n Personally, I think that most OPEC coutries are lying about their reserves. In the early 80's, OPEC changed how they did business, and coutries with larger reserves pumped more oil, thus making more money. There was a FABULOUS increase in reported reserves over the next few year. Between 1988 and 1989, Sudi Arabia reported an increase in reserves form 170 to 257 billion barrels, and their projections have increased. At the same time, they are currently at full capacity, pumping less than 10 million barrels per day, and just last month the head of their oil ministry annouced that 12 million BPD was impossible, regardless of investment. \n \n As far as oil sands go, they are worthless as far as solving our problem.

Additionally, they need hot water to extract the hydorcarbon compounds. As energy costs increase, it gets more expensive to mine the sands and heat the water. It is much more energy intensive than simple oil extraction and transport. While there is new. Even with hydrotransport, you are pumping a slurry though the pipeline instead of just oil, so it is less efficient. \n \n Like other straight oil alternatives, you need cheap energy to keep it economically viable. It will always be better than biomass based energy and such because the energy density of your product is higher, but it will still never be as good as just pumping oil out of the ground. Assuming the oil prodcued from a given well is 100%, only 2% of that amount of energy needs to be used to extract the oil, so you effectively get to \"keep\" 98% of the energy that flows out of an oil well. Tar sands ont he other hand, even with hydrotransport and other new technologies, you only get to \"keep\" 67% f the energy.\n \n \nThey are currently the brightest star in North American oil production, and IMHO, with continued technological advances and sustained prices, they will continue to be a star.

Not at all. You simply lie about the geology. US companies have been doing this for years. They underreport initial finds and then overreport for years following. \n\n \n To the best of my knowledge, this is only partially correct as far as the middle east is concerned, I can't comment on Russia with any real authority, other than to say that we do have access to the basics of the geology and reservoir properties there (the basics is all they have). \n \n The USGS survey, among others, have a very accurate data when it comes to the geology of the middle east. Production data is also available. Don't forget who's technology and service companies are doing the work. \n \n Reserves analysis is not rocket science, it boils down to simple equations needing only simple input data - porosity, thickness, water saturations, permeability, pressures, etc... None of those parameters are national secrets that I'm aware of.\n \n It's not easy to just \"lie about the geology\". Middle eastern geology is about as straightforward as it gets, and it's well understood. They were simply blessed with large porous containers of rock with really good lids.\n \n Furthermore, US/Canadian companies haven't been lying about the geology for years. That's a sweeping statement that I would challenge you to support with actual data. The system used by the oil industry to quantify reserves has been in place for decades, it is stringently monitored by the gov't, internally, and by external private enterprise. I'd never say that the rules don't get bent, of course they do, but it's not an easy thing to pull off and the risks are huge, it will bite you in the posterior.\n \n Reserves are not simply \"reported\" they are calculated based on numerous factors. As fields are developed, the numbers change, both up and down, that's simple reality.\n \n \nOil sands must be mined instead of merely pumped. Additionally, they need hot water to extract the hydorcarbon compounds. As energy costs increase, it gets more expensive to mine the sands and heat the water.

Tar sands ont he other hand, even with hydrotransport and other new technologies, you only get to \"keep\" 67% f the energy.\n \n Comparable to the ME, but with higher total production costs by several orders of magnitude, production costs that increase as energy costs increase. \n\n \n SOME oil sands are pumped/mined. Much of the initial recoverable oil is producable in an essentially convential manner, directly up the well bore. It is done using simple and effective current technology - tight well spacing and secondary/tertiary recovering techniques (CO2 flood, SAGD) applied as part of initilal production.\n \n I would never argue that the oil sands/heavy oil region can directly compete with middle east crude, or any OPEC nation, right now. Cost and crude quality are inferior, and energy returns are not comparable. However, with an initial volume in place of 1.6 trillion barrels and a remaining ultimate potential of 311 billion producable barrels (with current technology) it's a resource that is going to be a dominant player in the near future. \n \n IMHO, the associated production costs will become moot as the end of CHEAP oil nears.\n \n \nIt was my understanding that the chinese invested in MEG Energy, whose primary purpose is to extract oilsands. It was a coupel weeks ago, but it seems like they purchased around 15% of the company.\n\n \n I'm not 100% on the details, but I believe that's correct. I've also heard that they are looking to considerably increase their presence, but have met with some resistance from Canadian producers and the Alberta government.\n \n Husky Energy (a major player) is also majority owned by a Chinese businessman.\n \n Waxy",
