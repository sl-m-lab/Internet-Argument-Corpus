   "Put a Fork in it - Liberalism is Dead  \n One thing came out loud and clear from last night's election. Liberalism is dead. EVERY gay marriage ban won big, Daschle lost his job and the Republicans picked up seats in both the House and Senate during a Presidential election cycle (unusual).\n And with the highest popular vote ever received, GW is back. Maybe this time, he'll think about the Conservatives who came out in droves, especially in Ohio, to give him the win. (The exit polls classified 25% of Ohio voters are \"Evangelical Christians\" and they voted HEAVILY Republican)\n emoticon_xlove emoticon_xlove emoticon_xlove emoticon_xlove",

   "My only skepticism is the transitional period that will leave the current recipients underfunded when todays workers start holding out their contributions into their own private funds. SS has always been a pyramid scheme that relied on todays workers to subsidize yesterdays retirees. Where does that void in funding come from?? \n\n \n Since there is a better than average chance that SS will be collapsing with the retirement of the baby boomers, it may be a good time to reform it. \n \n You are 100% correct, though, and I for one have heard no workable plan for how to fund SS for the current generation of retirees if we allow funds to be diverted (most projections show SS going under even pulling full funds from current employees).\n \n \nTort reform will only help if it applies accross the board. Medical is only one small part of the problem. Product liability is choking virtually all industries and it's cost has to be passed on through their products. Get a handle on jury awards, stop natural disasters, eliminate terrorism, and you'll see that lower premium because it will create a buyer's market again for policyholders.\n\n \n It is the \"stop natural disasters\" and \"eliminate terrorism\" that I think will sink this plan :) I doubt we will see a buyers market for liability insurance for a LONG time. Matrix pricing. enough said.\n \n \n \nProfit isn't a dirty word as long as it isn't extorted from the consumer. You have a choice on buying the Nike's. Besides, it would only cost them $1 to make them if they didn't pay so much for their liability coverage! :)\n\n \n I have no problem with profit. I am simply saying that, given corporate Americas reluctance/failure to pass savings on to their customers, I think that the whole \"it will save us all money\" thing is a crock.\n \n The whole tort reform thing is a chicken and egg scenario. We need tort reform because we have a nation full of greedy lawyers. Unfortunatly, we also have a nation full of greedy, unscrupulous corporations who have no problem with marketing defective (sometimes to the point of being lethal) products.\n \n As much as I hate to say it, the courts and civil actions do help keep companies in line. Maybe what we need is new criminal legislation, and prosecutors with the cahones to use it whihc would allow them to hold corporate executives criminally responsible for damages caused by products which were known to be defective or dangerous at the time of their release.",

   "It kills me that putting a maximum value on someone's life and limb is seen as \"reform.\" Putting caps on damages punishes the victims of negligence and malpractice while reducing the incentive to companies, hospitals, and doctors to practice safely. If there will be real reform, it will make lawyers more accountable. Maybe there should be caps on lawyers fees, but not on damages. These are the only incentives that companies and hospitals have to be accident and malpractice free.\n\n \n I disagree. Doctors don't need the threat of outrageous lawsuits to keep them on their toes. A doctor who has been found negligent can lose his lisence to practice medicine. A hospital can lose its reputation, good doctors and patients if it fails to provide good services. The threat of bankruptsy at every turn doesn't make for better doctors, it just makes for needless tests and increased CYA activities. There are enough carrots AND sticks out there without windfall suits.\n \n\n If we want to see a reduction in liability damages then companies have to make safe products and lawyers have to have limits on the fees they can score from lawsuits. \n \n\n In many ways, I believe that product liability lawsuits should be regulated heavily. For example, if a drug company follows all of the FDA's protocols in the development of a new drug and doesn't hide anything and the FDA approves the drug, liability should be extremely limited and directed towards the FDA. The same should hold true for automotive companies. If a vehicle is certified by the NHTSA, then the manufacturer shouldn't be held liable for unforeseen risks unless there is an unapproved change in the vehicle manufacturing process that wasn't certified.",
