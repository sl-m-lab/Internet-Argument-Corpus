   "D-Day was never close to the largest invasion, it wasn't even the largest amphibious assault. Hitler's Operation Barbarossa was the largest by far, over 3,000,000 soldiers, and millions of more reinforcements invaded the USSR, the largest amphibious assault was Stalingrad when millions of Soviet troops crossed the Volga into Stalingrad, it was also long close to half a year, and 3.5 million people died in the battle, and 300,000 germans were captured, more people than were involved in D-Day. The USSR lost 50,000,000 people in that war, most industrialized factories were burned too, only 175,000 were involved at D-Day. also 80% of Germans killed in the war were from Soviets, also US/UK went from France to Central Germany, USSR went from Moscow/Stalingrad/Leningrad to Central Germany. So the real beginning of the defeat of Hitler was the victory at Stalingrad, not D-Day.\n Also did anyone know that 100,000 German POW's in US hands died AFTER peace was declared, I still can't find how many died DURING.\n \n And with Japan, USSR did go to war with Japan, and killed Japan, when cease-fire was declared, USSR overran Manchuria, Japan's resource and military stronghold, in only a month.\n \n And might I remind you Japanese-American concentration camps.\n \n So you are pretty much right that the largest assault was on the shores of Europe, but not the English Channel, THE VOLGA.",
