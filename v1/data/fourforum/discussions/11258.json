   "Weekend Thoughts\n \n by\n \n Isly Ilwott \n \n Living near the edge of undisturbed hardwood forests has to rank among the highest of placement pleasures. (Being where you want to be.)\n \n If my placement pleasure meter is in the red zone, I don't want to move. If it pegs out, I am immobile. As I walk the trail north from my back door, I see nothing man made. I see nothing Rubbermaid. I see nothing but what the earth made possible...nature. The farther I get into nature to get out of sight from manmade stuff, the higher my placement pleasure meter reads. I'd rather not turn around and go home to eat. I'd rather not hear the manmade speakers blaring the manmade sounds that mask the sounds of nature. I'd rather not have to reject all the invitations to focus my attention on their messages, most of which are related indirectly or specifically to the contents of my purse in the form of a cash transfer from me to them in exchange for some worthless, manmade trinket. The walk in the woods is free.\n \n If I could just find some food and build a nest out of downed limbs and vegetation, I could live here, free as a bird. Since I don't have the feathers required to sleep naked in the woods throughout the year, I can't be a bird...but I can watch them and wish I were. \n \n There's a place I went several times during my high school years to camp out with friends on one's aunt's hill-infested, wooded farm. There was pasture enough for hundreds of cows, but the majority of her eighteen or so hundreds of acres was hardwood and huntable. Almost any species of game animal and wildlife known to exist within a hundred miles of her place could be seen there under the right circumstances. It was this place that was a catalyst in developing my interest in nature and the enjoyment of undisturbed times in it.\n \n She had cleared the underbrush from the woods within view of the three-story, anti-bellum wood home, but in the camping areas we frequented, there was firewood waiting on the ground all through the year. Most of the campsites were just a few yards from one of the many tractor trails she had developed over the years to make it easier to search for wayward cows in the woods. She'd ride by on her tractor or in an old, but well kept Chevrolet pickup saying she was looking for a stray when (we think) she was just checking on us kids.\n \n We built fires and cooked something whether we slept in the woods or went back to the farmhouse to sleep. Sometimes we'd caught it, sometimes we'd bought it...but it was always good to cook it on our own fire...and share amongst friends. \n \n The top benefit of sleeping in the house was the smell of breakfast waking you up as you gradually regained your sense of touch and stretched around under the lightweight comforters layered on the soft bed, wishing you didn't have to get dressed to eat. It would have been unwise to ask my friend's aunt to serve me breakfast in bed because she would have cheerfully done it, making me feel guilty all day long. Besides, she could teach any person tall enough to see the top of the stove how to cook guinea eggs in bacon fat and to make buttered biscuits that only Hardee's gets close to matching these days. I think it was the butter...which, by the way...she made in an old wooden churn from milk she'd pumped from her own cows. She was in her eighties when we were in high school and she could out work any two of us. It was she that taught me that you don't have to swing the axe very hard at all...if you keep it sharp and hit the right spot on what you're cutting...or splitting. Your aim is more important than the fierceness of the blow. To this day, I keep my Swedish axe and matching hatchet sharp enough to shave fuzz from peaches.\n \n Staying in the woods 'til daylight was good in a different way. On a clear, crisp night you could see through the hole that invariably exists overhead some of the millions of stars dotting the black background. At one favorite spot near the river, you could see millions of them for lack of trees. Sometimes on moonlit nights we'd fly fish while standing on a sand bar, casting across the wide spot where the water looked still. Through the night you could hear various animals making their various calls for whatever purpose they had. I remember owls, tree frogs, an occasional wildcat, some boar and sometimes a lonely cow, waiting for the putt-putting sound of the tractor coming at daybreak. She always got up early...to count her cows.\n \n The old two-cylinder John Deere was difficult to crank even on a mild day. On a cold day it could take a real country while. I think that's why we saw the truck more in the winter. It started with a punch or two of a button on the floorboard, next to the gas peddle, had a four-speed, floor-mounted shifter and road like a dump truck. Back then it was called a \"three quarter ton shevy\". It was built more like a railcar with a truck body, with little coach windows in the cab's rear corners, vacuum windshield wiper motors that would stop when you mashed on the gas, a vinyl bench seat made like a thin box-spring mattress, an airplane-looking windshield in two pieces and an exterior sun visor that would also keep rain off the windshield of you were sitting still. We think it was a forty-nine model or so.\n \n There was a place at a creek crossing where a shallow ditch had been eroded and ran nearly forty-five degrees across the road like a crooked speed bump...shaped like a miniature Grand Canyon with steep walls and depth exceeding its width. She'd ease across it at idle speed in grandma gear and you'd think you were on a speeding bobsled, jostling from side to side, down toward the seat and then up toward to roof...feel a bang on the top of your head...your neck seems shorter. She'd laugh and say that it still beats walking. We asked once why she didn't fill in the ditch. \"It's natural!\" she said. \"I might build a bridge over it someday, but I'll not fill it in.\" That was a manifestation of her respect for nature. She didn't want to change it.\n \n The house was built when wood was the source of heat. Unlike most others that had numerous chimneys around the perimeter, this one had a single big chimney near the center. There was a fireplace in every bedroom, three on each of two floors and two on the third, each sharing one flue or another in the chimney. The main fireplace was huge and had a wrought iron bracket that was hinged vertically at one corner of the opening like a door to swing a hook from over the fire to over the brick floor in front of the hearth. There was a large cast iron, three-legged kettle that hung on a chain from the hook. She'd cook in it occasionally, when there was a big party to feed but mostly she cooked on the wood-burning stove in the kitchen, using cast iron skillets, enameled steel pots, some copper bowls and an old cast pot-metal teapot molded to look like a woven basket. It took a lot of firewood to get through a winter, especially if she had many of the hunting guests that would use her home for hunting camp during the best parts of deer season. She never charged them but they always left her more than the cost of a good bed and breakfast. The firewood always came from her land so she never had to buy it. She would find fallen trees rather than harvest them, putting her old crawler tractor to work pulling the trimmed logs across the pasture and up to the level ground beside the barn. There she had a really old drop-head circular saw with a four foot blade that ran off a flat belt pulley system driven by the John Deere tractor engine as it sat choked in some depressions made to fit the rear wheels, running about one third throttle in neutral. From where she'd parked the log, she'd help it roll down a slight grade onto a large steel dolly that was mounted on rails long enough to move the log past the saw. The log would end up in two foot lengths, cut smoothly and squarely with that noisy blade, gathered rather randomly at the bottom of the hill they'd roll down after dropping off the end of the saw frame. She had bought the saw and rail system from an old saw mill when it went modern years before we started the camping visits. Sawing time drew volunteers from around the county to help her move those logs around and store the cut wood. She'd have a splitting party for that wood as soon as it dried enough...if it wasn't already. It was at one of those that she taught me about the sharp axe and the marksmanship. There was a hydraulic splitter to get the big logs quartered, but the stick size she wanted for tending the stove and fireplaces required many subsequent splits. Her fires seemed to burn hotter with the smaller pieces and that's the way she wanted it.\n \n Her pantry held jar after jar of jellies, jams and preserves, honey, molasses, beans, peas, corn, tomatoes, okra, pickled eggs, pickles, dried fruit and home-made beef jerky...all neatly dated in her hand with a consistent font in black grease pencil.\n \n There was large smoke house a bit away from the house where she'd cure that beef jerky, hang hams and beef ribs when they'd slaughter once a year. I didn't particularly like that part of my visits, but after all of the killing and cleaning was done, it was fun to make the sausage, the stew and the cracklin' cornbread and cabbage that it took to have the party. None of her volunteers ever left hungry or empty handed. It seemed they all considered it a blessing to be a part of her life. They hadn't come for the food...but she wouldn't let them leave without it.\n \n The weekends became more frequent for those of us who liked it. I think sometimes that she invited back only those who seemed to enjoy the daily chores that come with a farm that size. We went from being friends of her nephew to being friends of her's, welcome to visit with or without him or a camping trip. Here I was not yet twenty, finding myself to be a favored friend of an eighty year old woman that lived alone, but not alone in a one hundred twenty year old house in the middle of nature in the form of a huge farm. She liked the others from my group, but I could see that she lingered with me longer than with them. I think she could tell by my aversion to watching the slaughters that I had a big heart for animals. Even though I fully accepted the idea of killing and cooking a fish from the river or a game animal from the hunt, it was different when you'd fed, petted and talked to the lamb. I think she knew this all too well. That's why her favorite farms animals were the milk cows. She never slaughtered them. In daily routine, she would feed them, keep them wintered, allow them to roam as they please through the natural forests around the pasture, treat their ills, be their midwife, wash their udders...and they would give her milk...daily! She knew them by name and deplored the orange, numbered ear tags required to be riveted through their ears by the county inspector. She told him once if he'd just remember their names, he wouldn't need the tags either.\n \n She took early morning walks with her rubber boots and walking staff, making hooting sounds and talking to each cow as they passed by her in the procession headed the other way toward the milking barn. Counting them as they appeared from one trail or another, she would keep a mental list of those she'd seen. When the number of them exceeded half the cows, she'd switch to thinking of which ones were missing. Each one would be removed from that list until all were accounted for. More often than not, she had to hunt a few of them for several minutes.\n \n As the cows would file into the milking barn they would enter separate stalls and be prepped by the dairy workers for attachment to the sterilized, four-tube milking machines that would harvest the liquid payback that supported the rest of the farm. The head ends of the stalls faced each other in two long rows, butting against two long feed troughs that ran parallel down the center of the barn with an aisle between them to roll the feed wagon. While the cows were lined up nibbling on their reward for entering the stall, she'd walk up and down between the feed troughs rubbing the cow's foreheads and talking to each one as if they understood her words. The income from the milk was more than enough to support the vegetable farming, the harvesting of the hay and the feeding of the hogs. I think the cows felt her love without knowing what her words meant.\n \n I found myself wanting to be around her more often that not. We would talk for hours in the winter nights while sitting with our sock feet perched on little wicker-topped stools placed near the big fireplace, each having been used for that purpose so long that the wooden legs facing the fire had become charred near their tops. She would recount images of when she was a youngster, learning by experience what it took to keep cows. Before the automatic milking machines, the milking was done by hand...and it had to be done every day, no matter what else was happening. There were no family vacations, no weekends out of town and no days off. The milking came before all other things. Her parents had sent her to an all-girls school that had not a single course in animal husbandry or agriculture. Though she had some interests in the literature and arts courses, she was bored with the attempt to become a liberal arts graduate and wanted more than anything else to return to the farm. There were books there enough to read...and cows that she'd seen born.",
