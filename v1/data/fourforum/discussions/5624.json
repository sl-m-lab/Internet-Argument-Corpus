   "Court allows lawsuit in '92 death of girl, 13, during abortion \n \n June 10, 2005\n \n BY STEVE PATTERSON Staff Reporter \n \n \n \n The mother of a teenager who died while having an abortion in 1992 can sue the Chicago clinic where it happened, the Illinois Court of Appeals ruled Thursday.\n \n Deanna Bell was 13 and nearly six months pregnant when the procedure was performed at the Albany Medical Surgical Center.\n \n She died on the last day of a three-day abortion procedure, her attorneys said, because of an overdose of anesthesia administered by the clinic staff.\n \n Her mother, Dianne Adams, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 1994 against the clinic at 5086 N. Elston Ave., but a jury ruled in favor of the clinic and its California-based owner, Family Planning Associates Medical Group, five years later.\n \n The appellate court reversed that decision in 2000, claiming a Cook County judge wrongfully blocked some evidence from being heard.\n \n Claim 'too much anesthesia'\n \n \n \n The suit was refiled in 2004, but clinic attorneys asked the court to dismiss it because so much time had elapsed. Though the family's attorneys blamed the delays on court docketing errors, a judge agreed to throw out the case.\n \n That decision was appealed by the girl's mom, and Thursday's appellate court decision reinstates the suit, finding there indeed were clerical errors.\n \n Attorney David Myers, who's representing the family with Charles Hervas, said the case could be reheard by year's end.\n \n Myers said they plan to show Deanna got \"way too much anesthesia\" and it \"slowed everything down, including her respiration.\" \"Nobody noticed,\" he said, \"until it was too late.\"\n \n Clinic officials declined comment, and their attorney did not return a call.\n \n http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-abort10.html",

While treatment is crucial, he said, preventing infection in the first place is still the only true protection against the disease.\n The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest homosexual-rights group, said the new HIV numbers were \"a wake-up call\" for a comprehensive, science-based plan to prevent AIDS.\n Dr. Jaffe cautioned that the higher number of new HIV cases could reflect higher numbers of people getting tested for HIV, as the tests show a new diagnosis but not necessarily a new infection. But the CDC official also noted that HIV diagnoses among other vulnerable groups have been stable.\n The HIV numbers could point to a new trend but could also be \"a blip in the data\" because of the new CDC surveillance system, said David C. Harvey, executive director of AlDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families.\n In any case, it's a sign that \"we need to renew our efforts on HIV prevention and we need the Bush administration to focus more on these issues,\" said Mr. Harvey. Investments in HIV prevention in the United States have paid off with lower transmission rates, he said. \"Condoms work, exclamation point.\"\n To Pete LaBarbera, an analyst with the Culture and Family Institute of Concerned Women for America, the rising HIV cases among homosexual men show the limits of multimillion-dollar campaigns about avoiding AIDS.\n \"The safer-sex message is not working. If gay men haven't heard of HIV and health risks, nobody has,\" he said. Despite untold millions spent on education, \"the reckless behavior continues,\" he said.\n \"Maybe it's time for the CDC and federal government to research the particular health risks associated with gay sex,\" said Mr. LaBarbera. \"The federal government studies the health risks of smoking. Maybe there needs to be some public education on the risks [of homosexuality.]\"\n Other proposed CDC approaches include stepped-up HIV testing among at-risk populations and education campaigns aimed at teaching HIV-positive people how to not transmit the virus.\n According to the CDC, about 70 percent of new HIV cases occur among men.\n The highest-risk group is men who have sex with men, representing 42 percent of new HIV cases. Men and women infected through heterosexual relations are the second-highest risk group, accounting for 33 percent of new HIV cases. Intravenous drug users are third, comprising 25 percent of new cases.\n Last year was the third year in a row in which homosexual and bisexual men saw an increase in new HIV cases. In 1999, there were 6,561 new cases from this group. In 2002, there were 7,723 new cases, a 17.7 percent increase.\n The new CDC HIV tracking system may soon determine whether a new case is also a new infection. A new test, which is supposed to be in place by next year in 35 locales that account for 93 percent of annual HIV infections, will use a blood test that can determine whether a person became infected with HIV in the previous six months.\n The new system will identify areas and populations where HIV is being transmitted, say CDC officials.\n An estimated 850,000 to 950,000 Americans are infected with HIV.",

Men and women infected through heterosexual relations are the second-highest risk group, accounting for 33 percent of new HIV cases. Intravenous drug users are third, comprising 25 percent of new cases.\n So it seems like more and more straight men and women are also having unprotected sex. So really the concern seems to the increase of HIV infections amongst both gays and straights. \n \nI agree that it isn't limited to gays just as accidents aren't limited to drunk drivers, but the chances of aquiring AIDS are greater just as the odds of a drunk getting in an accident are greater. So, logically, shouldn't we be discouraging risky homosexual behavior with the same vigor that we discourage drunk driving?\n Logically? As in that being a valid deduction? No. \n \n Here's why: Discouraging one set of behaviour (1) with the vigour by which another set of behaviour (2) is discouraged purely on the grounds that both sets of behaviour are riskier than their respective alternatives is invalid because no stipulation has been made in your premises with regard to how the equivalence of increased risk relates to the vigour by which a set of behaviours is discouraged.\n \n Without a premises stating equivalency of vigour is to be determined, you've underdetermined your conclusion in failing to do this and thereby invalidated it.\n \n Off-hand though I quite agree with the idea of filing assault charges against people that give other people sexually transmitted diseases.",

Can't say I've ever had that happen to me and I can imagine that people who experience it should probably clean themselves more carefully, change their diet, and remember to relieve themselves at least an hour before engaging in anal play.\n This may surprise you, but you can get LGV from opposite sex partners, especially in the tropics. Likewise so-called \"gay bowel syndrome\", GBS, is merely a collection of infections that you can also get from opposite sex partners such Shigella, Giardia, Campylobacter-like organisms, Entamoeba, Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. \n \n So, do you actually know any STDs that are exclusive to homosexuals?\n Except that there are no particular health concerns that gay people have that straight people don't share, and your religious beliefs are your own which you have no legal or moral right to force others to hold.\n\n \n \n On that note, I think that I'll gracefully bow out of this discussion before I toss my dinner.",

Hetero-hetero sexual contact is a small subset of hetero infections.\n \n \n\n UNITED STATES:\n \"HIV/AIDS Testing: Men Who Have Sex with Men Should Undergo Frequent HIV Testing\" AIDS Weekly, (06.06.2005) \n In the current study, Randall A. Roark and colleagues at the University of California-San Francisco reported, \"HIV counseling and testing has been a cornerstone of AIDS prevention strategies, with men who have sex with men [MSM] being specifically targeted for the counseling and testing. Unfortunately, it appears that exposure to HIV counseling and testing has little effect on the behaviors of those who test negative.\" Recently, CDC altered its recommendations on when and how frequently MSM should undergo testing for HIV and other STDs, recommending annual testing for sexually active MSM and even more frequent testing for MSM who engage in highest risk behaviors, the researchers noted. \n \n \"Using data from our study, we evaluated the new recommendations with respect to HIV testing. Overall, 81 percent of [MSM] in our sample reported never having tested positive for HIV,\" the researchers stated. Among MSM in South Beach, almost 8 percent tested positive on their current test. Of those testing HIV-positive, just more than half had not been tested in the previous 12 months; just under half said they had tested negative within the past nine months. \n \n \"Reporting multiple (four or more) anal sexual partners during the past 12 months was significantly associated with a positive test result,\" the study found. \"Our results support the new CDC guidelines regarding more frequent testing for sexually active men who have sex with men, with having a high number of anal partners being a significant indicator of need for testing more often than annually in our population,\" the researchers concluded. \n \n The study, \"HIV Testing Among Men Who Have Sex with Men: How Often Should One Test?,\" was published in the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (2005;11(1):18-24). \n \n",
