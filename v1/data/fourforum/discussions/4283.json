   " You might think that criminality arises from the defective moral character etc. of people who find it easier to take from others what they don't want to work for themselves.\n\n \n Some of it does. It's overly simplistic to say that it is either/or logic. There are many factors at work when it comes to criminal behavior; nature and nurture. Some crimininals honestly just don't care about other people, and they are selfish, but that's just an outting of the inner nature of all human beings. They are either are unable to control themselves and their desires or they just don't care. Either way... it's bad.\n \n \n\n But this is a naive view of criminal mentality - according to my friend who works in the Probation Service. Here's a more \"sophisticated\" take on the subject:\n\n \n Is he a probation officer or something?\n \n \n\n OK. You are well off: you have a money, house, quality car, valuables, etc. - perhaps more than you \"deserve\", if the envy model of social equity is taken seriously.\n\n \n I know this is true for some people, to some extent. Jealously of wealth of others is a factor for crime, but not the only one. Everyone deserves exactly that for which he works. No one else, short of taxes, is entitled to anything. THere is no social \"duty\" to equalize wealth. It's a nice thing to some extent, and every society needs some distribution of wealth to close the gap, but everyone is entitled to anything they can get legally.\n \n \n Meanwhile, I'm broke - with no job, no prospects, and no money to finance the habits and hobbies that make me happy.\n \n \n\n How can the economic balance between you and me be adjusted ?\n\n \n Quite simply, they decide to steal, but there is a difference, in my opinion, between necessity and pleasure. The people who steal, if there is no alternative (which in many cases their are), should only take necessities, while luxuries, under no circumstances, should ever be stolen. As a general rule, you don't want anyone to steal anything in a society regardless.\n \n \n \n \n\n Here comes the \"theory\": In performing my so-called \"criminal duty\", I'm merely acting as an agent of social justice by redistributing a little wealth. This has both the beneficial effect of correcting some of the economic discrepancy that exists between you and me and, if enough other people follow my example, the benefits of my behaviour have a cumulative effect (i.e.throughout society). Isn't a more egalitarian society a \"good thing ? And isn't my larceny a valid contribution towards that end ? What I do is by no mean an odious activity but advantageous to civil society.\n\n \n Anyone who legitimizes that social theory as acceptible is crazy, quite honestly. It's not serving social utilty to go around stealing the wealth of others. Egalitarianism  is a good thing, but it depends on how you look at it or apply it. Stealing to get it or taking other's property is not good, nor is it just. It's not a utilitarian society. You cannot make everyone equal or exactly as happy as one another, because if you go too far, as above, everyone suffers potentially.\n \n How is theft, which breeds more crime and violence, of social utility? How is living in fear that your belongings you earned serving social order and utility?",

   "My opinion:\n Criminals don't really care if the victim is well off or not, while it is beneficial to steal from the rich (they have a lot of good stuff), anyone will do, as long as they have something of value.(family and friends are on the victim list)\n People steal because 1. They enjoy it, they get high on stealing, and can use the items themselves and won't have to buy it. 2. They are kleptomaniacs and can't help it. 3. They need some quick money or property they can turn into money quickly. 4. They are greed corporate gluts and have the ability to launder money or fix their books.\n \n Of all the above, I have more disgust for the corporate glut than I do the cattle rustler.",

   "You don't agree ? Well, what's wrong with my point of view ?\n\n \n I suspect you`re trying to make a sophisticated point about tax/resource re-duistribution is theft, no?\n \n One could make the counter-argument that, unlike the situation with a thief, taxes and democraticly* decided resource distribution is a part of the social contract. Where you have a simple choice of abide to the democraticly decided laws at hand (including taxes) or withdraw from the country. You don`t have that choice with a thief.\n \n Another way to look at it is that property rights are defined, created and protected by the democratic government. As the right to property isn`t an absolute, but rather a social construct, or tool if you will, for the people, they have the right to infringe it.\n \n * I`m emphasising democratic, as a despot cannot be said to have the same powers/rigths attributed as the people.",
