   "Thinking about it more, it does raise some important points in general about religion which I think underlie a lot of people's opposition to it (seperate from their lack of beleif).\n What you attribute to Budda fits more generally in what people call the 'Golden Rule', and is the foundation of the social contract (i.e by working with others you will benefit yourself). However Jesus takes this a step forward with the turn the other cheek and forgiveness ideas - basically saying its not our place to judge others, its someone Else's job and trying to impose your own flawed opinions on someone else will only lead to more suffering even if it is done for the noblest of reasons. \n \n However this runs into some serious problems, if everyone followed his teachings then the world would be a very happy but very different place indeed, but what price is worth paying to reach this goal? Is it justifiable to turn your back on Jesus' teachings to attempt to further them, as while pacifist martyrs can be a powerful agent for change they are hard to recruit and in many cases are just not effective. They rely too much on the culture being influenced to recognise its own values being made manifest in the martyr and the hypocracy of their own actions. \n If you take pride in being strong or fierce dedication to your God, the message of the martyr could easily just completely pass you.\n \n Christianity owes its popularity far more to it being enforced and backed up by power than due to the nature of its own beliefs, as do most world religions today (which is no suprise). How can the need to unhold your beliefs be reconceiled with the need to diseminate them?\n Its easy to respect someone who will die before turning on their beleifs if said pacifist beleifs are being persecuted by your government, its a totally different story when they try to tell you to forgive and love your wife's and daughter's murderer and rapist, especially when they tell you that they too can reach heaven if they see the error of their ways.\n Is saving other's souls worth the price of your own, or are you not really saving them at all due to the hypocritical example you lead being interpretted as acceptable?",

   "It's 13:8. Did you actually look it up?\n \n The Greek word is opheilete, from opheilw meaning 'I owe'. How can it mean 'I choose to establish a covenant relationship with'?\n \n They didn't really have primates in Judea. And in any case, it's not necessarily from Darwin: it's based more on their apparent intelligence and sensitivity. \n Slightly dodgy, as John the Baptist is hardly a normal child, and the 'leapt' could be a reaction of the Spirit: after all, a fetus cannot literally leap.\n\n \n Yep looked it up. Simply transposed. The greek word meaning I owe cannot be defined outside of the context of the passage. There are many meanings and the one that is contextually appropriate is the one I gave.\n \n Now then, are you actually telling me that people in Judea had no idea that primates existed? Are you saying that they had never seen a monkey of any kind? Are you saying that Paul (Saul of Tarsus) who had Roman citizenship and was highly educated had no concept of the behavior of various primates? I think it could easily be shown that a world traveller such as Paul had seen monkeys in the market place etc. To say that he could not possibly make any connections would be really stretching.\n \n As for John the Baptist example, the fact that a child could be indwelt by the spirit of God gives credence in and of itself of the life within the womb.\n \n Trebor: Could you provide the specific reference you are speaking of. I am having trouble locating it. Also, remember that God's direction that a child be killed is not an indication of the lack of worth of the child. Also, you cannot logically compare God's decisions and judgements with those of Humans. God is distinctly different in nature. He is not Human. He can see both future and past perfectly. For a human to determine life or death is a different thing.\n \n EF",

   "Jesus' Resolute Love\n \n The first thing the Cross means to me is the determination of Jesus to set us free from the wages of sin and death. In the story of the transfiguration of Jesus on the mount, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke with him concerning His upcoming death, which He was about to bring to fulfillment in Jerusalem. A few verses later, in Luke 9:51 we read, \"As the time approached for Him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.\" He resolutely set out for Jerusalem. Knowing that according to the scriptures he would be beaten, whipped, spat upon and cursed, and knowing that He would be nailed to the cross like a common criminal, with the sins of the entire world upon his shoulders, and knowing that for the first and only time in the history of creation that He undeservedly would face the full wrath of His heavenly Father, whom He loved with all His heart, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. I don't know of any scripture in the Bible that is more powerful and meaningful to me than that one. What did we see in the wilderness with John the Baptist? Did we see a \"reed shaken by the wind?\" And we didn't see that at the cross of Calvary, either. What we saw was the destruction of sin and death, brought about by the grace, love, and determination of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n \n The second thing that the cross reveals to me is the nature of God's justice. We presently live in an imperfect world. In America we still have one of the finest justice systems known to man, yet we know, in our heart of hearts, that there are still many instances where justice is not served. But God is a God of perfect justice. And I don't think we could look at him with respect if He does not punish those who have broken His laws. He is not a respector of any one individual over another. His laws and truth are eternal, and they are objective. They are for all persons in all places at all times. They are not subjective and do not change according to the whims and attitudes of an evolving society. In Jesus, we can look to the cross for perfect justice, tempered with the grace of our forgiven sins. \n \n 3. The cross of Jesus has the power to save lives. There once was a man by the name of Mel Trotter, who had an addiction to alcohol. There came a time when his youngest baby died, and he cried as he knelt by the little white casket in the funeral home. And he vowed that he would never take another drink. But a few hours later he went back and he stole the shoes from the little baby's feet and sold them in order to buy another drink. Then he slowly walked toward Lake Michigan to commit suicide. It was then that the compassionate and forgiving hand of the Lord led him into a rescue mission and he was saved. His life changed, and he later became a preacher and led hundreds of others to Christ. The cross had made a difference.\n \n 4. The cross is a testimony to the martyr's of Christ.\n \n In the early days of the church there was a man who was a disciple of the apostle John. During his life, he attained to the position of bishop of Smyrna (Izmir, Turkey). He was acquainted with Ignatius, and for a time he represented the churches of Asia Minor in meeting with \"Pope\" Anicetus of Rome. His relationship with the apostle John and other early Christian leaders, and his gift of preaching and his devout character, gave him a position of great authority and respect in the Asian churches. When he was eighty-six years old, a persecution of the Christian Church broke out in Smyrna. Many believers had already been fed to the wild beasts in the local arena. The crowd began to call for Polycarp's execution. So on a Friday afternoon, the authorities went to his home and arrested him like a common criminal. In one of the most touching instances of Christian grace imaginable, Polycarp welcomed his captors into his home as if they were his friends, talking with them and serving them food and drink. His only request was that he be given one hour to pray before his death. They gave him two hours to pray, and then escorted him to the arena. Despite the cries of the crowd, the Roman authorities saw the senselessness of making this aged man a martyr. So when Polycarp had been brought into the arena, the procounsel pleaded with him to renounce and curse Jesus Christ, in which case he would be released a free man. His famous reply was, \"Eighty and six years have I served Him. He has never done me wrong. How then is it possible that I could curse my King who has saved me?\" The procounsel still searched for an acceptable way out: \"Then do this, old man. Just swear by the genius of the emperor and that will be sufficient.\" Polycarp replied, \"If you imagine for a moment that I would do that, then I think that you pretend that you don't know who I am. Hear it plainly. I am a Christian.\" Four times the procounsel pleaded with him to renounce his faith and live. Four times Polycarp refused. The procounsel's patience was gone, and he said, \"I will then have you burned alive.\" And Polycarp replied, \"You threaten fire that burns for an hour and then is over. But the judgment and the fire of the ungodly is forever.\" In the last moments of his life, with the flames beginning to consume this precious saint, his last prayer was heard: \"Father, I bless you that you have deemed me worthy of this day and hour, that I might take a portion of the martyrs in the cup of Christ.....among these may I today be welcome before thy face as a rich and acceptable sacrifice.\" Afterwards, his followers gathered his remains, and buried him on the sabbath day of the 22nd of February, 155 A.D. \n \n 5. Above all things, the cross reveals the depth and majesty of God's love for all mankind.\n \n In a world that is consumed with the hatred and anger of one people fighting against and killing each other, we see an uncommon love at the cross of Christ. His love has the power to change lives and set people free. It has the power to restore marriages and broken relationships. Love is action. It's not something that we keep stored up inside of us and never use. It is being kind and compassionate to each other whether or not we even like that person. Love refuses to take into account a wrong suffered at the hands of another. Love forgives. It gives a second chance, and then a third and a fourth. Love is the source of God's mercy and grace. It is the very essence of His nature. And it is the redeeming quality that we hope and look for in one another. Where there is love and mercy, then there is life and hope. You and I many never know what mercy is until we need some. We may never have known what love was, unless someone else had revealed it to us. It is the supreme commandment of God, and the fulfillment of His law. And I believe that the love that comes to us from God is the only thing that makes people truly happy. I think that's where men get their courage. That's where countries get their strength. And that's where God grants us our miracles. And in the absence of God's love for us, and our love for one another, there is absolutely nothing left in this world worth living for. And that is the essence of the cross of Christ. \n \n It is a cross of mercy and grace. A cross of love and forgiveness.... of hope and compassion. Salvation and glory. It's the place where we cast our anger and our bitterness, our fears and despair. It's a place where we are healed and set free from the ravages of a hopeless world. It is many things to many people, but to each and every one of us, it is the blood-soaked alter of our redemption, and our only secure hope for eternal life. It is the cross of the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all things are possible.",

   "Hi there,\n \n \nActually, if you take it back and follow the theology, God gave man everything, man chose of his own free will to rebel. \n\n And if he were like any human parent, he wouldn't punish them for rebelling by throwing them into a lake of fire for all eternity.\n \n \n \nThere was not originally an implied penalty. God did tell man (in the garden) that eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would bring about death. That is not an implied penalty but a statement of fact. Much like saying don't stick your hand in the transformer box, if you do you might get electrocuted. It is not a penalty but merely a consequence. God did not punish man because of the rebellion, it was simply a fact of the act. Now then, God in his mercy removed man from the garden so that he would not eat also of the tree of life and live forever in rebellion. Not a punishment, an act of mercy.\n\n Yet God has and always had the power to change any part of that equation. I can tell me friend not to put his hand in the transformer, but if he does and dies, I don't have the power to bring him back. I can love him all I want, but I can't bring him back. God can. God is supposed to have the power to bring my friend back from the dead, or even bring me back from spiritual death in the lake of fire. But, he choses not to. \n \n \n \nMan had to have choice. Without it love does not exist. Period. God gave man the choice. NOw then, our lack of choosing Jesus is the same as choosing to stay right where we are. In death. We are simply already there. It is not that God is punishing us, it is a fact of the act. Instead, God has made provision in his mercy and grace to give us an alternative. He would be perfectly just to give us nothing, but that is not who He is. \n\n God never offered me a choice. Not personally, that is. \n The minute God (or something so out of this world I have to believe that it must be God) offers me that choice, I'll make it. The only people I've seen offering me that choice are people with good intentions or people on TV trying to take my money. God may be working through them, but this skepticism and free will combination that God supposedly instilled in me keeps me from doing that.",

   "And, what kind of pervert idea is sending your own son to be horribly tortured to pay yoruself back for a debt. I mean, that is pretty perverse in my opinion.\n\n \n And let's not forget about what Thomas Paine, in \"The Age of Reason\", had to say about Jesus \"paying our debt\" ...\n \n \nIf I owe a person money, and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in prison, another person can take the debt upon himself, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case is changed. Moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself. To suppose justice to do this, is to destroy the principle of its existence, which is the thing itself. It is then no longer justice. It is indiscriminate revenge.\n\n \n ...\n \n \ntrebor: That is not love. That is sadistic. Requiring the human sacrifice of your own son (who is also yoruself) so you won't be go and torture people for eternity is rather a peverse concept.\n\n \n Yeah, what a warped fable. God comes down to earth and becomes a man, so that He - a God who can't die - somehow dies, so that His death - which is impossible - can save people from His own wrath?!?!?! WTF! \n \n As Thomas Paine points out, it would have made sense if SATAN was forced to die on the cross (that's at the end of this quote).\n \n \n\n Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in Heaven, in which none of the combatants could either be killed or wounded - put Satan into the pit - let him out again - given him a triumph over the whole creation - damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten on purpose to be sacrificed, because, they say, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.\n \n Putting aside every thing that might excite laughter by its absurdity, or detestation by its prophaneness, and confinding ourselves merely to an examination to the parts, it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the Almighty, more inconsistent with his wisdom, more contradictory to his power, than this story is.\n \n In order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being, whom they call Satan, a power equally as great, if not greater, than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity. Before this fall, they represent him only as an angel of limited existence, as they represent the rest. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipresent. He exists every where, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of space.\n \n Not content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as defeating by stratagem, in the shape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wisdom of the Almighty. They represent him as having compelled the Almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth, and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man.\n \n Had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had they represented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit himself upon a cross in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his new transgression, the story would have been less absurd, less contradictory. But instead of this, they make the transgressor triumph, and the Almighty fall.\n \n\n \n And finally, Thomas Paine makes a few nice observations about the immorality of this Christian fairy tale.\n \n \n... the christian story of God the Father putting his son to death, or employing people to do it (for that is the plain language of the story), cannot be told by a parent to a child: and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better is making it still worse, as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a mystery, is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it.\n",

Mr. Cobbett's refutation, with a few abridgements, is as follows:\n \n *********************************\n \"It is a part of the business of a press sold to the cause of corruption to calumniate those, dead or alive, who have most effectually labored against that cause; and, as Paine was the most powerful and effectual of those laborers, so to calumniate him has been an object of their peculiar attention and care. Among other things said against this famous man is, that \n he recanted before he died; and that in his last illness he discovered horrible fears of death.\"\n \n \"I happen to know the origin of this story, and I possess the real original document whence have proceeded these divers editions of the falsehood, of the very invention of which I was perhaps myself the innocent cause!\"\n \n ...\n \n *********************************\n \n ...\n \n Collins himself afterwards tacitly admitted the falsity of the Paine calumny. ...\n \n ...\n \n The exposures of Cobbett, Vale, and others, while they lessened the influence of the calumny, did not silence it. It mattered little to the church whether Paine recanted or not, but it was important that the masses should believe that he recanted. With most theologians a falsehood is as good as a \n truth so long as it serves its purpose. The orthodox clergy continued to thunder it from the pulpit; tract distributors sowed it broadcast over the land; no Sunday school library was considered complete without a volume containing it; while the religious papers kept it continually before their \n readers. The New York Observer, a Presbyterian paper, repeatedly published it, together with other calumnies on Paine. In an open letter to the Observer, Col. Ingersoll, in 1877, issued the following challenge:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"I will deposit with the First National Bank of Peoria, Illinois, one thousand dollars in gold, upon the following conditions: -- This money shall be subject to your order when you shall, in the manner hereafter provided, substantiate that Thomas Paine admitted the Bible to be an inspired book, or that he recanted his Infidel opinions -- or that he died regretting that he had disbelieved the Bible -- or that he died calling upon Jesus Christ in any religious sense, whatever.\n \n ...\n *********************************\n \n \n The Observer made a pretence of accepting the challenge and then backed out. It again repeated the Mary Hinsdale story with this endorsement: \"It has been published again and again, and so far as we know has never been impeached.\" In a subsequent issue, it said: \"We have never stated in any form, nor have we ever supposed that Paine actually renounced his Infidelity. The accounts agree in stating that he died a blaspheming Infidel.\" Col. Ingersoll's reply contained the following:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"From the bottom of my heart I thank myself for having compelled you to admit that Thomas Paine did not recant. ***\n \n \"You have eaten your own words, and, for my part, I would rather have dined with Ezekiel than with you.\n \n \"I ask you if it is honest to throw away the testimony of his friends -- the evidence of fair and honorable men -- and take the putrid words of avowed and malignant enemies?\n \n \"When Thomas Paine was dying, he was infested by fanatics -- by the snaky spies of bigotry. In the shadows of death were the unclean birds of prey waiting to tear with beak and claw the corpse of him who wrote the 'Rights of Man.' And there lurking and crouching in the darkness were the jackals and hyenas of superstition ready to violate his grave.\n \n \"These birds of prey -- these unclean beasts are the witnesses produced and relied upon by you.\n \n \"One by one the instruments of torture have been wrenched from the cruel clutch of the Church, until within the armory of orthodoxy there remains but one weapon -- Slander.\"\n *********************************\n \n \n In disproof of the lying statement of this depraved woman, who never saw Thomas Paine, we have, thanks to the unselfish labors of Cobbett, Vale, Ingersoll, and Conway, the testimony of a score of death-bed witnesses.\n \n Two of Paine's most devoted friends in France were Nicholas Bonneville and his wife. Bonneville like Paine was a prominent actor in the French Revolution. After the Revolution Paine lived with the Bonnevilles in Paris. For criticising Napoleon in his journal Bonneville was imprisoned and his family reduced to penury. Paine gave them a home in America. When he was taken sick Madame Bonneville tenderly cared for him until he died. 'After his death Bonneville and his wife wrote a sketch of the life of their benefactor. It was subsequently revised by Cobbett, and will be found appended, to Dr. Conway's admirable biography of Paine. The following, relative to Paine's death, is from the pen of Madame Bonneville:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and to talk with him on religious matters. 'Let me alone,' said he, 'good morning.' He desired they should be admitted no more. Seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend, if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house, upon which he could only exclaim, Oh, yes! He, added other words but they were incoherent. It was impossible for me not to exert myself to the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed so much. He now appeared to have lost all kinds of feeling. He spent the night in tranquility, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock.\"\n *********************************\n \n \n Madame Bonneville was a lady of spotless character, educated and refined, and, like most French women, a Catholic.\n \n Dr. N. Romaine, at that time the most eminent physician of New York, was Paine's physician. He testified that Paine did not recant. A Dr. Manley also visited him. But, it afterward transpired that he was there as a Christian spy and emissary. His real mission was to extort, if possible, a recantation from the lips of the dying Infidel. In a letter to James Cheetham, the vilest of Paine's calumniators, he says: \"I took occasions during the nights of the 5th and 6th of June to test the strength of his opinions respecting revelation. I purposely made him a very late visit; it was a time which seemed to suit exactly with my errand; it was midnight, he was in great distress.\" Addressing Paine, Dr. Manley said:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"Do you believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ? Come, now, answer me honestly. I want an answer from the lips of a dying man, for I verily believe that you will not live twenty- four hours.\" Not receiving an immediate answer, he continued, \"Allow me to ask again, do you believe? or let me qualify the question, do you wish to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? After a pause of some minutes, he answered, 'I have no wish to believe on that subject.'\"\n *********************************\n \n \n Dr. Manley's \"minutes\" were probably seconds. Indignant at the impertinence, not to say brutality, of his pious interrogator, the dying patient paused to summon strength to utter a reply that should not be misunderstood. With the exception of the brief words mentioned by Madame Bonneville, those were the last words of Thomas Paine.\n \n Dr. Manley says that Paine throughout his illness manifested great fear. \"He could not be left alone night or day; he not only required to have some person with him but he must see that he or she was there, and would not allow his curtain to be closed at any time.\" This is true; and subsequent events showed that his fears were well founded. Dr. Conway says:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"His unwillingness to be left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without witnesses. He had foreseen this. While living with Jarvis, two years before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic convictions to the last. ... When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr. Romaine, Mr. Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.\" (Life of Paine, Vol. ii, p. 414.)\n *********************************\n \n \n It was these witnesses -- some of whom were always present when Dr. Manley visited him -- that prevented this charlatan from doing what Mary Hinsdale did.\n \n Just before Paine's death the Rev. Cunningham and the Rev. Milledollar, prominent clergymen of New York, gained access to his room. With that politeness so characteristic of clergymen, when addressing those who do not subscribe to their opinions, Mr. Cunningham said to him, \"You have now a full view of death, you cannot live long, and whosoever does not believe in Jesus Christ shall be damned.\" To this Paine replied, \"Let me have none of your popish nonsense. Good morning.\" Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Milledollar both affirmed that Paine died unrepentant.\n \n A blind preacher, named Pigott, and his brother also visited Paine for the purpose of converting him. The brother says that Paine received them cordially and treated them politely, but exhibited great displeasure when they attempted to obtrude their religious opinions upon him.\n \n Mrs. Redden, Paine's pious nurse, was especially anxious to secure his conversion. She admitted the clergymen who annoyed him during his last hours and is charged with the responsibility of Dr. Manley's visits. But Mrs. Redden desired a genuine conversion, not a fabricated recantation. She frankly confessed that all efforts to change his views were futile.\n \n There is usually an attempt to supply every demand. That there was an urgent demand for this recantation story, particularly among the Quakers, is attested by the Quaker preacher, Willet Hicks. Mr. Hicks says:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"You can have no idea of the anxiety of our people on this subject; I was beset by them, both here and in England, where I soon after went on a journey. As for money, I could have had any sums if I would have said anything against Thomas Paine, or if even I would have consented to remain silent. They informed me that the doctor (Manley) was willing to say something that would satisfy them if I would engage to be silent.\" (Vale's Life of Paine, p. 178.)\n *********************************\n \n \n The following affidavit was subscribed and sworn to by William B. Barnes of Wabash, Indiana, October 27, 1877:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"In the year 1833 Willet Hicks made a visit to Indiana and stayed over night at my father's house, four miles east of Richmond. In the morning at breakfast my mother asked Willet Hicks the following questions:\n \n \"'Was thee with Thomas Paine during his last sickness?'\n \n \"Mr. Hicks said: 'I was with him every day during the latter part of his last sickness.'\n \n \"'Did he express any regret in regard to writing the \"Age of Reason,\" as the published accounts say he did?'\n \n \"Mr. Hicks replied: 'He did not in any way by word or action.'\n \n Did he call on God or Jesus Christ, asking either of them to forgive his sins, or did he curse them or either of them?'\n \n \"Mr. Hicks answered: 'He did not. He died as easy as any one I ever saw die, and I have seen many die in my time.'\"\n *********************************\n \n \n ...\n \n Thomas Nixon and Capt. Daniel Pelton, who attended Paine during his last sickness, wrote, signed and sent the following statement to William Cobbett:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"All you have heard of his recanting is false. Being aware that such reports would be raised after his death by fanatics who infested his house at the time it was expected he would die, we, the subscribers, intimate acquaintances of Thomas Paine, since the year 1776, went to his house -- he was sitting up in a chair, and apparently in the full vigor and use of all his mental faculties. We interrogated him on his religious opinions, and if he had changed his mind or repented of anything be had said or written on that subject. He answered, 'not at all,' and appeared rather offended at our supposition that any change should take place in his mind. We took down in writing the questions put to him, and his answers thereto, before a number of persons then in his room.\"\n *********************************\n \n \n \n Paine's executors were Walter Morton, a lawyer of New York, and Thomas Addis Emmet, a brother of Robert Emmet, the Irish patriot. Both attended Paine and both testified that no change took place in his opinions. Mr. Morton, who was present when he expired, says:\n \n \n *********************************\n \"In his religious opinions, he continued to the last as steadfast and tenacious as any sectarian to the definition of his own creed.\"\n *********************************\n \n ...\n \n Here are twenty death-bed witnesses, Madame Bonneville, Dr. Romaine, Dr. Manley, Rev. Cunningham, Rev. Milledollar, Mr. Pigott, Mrs. Redden, Willet Hicks, Mrs. Cheeseman, Amasa Woodsworth, Thomas Nixon, Captain Pelton, Walter Morton, Thomas Addis Emmet, Mrs. Few, Albert Gallatin, Mr. Jarvis, B.F. Haskin, Colonel Fellows, and Judge Hertell, many of them Christians, all affirming or admitting that Thomas Paine did not recant.\n \n ... \n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_1.html#3\n \n",

   "Many believe that religion is at the center of wars, arguments, and other things.

If we all did this and thought about the other person instead of ourselves like Jesus did, all of our problems would be gone.\n \n\n \n I think looking at things reasonably is the only way to figure out ethics and morality.

The question was how would you set the world up?\n\n \n I think that a more fundamental question is, how would one make a distinction between a universe that is designed and one that is not? For example, if I hired someone to design the human backbone and he gave me what we have, I'd fire him. However, the human backbone makes perfect sense as an evolutionary adaptation from quadruped to biped.\n \n Likewise, the human temperature control mechanism (sweating) is another evolutionary adaption which falls quite short of the mark. It's useless in humid climates and can lead to death resulting from the loss of body fluids along with essential salts and minerals. Symptoms include stomach cramps, followed by convulsion, unconscienceness, and death. Way to go.",

If one argues about christian theology then one must use ACTUAL christian theology and not something they decided was christian theology.\n \n Trebor assumes that hell exists and therefore god must be evil (in his argument). I am not trying to prove the existence or non existence, merely using trebor's assumption and explaining why the existence is the only real possibililty given the stated nature of God is love. Heaven, is to be with God, Hell is to be without God.\n \n God gave man a choice. Man chose to be without God. God in his mercy gave man the choice again because he loves us. He did not want us to be stuck with the choice we made the first time. That is love and it is unconditional. Anyone can choose to accept God at any time. Race, creed etc are irrelevant. It is truly the most inclusive. There are no works necessary, simply accepting the gift that is offered.\n \n The acceptance is the only requirement because god wants a choice to be made.

Unfortunately, there are many evildoers who reject Christ and God's love and salvation.

And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. \n \n Matthew 25:46, And these shall go away into EVERLASTING punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. \n \n II Thessalonians 1:9 Who shall be punished with EVERLASTING destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. \n \n Isaiah 66:24, And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be abhorring unto all flesh. \n \n Mark 9:44 (speaking of hell), Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. \n \n Jude 7, Sodom and Gomorrha...are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. \n \n Matthew 22:13, ...Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n \n Matthew 13:41-42, The Son of man (Jesus) shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. \n \n Revelation 21:8, But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. \n \n Psalm 9:17, The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. \n \n Isaiah 14:99-11, 15 (referring to Lucifer), Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee...all they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

The danger of spreading a message that God won't judge people as we see above is deluding people into thinking they don't need to repent and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins.",

The context to keep in mind is this. The claim from Trebor if I sumarize correctly, is that the christian God demands obedience or damnation. As a christian I say that is wrong. I say that within the christian Doctrine that Love defined as God necessitates a heaven and hell. Heaven is defined as spending eternity with God and hell is defined as spending eternity away from God. A person simply cannot have it both ways. If you do not choose to spend eternity with God then you necessarily choose to spend it away from him. God will not force YOU to spend it with him if YOU do not want to. The lake of fire etc. are metaphorical. It is the spending eternity away from God that is the actual torture. You will be aware of it and you will regret it. It is not a threat. No person begins in a place of on the cusp. It is not that you can say, I am not going to choose. By not choosing a choice has been made.\n \n AGAIN I AM NOT ARGUING THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF GOD OR HEAVEN OR HELL. Trebor's argument automatically assumes their existence. He states that if God does exist and is like the bible says then His requirement that someone choose or go to hell is considered coercion. \n \n My point is that if Trebor assumes God to be like that based on the bible he is making an incorrect statement as to what the bible says about God and is using improper hermaneutics to determine what is being said. I am correcting that and providing the logic for what is actually there.\n \n My statement that love requires the existence of heaven and hell is in the context of this discussion and my definitions of heaven and hell. Your statement that context does not matter is absolutely ludicrous when it comes to evaluating a debate argument.\n \n Please keep your ire to yourself. I have not attacked you and find your attack to be out of keeping with a debate.\n \n EF",

   "There are several threads where Trebor and I have argued this point. The context to keep in mind is this. The claim from Trebor if I sumarize correctly, is that the christian God demands obedience or damnation. As a christian I say that is wrong. I say that within the christian Doctrine that Love defined as God necessitates a heaven and hell. Heaven is defined as spending eternity with God and hell is defined as spending eternity away from God. A person simply cannot have it both ways. If you do not choose to spend eternity with God then you necessarily choose to spend it away from him. God will not force YOU to spend it with him if YOU do not want to. The lake of fire etc. are metaphorical. It is the spending eternity away from God that is the actual torture. You will be aware of it and you will regret it. It is not a threat. No person begins in a place of on the cusp. It is not that you can say, I am not going to choose. By not choosing a choice has been made.\n \n AGAIN I AM NOT ARGUING THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF GOD OR HEAVEN OR HELL. Trebor's argument automatically assumes their existence. He states that if God does exist and is like the bible says then His requirement that someone choose or go to hell is considered coercion. \n \n My point is that if Trebor assumes God to be like that based on the bible he is making an incorrect statement as to what the bible says about God and is using improper hermaneutics to determine what is being said. I am correcting that and providing the logic for what is actually there.\n \n My statement that love requires the existence of heaven and hell is in the context of this discussion and my definitions of heaven and hell. Your statement that context does not matter is absolutely ludicrous when it comes to evaluating a debate argument.\n \n Please keep your ire to yourself. I have not attacked you and find your attack to be out of keeping with a debate.\n \n EF\n\n \n You were not quite clear about your definition of hell before. While it is not the more 'mainstream' view of hell (or at least the more vocal minority) I will say your version of 'hell' is more reasonable that the vocal 'bbq pit' hell.\n \n Ok. For your definition of hell, I will say that I do not see the carrot/stick approch of most of Christianity.",
