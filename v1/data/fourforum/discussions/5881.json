Though I'd be even more surprised if a large number of people were able to do that.\n \n Still, what I have given is a testimony, and simply put, I could be lying. But I have little reason to lie, since this doesn't really affect gay rights.\n \n Yet by ignoring what I've written, readers are in danger of committing what I believe to be the worst logical error: presenting facts as though they are conclusions. Studies, statistics, and evidence never lie, but they never speak for themselves, either. We must use logic and reasoning to understand why we got the study results we did; we should not simply assume the cause of these things is the thing we were hoping to prove.\n \n We have here a strange situation where people claim to be attracted to members of both sexes, yet when shown sexual videos, they appear to be attracted only to one sex or the other.

Or is it more logical to suggest that those bisexuals simply aren't attracted to every man and every woman?\n \n My post was not intended to be a testimonial, it was intended to be an offering of an explanation for the results of this study, using my own sexual attractions as both introduction to my reasoning and evidence supporting it.",

   "From http://www.americablog.org/ ... \n1. Dr. J. Michael Bailey had to step down from the chairmanship of the psychology dept. at Northwestern just last year because of ethics charges related to earlier research.\n \n 2. Bailey has been linked to a racist, neo-eugenics movement called the Human Biodiversity Institute by the Southern Poverty Law Center\n \n 3. Bailey's previous attention-getter was a book on transgenders that extrapolated from about nine transgenders he claimed to befriend into a study. Many of the people profiled claimed convincingly they had no idea they were part of a research study. (A violation of ethics.) One claimed Bailey slept with them. (Also a violation.) Though ostensibly science, it contained no footnotes. This book led to the investigation of Bailey that resulted in his stepping down as chair, though he remains a professor at Northwestern. The Chronicle of Higher Education profiled Bailey and the controversy, all but labeling him as a closet case.\n \n 4. Bailey claims to be gay-friendly but is so at odds with the GLBT community at Northwestern that campus groups urge people NOT to cooperate with his studies. Gee, think that might make any research he does there harder to accept as valid? (Bailey has reportedly found it difficult to recruit people for his research.) The Chicago Free Press paints a rather sad picture of Bailey trying to convince people he isn't anti-gay or biased by calling for a public meeting virtually no one attended, just weeks before the New York Times would treat his latest research as front-page of the Science section newsworthy.\n \n 5. Some of Bailey's more silly and offensive comments that should raise red flags for anyone wondering about his bias: most transexuals are \"especially motivated\" to shoplift and \"especially suited to prostitution.\" Bailey says that if it became possible to genetically identify a fetus as \"gay\" and a parent chose to abort because they wanted a straight child, this would be \"morally neutral.\" Yep, gay eugenics. Aborting gay fetuses wouldn't do anyone harm, he says. He's not anti-gay, just \"pro-parental liberty.\"\n",

After all, we know that the phenomenon of situational homosexuality exists in prisons and other same-sex environments. Why is it so threatening that people might choose things that lead to the assumption of a homosexual identity?\n\n from what i've learned, the reason why there is such a high appeal to convince the masses that being gay its biological and beyond one's choice, is that this thinking will assuade the religious (bible-based) sect of america from condemning them. in other words, gays want to be ok in the eyes of religion\n \n you may ask \"why?\" do gays want to go to heaven? do they believe in god and that the bible is true? no, generally they dont. so do they seek approval of a bunch of traditionalists and conservatives that they have no admiration for? neither. gays dont need the approval of religion. but politicians do. \n \n in america the bible-believing religiously staunch individual is an extremely massive and influencial part of the population. however, sciences trumps religion, and the most influencial religious leaders know this. so if there is scientific support that gays should be approved, then the religious body can do nothing but concede.\n \n the saddest part is that the bible is saturated with blatant contradictions, exagerrations and lies. even the religious sect knows this. but more powerful than logic, especially in a merica, is the power of emotional dependance. that is why religion will continue to thrive despite scientific progress. it is also why politicians will continue to foster the spread of religion, knowing that people who are lead by emotions easily succumb to brainless political campaigns, like the ones we see in the media.\n \n gays choose to be gay. nobody is born gay and pathetic and bogus scientific \"studies\" like the one in this thread will not change that. truthfully, the gay community does not need the political pressure of justifying their lifestyle, especially for the appeasement of the religious right. the real solution to this dilema, in my view, is to relieve our society from the folly of emotional bondage and traditional stupor, and actually think independantly. attempting to prove the \"innocence\" of gays just for religious approval is an exercise in deception and closed-mindedness, and in the long run the gay community will be worse off for it",

After all, we know that the phenomenon of situational homosexuality exists in prisons and other same-sex environments. Why is it so threatening that people might choose things that lead to the assumption of a homosexual identity?\n\n \n I disagree with everything unkerpaulie posted. We have determined in many previous discussions on this forum that gay rights should not depend on whether homosexual attractions are a choice. Yet many people here, including myself, still argue that homosexual attractions are not a choice. Although I cannot speak for every person here, I can speak for myself. I argue that homosexual attractions are genetic because I strongly believe them to be genetic, and this is, after all, a debate forum.\n \n The idea that people choose their sexual orientation is, in my opinion, generally absurd. I don't think unkerpaulie even meant to say that. In the majority of people, the individual just goes along with whatever sexual attractions he comes across, whether those attractions are society-induced or genetic, and has no idea how to change them. Ask the average straight person to become gay or ask the average gay person to become straight, and they will tell you right away that they cannot. People cannot simply choose their sexual orientations.\n \n I do believe that environmental factors can come into play, but I think those environmental factors can do nothing more than help people realize their underlying sexual attractions or prevent people from realizing those attractions. I do not think people can change their underlying sexual attractions. I have certainly tried this myself, and I've found that I simply cannot do it.\n \n So why should I not speak out my opinion on the subject when it becomes a topic of debate on a debate forum?",

Yet many people here, including myself, still argue that homosexual attractions are not a choice. \n\n \n With all due respect, for an issue that has been determined to not be relevant to gay rights, people on your side spend a LOT of time talking about it, posting studies and articles anytime they see them. It seems to me that Unkerpaulie is right in that some in your movement seem to really feel the need to prove this. I think they feel it gives homosexuality more scientific validity. Perhaps that is the case.\n \n But the reason it won't do any good is that opposition to homosexuality isn't over the nature part of it per se, but the behavioral aspect. Certainly any behavior can be justified by saying \"my genes make me do this\", or \"it's my nature.\" That's beside the point when it comes to the morality of the behavior. For people who believe in absolute truth, and that absolute truth tells them that a certain behavior is wrong, the genetic leaning toward that behavior isn't that relevant. I don't mean this analogy to directly analogize homosexuality in any way other than the issue of genetics, but for religious people it would be the same as saying to someone genetically inclined to losing their temper constantly and throwing things that it's ok to do that, just on the basis that there are studies that say high temper can be genetic.\n \n It's interesting that for gay rights people the reason that genetics is not that relevant is that rights shouldn't be based on them.\n \n For religious people the reason that genetics is not that relevant is that morality of behavior shouldn't be based on them.",

   "With all due respect, for an issue that has been determined to not be relevant to gay rights, people on your side spend a LOT of time talking about it, posting studies and articles anytime they see them. It seems to me that Unkerpaulie is right in that some in your movement seem to really feel the need to prove this. I think they feel it gives homosexuality more scientific validity. Perhaps that is the case.\n\n \n Well, that may or may not be the case; that isn't where I meant to disagree with Unkerpaulie, except to point out that my own reasons for discussing this issue are vastly different from that which he suggested.\n \n \nBut the reason it won't do any good is that opposition to homosexuality isn't over the nature part of it per se, but the behavioral aspect. Certainly any behavior can be justified by saying \"my genes make me do this\", or \"it's my nature.\" That's beside the point when it comes to the morality of the behavior. For people who believe in absolute truth, and that absolute truth tells them that a certain behavior is wrong, the genetic leaning toward that behavior isn't that relevant. I don't mean this analogy to directly analogize homosexuality in any way other than the issue of genetics, but for religious people it would be the same as saying to someone genetically inclined to losing their temper constantly and throwing things that it's ok to do that, just on the basis that there are studies that say high temper can be genetic.\n \n It's interesting that for gay rights people the reason that genetics is not that relevant is that rights shouldn't be based on them.\n \n For religious people the reason that genetics is not that relevant is that morality of behavior shouldn't be based on them.\n\n \n Every single thing you've said in this paragraph is true of a supporter of gay rights. A behavior cannot be justified by the excuse that your genes made you do it. It cannot be justified by saying \"it's in my nature\", and it cannot be justified by saying \"it's part of my religion\". There is an absolute right and wrong, and opposing homosexuality and same-sex marriage is nothing less than pure, unbridled wrong. Opposing it for religious reasons is no more justified than losing one's temper and throwing things for religious reasons, or oppressing anyone for religious reasons.\n \n For gay rights supporters, the reason that genetics is not relevant is that the morality of behavior should not be based on it.",

   "jaxian, you may strongly believe that a person's sexual orientation is built-in and permanent, but there is no evidence to back this up. we have the testimony of your \"average guy\" that says he cannot choose to be gay, then we also have the testimonies of another bunch of people that said they chose to be gay. so what are we to make of these testimonies?\n \n pravda, i am aware of this. in fact, its funny that the topic of this article is based on the willingness of some people to nullify a sexual orientation complete; ie., bisexuality. in my mind, no such thing as sexual orientation exists. there are only habits, which are behaviors that have been made default by continual repitition and growing accustom. both psychology and neuroscience support this. habits are created by conditioning and sensitization. once an act is repeated often, the brain reinforces the memory nodes that recall the act. the act that is stored becomes more redily accessible, and will be the default act in such a circumstance. it works that way in every aspect of everyones personality. to say that any aspect of ones personality is built in or cannot be changed is to say that a habit cannot be broken. we are all familiar with how dificult it is to overcome a habit we've grown comfortable with. but we also know that habits can be changed",

   "not true. masochists are living examples of this. how do you explain that? are masochists born that way too?\n\n \n The sensation of pain felt by masochists does not change. They still feel pain, and pain is still a negative feeling. However, in the case of sexual masochism, the masochist is either born with an underlying sexual desire to be submissive and dominated or he is able to use his imagination to associate the situation of being dominated with something that stimulates sexual arousal in his body. Masochism is based on deriving pleasure or sexual arousal from the situation of being helpless, mistreated, or abused. This does not mean that masochist's body no longer produces a negative sensation when it is injured. It means that the body creates some other, positive sensation because of the situation.\n \n \nwrong again. not only does pavlov's experiment with dogs show that physical and biological reactions to stimulus can be controlled, we keep turning a blind eye to the dozens of testonials of people who said that they changed their sexual orientation by choice. clearly the internal sensations experienced by a given stimulus can change\n\n \n Pavlov's experimentation with dogs is a fantastic example of what I am referring to. The body has an underlying desire to have food. When the mind believes food is coming, the body produces additonal saliva in preparation for that food. Pavlov was able to associate a bell with the arrival of food. In this case, when the dog hear the bell ringing, the dog's brain imagined or predicted the arrival of food, and it therefore salivated.\n \n The key part of this experiment is the dog's underlying desire for food. One could not train a dog to salivate using a bell alone, one must train the dog to salivate at the sound of a bell by associating the bell with something that the dog's body actually wants. Ring the bell enough times without providing food, and the dog's association of the bell with the food will drop, and the dog will no longer salivate at the ringing of a bell. \n \n To restate: in Pavlov's experiment, we associate a bell, something the dog's body doesn't care about, with food, something the dog's body does care about, and we can make the dog's body behave as though it sees food whenever it hears a bell. But as soon as that association is lost, as soon as the dog no longer associates the bell with food, the bodily behavior is lost. It is the association of something with the body's natural desires that causes the salivation.\n \n This perhaps something happens with people who change their sexual orientation. People have a set of underlying sexual desires. So long as they associate the body of the individual they're having sex with and their own sexual desires, they will be aroused by that person. But if they instead teach themselves to ignore those associations or to be immediately repulsed, then they will not be aroused by that person.\n \n Yet this should not be interpreted to mean that any set of underlying sexual attractions can apply to any person; some people will simply have sexual attractions that they can't associate to a member of the same sex or the opposite sex. In those cases, it may be possible to create sexual arousal in a fashion similar to Pavlov's experiments. But you were to try to change your own sexual orientation in such a fashion, you'd have to put an unattractive person in front of you, then switch that with an attractive person. You'd have to do this enough times that your body is conditioned to predict the appearance of the attractive person upon only seeing the unattractive person, and even then, it would only be your mind's prediction of the appearance of the attractive woman that aroused you.",
