   "To give credit where credit is due, Steeeve originally posted this. I just thought it deserved its own thread.\n \n http://www.randpaul2010.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Overview-500-billion-cuts-2.pdf\n \n Overall I think it is good, but there are a few things that I disagree with. First of all, eliminating the government printing office. I can certainly understand the desire, and I think he is right that in large part it is a pointless organization. HOWEVER, we have been running black ops on the government printing office budget since at LEAST the Reagan years. I still dont necessarily disagree with getting rid of the GPO, but when looking at the \"savings\" from doing so we need to realize that a lot of that will not actually appear since we will end up just shifting our hidden spending somewhere else. \n \n I also disagree with a 100% funding elimination for HUD. I think that we can certainly cut LARGE portions of the HUD budget, but I think we need to do it slowly over time so the real estate market has time to adjust. I dont think there is any question at all that low income housing has become more expensive due to HUD, but if we just drop it like Rand suggests, we are going to see a LOT of homeless people. I dont think there is any question that the market can essentially fix the problem, but it takes time to turn a ship that big.\n \n His defense department cuts are a joke.\n \n His department of labor cuts are a complete and utter farce. Compliance costs for businesses for DOL regulations are higher than for any other federal agency. You see people whining about EPA compliance costs, but DOL compliance costs are on average over 1000% higher than EPA compliance costs for most companies. And the thing is, they are superfluous. I dont take steps to protect the health and safety of my workers because I really care what MSHA thinks about it. I dont do it because I really care all that much about my employers. I do it, and do a damn good job of it, because my workman's comp company will anally rape me if I do not, and that is not a fun Friday night. \n \n I disagree with his cutting the DOE to nothing. We have an energy problem, and the best new energy research that we do comes from the DOE. While certain portions of their budget can certainly take a hair cut, it is vital that we continue energy research. If anything, take money from the military are give it to DOE R&D programs. \n \n I also disagree with his position on the national park service. I think the national parks need to be preserved and need to stay federal. HOWEVER, I would agree that a more \"BLM\" approach would be a good idea. Most of our national parks do not need $20 million visitor centers. They do not even need paved roads. They do not need amphitheaters. We do not need 700 park rangers running around each park. \n \n I am also not seeing any cuts to FEMA in his budget and that is a BIG mistake. Every year FEMA hands out billions of dollars in flood relief that is just plain wasted. The county I live in gets millions of dollars in flood relief from FEMA every single year to pay to repair roads that are damaged by flooding every single year. THAT IS STUPID. Our own county commissioners have admitted that the SMART thing to do would be to either move or vacate those roads BUT that fema money is a big part of our county road budget (since what they pay to repair the roads is FAR more than it actually costs) so we use our flood prone roads as a revenue stream.",

   "Thanks for creating the thread.\n \n Maybe I'm growing tired but I'm all for this plan given the choices. On the one hand we have the $250 billion \"cut\" from we saw last week which was nothing short of pathetic. Today we see the $500 billion a year plan which is 3-4 changes from being dead on.\n \n Changes I see fit:\n I'm not an expert in all areas but here are the immediate changes I would like to see keeping in mind I'd vote for this thing any day of the week.\n [*]cut the military but another 10%[*]Labor needs to be cut by another 15%[*]Force a reform of Social Security and Medicare by limiting expenditures...perhaps reducing benefits for the rich[*]For everything NOT cut, cut it by 5-15%[*]For everything NOT cut or only but by 20% or less this year, cut it again next year another 5-10% and same thing for a third year.[*]Finally, REFORM STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. I'm probably the only poster here that fully understands how this impacts tuition costs. Nothing wrong with other posters here, I just happen to deal with it every week or so.\n I understand people's reservations about the Dept of Ed. cuts but it is beyond obvious to me that they hurt education at best and most likely drive up the cost. \n \n Anyway, other thoughts?",

That seems foolish to me.\n \n Second, also to do with the department of education, I think that is going to be a TOUGH sell to the voters. State school systems have been sucking at the federal teat for so long that I think a lot of Americans have probably never considered the possibility that we can have an education system without overriding federal involvement. \n \n The other thing that I think we need to consider though I dont think it should keep us from taking action, but rather see it as an indicator of where we need to keep a watchful eye, is the impact that the reduced federal spending will have on the wider economy. \n \n When they talk about dropping 15+% of the federal workforce, they are talking a sizable layoff by the worlds biggest employer. The $500 billion that Rand talks about saving us a year comes right off the bottom line of our GDP. When you factor in any kind of flow through multiplier at all, you are looking at losing a significant portion of our GDP. \n \n As you have pointed out in the past, deficit spending is essentially borrowed growth. The time has come we have to pay some of that back, almost without question through economic contraction. My concern is how helicopter Ben Bernanke is going to handle this. At this point the fed is already directly monetizing the debt. I think that throwing bags of cash out of helicopters may literally be the next step from there. I literally cannot conceive of what his next step may be, but I shudder in horror at the very thought of Bernake trying to print our way out of this.",

   "here's three points that caught my attention .\n \n Defense\n reduce war funding for FY2011 by $16 billion, in other words to provide $144 billion (President Obama hasrequested $117 billion for FY2012, $27 billion dollars below our proposed level).\n \n I agree the Defense cuts are a joke. \n \n Transportation\n The proposal includes funding the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration at the level of projected gas tax revenue of $37 billion. The proposal eliminates Amtrak subsidies, and reduces the remainder of the department back to FY2008 levels, with an additional reduction of 20 percent.\n \n I like the Idea of cutting this, but I don't like the Open end it leaves. If the funding is based purely on the projected gas tax revenues then they have an open door to slide in higher gas taxes to raise the funding . This would shift the burden back to the public , much like Reagan did in the 80's when he passed out Massive tax cuts and then sifted in tax increases in other areas to make up for the loss. \n \n Like I said in the other thread, Overall I think this is a good start and I agree it's the best one I've seen so far out of what we have on the table. And Much , Much better than what Obama is planning.\n \n \n \n \n Amtrak Subsidies: Eliminate\n Created by an act of Congress in 1970 to provide passenger rail service, Amtrak has yet to turn a yearly profit. During its first 35 years, federal assistance amounted to approximately $30 billion. Yet from FY2007 to FY2010 that number has increased by $7 billion. Of the 44 routes and 21,000 miles of track the trains travel over, only 625 miles are actually owned by Amtrak. Congress has forced freight rail companies to allow Amtrak to use the lines the freight rail companies own and maintain.\n \n I do agree that Something needs to be done about Amtrak, but eliminating the Subsidies in my opinion isn't the way they should go about it. I think they should use cuts in other areas and shift the money over to invest more into building High Speed Rails. Building new Rails will eventually allow for eliminating the Leasing of rails from The UP and BNSF rails, and would help Amtrak become more Competitive and self reliant. It would also create jobs, not only for building the rails but new business along the new rail ways. If they simply cut subsidies Amtrak will eventually close, considering they haven't turned a profit since their inception.",

If the Current Tax Revenue is 37 billion per year then that is all we will get to spread out across the country to maintain and build new Roads, bridges, etc. If they need more they can just simply raise the tax on fuel to rake in a few more billion. My concern is that there doesn't seem to be a stopping point. No mention of excluding ear marks. Suppose the Congress wants to put in new curtains and they need funding.. will they be able to raise fuel prices to raise the money?.. IMO he leaves this too open for politicians to use as a back door fund raiser. I would agree to it only if the wording were changed to either put a limit on future Tax increases for Fuel, or put a Cap on the amount that can be taken in each year . Some kind of safe guard against abusive politics.",
