   "The other day, Dr. Alvena King, MLK's neice, stated that Harry Reid's comments amounted to calling Obama a \"house negro\". Given his pension doing labor's bidding for them, does that make him the labor unions' house negro? emoticon_confused\n \n \n\n White House, unions reach deal on taxing insurance coverage\n By Lori Montgomery\n The White House has reached a tentative agreement with labor leaders to tax high-cost health insurance policies, sources said Thursday. The agreement clears one of the last major obstacles on the path to final passage of comprehensive health care legislation. \n \n The deal would temporarily exempt union health plans from a significant surtax on unusually generous health policies plans, giving union leaders time to negotiate new contracts, according to sources familiar with the talks. They spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid affecting ongoing negotiations. Additional details of the deal were not immediately available. \n \n The so-called Cadillac tax is a key source of financing for a proposal to dramatically expand health coverage to the uninsured. But it is also an important tool for reining in skyrocketing health care costs, and President Obama has insisted that it be included in the package. \n \n Labor leaders, nonetheless, had threatened to campaign against any health care bill that included the tax. By one analysis, as many as one in four union members could have been affected by the version of the tax approved by the Senate.\n \n Under that proposal, family plans that cost more than $23,000 and individual policies that cost more than $8,500 would be subject to a 40 percent surtax. The tax would be imposed on the insurance company, but economists believe it would be passed on to workers. For years, many unions have negotiated more generous health benefits in lieu of higher wages. \n 44 - White House, unions reach deal on taxing insurance coverage \n\n \n This is such a blatant sweetheart deal that I'm surprised that the Obama- Ade drinkers are still enamorred with the man. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "The latest I heard was that they wanted to exclude Union Labor from the \"cadillac tax\" until 2017. Even reporters on the Huffington Post are railing against that kind of sweetheart deal. \n Michael Whitney: Union Exemption From Excise Tax Is a Bad, Bad Idea\n\n \n Exactly, and how can they believe they can do this kind of stuff right in front of the rest of us and get away with it? Here's another article from today with an excerpt which sums it up better than I could. Health-Care Negotiators Search for More Revenue - WSJ.com I mean, how can these people be as intelligent as they claim to be if they don't realize that we the people will have to pay for these cuts in the end anyway? And why should the non union americans have to carry the union members who already have the cadillac plans which Obama wants to tax in order to subsidize the cost for insuring the poor? The circular reasoning here is mind boggling. \n \"Democrats are placing the interests of their narrow political base over the interests of every other American,\" said Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.). \"Real reform wouldn't treat people better simply because they have a union card in their wallet. Union members and bureaucrats should pay the same taxes as the rest of us.\"\n \n A conservative advocacy group sent letters to a pair of Democratic congressmen whom Republicans are targeting this November, asking them to oppose the modified tax plan. The letters went to Reps. Tom Perriello and Glenn Nye, both of Virginia, a \"right to work\" state where workers can't be forced to join unions\n \n \"This is absolutely deplorable to American workers, 92% of whom do not belong to unions,\" the group's president, Bill Wilson, wrote. \"In essence, nonunion employers and employees will be forced to subsidize the cost of exempting union workers from the tax, which will cost families in your states and districts thousands of dollars a year in additional charges.\"",

Obama is basically where Bush was at in 2006. In fact, I still stand by my comment that they are more similar than not.\n\n \n The extreme leftists wont abandon Obama because he is the closest they will ever get to their ideal president. But I have always maintained that the average democrat in America is far from the radical left which Obama truly represents at his core. \n \n In other words, take away the ballot stuffing in the last election and the only reason Obama won was because people believed his lies when he said whatever any and every group he spoke to wanted to hear. All of those people now realize they were conned by this extremist militant leftist, and they are both angry and scared that he will accomplish his agenda before we can vote him out. This is my fear also.\n \n People are so untrusting of him and his cronies that they are convinced that even if Brown wins the democrat majority will delay swearing him in until after they rush their vote through in the middle of the night. It has become obvious to most everyone that all that matters to these people is their agenda, not the will or the welfare of the people who elected them to serve our interests.\n \n In any other scenario, people who hold such high office yet ignore the will of the people for their own personal agendas would be considered enemies of the State and guilty of Treason, or at the very least a criminal level breach of the publics trust. Why these criminals aren't being held responsible for ignoring the Constitution is beyond me. emoticon_xdonno",
