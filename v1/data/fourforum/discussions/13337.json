   "The Police: No Duty To Protect Individuals\n (Warren v. D.C.) \n \n The Court's Decision: Appellants Carolyn Warren, Miriam Douglas, and Joan Taliaferro in No. 79-6, and appellant Wilfred Nichol in No. 79-394 sued the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department for negligent failure to provide adequate police services. The respective trial judges held that the police were under no specific legal duty to provide protection to the individual appellants and dismissed the complaints for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Super.Ct.Civ.R. 12(b)(6). However, in a split decision a three-judge division of this court determined that appellants Warren, Taliaferro and Nichol were owed a special duty of care by the police department and reversed the trial court rulings. \n \n The division unanimously concluded that appellant Douglas failed to fit within the class of persons to whom a special duty was owed, and affirmed the lower court's dismissal of her complaint. The court en banc, on petitions for rehearing, vacated the panel's decision. After rearguments, notwithstanding our sympathy for appellants who were the tragic victims of despicable criminal acts, we affirm the judgments of dismissal. \n \n Appeal No. 79-6 \n \n The Gruesome Facts of the Case: In the early morning hours of March 16, 1975, appellants Carolyn Warren, Joan Taliaferro, and Miriam Douglas were asleep in their rooming house at 1112 Lamont Street, N.W. Warren and Taliaferro shared a room on the third floor of the house; Douglas shared a room on the second floor with her four-year-old daughter. The women were awakened by the sound of the back door being broken down by two men later identified as Marvin Kent and James Morse. The men entered Douglas' second floor room, where Kent forced Douglas to sodomize him and Morse raped her. \n \n Warren and Taliaferro heard Douglas' screams from the floor below. Warren telephoned the police, told the officer on duty that the house was being burglarized, and requested immediate assistance. The department employee told her to remain quiet and assured her that police assistance would be dispatched promptly. \n \n Warren's call was received at Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters at 6:23 a. m., and was recorded as a burglary in progress. At 6:26 a.m., a call was dispatched to officers on the street as a \"Code 2\" assignment, although calls of a crime in progress should be given priority and designated as \"Code 1.\" Four police cruisers responded to the broadcast; three to the Lamont Street address and one to another address to investigate a possible suspect. \n \n Meanwhile, Warren and Taliaferro crawled from their window onto an adjoining roof and waited for the police to arrive. While there, they saw one policeman drive through the alley behind their house and proceed to the front of the residence without stopping, leaning out the window, or getting out of the car to check the back entrance of the house. A second officer apparently knocked on the door in front of the residence, but left when he received no answer. The three officers departed the scene at 6:33 a.m., five minutes after they arrived. \n \n Warren and Taliaferro crawled back inside their room. They again heard Douglas' continuing screams; again called the police; told the officer that the intruders had entered the home, and requested immediate assistance. Once again, a police officer assured them that help was on the way. This second call was received at 6:42 a. m. and recorded merely as \"investigate the trouble\" -- it was never dispatched to any police officers. \n \n Believing the police might be in the house, Warren and Taliaferro called down to Douglas, thereby alerting Kent to their presence. Kent and Morse then forced all three women, at knifepoint, to accompany them to Kent's apartment. For the next fourteen hours the women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of Kent and Morse. \n \n Appellants' claims of negligence included: the dispatcher's failure to forward the 6:23 a.m. call with the proper degree of urgency; the responding officers' failure to follow standard police investigative procedures, specifically their failure to check the rear entrance and position themselves properly near the doors and windows to ascertain whether there was any activity inside; and the dispatcher's failure to dispatch the 6:42 a. m. call. \n \n Appeal No. 79-394 \n \n No Duty to Protect: On April 30, 1978, at approximately 11:30 p.m., appellant Nichol stopped his car for a red light at the intersection of Missouri Avenue and Sixteenth Street, N.W. Unknown occupants in a vehicle directly behind appellant struck his car in the rear several times, and then proceeded to beat appellant about the face and head breaking his jaw. \n \n A Metropolitan Police Department officer arrived at the scene. In response to the officer's direction, appellant's companion ceased any further efforts to obtain identification information of the assailants. When the officer then failed to get the information, leaving Nichol unable to institute legal action against his assailants, Nichol brought a negligence action against the officer, the Metropolitan Police Department and the District of Columbia. \n \n The trial judges correctly dismissed both complaints. In a carefully reasoned Memorandum Opinion, Judge Hannon based his decision in No. 79-6 on \"the fundamental principle that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any particular individual citizen.\" See p. 4, infra. The duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists. Holding that no special relationship existed between the police and appellants in No. 79-6, Judge Hannon concluded that no specific legal duty existed. We hold that Judge Hannon was correct and adopt the relevant portions of his opinion. Those portions appear in the following Appendix.[fn1] \n \n Judge Pryor, then of the trial court, ruled likewise in No. 79-394 on the basis of Judge Hannon's opinion. In No. 79-394, a police officer directed Nichol's companion to cease efforts to identify the assailants and thus to break off the violent confrontation. The officer's duty to get that identification was one directly related to his official and general duty to investigate the offenses. His actions and failings were solely related to his duty to the public generally and possessed no additional element necessary to create an overriding special relationship and duty.[fn2] \n \n Here the effort to separate the hostile assailants from the victims -- a necessary part of the on-scene responsibility of the police -- adds nothing to the general duty owed the public and fails to create a relationship which imposes a special legal duty such as that created when there is a course of conduct, special knowledge of possible harm, or the actual use of individuals in the investigation. See Falco v. City of New York, 34 A.D.2d 673, 310 N.Y.S.2d 524 (App. Div. 1970), aff'd, 29 N.Y.2d 918, 329 N.Y.S.2d 97, 279 N.E.2d 854 (1972) (police officer's Page 4 statement to injured motorcyclist that he would obtain name of motorist who struck the motorcycle was a gratuitous promise and did not create a special legal duty); Jackson v. Heyman, 126 N.J. Super. 281, 314 A.2d 82 (Super.Ct.Law Div. 1973) (police officers' investigation of vehicle accident where pedestrian was a minor child did not create a special legal duty to child's parents who were unsuccessful in their attempt to recover damages because police failed to identify drivers of vehicle). We hold that Judge Pryor did not err in dismissing No. 79-394 for failure to state a claim. \n \n In either case, it is easy to condemn the failings of the police. However, the desire for condemnation cannot satisfy the need for a special relationship out of which a duty to specific persons arises. In neither of these cases has a relationship been alleged beyond that found in general police responses to crimes. Civil liability fails as a matter of law.",

They don't show up to your house instantly, it takes time for them to arrive, and they may have more pressing matters to attend to. Remember, we're just citizens, there are things more important than us.\n \n \nThere was no information in the article at all about a call to the police, let alone, if they received a call, when they received it. The article simply reported that she went and got her gun after he left. She shot at his departing vehicle. Then the police arrested him. The entry of the police into the story is unexplained.\n \n We can only speculate.\n\n \n That statement was assuming she made a call, of course.\n \n Now imagine if she dialed 9-11, and didn't own a gun. How long would it take for the police to show up? And what could this guy have done in that time?\n \n \nConsider too, a scenario in which the police arrive when she is shooting at his departing vehicle. If they hadn't arrived -- this is a hypothetical, now -- but goes to your first point -- she shoots some more and hits his vehicle, he skids, runs into another vehicle, and in a head-on collision, the other driver, with children in the backseat are killed.\n\n \n This would've happened anyway, the police don't show up instantly. The ten to fifteen minutes it takes for police to show up is plenty of time for a robber to break into her house, kill and rape her, take a few thousand dollars worth of goods, and get away before the police arrive. It's also plenty of time for her to scare him out with a gun, then shoot his car and cause an accident. The police aren't there to prevent it. \n \n After this nothing is left but the evidence. Evidence doesn't ressurrect the dead.\n \n \nThe entry of the police in this tale prevents a crime from occurring.  You see, the woman with the gun is now the criminal. Without the police arriving on the scene to arrest him and stop her from using her firearm in such a reckless manner.\n\n \n No it doesn't, becuase unless the victim lives next door to the police station, in which case you'd have to be pretty bold to attempt a robbery, it'd take them a good ten to fifteen minutes to show up. A human being can be raped and killed in fifteen minutes. Thousands of dollars worth of goods can be stolen in fifteen minutes. \n \n Also, she fired at the car so apparently they didn't stop her from using the firearm. And fifteen minutes is plenty of time for the incident you described to occur.\n \n You seem to think you can cast a spell and summon the police on demand whenever you're in danger.\n \n First off, it takes time for the police to arrive. Second, the police may have other emergencies to respond to, so they may not respond to you instantly.\n \n No ordinary citizen in the U.S. has a constitutional right to police protection. Police may be able to save you, but if they're not, they can't be sued. In other words, when you call 9-11, if the police can respond to you, they will try to show up instantly and they will try to save you, but it's not their obligation, and if you're nothing but pulp and gore splattered everywhere when they arrive, they are not responsible. You can't depend on the police when a home invader is kicking your door down. A gun, on the other hand, can always be there when you need it.",

It doesn't mean that it isn't the function of the police to protect you.\n \n For example, when police shout, \"Get down,\" while in pursuit of a criminal, they are protecting people. Another example, if the police arrive at a scene with a shooter, their function is not just to get the shooter, but to prevent him from harming or killing more people than have already been harmed or killed; to protect other people.\n\n \n Umm QLD Is not a small community, it is the Biggest Island in the world.

Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) tracks the percentage of times that each lawmaker votes on the liberal side of an issue. Based on these votes, the ADA assigns a numerical score to each lawmaker, where \"100\" is the most liberal and \"0\" is the most conservative. After adjustments to compensate for disproportionate representation that the Senate gives to low&#8209;population states and the lack of representation for the District of Columbia, the average ADA score in Congress (50.1) was assumed to represent the political position of the average U.S. voter.\n \n Groseclose and Milyo then directed 21 research assistants &#8212; most of them college students &#8212; to scour U.S. media coverage of the past 10 years. They tallied the number of times each media outlet referred to think tanks and policy groups, such as the left-leaning NAACP or the right-leaning Heritage Foundation.\n \n Next, they did the same exercise with speeches of U.S. lawmakers.

   "MOUNT JULIET, Tenn. -- A woman in Mount Juliet got a scare this week when a man broke into her home while she was in the shower.\n \n The intruder quickly ran out, but the woman grabbed her gun and shot at his car.\n \n Police arrested Franklin Fish a short time later. The woman identified him as the burglar.\n \n Detectives believe Fish is wanted for several other home break-ins.\n Woman In Shower Shoots At Intruder - Nashville News Story - WSMV Nashville[/url]\n \n How do you think this would have played out if some of the \"reasonable\" gun laws the dim wits of the Brady bunch keep shilling for?\n\n \n As far as I can tell, the most authentic and enduring aspect of US democracy is the \"right to bear arms\". Once this \"right\" is rescinded then all that will be left is 'Big Macs and Coke'. \n \n Mark these words well if the dumbocrats dont disarm citizens then the repuglicans will - its a matter of time, not politics.",
