   "This is a little game that I like to play with people who know movies but you can also do it solitare. I think of an actor and then have to link that actor to another actor through roles other actors have played on movies, TV shows, and/or (I guess I'd allow) voice acting. An example is probably much more helpful so here is one.\n \n Chris Cooper to Jerry Seinfeld\n Chris Cooper < Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity) < Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting) < Bruce Willis (Armaggedon) < Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction) < Jude Law (Gataga) < Mark Whalberg (I emoticon_love Huckabees) < Alia Shawkat (3 Kings) < Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Arrested Development) < Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld)\n \n That is basically how it works. (I know I could have made this shorter but I wanted a long one for an example). The only rule is no using the same actor or movie/TV show twice in the same string (which would be dumb anyway). Ok, I'll supply the next one and the next post can give one for the next person and so on. (Use IMDB.com if you need help)\n \n Kelsey Grammar to George C. Scott",
