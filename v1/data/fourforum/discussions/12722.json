   "Can it really be called death when someone knows that in three days they will come back to life?\n\n \n Now for a medical explanation of the physical effects of being crucified:\n The Crucifixion Of Jesus\n A medical explanation of what Jesus endured on the day He died \n By Dr. C. Truman Davis*\n A Physician Analyzes the Crucifixion.\n From New Wine Magazine, April 1982.\n Originally published in Arizona Medicine,\n March 1965, Arizona Medical Association.\n \n Several years ago I became interested in the physical aspects of the passion, or suffering, of Jesus Christ when I read an account of the crucifixion in Jim Bishop's book, The Day Christ Died. I suddenly realized that I had taken the crucifixion more or less for granted all these years - that I had grown callous to its horror by a too-easy familiarity with the grim details. It finally occurred to me that, as a physician, I did not even know the actual immediate cause of Christ's death. The gospel writers do not help much on this point. Since crucifixion and scourging were so common during their lifetimes, they undoubtedly considered a detailed description superfluous. For that reason we have only the concise words of the evangelists: \"Pilate, having scourged Jesus, delivered Him to them to be crucified ... and they crucified Him.\"\n \n Despite the gospel accounts silence on the details of Christ's crucifixion, many have looked into this subject in the past. In my personal study of the event from a medical viewpoint, I am indebted especially to Dr. Pierre Barbet, a French surgeon who did exhaustive historical and experimental research and wrote extensively on the topic.\n An attempt to examine the infinite psychic and spiritual suffering of the Incarnate1 God in atonement for the sins of fallen man is beyond the scope of this article. However, the physiological and anatomical aspects of our Lord's passion we can examine in some detail. What did the body of Jesus of Nazareth actually endure during those hours of torture?\n \n Gethsemane\n The physical passion of Christ began in Gethsemane. Of the many aspects of His initial suffering, the one which is of particular physiological interest is the bloody sweat. Interestingly enough, the physician, St. Luke, is the only evangelist to mention this occurrence. He says, \"And being in an agony, he prayed the longer. And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground\" (Luke 22:44 KJV).\n \n Every attempt imaginable has been used by modern scholars to explain away the phenomenon of bloody sweat, apparently under the mistaken impression that it simply does not occur. A great deal of effort could be saved by consulting the medical literature. Though very rare, the phenomenon of hematidrosis, or bloody sweat, is well documented. Under great emotional stress, tiny capillaries in the sweat glands can break, thus mixing blood with sweat. This process alone could have produced marked weakness and possible shock.\n \n Although Jesus' betrayal and arrest are important portions of the passion story, the next event in the account which is significant from a medical perspective is His trial before the Sanhedrin and Caiaphas, the High Priest. Here the first physical trauma was inflicted. A soldier struck Jesus across the face for remaining silent when questioned by Caiaphas. The palace guards then blindfolded Him, mockingly taunted Him to identify them as each passed by, spat on Him, and struck Him in the face.\n \n Before Pilate\n In the early morning, battered and bruised, dehydrated, and worn out from a sleepless night, Jesus was taken across Jerusalem to the Praetorium of the Fortress Antonia, the seat of government of the Procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate. We are familiar with Pilate's action in attempting to shift responsibility to Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Judea. Jesus apparently suffered no physical mistreatment at the hands of Herod and was returned to Pilate. It was then, in response to the outcry of the mob, that Pilate ordered Barabbas released and condemned Jesus to scourging and crucifixion.\n \n Preparations for Jesus' scourging were carried out at Caesar's orders. The prisoner was stripped of His clothing and His hands tied to a post above His head. The Roman legionnaire stepped forward with the flagrum, or flagellum, in his hand. This was a short whip consisting of several heavy, leather thongs with two small balls of lead attached near the ends of each. The heavy whip was brought down with full force again and again across Jesus' shoulders, back, and legs. At first the weighted thongs cut through the skin only. Then, as the blows continued, they cut deeper into the subcutaneous tissues, producing first an oozing of blood from the capillaries and veins of the skin and finally spurting arterial bleeding from vessels in the underlying muscles.\n \n The small balls of lead first produced large deep bruises that were broken open by subsequent blows. Finally, the skin of the back was hanging in long ribbons, and the entire area was an unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue. When it was determined by the centurion in charge that the prisoner was near death, the beating was finally stopped.\n \n Mockery\n The half-fainting Jesus was then untied and allowed to slump to the stone pavement, wet with his own blood. The Roman soldiers saw a great joke in this provincial Jew claiming to be a king. They threw a robe across His shoulders and placed a stick in His hand for a scepter. They still needed a crown to make their travesty complete. Small flexible branches covered with long thorns, commonly used for kindling fires in the charcoal braziers in the courtyard, were plaited into the shape of a crude crown. The crown was pressed into his scalp and again there was copious bleeding as the thorns pierced the very vascular tissue. After mocking Him and striking Him across the face, the soldiers took the stick from His hand and struck Him across the head, driving the thorns deeper into His scalp. Finally, they tired of their sadistic sport and tore the robe from His back. The robe had already become adherent to the clots of blood and serum in the wounds, and its removal, just as in the careless removal of a surgical bandage, caused excruciating pain. The wounds again began to bleed.\n \n Golgotha\n In deference to Jewish custom, the Romans apparently returned His garments. The heavy patibulum of the cross was tied across His shoulders. The procession of the condemned Christ, two thieves, and the execution detail of Roman soldiers headed by a centurion began its slow journey along the route which we know today as the Via Dolorosa.\n \n In spite of Jesus' efforts to walk erect, the weight of the heavy wooden beam, together with the shock produced by copious loss of blood, was too much. He stumbled and fell. The rough wood of the beam gouged into the lacerated skin and muscles of the shoulders. He tried to rise, but human muscles had been pushed beyond their endurance. The centurion, anxious to proceed with the crucifixion, selected a stalwart North African onlooker, Simon of Cyrene, to carry the cross. Jesus followed, still bleeding and sweating the cold, clammy sweat of shock. The 650-yard journey from the Fortress Antonia to Golgotha was finally completed. The prisoner was again stripped of His clothing except for a loin cloth which was allowed the Jews.\n \n The crucifixion began. Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh, a mild analgesic, pain-reliving mixture. He refused the drink. Simon was ordered to place the patibulum on the ground, and Jesus was quickly thrown backward, with His shoulders against the wood. The legionnaire felt for the depression at the front of the wrist. He drove a heavy, square wrought-iron nail through the wrist and deep into the wood. Quickly, he moved to the other side and repeated the action, being careful not to pull the arms too tightly, but to allow some flexion and movement. The patibulum was then lifted into place at the top of the stipes, and the titulus reading \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\" was nailed into place.\n \n The left foot was pressed backward against the right foot. With both feet extended, toes down, a nail was driven through the arch of each, leaving the knees moderately flexed. The victim was now crucified.\n \n On the Cross\n As Jesus slowly sagged down with more weight on the nails in the wrists, excruciating, fiery pain shot along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the brain. The nails in the wrists were putting pressure on the median nerve, large nerve trunks which traverse the mid-wrist and hand. As He pushed himself upward to avoid this stretching torment, He placed His full weight on the nail through His feet. Again there was searing agony as the nail tore through the nerves between the metatarsal bones of this feet.\n \n At this point, another phenomenon occurred. As the arms fatigued, great waves of cramps swept over the muscles, knotting them in deep relentless, throbbing pain. With these cramps came the inability to push Himself upward. Hanging by the arm, the pectoral muscles, the large muscles of the chest, were paralyzed and the intercostal muscles, the small muscles between the ribs, were unable to act. Air could be drawn into the lungs, but could not be exhaled. Jesus fought to raise Himself in order to get even one short breath. Finally, the carbon dioxide level increased in the lungs and in the blood stream, and the cramps partially subsided.\n \n The Last Words\n Spasmodically, He was able to push Himself upward to exhale and bring in life-giving oxygen. It was undoubtedly during these periods that He uttered the seven short sentences that are recorded.\n The first - looking down at the Roman soldiers throwing dice6 for His seamless garment: \"Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do.\"\n \n The second - to the penitent thief: \"Today, thou shalt be with me in Paradise.\"\n \n The third - looking down at Mary His mother, He said: \"Woman, behold your son.\" Then turning to the terrified, grief-stricken adolescent John , the beloved apostle, He said: \"Behold your mother.\"\n \n The fourth cry is from the beginning of Psalm 22: \"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\"\n \n He suffered hours of limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending cramps, intermittent partial asphyxiation, and searing pain as tissue was torn from His lacerated back from His movement up and down against the rough timbers of the cross. Then another agony began: a deep crushing pain in the chest as the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, slowly filled with serum and began to compress the heart.\n \n The prophecy in Psalm 22:14 was being fulfilled: \"I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint, my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.\"\n \n The end was rapidly approaching. The loss of tissue fluids had reached a critical level; the compressed heart was struggling to pump heavy, thick, sluggish blood to the tissues, and the tortured lungs were making a frantic effort to inhale small gulps of air. The markedly dehydrated tissues sent their flood of stimuli to the brain. Jesus gasped His fifth cry: \"I thirst.\" Again we read in the prophetic psalm: \"My strength is dried up like a potsherd; my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou has brought me into the dust of death\" (Psalm 22:15 KJV).\n \n A sponge soaked in posca, the cheap, sour wine that was the staple drink of the Roman legionnaires, was lifted to Jesus' lips. His body was now in extremis, and He could feel the chill of death creeping through His tissues. This realization brought forth His sixth word, possibly little more than a tortured whisper: \"It is finished.\" His mission of atonement had been completed. Finally, He could allow His body to die. With one last surge of strength, He once again pressed His torn feet against the nail, straightened His legs, took a deeper breath, and uttered His seventh and last cry: \"Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.\"\n \n Death\n The common method of ending a crucifixion was by crurifracture, the breaking of the bones of the leg. This prevented the victim from pushing himself upward; the tension could not be relieved from the muscles of the chest, and rapid suffocation occurred. The legs of the two thieves were broken, but when the soldiers approached Jesus, they saw that this was unnecessary.\n \n Apparently, to make doubly sure of death, the legionnaire drove his lance between the ribs, upward through the pericardium and into the heart. John 19:34 states, \"And immediately there came out blood and water.\" Thus there was an escape of watery fluid from the sac surrounding the heart and the blood of the interior of the heart. This is rather conclusive post-mortem evidence that Jesus died, not the usual crucifixion death by suffocation, but of heart failure due to shock and constriction of the heart by fluid in the pericardium.\n \n Resurrection\n In these events, we have seen a glimpse of the epitome of evil that man can exhibit toward his fellow man and toward God. This is an ugly sight and is likely to leave us despondent and depressed.\n \n But the crucifixion was not the end of the story. How grateful we can be that we have a sequel: a glimpse of the infinite mercy of God toward man--the gift of atonement, the miracle of the resurrection, and the expectation of Easter morning.\n \n *Dr. C.

   "The trinity (three persons, yet one God) is something that no true Bible scholar is going to claim to fully understand. While Christ was on earth, it wasn't exactly the same as God walking on earth. He had many attributes of a man, enough so that his relationship to God required some measure of faith, and his faith was perfect. God completly abandoned him in his death - it wasn't like God was right next to him the whole time saying; \"just a few more days and it's over, buddy.\" He was completely alone, more alone than any of us have EVER been, including you, atheists. emoticon_xangel\n\n \n Very true marc, in fact as you know, when Jesus took the sins of humanity upon Himself, God turned His back on Him and for the first time Jesus was totally alone. This is why He cried out \"Father Father, why have you forsaken me?\" He was abandoned and He knew it, since He became sin for us. \n \n Also, if Jesus wasn't dreading what was coming, and if it was just a walk in the park, why did He pray so hard in the garden of Gethsemane for this cup to pass that He sweat drops of blood? No, Jesus loved life like the rest of us do and He didn't look forward to what He suffered for us. He still allowed it to happen to Him though. \n \n But the atheist will never consider the reality of what that single event did to change the world since they would then have to admit that they are at war with the very God of creation who created them in His image.",

He isn't hanging at all but attempting to maintain the required 60 to 70 degree angle. http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/zugibe9.jpg Do you sincerely believe that if that subject had a spike through both feet that he would be able to maintain that position for even 10 seconds? Of course not. He would be hanging with the full weight of his body on his arms as he attempted to switch his weight from from hands to feet for any possible temporary relief. \n \n The attempt to find a comfortable position would be exhausting to the max as his muscles burned, went into spasms. And this doesn't require faith at all, just common sense and the ability to place one self in that position.\n \n \nIf you want to believe, as an article of faith, that crucifixion typically asphyxiated its victims, I suppose that's your right. \n \n I perfer to rest my conclusions on the data, and the data shows that Barbet's conclusions are not sound.\n\n \n I must repeat that I posted Zugibe's own research as evidence. Here is the heading from the link:PIERRE BARBET REVISITED\n \n Frederick T. Zugibe, M. D., Ph. D.\n \n Adjunct Associate Professor of Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians & Surgeons, N.Y. \n Chief Medical Examiner, Rockland County, N.Y.\n Zugibe Barbet Revisited Forensic Study of Crucifixion\n \n I have also pointed out a variety of the obvious symptoms which would lead to the ultimate death of the victims of crucifixion. And hopefully have made clear that it is a combination of these simultaneous reactions to this form of execution which kills them. So I'm not saying that asphyxiation kills them anymore than drowning in their own fluids, dehydration, shock or the loss of blood which all contributed to death equally. \n \n \nThis analogy makes no sense. Because the aerobic problems result from arm angle, we don't need to nail or scourge our test subjects to see if a Roman era crucifixion would typically asphyxiate its victims. What we need to do is to hang them from a cross at a particular lower arm angle and measure the effect on their breathing.\n \n Which is what Zugibe did.\n\n \n The analogy is very accurate in that it reflects a recreation of a particular form of execution without utilizing real world condition. It's impossible to get accurate results without reproducing the physical stresses which the original circumstances place on a body.\n \n Regarding this arm angle, just imagine the full weight of the body on the arms even at that original angle. And your telling me the aerobic problems don't occur anyway in a real world situation? Pleeeaaase Art, the study you are relying on isn't realistic in any way. You do realize that in many cases the arms pull out of their sockets don't you? The muscles and tendons rip and stretch. The pain they would experience is likened to burning without even considering the shock and pain from the spikes through the wrist bones. You just aren't giving this most brutal form of execution the real world credit for brutality which it deserves, and neither did Zugibe in his attempted recreation.",

   "This is the last i'll say on the subject. I'm getting awfully tired of repeating myself and getting nothing substantive in return.\n \n 1) Barbet's theory, repeated in the original article, critically depends on stresses resulting from the suspension of the victim's arms over the head.\n \n 2) Zubige correctly understood that this position would not have been typical in a Roman crucifixion. In order to determine if Barbet's hypothesis could account for the typical case, he affixed test subjects in a more appropriate manner. He also told subjects \"not to attempt to lift the body up at any time by straightening their legs,\" meaning the photo should not be taken as indicating general experimental practice. The results of these experiments effectively falsified Barbet.\n \n It is just not true that the entire body weight would be supported by the arms (victims were also affixed at the ankle), or that this would even matter. The arm angle is as maximally wide as the hands or wirsts are nailed to the patibulum, and numerous Roman sources attest to victims being affixed with arms outstretched.\n \n It is just not true that by not nailing his subjects to the cross, Zugibe was unable to falsify the asphyxiation hypothesis. The reason, as I stated before, is that asphyxiation works independent of nailing via arm angle. So while Zugibe's experiment could not rule out other hypotheses of death causation, it can and did rule out asphyxiation.\n \n So, the only evidence for the asphyxiation theory is Barbet's observations. His observations don't apply to the typical Roman crucifixion where the arm angle wasn't sufficent to cause aerobic distress. There is, consequently, absolutely no reason to think that asphyxiation was the cause of death in the typical case.\n \n QE-mother f'in-D.\n \n ETA: Also note that those subjects who were only suspended by the arms had no difficultly breathing either.",

Is this person what you would consider a nice guy? \n\n \n Your analogy works if the woman owes the man.......$10 billion, and she works a minimum wage job. His response wouldn't necessarily be a threat of a worst nightmare if she refused, it would be a simple direction to start paying the $10 billion - with interest of course on however long it took.

If it hadn't then God would have to wait until after the event to know the decision you made. God hasn't got a time machine.\n\n \n Educate yourself regarding the divine attributes of God winston. Here's one quote to start with.\n THE DIVINE WISDOM AND FOREKNOWLEDGE OF GOD\n \n With respect to The divine wisdom and foreknowledge, I shall lay down the following positions:\n \n Position l.--God is, and always was so perfectly wise, that nothing ever did, or does, or can elude His knowledge. He knew, from all eternity, not only what He Himself intended to do, but also what He would incline and permit others to do. \"Known unto God are all His works from eternity\" (Acts 15:18).\n \n Position 2.--Consequently, God knows nothing now, nor will know anything hereafter, which He did not know and foresee from everlasting, His foreknowledge being co-eternal with Himself, end extending to everything that is or shall be done (Heb. 4:13). All things, which comprises past, present and future, are naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\n \n Position 3.--This foreknowledge of God is not conjectural and uncertain (for then it would not be foreknowledge), but most sure and infallible, so that whatever He foreknows to be future shall necessarily and undoubtedly come to pass. For His knowledge can no more be frustrated, or His wisdom be deceived, than He can cease to be God. Could either of these be the case, He actually would cease to be God.\n \n Position 4. --The influence which the Divine foreknowledge has on the certain futurition of the things foreknown does not render the intervention of second causes needless, nor destroy the nature of the things themselves.\n \n My meaning is, that the prescience of God does not lay any coercive necessity on the wills of beings naturally free. For instance, man, even in his fallen state, is endued with a natural freedom of will, yet he acts, from the first to the last moment of his life, in absolute subserviency (though, perhaps, he does not know it nor design it) to the purposes and decrees of God concerning him, notwithstanding which, he is sensible of no compulsion, but acts as freely and voluntarily as if he was subject to no control and absolutely lord of himself. This made Luther, after he had shown how all things necessarily and inevitably come to pass, in consequence of the sovereign will and infallible foreknowledge of God, say that \"we should carefully distinguish between a necessity of infallibility and a necessity of coaction, since both good and evil men, though by their actions they fulfil the decree and appointment of God, yet are not forcibly constrained to do any thing, but act willingly.\"http://www.mbrem123.com/god/godatt.php",

For instance it would move towards a power point whenever his batteries ran low, and it would think : \"I am feeling weak, I'd better top up \" or to clean itself when dirty etc. the awareness of the action it is executing makes it think it is itself making the decision. \n The same with we observe ourselves acting in this or another manner and we think that 'we', whatever we think \"we\" is, is the one making the decision.\n \n \n when you ride a bicycle are you aware of making a decision every time you move your legs up and every time you move them down. do you make a decision to lean in order to turn or just experience yourself doing it?\n your body just does it, doesn't it?\n \n If free will as you depict existed every thing you do would have to be pondered and decided by a \"little man\" inside your head and another little man inside the little man ad infinitum.",

Period\n \n you silly response to the above was: 'we all die\"\n \n all the above are not man made suffering those are Nature's actions and God's actions.\n \n free will : making decisions and having choices?\n \n who is making the decision? you are aware an event has taken place that is all an event that is all. being a witness inside your mind is not the same as making it.\n \n For example you are sitting at your desk and you realise you are getting up, why because you notice the thought : I am going to go to the kitchen and you experience yourself getting up and doing so.\n awareness that a decision has been made it is not the same as being the originator of the decision.\n \n We could in theory build a robot and make him act by remote control and every time we make him do something we can make it think: I am going to move in that direction, I am going to stop etc and the robot would never be aware that someone else was calling the shots or programmed it to execute those movements under certain stimuli. For instance it would move towards a power point whenever his batteries ran low, and it would think : \"I am feeling weak, I'd better top up \" or to clean itself when dirty etc. the awareness of the action it is executing makes it think it is itself making the decision. \n The same with we observe ourselves acting in this or another manner and we think that 'we', whatever we think \"we\" is, is the one making the decision.\n \n \n when you ride a bicycle are you aware of making a decision every time you move your legs up and every time you move them down. do you make a decision to lean in order to turn or just experience yourself doing it?\n your body just does it, doesn't it?\n \n If free will as you depict existed every thing you do would have to be pondered and decided by a \"little man\" inside your head and another little man inside the little man ad infinitum.\n\n \n \n In order, for the first three paras: we have agreed we do not know God's will. Whether he is cruel or not is our current perception it most likely isn't his. There can well be other reasons.\n \n The rest is I think a misunderstanding by you. If I stand up or sit down, that is a decision freely made by me. I do not accept your witness theorey. And yes if I am approaching the corner, I make the decision to turn. I could say damn it I'll go straight on. I am responsible for the result.\n \n Who else is making the decision ?\n \n If I decide I will read this book rather than that I make the decision.",

I will point out that once you received an answer that differed from the one you wanted to hear, you created situations that for you clearly proved your point.

Let's say a robot can be programmed to behave the same as a human being, does that make it a human being? When a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around, does it make a sound? What is the difference between the robot and the human? One is capable of functioning, living, dying, creative and rational thought without programming one is not. When you come back with the Nature Inc. \"what if\" we are bio nano robots that have moved past the original program and are now capable of functioning, living, dying, creative and rational thought go read what the definition of free will is making sure you get what it says, not what you think it says and if that part you missed the first time is present in your what if then either way you have your answer. Yes it really is that simple. \n \n Your statement that I probably hate philosophy because I referenced a dictionary as evidence for the definition of words is quite the leap. Maybe I am wrong but that is where I would start if I wanted to know the meaning of a word. It wouldn't be my first choice if I wanted to bake a cake. Fear not all the other sources of reference are safe from being made obsolete by the dictionary.\n \n As for your natural disasters and uncaring God, why don't you let the homeless person at the liquor store live with you? Why don't you grow corn in your backyard and give it to people without food? Why don't you tell people they are going to die before rain turns into a flood? Do you not care? Are these things so trivial to you? Probably not, but maybe whatever answer you come up with is the same as God's.\n \n As for student curriculums, I say keep philosophy, me is undecided, myself is disenfranchised so won't vote leaving us and we who cast absentee ballots that haven't been counted yet.\n emoticon_ideaemoticon_xbye",

So let's take a closer look just from the Old Testament:\n \n ONE GOD OR THREE?\n \n EXAMPLE # 1: The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes, rather than refutes, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which often demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Numbers 13:23, it speaks of a \"cluster\" of grapes. The word \"cluster\" is again the Hebrew word echad. Obviously, this singular cluster of grapes consisted of more than one grape.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. \n \n It is important to understand that Scripture interprets Scripture. By interpreting Deuteronomy 6:4 in conjunction with other verses, we learn that the one true God is triune in personality (2 Cor. 13:14), i.e., there are three persons in this one nature. \n \n Each of the three persons of the Trinity is called God in Scripture: the Father (1 Peter 1:2), the Son (John 20:28), and the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4). Moreover, each possesses the attributes of deity-including omnipresence (Ps. 139:7; Matt. 28:20; Heb. 4:13), omniscience (Matt. 9:4; Rom. 11:33; 1 Cor. 2:10), and omnipotence (Matt. 28:18; Rom. 15:19; 1 Peter 1:5). \n \n Three-in-oneness within the Godhead is clear in such passages as Matthew 28:19: \"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\" (niv). The word name is singular in the Greek, indicating that there is one God. But there are three distinct persons within the Godhead, as indicated by the three definite articles in the Greek-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This three-in-oneness is also reflected in 2 Corinthians 13:14. So, there is only one God, but there is a plurality within this unity-a plurality of persons within the unity of nature. - Norman Geisler \n \n EXAMPLE # 2: \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" denotes God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" is the plural notation for God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n EXAMPLE #3: Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God. A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,\n and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\"). This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking.\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n The \"Creators\" of the Universe\n \n The plurality of the Creator (Elohim) in Genesis 1:1 has been dismissed by many as simply a description of God's diverse nature. However, the plurality of the creator of heaven and earth is also seen in a number of other Old Testament verses. For example, in Ecclesiastes 12:1 we read,\n \n \"Remember also thy Creators in the days of thy youth, while the \n evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt\n say, 'I have no pleasure in them.\"\n \n \n The notion of a plural Creator is also seen in Isaiah 54:5, where the prophet states:\n \n \"For thy 'Maker' is thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts is His name.\"\n \n In the above verse, the word \"Maker\" is the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which denotes the plurality of the entity involved in the creative process.\n \n EXAMPLE #4: The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n So, please send that on to the twerps masquerading as scholars who still deny the Trinity. And tell them to get born-again, because only then will they be spiritually cognizant enough to really understand scripture (1 Corinthians 2:14).",

Is that the distinct aspect of the one true Jedi Yoda who together with the force are the voice of the Fozzi Bearhead?\n \n Because that is about where your coming from. Another way to look at this is you believe that 200 years after the death of Christ a couple of non-jewish, non-hebrew speaking, non-hebrew writing Gentiles realized that Jews for 2,000 years were completly oblivious to the Trinity that was so blantantly obvious in thier Greek and Latin translations of Jewish scripture. \n \n Because Jews don't recognize the Trinity never have and most likely never will. How come Jesus, The Apostles, including Paul never mention specifically anything about the Trinity? \n \n Perhaps if you read the links I had posted two things would have happened\n A) You would have seen my evidence in response to your argument.\n B) You may have learned several more things that you could ignore. (Having choices is always good. You could have had a much larger selection of facts to pretend don't exist, aren't credible, don't take into consideration your need to be right and all the protective thoughts you come up with.)\n \n Let's see some of my spiritually challenged ##### nincompoops are \n \n New Catholic Encyclopedia, The Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Church of England Bishop George Smalridge, The Apostle Paul and Eusebius to name a few. \n \n I didn't see where you got your info, did you include it and I just missed it?\n \n Since you went to the trouble of ignoring my links, which already address all the new stuff you posted, I will deal with a couple and then give you a few more links to ignore. \n \n Just curious for you what really is the significance of the Trinity today? If their was God who was different from the son who was different from the Holy Spirit would you suddenly toss out your Bible and change religions? I know why it came about originally, but those reasons aren't relevant anymore and Christianity for some reason just keeps digging itself a bigger hole trying to defend ideas put in place 2000 - 3000 years ago. Not everbody went to college and had internet access back then. To think people 2000 years ago would have the ability to consitantly provide answers to questions relevant to us now and in another 2000 years is absurd.\n \n But instead Christians know best, better than God since you will also see verses that were changed in order to support the trinity. Do a little research and you will learn what happened to those who didn't agree with the Trinity as it evolved into what we have today. (Here is a hint. Most of them were killed)\n \n Good luck with that. \n The Old Testament\n \n \"A search of the Hebrew Scriptures for any sign of a duality or Trinity of divine persons active in the creation will provide fruitless. To propose a Godhead of more than one person would require us to cast aside the rules of language and grammar. Responsible historians, both secular and religious, agree that the Jews of Jesus' time held firmly to faith in a unipersonal God. It is one of the great ironies of history that Christian theologians have denied the Jews the right to explain the meaning of God in their own Scriptures.\"\n --Sir Anthony F. Buzzard and Charles F. Hunting, The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound (Oxford: International Scholars Publications, 1998), 29.\n \n \"The doctrine of the Trinity is not taught in the Old Testament.\"\n --New Catholic Encyclopedia, Pub. Guild., 1967, 14:306.\n \n \"It remains a fact that the doctrine of the Trinity was never defended in the whole of the New Testament. This could simply be because it was unheard of. The Messiah is seen in the New Testament documents as the unique, legal representative of God, not as the second member of the Trinity.[...] The correctness of this evaluation is confirmed by the startling fact that there is no text in the New Testament in which the term ho theos (\"God\") means 'Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.' The reasons appears to be that no writer thought that God was 'three-in-one.' It ought to be a matter of concern for Trinitarians that when they say 'God,' they mean the Triune God, but when the New Testament (or indeed the whole Bible) says 'God,' a Triune God is never meant. It would be hard to find more conclusive evidence that the Triune God is not the God of Scripture.[..] Discussion of the Trinity often centers around a handful of New Testament verses which are meant to prove that Jesus is the Supreme Deity rather than the perfect reflection of Deity, the authorized human ambassador of the One God. Some modern proponents of Trinitarianism produce these verses as though it were self-evident that their testimony favors Trinitarianism. There is a strong tradition among Trinitarians of the highest repute, however, that these texts do not establish the Deity of Jesus.[...] We suggest that a false distinction has been drawn between a so-called 'high' Christology of John and the Christology 'from below' of the Synoptics [Mark, Matthew, and Luke]. Both John and the Synoptics present a Jesus who comes not only 'from above' (Matthew and Luke by describing Jesus' divine origin in the womb of Mary), but also 'from behind,' by which Jesus is the culmination of the Old Testament promise that the greater son of David will appear. In fact, all New Testament Christology is Messianic. Each writer contributes, with different emphases, to the one portrait f Jesus as Son of God, in that Messianic sense. It is the transition from 'Son of God' in the biblical sense to 'God the Son' which has proved so devastating to the apostolic presentation of Jesus.[...] Some of the arguments advanced in favor of the doctrine of the Trinity are remarkably misleading. In the Bible, it is said, there is one called the Father who is God, one called the Son who is God and one called the Holy Spirit who is God. But we know that there is only one God. Therefore there must be three persons who compose the one God. This is an extraordinary way of presenting the evidence. In fact there is one in the New Testament called the Father who is said to be the One God (ho theos) over 1300 times. He is also designated 'the only God' (Rom. 16:27; Jude 25), 'the one who alone is God' (John 5;44) and 'the only true God' (John 17:3). There is one called the Son, Jesus Christ, who is given the title God (theos) twice for certain (John 20:28; Heb. 1:8), but is never called ho theos (used absolutely), the 'only God,' 'the one who alone is God,' or 'the only true God.' The data hardly suggests that there are two who are to be ranked equally as God, both being the one God. Add to this the fact that God in the Old Testament is said to be a single individual thousands of times, and it should be clear that Trinitarianism does not do justice to the biblical data. Moreover, the titles 'only god,' 'one who alone is God' 'and only true God,' applied exclusively to the Father, point to a unique classification for Him as distinct from the Son. A mass of New Testament texts present Jesus as subordinate to the Father, a fact not easily reconciled with the notion that the son is coequal with the Father. Paul believed that the Son would be for all time subjected to the Father, after he had handed back the (future) Kingdom of God (1 Cor. 15:28). If the Trinity were taught in the New Testament, one would expect at least one verse somewhere stating that the one God is 'Father, son and Holy Spirit.' Such a statement is absent from the pages of Scripture. When Father, Son and Holy Spirit are placed together in a biblical passage, they are never said to be 'the one God' (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). It is remarkable that greetings at the opening of Paul's epistles are never sent from the Holy Spirit. Nor is the Holy Spirit ever addressed or prayed to. When Paul, however, defines monotheism as distinct from polytheism, he expressly says that there is one God, the Father, and that there is no other God but that one God, the Father (1. Cor. 8:4, 6). That in its simplest beauty is the biblical creed. It should lay all argument to rest.\"\n --Sir Anthony F. Buzzard and Charles F. Hunting, The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound (Oxford: International Scholars Publications, 1998), 37, 275, 279, 330, 332, 333.\n \n Elohim, Echad, and the Holy Name of God\n \n \"Though a plural form, elohim can be treated as a singular, in which case it means the one supreme Deity...There is only one supreme God and he is a Person.\"\n --\"God\" in the Illustrated Bible Dictionary (InterVarsity Press, 1980), 571.\n \n \"Even weaker [than the argument for plurality within the Godhead because of Elohim] is the argument that the Hebrew word for 'one' (echad) used in the Shema ('Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord') refers to a unified one, not an absolute one. Hence, some Trinitarians have argued, the Old Testament has a view of a united Godhead. It is, of course true that the meaning of the word may in some contexts denote a unified plurality (e.g. Gen. 2:24, 'they shall become one flesh'). But this really proves nothing. An examination of the Old Testament usage reveals that the word echad is as capable of various meanings as is our English word one. The context must determine whether a numeral or unified singularity is intended.\"\n --Trinitarian professor of theology Gregory Boyd, Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity (Baker Book House, 1995), 47, 48. \n \n \"The plural form of the Hebrew word for God, elohim, however, does not provide clues pointing to the Trinity. It is as misleading to talk of elohim as a 'uniplural' word as it is to say that echad, 'one,' hints at a plural Godhead. One cannot successfully argue the Trinity from the fact that echad can modify a noun like 'cluster' or 'herd' and therefore might lead us to think that God is compound. Echad is simply the numerical 'one' in Hebrew. 'Yahweh is one Lord,' so the creed of Israel states (Deu. 6:4). Echad appears as a modifier for 'Abraham' (Ezek. 33:24; Isa. 51:2), and it may sometimes be properly rendered as 'unique' (Ezek. 7:5). Its normal meaning is 'one and not two' (Ecc. 4:8). There is nothing at all in the word 'Yahweh' which suggests a plurality, especially since the word occurs with singular verbs and pronouns in all of its multiple thousands (about 5,500) of occurrences. If singular pronouns, constantly designating the One God, cannot persuade the reader that God is a single individual there is no little else in language that can. Elohim has singular verbs in nearly all of its 2500 references to the One God. An occasional anomaly proves as little as the fact that Joseph's master is described by a plural noun several times (Gen. 39:2, 3, 7, 8, 19, 20). Will anyone contend that 'Joseph's master [plural in Hebrew] took [singular verb] him' is incorrectly translated? Abraham is the 'masters' (plural in Hebrew) of his servant (Gen. 24:9, 10). Is there plurality in Abraham? No one would want to alter the translation of another passage in Genesis: 'The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us.' But though the verb is singular the noun has a plural form, 'the lords of the land' (Gen. 42:30) [see also Gen. 42:33: 'The man who is 'lords' of the land.']. We have in these examples the same plurality in Abraham, Potiphar and Joseph as is supposedly found in elohim when it refers to the Supreme God.\"\n --Sir Anthony F. Buzzard and Charles F. Hunting, The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound (Oxford: International Scholars Publications, 1998), 272.\n \n \"He that saith that Christ died, saith that Christ was not God, for God could not die. But every Christian saith that Christ died, therefore every Christian saith that Christ was not God.\"\n --Anonymous, c. 1655.\n \n The Origin of Trinitarianism\n \n \"It must be owned that the doctrine of the Trinity, as it is proposed in our Articles, our Liturgy, our Creeds, is not in so many words taught us in the Holy Scriptures. What we profess in our prayers we nowhere read in Scripture - that the One God, the one Lord, is not only one person but three persons in one substance. There is no such text in the Scripture as this, that 'the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.' None of the inspired writers have expressly affirmed that in the Trinity none is before or after the other, none is greater or less than the other, but the whole three persons are coeternal together and coequal.\"\n --Church of England Bishop George Smalridge, Sixty Sermons Prech'd on Several Occasions, no. 33, 348, cited by Wilson in Unitarian Principles Confirmed by Trinitarian Testimonies, 367.\n \n \"People who adhere to belief in the Bible only (as they believe) often adhere in fact to a traditional school of interpretation of sola scriptura. Evangelical Protestants can be as much servants of tradition as Roman Catholics or Greek Orthodox, only they don't realize that it is tradition.\"\n --F.F. Bruce, 1981.\n \n \"God is only one.\"\n --Apostle Paul, Epistle to the Galatians, 3:20\n \n \"There is but one God, the Father.\"\n --Apostle Paul, First Epistle to the Corinthians, 8:6.\n \n Matthew 28\n \n 1. Eusebius (c. 260-c. 340) was the Bishop of Caesarea and is known as \"the Father of Church History.\" Although he wrote prolifically, his most celebrated work is his Ecclesiastical History, a history of the Church from the Apostolic period until his own time. Today it is still the principal work on the history of the Church at that time. Eusebius quotes many verses in his writings, and Matthew 28:19 is one of them. He never quotes it as it appears today in modern Bibles, but always finishes the verse with the words \"in my name.\" For example, in Book III of his History, Chapter 5, Section 2, which is about the Jewish persecution of early Christians, we read:\n But the rest of the apostles, who had been incessantly plotted against with a view to their destruction, and had been driven out of the land of Judea, went unto all nations to preach the Gospel, relying upon the power of Christ, who had said to them, \"Go ye and make disciples of all the nations in my name.\"\n Again, in his Oration in Praise of Emperor Constantine, Chapter 16, Section 8, we read:\n What king or prince in any age of the world, what philosopher, legislator or prophet, in civilized or barbarous lands, has attained so great a height of excellence, I say not after death, but while living still, and full of mighty power, as to fill the ears and tongues of all mankind with the praises of his name? Surely none save our only Savior has done this, when, after his victory over death, he spoke the word to his followers, and fulfilled it by the event, saying to them, \"Go ye and make disciples of all nations in my name.\"\n Eusebius was present at the council of Nicaea and was involved in the debates about Arian teaching and whether Christ was God or a creation of God. We feel confident that if the manuscripts he had in front of him read \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\" he would never have quoted it as \"in my name.\" Thus, we believe that the earliest manuscripts read \"in my name,\" and that the phrase was enlarged to reflect the orthodox position as Trinitarian influence spread.\n \n Here is the rest\n \n BiblicalUnitarian.com - Content\n \n Verses changed\n Mark 3:11\n \"You are the Son of God\" was altered by scribes to read \"You are God, the Son of God\" to help support the Trinitarian position.\n Luke 2:26\n That Simeon would see \"the Lord's Christ\" was changed to read \"Christ, namely God.\"\n Luke 2:33\n Copyists changed \"Father\" to \"Joseph\" in many manuscripts. They thought this would \"clear up\" any possible confusion about the father of Jesus.\n Luke 2:41\n \"Parents\" was changed by scribes to read \"Joseph and Mary,\" lest someone become confused about Jesus' \"real\" parents.\n Ephesians 3:9\n \"God who created all things\" was changed to \"God who created all things through Jesus Christ.\"\n 1 John 5:7 and 8\n This text was markedly changed to reflect the Trinitarian position. Reading the KJV and the NIV shows the differences:\n 1 John 5:7 and 8 (KJV)\n (7) \"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.\n (8) And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.\" \n 1 John 5:7 and 8 (NIV)\n (7) \"For there are three that testify:\n (8) the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.\"\n The phrase, \"the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one,\" was added by Trinitarians. The NIV, a very Trinitarian Bible, omits the phrase, and the NIV Study Bible has this note about the verse: \"The addition is not found in any Greek manuscript or NT translation prior to the 16th century.\"\n \n And this link will address all the wonderfully creative, but wrong interesting little tid bits you were kind enough to share, but you have to read it otherwise you will say I didn't address you points again.\n \n BiblicalUnitarian.com - Verses Commonly Used to Try to Support the Doctrine of the Trinity\n \n emoticon_xgood",
