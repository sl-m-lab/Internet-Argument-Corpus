   "Saw this good article on Biblical Archaeology Review's website:\n Biblical Views: What&#8217;s Up with the Gospel of Thomas? | Biblical Archaeology Review | Bible History Articles\n \n Here's a snippet: \n \n \nNew manuscript discoveries continually expand our knowledge of what was actually going on in antiquity. The accommodation of this new knowledge can sometimes require us to create new histories. Yet as a Biblical scholar, I am constantly faced with the fact that our old academic models die hard. Why? Because there is a general resistance to changing previous understandings of the Bible based on the discovery of \"new\" nonbiblical manuscripts. For one thing, the religious view that the Bible is old, trustworthy and sacred has become a cultural icon in our society. Second, not only are believers invested in maintaining traditional faith, but scholars are invested in maintaining their previous academic opinions.\n \n I have noticed that new manuscript discoveries are often labeled in a way that diminishes their importance, both in religious communities and in the academy. Scholars determine that these manuscripts \"post-date\" the Bible, allowing them to be tabled. They are called \"Gnostic,\" by which these scholars mean that they were written by \"heretics\" who corrupted the scripture and were purged from the Church because they refused to worship the creator god YHWH and instead turned to pay homage to the \"one god\" who they believed existed beyond the universe.a They are thought of as \"forgeries,\" a legal term that identifies their authors as criminals who falsely assumed apostolic identities. What this might mean for 2 Thessalonians, Colossians or Ephesians (all claiming Paul's authorship but likely not written by Paul) rarely crosses our minds, because Biblical letters can't be forgeries. They are either \"anonymous\" or \"pseudonymous.\"\n \n Largely because of this resistance, it can take scholars decades to figure out what a manuscript means and put in place a new model that makes sense of the new evidence. It can take even longer for this new model to become common knowledge, distributed outside the academy.\n \n A case in point is the Gospel of Thomas. It was one of more than 50 texts that were discovered in 1945 by Bedouin in the Egyptian desert and came to be known as the Nag Hammadi codices.b Unlike the canonical gospels, it does not contain a narrative of Jesus' life and ministry but rather is a collection of Jesus' sayings, some of which are also recorded in the canonical gospels. It was immediately labeled Gnostic, late, secondary, Biblically dependent and inauthentic. Just as old models die hard, so, too, do first impressions last; today, if you open up almost any general book on the Gospel of Thomas, you will see that this is how it is still described. Yet during the intervening 50 years since it was first published, we have worked very hard to understand this text. We struggled with the Gnostic label for a long time until we realized that the Gnostics weren't a single group and that the Gospel of Thomas represents none of the various types that did exist (Sethian, Valentinian or any other Gnostic Christian community) because it lacks references to distinctive Gnostic mythologies, including the hallmark feature that the God of worship is not the creator god YHWH, but a god beyond our universe. \n\n \n There's more to the article, just click on the link.\n \n I thought this was pretty interesting, and an interesting look at how many immediately shoe anything that is new off as \"Gnostic\", anything that hasn't made it all down the centuries in the Bible.\n \n I wonder how many other books have been dismissed as \"Gnostic\" like this that could give us a good view of the early church and of Jesus?\n \n And how many have been lost for eternity?",

His phrases about it are completely inadequate.\n \n It has been an on-going debate for a long time whether or not the GoT should fall under the label of truly Gnostic literature. Regardless, I've read the Gospel of Thomas, and it's pretty clear its much more overtly mythological.

Religion can't win to folks like that--it's always damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don't.\n\n \n You misunderstand. There is no contradiction and you are right it is common sense. \n \n The criteria for acceptance into the Canon included that the text must conform to what conformed to the belief by church leaders at the time. Not that it be authentic or even correct. By the time they put forth a concerted effort to establish a consistent Canon there were no longer any survivors who could validate which books and which versions of those books. So they have an established criteria for selection, but can only cross their fingers and hope their educated guess is correct. \n \n The acceptance of the Canon was not a smooth or quick process. Bishops were excommunicated, banished, walked out, books were added then taken out and all the while and even well after scribes made mistakes some accidentally some not so accidentally. The book burnings don't help out much either. \n \n So my point was just because it is different doesn't automatically make it invalid. After all this isn't 4 people witness a crime and they tell stories that are reasonably close so if the 5th guy tells it completely different and with only half or a quarter are consistent with the rest who cares you have enough to move forward. This is the inspired word of God outlining the only known set of instructions on how to achieve salvation instead of damnation. So my common sense appears to be a little less willing to accept that that group of 3rd and 4th century Christians who were told make a choice or else got it right. \n \n I am not picking on Christianity just for fun. I truly think the position taken by most Christians that there is no reason to review the authenticity of both texts and verse with the intent of correcting errors not seeing how creative they can be in justifying them. This can't possibly bring them truly closer to God and it sucks the life out of any claims of credibility.",
