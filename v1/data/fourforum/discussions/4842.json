   "AS this is my second post and the number of debate options is enormous, I thought I would throw in my opinion as it regards the \"passport\" issue that was recently in the news. I apologize if this has already been addressed. However, was anyone else bothered by the fact that once again, our President, who doesn'r read papers, found out about this isuue from the Newspaper? I mean really, first Abu Ghraib, and now this? What's next? \n \n \"I didn't know we were \"this close\" to getting Bin Laden at Tora Bora!\"?\n \n OK, who is really in charge up there? Inquiring minds wan to know.",

Chances are he was briefed on this at one time and it slipped by without being fully discussed. When he saw it in print, he said what came immediately to mind. And then the press goes to work to make a mountain out of a molehill. And then there are some top level bureaucrats that simply get carried away. I think this story likely is less than meets the eye.",
