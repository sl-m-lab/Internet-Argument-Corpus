   "The US is going to build tactical nuclear weapons. Many people are commenting about how this is hypocritical due to the reason we took out Iraq in the first place. Here is a letter from the mayor of Hiroshima protesting the building of these nukes:\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Hiroshima Mayor Protests Bush's New Nuclear Weapons (5-1-3) \n The City of Hiroshima\n Letter of Protest \n \n His Excellency George W. Bush \n The President \n The White House \n The United States of America \n \n I have received a report that your administration has submitted to Congress a 2004 Defense Authorization Bill that requests funds for the development of small nuclear weapons with a yield of five kilotons or less, which development has been prohibited since 1993, and that would repeal the Furse-Spratt prohibition on the development of such weapons. \n \n This clear indication that the United States intends to develop small nuclear weapons raises the horrifying spectre that nuclear weapons will actually be used. As mayor of the A-bombed city Hiroshima I am outraged by the barbarism that has led you not only to attack Iraq, killing or injuring thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens, but also to develop new nuclear weapons. You are trampling viciously on the hopes of the vast majority of people around the world who seek peace and, on behalf of the residents of Hiroshima, I vehemently protest. \n \n Coming as it does on the eve of the UN NPT Review Conference Preparatory Committee, this announcement, together with statements regarding the necessity of resuming underground testing and rapidly developing new tactical nuclear weapons, represents an extremely regrettable frontal attack on the process of nuclear disarmament. \n \n I demand that you immediately begin demonstrating a willingness to implement the \"unequivocal undertaking\" to eliminate your nuclear arsenal promised at the previous NPT Review Conference, take a clear decision to terminate all nuclear testing, and devote the full strength of your great country to achieving a genuinely peaceful 21st century free from nuclear weapons. \n \n Tadatoshi Akiba \n Mayor of Hiroshima \n http://www.informationclearinghouse...article3185.htm\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I would like to debate someone that will take the stance of being against the building of these nukes. First one to accept will be my opponent. \n \n I'll make the opening argument here:\n \n 1) Sorry but as much as defeatists would like it the United States is not barred from having the nuclear weapons they have, as per the Nuclear Non-proliferation agreement that was ratified by most countries.\n \n 2) The United States has shown it is responsible with the weapons it has, I'm sorry but you don't see us using chemical weapons or nukes on our own people or Canadians.\n \n 3) To say that \"Iraq weapons of mass destruction didn't exist\" is a blatant slap in the face to all of the Kurds, Iranians, and Iraqis that died to due to those same weapons, the very ones Saddam already declared including 8500 liters of anthrax, large amounts of sarin, large amounts of vx, and amounts of mustard. Seeing as how you don't just declare all of this XXXX for fun, they had to have existed and to say that they didn't is simply neglecting what happened. \n \n 4) To say you would have rather risked thousand of allied soldiers and millions of the Japanese rather than drop an atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima is pretty ridiculous, suffice to say the atomic bomb saved many more lives that one can grasp seeing as how the Japanese fought with an intensity and perseverance rarely seen throughout world history. To say they weren't willing to make suicide attempts to kill as many as possible (which would in turn cost far more lives) is neglecting their fighting style at the time.\n \n 5) I'm sorry but the mayor of Hiroshima does not dictate the United States policy, and it is not up to them whether or not we will carry nuclear weapons. They should know first and foremost it had to be done seeing as how it saved so many people's lives, and the contributions that the United States made afterward to rebuild and reconstruct the Japanese economy are not to be undermined either.",

   "I'll take the challenge and debate you again. Let's follow the 9 post rule posted by dsa. We don't want to XXXX him off again, especially since the rule was posted before the debate this time :), and since he has set up the rankings and records thread, he might as well just become all-time judge of the forum.\n \n In response to your post - \n \n \n 1) Sorry but as much as defeatists would like it the United States is not barred from having the nuclear weapons they have, as per the Nuclear Non-proliferation agreement that was ratified by most countries. \n\n \n Just because the United States can have these weapons does not mean it is good or right for us to do so.\n \n \n 2) The United States has shown it is responsible with the weapons it has, I'm sorry but you don't see us using chemical weapons or nukes on our own people or Canadians. \n\n \n Once again, this doesn't mean that the United States should build these weapons.\n \n \n 3) To say that \"Iraq weapons of mass destruction didn't exist\" is a blatant slap in the face to all of the Kurds, Iranians, and Iraqis that died to due to those same weapons, the very ones Saddam already declared including 8500 liters of anthrax, large amounts of sarin, large amounts of vx, and amounts of mustard.

They should know first and foremost it had to be done seeing as how it saved so many people's lives, and the contributions that the United States made afterward to rebuild and reconstruct the Japanese economy are not to be undermined either. \n\n \n All of this is off topic.\n \n \n Here is why I oppose the building of these weapons -\n \n 1) There has only been one instance in history where atomic or nuclear weapons have been used, and the use of those weapons is debateable. The chances that these weapons will ever need to be used again are small. During the cold war, we continually attempted to increase our stockpile of weapons, forcing the Russians to keep up with us. Now that the cold war is over, we're taking many of them apart. We spent all that money, only to see what we spent it on thrown away, unused. Why should we now spend more money to build another weapon that we may never have a need for.\n \n 2) There is too much of a risk for accident with these bombs. At the Joliet, Illinois aresnal (near my home town), there were over 60 people killed when one bomb exploded while they were loading bombs onto a ship to be sent to WWII. If we begin to manufacture these \"tactical\" nuclear weapons, one accident like that could lead to the destruction of the entire aresnal and everyone working there.\n \n 3) If these bombs were to fall into the hands of terrorists, it could mean utter destruction for those they terrorise. It would not be too difficult for terrorists to get their hands on these weapons either. Both the United States and Russia admit to having developed these weapons in the past. However, if the United States begins to develop these weapons, Russia would, too. Many terrorists organizations have ties to Russia and could possibly get their hands on these weapons. One Russian general even admitted after they first developed these weapons that they were unable to account for all of them.\n Terrorists with these weapons would be able to do much worse than what happened on 9/11. They could shut down an entire city. Placing a nuclear weapon in the center of the city could not only destroy a large portion of a city, but would also cause radioactive contamination and mass havoc and confusion.",

   "We spent all that money, only to see what we spent it on thrown away, unused. Why should we now spend more money to build another weapon that we may never have a need for\n\n Because the possibility that we WILL have a need for these weapons exists. Having another opition available if needed justifies the cost.\nThere is too much of a risk for accident with these bombs. At the Joliet, Illinois aresnal (near my home town), there were over 60 people killed when one bomb exploded while they were loading bombs onto a ship to be sent to WWII. If we begin to manufacture these \"tactical\" nuclear weapons, one accident like that could lead to the destruction of the entire aresnal and everyone working there.\nHow many times have nuclear arsenals been destroyed because of an accident with one of the weapons? How many accidental nuclear wepaons detonations have there been? I certainly haven't heard of any, and that's something the anti-nuclear crowd would latch onto. But they haven't. Why?\n \n It's because nuclear weapons operate on principles different from conventional weapons. Conventional bombs rely on explosive chemical combustion; nuclear ones rely on atomic fission. Before a nuclear device will detonate, it has to be activated and its fissionables have to be able to come together.\nIt would not be too difficult for terrorists to get their hands on these weapons either. Both the United States and Russia admit to having developed these weapons in the past. However, if the United States begins to develop these weapons, Russia would, too. Many terrorists organizations have ties to Russia and could possibly get their hands on these weapons. One Russian general even admitted after they first developed these weapons that they were unable to account for all of them.\nThis premise rests on two things. One, that the Russians would, in their current economic state, find reason to engage in a new nuclear arms race with the United States; and Two, that the Russian government would give the weapons to terrorists.\n \n Russia's inability to keep track of their weapons stems from the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it the collapse of the KGB, which was responsible for security of nuclear weapons.",

   "Because the possibility that we WILL have a need for these weapons exists. Having another opition available if needed justifies the cost.\n\n \n We already have nuclear weapons. What good will these smaller weapons do? They are a waste of money to build. They will do to a several street blocks what Fat Man and Little Boy did to two cities. If the need to use these ever arises again, what would the difference between \"small\" nuclear weapons or \"large\" nuclear weapons mean? Not very much when you look at it.\n \n \nHow many times have nuclear arsenals been destroyed because of an accident with one of the weapons? How many accidental nuclear wepaons detonations have there been? I certainly haven't heard of any, and that's something the anti-nuclear crowd would latch onto. But they haven't. Why?\n \n It's because nuclear weapons operate on principles different from conventional weapons. Conventional bombs rely on explosive chemical combustion; nuclear ones rely on atomic fission. Before a nuclear device will detonate, it has to be activated and its fissionables have to be able to come together. \n\n \n I also must admit I have never heard of any nuclear arsenals being destroyed. However, I am pointing out that nuclear accidents CAN occur. Three Mile Island. Chernobyl. Two SERIOUS problems with the use of nuclear power. Now, we want to take that power one step further and use it to create a weapon. How many more complications could occur?\n \n This is the link to a chart that lists nuclear accidents by date. There has been almost one nuclear accident each day. There are only 59 days on which there has not been a nuclear accident. We're in the process of reducing our nuclear aresnal, which would decrease the risk of accident. Why should we do something to increase it again?\n \n Also, an accidental explosion would bring chaos to America. We would have to deal with problems from the radioactive fallout area. Many \"survivors\" of Hiroshima and Nagasaki suffer from radiation poisioning, which affects both them and their children and grandchildren.\n \n I understand that these statements involve many \"what if's,\" but they are things that we do not want to see happen at any time. The possibility of an accident has too many risks to make the building of these weapons useful.\n \n \nThis premise rests on two things. One, that the Russians would, in their current economic state, find reason to engage in a new nuclear arms race with the United States; and Two, that the Russian government would give the weapons to terrorists.\n \n Russia's inability to keep track of their weapons stems from the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it the collapse of the KGB, which was responsible for security of nuclear weapons. \n\n \n This took place in 1995, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the KGB. Russia stated that they would build at least one of every weapon the US had. They build approximately 100 of them, 60 of which are unaccounted for. Now, Czechnya (sp?) claims they have two, and Palastine claims they have some (they haven't given a number). We BELIEVE they are both bluffing, but the lapses in Russian, and sometimes even American, security make the acquisition of these weapons by terrorists a possibility.",
