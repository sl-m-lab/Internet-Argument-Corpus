In other, earlier times, people expressed homosexual tendencies as well as heterosexual ones. People of both genders parented children independent of sexual desires or tendencies. \n \n I hope I&#8217;ve explained the background thoughts to my question but this is it in a nutshell: why be against marriages between people of the same gender? \n \n If the genetic component is needed for the homosexual expression (also needed is the environmental components), wouldn&#8217;t one expect (over a rather long time) for the genetic component to decrease in the population?\n \n That is, in our recent past history, people of both genders became biological parents of children, & sometimes the heterosexual expression was not what they truly desired however environmental factors (mostly cultural intolerance) forced their hand, so to speak.\n \n If marriages between people of the same gender are culturally or environmentally more acceptable, wouldn't one expect (over a rather long period of time) for the genetic component to decrease in the population, therefore leading to a decrease in homosexual expression?\n \n Thanks for reading & considering.

   "Homosexual behaviour widespread in animals according to new study - Telegraph \nHomosexual behaviour widespread in animals according to new study\n \n The pairing of same sex couples had previously been observed in more than 1,000 species including penguins, dolphins and primates.\n \n However, in the latest study the authors claim the phenomenon is not only widespread but part of a necessary biological adaptation for the survival of the species. \n \n They found that on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, almost a third of the Laysan albatross population is raised by pairs of two females because of the shortage of males. Through these 'lesbian' unions, Laysan albatross are flourishing. Their existence had been dwindling before the adaptation was noticed. \n \n Other species form same-sex bonds for other reasons, they found. Dolphins have been known engage in same-sex interactions to facilitate group bonding while male-male pairings in locusts killed off the weaker males.\n \n A pair of \"gay\" penguins recently hatched an egg at a German zoo after being given the egg that had been rejected by its biological parents by keepers. \n \n Writing in Trends in Ecology & Evolution, Dr Nathan Bailey, an evolutionary biologist at California University, said previous studies have failed to consider the evolutionary consequences of homosexuality. \n \n He said same homosexual behaviour was often a product of natural selection to further the survival of the species. \n \n Dr Bailey said: \"It's clear same-sex sexual behaviour extends far beyond the well-known examples that dominate both the scientific and popular literature - for example, bonobos, dolphins, penguins and fruit flies.\n \n \"Same-sex behaviours - courtship, mounting or parenting - are traits that may have been shaped by natural selection, a basic mechanism of evolution that occurs over successive generations,\" he said.\n \n \"But our review of studies also suggests that these same-sex behaviours might act as selective forces in and of themselves.\" \n",

Your brand of intolerance serves no purpose, is, in fact, impotent.\n \n I prefer the aesthetic to the anesthetic, that is, inspiring creative, original thought vs. the mind numbing. \n \n Lenny Bruce is thought to have said, \"Satire is tragedy plus time.\" & Kurt Vonnegut wrote, \n\"Jokes can be noble. Laughs are exactly as honorable as tears. Laughter & tears are both responses to frustration & exhaustion, to the futility of thinking & striving anymore. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning to do afterward - & since I can start thinking & striving again that much sooner.\" \n (from Palm Sunday by Kurt Vonnegut).\n\n Pondering these two exceptional thoughts in my curly, mediocre mind, sometimes a joke has outlived its purpose (or funniness). A 'one trick pony' political humor theme outlives its purpose when it is, simply, no longer funny. This happens with political themes over time. The first & even 10th time, it continues to be funny. The thousandth time, not so much. It becomes pathetic & I would even say lazy, as if there's nothing new to satirize. \n \n I observe a similar process occurring in some debating - when it goes circular & gets to be about minutiae alone, it no longer serves any productive purpose. It succeeds in perpetuating itself, & NOT in inspiring further creative, critical or original thought & certainly not in producing any type of action (inertia). \n \n I think of a chess game where some games are declared 'stalemates.' One or both players could insist on continuing to play the game for whatever reason they choose. It could go on endlessly without any satisfactory conclusion. Although it's no longer entertaining or productive (especially for the observers who have absolutely nothing to gain). \n \n imho some debates take this form. Taking either position invariably involves making assumptions, using different axioms, ones that the other invalidates. Getting caught up in fruitless minutiae ('lost in a maze of quibbles & a fog of words').\n \n I'm not quite sure it's fruitful as a means of going forward.\n :) :(",

We can make fun of them, condemn them, and be disgusted by them, but at the end of the day they have a right to live their lives and have their views, as long as they obey the law.\n \n \nSecond, most homosexuals try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n \n Again, GLBT people can tell whoever they want that they do not see themselves as sinners, just as you have the right to say that you think that they are. Do you not try to persuade people that what you believe is correct? Do you realize that this is just as offensive to many, many people as gays purportedly trying to convince people that their orientation is normal?\n \n And BTW, most gay people I am friends with want to be left alone and not treated like XXXX. They don't care who thinks they are a sinner as long as they aren't treated like they are bad people.\n \n \nThird, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n\n \n You defend your specific interpretation of what the Bible is today. Catholics interpret it differently than Protestants, Jews don't buy the New Testament, and even within the blanket label of Protestantism their are countless sects that each have their own opinions of what this book actually means and how it is to be applied. \n \n A few hundred years ago your views on the Bible may have been considered heresy depending on where you lived. \n \n Plus, again, anyone can have whatever damn opinion they want on the Bible. Its not your business to tell them how to think. Say what you want, but remember while you are seeing yourself as a Holy Defender some other Christian thinks you are perverting it. A little humility never hurt anyone. \n \n \nFourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n \n \n Yes, and I am pretty sure that since Jesus took the sins of mankind into himself, your theology states that every individual has a personal path to forgiveness and redemption. At least that is how I was raised. \n \n Your theology and beliefs are fine for you, but when you enroach on other's rights is when they become unacceptable. \n \n \nFifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance. It's disgraceful how they try to justify their sin by attacking others.\n\n \n *yawn*\n \n PEOPLE attack other PEOPLE who disagree. \n \n Gays are called f*gs, degenerates, sodomites, perverts, sinners, evil, demon-possessed, pedophiles, and soulless.... I could go on and on.\n \n Athiests are called moral degenerates, hedonists, evil, and are accused of trying to become God, etc. I could go on and on.\n \n Muslims are called Jihadists, racists, terrorists, etc... I could go on and on.\n \n Evolutionary biologists (even Christian ones!) are called hacks, frauds, liars, soulless, evil, etc... I could go on and on. \n \n Do you get my point? Everyone should tone down on the name calling, it doesn't solve anything. It lends no credence or support to either side. \n \n \nSixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America, costing people money. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their sick agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts.\n\n \n What elementary school describes gay sex acts, or any sex act in general? Citation please? \n \n What makes America cool is that we have the right to struggle against what we think is injustice. Gays, and those who agree with them or who just dislike intolerance, have every right to attempt to fight for their rights.\n \n Here is a thought experiment for you. Imagine that you have an inborn characteristic that you cannot help. Lets say.... left-handedness. Imagine that half the country thinks you are a degenerate and should be \"redeemed\" from your base urges to dominate with your left hand. Say you are ridiculed and called names all the time, so much that you try to hide the way you were born. \n \n Would you fight for the right to be accepted and life your life, liberty and pursuit of happiness? Or would you just stay quiet, not wanted to risk offending anyone with your \"perversion\"? \n \n BTW, Christians are sue-happy when they feel disagreed with or oppressed too. Its part of the American legal system. \n \n \nSeventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n\n \n Also, straight people (even married ones!) make unwanted babies, and can't feed them half the time, and cost the government billions. Should we force sterilization on poor straight people?\n \n Fat people cost untold amount of health care dollars for diabetes, cancer, injuries, etc... Should we have forced exercise and starvation programs for people of a certain BMI and above?\n \n Cigarette smokers, heavy drinkers, people who sit around too much posting on the internet, and many others have many unnecessary health care costs for completely preventable treatments and jack up insurance and other costs up for everyone. \n \n \nAnd eighth: They refuse to repent of it, making their own salvation and those who they lead astray a serious question mark.\n \n \n \n In your opinion.\n \n In my opinion, people who listen to the type of rhetoric you are spouting are far more damaged and in danger than people who think gays are just like anyone else.\n \n But that is just my personal opinion.\n \n Like I said before. Your theology, and anyone who thinks your views are correct, is your business. When you try to infringe on other people's natural rights, that is when you get shut down. Simple as that really. \n \n TO Matthew S:\n \nWell then we must then expunge all religion from the face of the earth.\n\n \n You have every right to say that, no right to do it. I may agree with you, but expressions of hostility get us nowhere fast.",

Another survey in 2008 focused on a much younger demographic of teens and young adults aged 15-21.

   "Does Believing the Bible Make You Irrational?\nDoes Believing the Bible Make You Irrational?\n \n \"The Bible said it, I believe it, that settles it,\" proclaims a common Christian bumper sticker. Strong belief in the Bible is considered a mark of spiritual maturity in most conservative Christian churches. Christians esteem that person in the congregation who is able to back up everything he or she says with a verse, whose Bible pages are yellow and wrinkled from flipping through them so often.\n \n Outsiders, however, are likely to see a person with whom they cannot reason. What in the church is considered a virtue is to them a vice. \"The Bible said it and that settles it\"? Apparently the Bible is only good for making one impervious to rational persuasion, they conclude. Or for enabling one conveniently to cut the argument short. People begin to suspect that perhaps the Bible is only useful for those who refuse to think, or for those wanting to justify their own bigotry.\n \n If many Christians seem difficult to reason with, it is probably true that they don't know how to think, and there probably are many people who do have bigotry they want to justify. This may have less to do with their Christianity than with the reality that this is simply the way most people are, regardless of whether or not they are Christians. Christians seem to make up the greater population of ignorant and bigoted people simply because they are more vocal and shameless in airing their true opinions. The common decency that restrains most people from saying what they really think has little stronghold on the person who is convinced that offending people with judgmental pronouncements is what it means to take a stand for God.\n \n Of course, most people don't care about the private opinions of others. They just want people to be civil enough to not to express them in hurtful and inappropriate ways. Here, I grant, Christians have failed far more miserably than the rest of the population.\n \n Why are Christians so bent on airing their views? Many Christians are actually told that it doesn't matter that they lack reasoning skills, or that they know little about other religious and philosophical worldviews. All that matters is that they know the truth of the Bible, and this is apparently reason enough for people to listen to them whether or not they are making much sense. They are not to be shy about inviting themselves even into arenas of debate where they are clearly in above their heads. Such persons imagine that they are bringing God's truth into the discussion, when in reality all they are doing is confirming to everyone involved that there must surely be a relationship between simple-mindedness and Christian belief.\n \n One might think that this only proves that the Bible does make people irrational. For since the Bible claims to be the truth, even the authoritative word of God, people who believe they have the truth will naturally want to impose it upon everyone else. Such a person has little use for the process of reasoning because all that matters to him is the bottom line. He has already looked up the answer in the back of the book; why then the need to show his work? Everyone is just supposed to take his word for it.\n \n Case in point: The Bible uses some pretty strong language to condemn same-sex sexual relations. How then can homosexuality be unchosen? If it is unchosen, we Christians reason, that seems to imply there is no moral culpability involved in homosexual behavior, and that goes against biblical teaching. So because the claims of homosexuals don't appear to match up with the view of the Bible, we tell ourselves we don't need to listen to them because we know better. Even in the face of an overwhelming consensus among homosexuals from all walks of life that their homosexual inclination is involuntary, we go to great lengths to deny what others are coming quite undramatically to accept. Perhaps the reason we assert and reassert our arguments in shrill and authoritative tones is that we are hoping no one will notice the shallow basis upon which they are built.\n \n Many Christians arrive at such a place not because of their belief in the Bible per se, but because they believe in a certain view of the Bible. Believing the Bible can make you irrational only if you view it as merely an answer book and do not think there is a rationale behind its teachings. This means that if the promptings of common sense contradict what the Bible seems to be saying, you will tend to ignore them instead of considering whether there is something deeper in the biblical text that needs to be investigated. Those common sense promptings couldn't be from God because you view God as someone who is not interested in helping you understand the world around you. He instead requires a kind of raw obedience that is always demanding that you act counter-intuitively, that you deny reality, that you rework the data to make it add up to a conclusion that doesn't make sense.\n \n The correct view of the Bible, of course, is that its teachings ought to help us make sense of life. They should resonate with reason and with common sense. This is not the same as saying that we should try to get the Bible to approve of whatever people feel like doing, which is what Christians understand gays and lesbians to be saying when they argue that they cannot help being homosexual. Christians are rightly concerned about having objective moral guidance to restrain whimsical and irresponsible behavior, and clearly there are many homosexuals who could use some moral guidance. But it is also clear when you hear gays and lesbians talk in depth about their homosexual feelings that this is not simply a case of people bent on doing what feels good to them and so morality can just take a hike.\n \n Any fair-minded person who reads the personal accounts of people who have battled fear and self-hatred to come to terms with their own homosexuality will be struck by the authenticity of such stories. It is amazing how often words like \"honesty,\" \"integrity\" and \"wholeness\" are used unabashedly to describe this journey toward self-acceptance. (Would adulterers dare to defend their actions using such terms?) It certainly ought to make one question whether going around calling gay people \"perverts\" and characterizing them as sexual predators is really a very informed way of trying to bring biblical teaching to bear on the homosexual experience.\n \n Historically, the church has always recognized the validity of rational inquiry. The churchmen of old used to say that God has written two books, the Bible and the Book of Nature. God invites us to study the Bible to know the way of salvation; but he also invites us to apply our reason in studying his creation, i.e., the Book of Nature. That includes fields such as biology, mathematics, psychology, music, physics, etc.\n \n The church has always viewed the Bible as more authoritative than human reason, so when the two seem to clash the church will favor what it believes the Bible teaches. Historically speaking, then, the current resistance of the church to the arguments of homosexuals is a fairly typical response. Of course, it is a fallacy to think that just because the Bible is more authoritative than reason, that the conclusions of reason must be false. Sometimes the conclusions of reason are legitimate and ought to inform our interpretation of the Bible.\n \n For example in the 17th century, Galileo upset people's customary understanding of the universe when he taught Copernicus's theory that the sun and not the earth was at the center of the solar system. The church responded by opposing Galileo's observations about the earth's orbit around the sun because the Bible seemed to teach that the earth was stationary. Psalm 93:1, for example, says \"the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.\" Much uproar and decrying of heresy followed Galileo's findings, resulting in his public trial and condemnation. It took a century or two, but the church did eventually come accept the Copernican theory, realizing that this biblical passage was simply a metaphorical way of talking about the security of our human existence under the everlasting rule of God, and was not an objective scientific commentary on the earth's relationship to the rest of the solar system.\n \n When it comes to considering whether the findings of reason should force an adjustment in our understanding of the Bible, the church typically drags its feet because certain interpretations tend to become almost traditional among Christians, and there is always resistance to changing what people are used to. But of a greater concern is that making such adjustments is always risky because a wrong move in that area could threaten to undermine more essential Christian teachings, such as those relating to the doctrine of salvation.\n \n Think of it like this. Christian theology is a system and all its doctrines fit logically together, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. The most important doctrines are the pieces located at the center of the puzzle. Modifying your understanding of one doctrine is like changing the shape of one of the puzzle pieces; the surrounding pieces also need to change shape a little to accommodate it. It's fine if it is only one of the outer pieces that needs some adjusting. Problems arise when the adjustment is so great that the subsequent chain reaction of adjustments threatens the central pieces; or when the piece that people are considering for adjustment is located too close to the center of the puzzle. A mistake could spell disaster, and the leaders of the church are aware of all the times in church history when such disastrous mistakes have been made.\n \n Unfortunately, the rise of liberal theology during the Enlightenment, when theologians began to use reason to deny the miracles of the Bible, was one such disaster that has caused conservative Christians to be suspicious of human reason to this day. Now denying the miracles of the Bible is pretty serious business, because belief in miracles is tied in with some of the most fundamental Christian doctrines such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, and the second coming of Christ. The outcome of this bitter controversy was the splitting of Christian theologians into liberal and conservative camps. The former denied the historicity of the biblical miracles and the latter was put in the defensive posture of having always to justify their belief in them.\n \n The outcome of this controversy was that conservative Christians felt burned by human reason, and began to view the conclusions of rational argumentation with great suspicion. Over the years they have became so jaded that it would be accurate to say that modern day fundamentalism is a thoroughly anti-intellectual and anti-rational movement. For these Christians hostility toward reason has practically become the hallmark of Bible belief. It reminds me of a plaque I saw in one fundamentalist pastor's study: \"You don't need a PhD to believe the Bible, but to deny it you might.\"\n \n And so if Christians seem difficult to argue with, it is because many of them have adopted the odd idea that they can bypass rational persuasion and simply assert the Bible. To try to relate to people at the level of reason would be tantamount to a betrayal of faith, and so they are not concerned about relating. Their aim is to assault people with a truth-blitz, and if their audience rejects them it only confirms what rebellious heathen they are.\n \n With such a mentality, I wonder what hope there is that conservative Christians will ever be able to respond appropriately and intelligently to the increasing visibility of gays and lesbians in their communities, whose lives are dismantling all the old stereotypes, whose positive contributions to society are causing people to rethink their prejudices, and who will probably not be going away any time soon?\n \n The irrationality of Christians is not in their concern to defend the Bible. Their irrationality is in thinking that defending the Bible means closing their eyes to reality, because it is saying that defending the truth involves closing your eyes to truth. And for all their protesting that they believe in the Bible, is it not an admission of doubt rather than faith to go to such lengths to protect it from any kind of challenge or scrutiny? I mean, do we Christians believe in the God of the Bible, or do we secretly think he doesn't know what he's doing, and that's why we need to cover for him?\n \n It is unfortunate that conservative Christians have become so intellectually isolated from the debates that are currently taking place in our society. For if we really believe the Bible is God's inerrant and infallible truth, then of all people we ought to be in the best position to confront difficult questions, because we stand in a place of tremendous intellectual security. If what we learn about people's experiences with homosexuality seems to conflict with some of our traditional interpretations of Scripture, we ought to welcome the challenge. For we know that there must be answers out there if we believe that the God who authored the Bible is also the God who created humanity with all its complexities and mysteries. Real confidence in the Bible, and in the God who inspired it, ought to open up our minds, not close them.\n",

Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\" \n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism?
