Knowledge without grace is the backbone to pride, and pride is the very backbone of a mans sinful nature and the more a man moves in his own pride the more blind the man becomes.\n I have heard it said many times in the arguments in some of these debateing rooms, the further back we go in time, the more that man and women believed in God, i totally agree with this, but you see the evidence for my message is buried in this very statement. \n As time moves on, the further man becomes more knowlegable and the greater his knowlege grows with out grace, the greater his pride grows, and the greater his pride grows, the further he slips into his own sinful nature, and the further he slips into his sinful nature, the further he slips away from God, and the more that man slips away from God the more that mans reality becomes more kaotic.

I grieve for your soul Zach!, you have been given the chance to recieve his salvation and you knocked it back. The picture comes to mind about the story of a fire breaking out in a mental institution. People were trieing to go in and pull them out of the fire, but the patients would not allow them to. Most punched and kicked, just so they could stay in that burning building.\n \n \n Hmm. When I think of religion, I think of people running out of a building that shows no signs of burning, all on the assumption that it might be about to burn, and then concluding with complete certainty that the building will start burning in 2 minutes. And some of them even try to force everyone else to get out of the building.",

I was just makeing a comparison. \n As for the evidence, there is millions of souls out there that have had their life changed from meeting the man that was crucified 2000 yrs ago.

It's their way or no way. You can't think about why. I personally like to know all the reasons of something. BUT when I search for the answer and find out that we just don't know, I don't try to fabricate an answer. I'm not saying all Christians are like this and Stormboy doesn't seem like this type but some people seem to just accept whatever religion they are because it makes them feel comfortable. They aren't scared of death anymore. This is just as bad a thing to do as believing nothing will happen when you jump off a cliff, just to feel safer.
