Because this guy has proven he has no moral compass and will vote for any issue his liberal constituency wants based purely on Political expediancy whether it's right or wrong.\n \n Cold Cash Congressman Pleads Not Guilty\n Rep. William Jefferson: \"I Will Be Vindicated.\"\n By JASON RYAN and THERESA COOK\n June 8, 2007- \n \n \n Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of bribery, money laundering, obstruction of justice, violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, racketeering and conspiracy at a federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va. \n \n Jefferson is free on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond -- he took an oath affirming he would make future court appearances in lieu of paying the bond. \n \n Jefferson had been in the crosshairs of a Virginia U.S. attorney's office for allegedly accepting bribes to steer business to a communications firm in Nigeria and soliciting bribes to benefit various companies owned by his family. A grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against the nine-term congressman Monday. \n \n \n Cold Cash\n The investigation came to a head last August, when FBI agents raided Jefferson's Washington, D.C., home and recovered $90,000 from his freezer, allegedly \"as part of the front-end bribe payment\" to pay the Nigerian vice president, according to the indictment. \n \n The cash \"was separated into $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and concealed in various frozen food containers,\" the indictment continued. \n \n Jefferson Admits Mistakes\n Toward the end of his statement, Jefferson acknowledged some missteps. \n \n \"Did I make mistakes in judgment along the way that I now deeply regret? Yes, but did I sell my office or trade official acts for money? Absolutely not. This case involved private business activities and not official acts by me.\" \n \n An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment about Jefferson's statement. \n \n Limited Travel, No Guns at Home\n Jefferson waived his right to a speedy trial because of the vast amount of evidence expected. \n \n The congressman will have to surrender his passport; he is free to travel within the United States but must give some advance notice to the judge. Foreign travel will only be allowed for official congressional business. \n \n Jefferson will also have to surrender guns he has at his home in New Orleans. Jefferson said he had several rifles and shotguns. \"I've been hunting since I was 10 years old,\" he told the judge. Jefferson's attorney, Robert Trout, will take possession of his guns and passport. \n \n The government said it needed four weeks to make its case, but Judge Ellis expressed his displeasure with the plan, saying, \"I think that's too much. No trial should last that long,\" Ellis continued, saying, \"The only people the jury wants to convict are the lawyers by the end of the trial.\" \n \n The case will go to trial Jan. 16, 2008. If convicted, a court could sentence the lawmaker to up to 235 years in prison. \n \n A motions hearing is set for September. \n \n \n http://www.abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Politics/story?id=3259384&page=1",

   "Again, where have Ohioprof or I said this? Show us where, or admit to your strawperson.\nThe opening post says it.\n \n \n\n Another defender of \"traditional marriage\" admits to adultery \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Ah, how icky the hypocrisy smells. Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter, one of the leading proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, has just apologized for his \"serious sin\" after his phone number appeared in the records of a DC Madam who ran an escort/prostitution service.\n \n Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service: \n \n \"This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible. Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling. Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way.\" \n \n During his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute, a charge that he then vigorously denied. Now, of course, he's been caught, and he admits it. \n \n Meanwhile, Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita. He said, \"I don't believe there's any issue that's more important than this one.\"\n \n It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage, the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice, are exposed for the hypocrites they are. In this case, this conservative Christian who campaigned against gay rights just couldn't keep his own pants zipped. And to make sure he got elected, he lied about it until he was caught.\nVitter's hypocrisy is related to conventional marriage only and has nothing whatsoever to do with same-sex marriage or his opposition to it. The OP makes it seem that the two should be related.\n \n It's like saying that Vitter's infidelity and admission that he has been acting wrongly in that regard should negate all of his arguments (whatever they may be) against same-sex marriage.\n \n It is true that he was a hypocrit. It is not true that his hypocrisy was related to same-sex marriage. It was related only to his claimed marital fidelity vs. his actual infidelity within his own marriage. It has nothing at all to do with his thoughts that men should not be allowed to 'marry' other men. The OP incorrectly links these two in the very first paragragh.",
