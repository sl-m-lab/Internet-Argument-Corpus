   "School Suggests Students Who Support Gay Rights Are an \"Illegal Organization\"\n \n PONCE DE LEON, FL - A Florida high school has been trampling the First Amendment rights of students who support equal rights for gay people, according to a federal lawsuit filed today by the American Civil Liberties Union. In its lawsuit, the ACLU described an atmosphere of fear and censorship at Ponce de Leon High School, where the school board's attorney says even expressions like a rainbow sticker may mean students are members of an \"illegal organization.\"\n \n \"All any of us wants to do is be able to talk about gay rights issues without having to be scared,\" said Heather Gillman, a 16-year-old junior at the school. \"Nobody should have to worry about being kicked out of school just for having a rainbow sticker on your notebook.\"\n \n The ACLU sent a letter in November to the school board's attorney on behalf of Gillman, asking for clarification as to whether a variety of symbols and slogans, such as the rainbow flag or \"I support my gay friends,\" would be allowed at the school. The school district replied that it would not allow any expressions of support for gay rights at all because such speech would \"likely be disruptive.\" The district then went even further, claiming that such symbols and slogans were signs that students were part of a \"secret/illegal organization.\"\n \n The letter was sent after Gillman and other students approached the ACLU about an atmosphere in which students say they were routinely intimidated by school officials for things like writing \"gay pride\" on their arms and notebooks or wearing rainbow-themed clothing. According to students, problems began in September when a lesbian student tried to report to school officials that she was being harassed by other students because she is a lesbian. Instead of addressing the harassment, students say the school responded with intimidation and censorship.\n http://www.wmbb.com/gulfcoastwest/mbb/news.apx.-content-articles-MBB-2008-01-31-0010.html\n \n Environments like this don't just exist because one or two people decide to bully.\n It exists because of a \"mob mentality\" that enforces its prejudicial will, or gives support to gay condemnation.",

   "This is the same sort of stupidity as when schools try to ban religious student groups. The law is clear: so long as schools permit the formation of extracurricular groups, they have to admit all groups, so long as their purpose isn't illegal. Doesn't matter if they worship Jesus or support equal rights for all Americans. It isn't illegal.\n \n Still, I suspect there is a difference. Schools that mistakenly attempt to ban religious groups usually do so because they don't understand the law separating church and state. The ACLU often defends religious organisations against such silliness. A letter is usually enough to clear things up. In this case, I suspect *gasp* anti-gay bigotry.\n \n Let's face it, a student organisation supporting equal rights is not a religious group. There is no possibility of innocent but naive confusion about the separation of church and state here. These censors are determined to stamp out expression of support for equal rights. This is pure restriction of freedom of speech, arising from homophobia.",
