   "Hallo! Have you noticed that an absolutely unclear situation is developing about downing Georgian copter for violating air space of South Ossetia? To tell in brief, on 11.03 air defense of South Ossetia fired at a helicopter of the Georgian Interior Ministry that violated the air space of the Republic of South Ossetia. What makes me surprised in this connection is the reaction of the OSCE representatives. On one hand, Karel De Gucht, the chairman of the OSCE, stated that the air space above South Ossetia belongs to Georgia and Georgian aircraft had the right to use it for flights. On the other hand, other OSCE representatives from Georgia itself and Russia are on the contrary with Karel De Gucht. They say that the helicopter violated airspace of South Ossetia, which was an indubitable fact of provocation of Georgian Interior Ministry aimed at a breakdown of peace process in this region. \n \n Don't you think this is a very curious valuation variance? These people are members of the same organization and they cannot agree in estimation! I thank that Karel De Gucht was sort of greazed by Americans who are annoyed with Europe's growing influence in Georgia (and especially that of Germany). \n \n That's why I believe Karel De Gucht provided forged information so that to prove Russian peacekeepers and OSCE incapable of preserving peace between Georgia and South Ossetia, and will suggest replacing them with American blue helmets. Being a German, I cannot say I'm happy about this fact 'cause we've gone far enough in cooperating with Georgia and do not want to vail to Americans.",

   "In case any of you wonder what on earth this is about.\n \n \nBRUSSELS, 4 September 2006 - The OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, expressed concern today about an incident on Sunday in which a Georgian helicopter carrying the country's Minister of Defence was fired upon from the South Ossetian side as it flew over the area of responsibility of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces. \n \n \"I am relieved there were no casualties as a result of yesterday's serious incident,\" said Minister De Gucht, urging the two sides to intensify dialogue. \n \n \"Firing at aircraft over the area of operations of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, and flying, especially low-level flights, over that space, contradict the commitments of the sides to achieve a peaceful settlement.\" \n \n He said despite agreements between the sides to avoid overflights of the zone of conflict, there was no internationally agreed \"no-fly zone\" over the region, which is part of Georgian airspace. \n \n \"Firing against aircraft can therefore only be regarded as a criminal act,\" the Chairman-in-Office said. \"Clearly such an incident demonstrates once again how fragile the situation is, and how urgent it is for the sides to show restraint and to take responsibility to intensify result-oriented dialogue.\"\n\n \n Source: OSCE press-release",
