They tell us we can't have these protections because we are not married then refuse to let us get married. I am wodering how someone dies from surgery on a broken leg I think the doctors personal opinions need to be looked into. The hospital recognised the civil union when they called the one partner then used that fact they weren't married to fight a court ruling. According to Andy Humm of Gay USA the couple could have gotten a legal marriage in New York city if Mayor Bloomberg hadn't apealed the New York state courts decision to allow same sex marriage. http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/11/MNGBCB9K7F1.DTL\n \n They could have gotten married if mayor bloomberg had not launched the appeal.",
