   "\n In a paper just released in the United States titled Porn Up, Rape Down, Northwestern University Law Professor Anthony D'amato crunches the numbers to reach the conclusion:\n \n The incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85 per cent in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults. The Nixon and Reagan Commissions tried to show that exposure to pornographic materials produced social violence. The reverse may be true: that pornography has reduced social violence.\n \n Professor D'amato explains that the Internet is now the predominant way in which people access pornography, noting that purveyors of internet pornography in the US earn an annual income exceeding the total of the major media networks in the country.\n \n The main point that Professor D'amato highlights in his paper is that there is a positive correlation between the recent explosion of household internet access in the US, and a decline in incidents of rape (measured in different ways, including police reports and survey interviews) during the same period.\n \n According to Professor D'amato, the four US states with the lowest internet access had the highest increase in rape incidents (53 per cent increase) between 1980 and 2004, whereas the four states with the highest internet access, experienced the largest decrease in rape incidents (27 per cent decrease).\n \n Professor D'amato suggests there are two predominant reasons why an increase in the availability of pornography has led to a reduction in rape. First, using pornographic material provides an easy avenue for the sexually desirous to \"get it out of their system\".\n \n Second, D'amato points to the so-called \"Victorian effect\". This dates back to the old Victorian era where people covered up their bodies with an immense amount of clothing, generating a greater mystery as to what they looked like naked. D'amato suggests that the free availability of pornography since the 1970s, and the recent bombardment of internet pornography, has de-mystified sex, thus satisfying the sexually curious.\n\n http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=4845",

The Nixon and Reagan Commissions tried to show that exposure to pornographic materials produced social violence. The reverse may be true: that pornography has reduced social violence.\n Well, nice premise, but this would appear to be a case of post hoc ergo proctor hoc.  \n \n The study claims that since internet access has increased in the last 25 years and since pornography may be found on the internet porn has reduced rape...\n \n Uh huh...\n \n After the fact; therefore, because of the fact. Prof. might have easily noted that the number of online stock market trades has increased in the past 25 years whilst the number or rapes have decreased and thus concluded that increased investing decreases rape. \n \n Two lessons for researchers:\n \n 1: Correlation does not equal causation\n 2: Make sure your conclusions are marketable",

Thanks for providing a link to the entire thing, but I still think that Amato paper is pretty flimsy. He posits a theory and then does very little to back it up other than some personal ideas. He should have done some regression analysis comparing sexual assault data to changes in Internet usage across all 50 states instead of arbitrarily picking the top and bottom 4.\n \n In any event, it is interesting research, the conclusion of that paper by Diamond is convincing:\n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n The concern that countries allowing pornography and liberal anti-obscenity laws would show increased sex crime rates due to modeling or that children or adolescents in particular would be negatively vulnerable to and receptive to such models or that society would be otherwise adversely effected is not supported by evidence. It is certainly clear from the data reviewed, and the new data and analysis presented, that a massive increase in available pornography in Japan, the United States and elsewhere has been correlated with a dramatic decrease in sexual crimes and most so among youngsters as perpetrators or victims. Even in this area of concern no \"clear and present danger\" exists for the suppression of SEM. There is no evidence that pornography is intended or likely to produce \"imminent lawless action\" (see Brandenberg v. Ohio, 1969). It is reasonable that the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently rejected the principal that speech or expression can be punished because it offends some people's sensibilities or beliefs. Compared with \"hate speech\" or \"commercial speech\" there seems even less justification for banning \"sex speech.\"21 22\n \n Sex abuse of any kind is deplorable and should be eliminated. Rape and sex crimes, like any criminal activities are blights on society which should be expunged. The question remains \"How best to do this?\" Most assuredly, focusing energy in the wrong direction, or taking actions just to placate victims, politicians or irate citizens will not solve the problem nor help. Nor will spreading myths or misinformation. Removing pornography from our midst will, according to the evidence, only hurt rather than help society.\n \n I think it is better to expend our energies in two directions. 1) Make better pornography so that preferred role models are portrayed and more segments of society can come to appreciate or at least understand and tolerate its value23; and 2) turn our research to other directions to eliminate or reduce the social ills of rape and other sex crimes. The best place to look is probably in the home during the first decade of life. But it is only by research that we can continue to understand how to most effectively meet this social challenge. Governments as well as the pornography industry itself would do well to finance and encourage such research.\n \n\n \n I agree that we should look to solutions that have some evidence of working rather than jumping to actions based on emotions.",
