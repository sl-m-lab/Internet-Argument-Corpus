They have motion and growth. Quite the opposite for death. Also, love and worship may simply not be so easily identified in the unborn.

Would it not be that a zygote STILL has the chances of the ability to think as it develops into a fetus, then a infant? \n \n Peace\n\n \n My second question was just to get a feel for period of time in the unborns development cycle you were talking about. I'm not mcuh for biology either and I don't believe a lot of people who I have debated in the past have been either. Many would say fetus and be refering to anywhere from a sperm and egg to the day of the birth. Lets use the following as our definition of fetus:\n \n \"an unborn or unhatched vertebrate in the later stages of development showing the main recognizable features of the mature animal\"\n \n This generally occurs around week 7-8.\n \n Now we have to define what 'ability to think' means. This is where my opinion tends to be loosely set. At one time I believed it meant the ability to control the body but recently I have changed that opinion to simply being able to support the body's systems. I believe that once the brain has the ability to deal with and all the vital systems of the body that it is then able to process real thought. Based on my research this means that between the week 20 and 24 the average fetus will fall under my definition of being able to think.\n \n Because the unborn is officially a fetus at about 8 weeks and not able to fall under what I loosely believe is the time when the real ability to think is complete until about week 22 I tend to say that the later stages of development is when the fetus has the ability to think.\n \n So as a result of this I am against partial birth abortion and am only for abortion before month 5 at the latest. I would like to see any baby 6 months along or more recognized as human life and any killing of this baby by the parents or otherwise will be seen as murder. I also think this provides a good middle ground between the pro-choice and anti-abortion groups since it would seem that neither side will ever be able to get everything they are asking for.\n \n Concerning your question about the zygotes possibility of becoming a fetus I do recognize that this is a fairly certain possibility and therefore I do not deny that aborting the baby at even the zygote state can be considered immoral because you are killing potential human life. What I do debate though is that killing the zygote is not killing human life. It is only going to kill the possibility of human life. This will make it morally right or wrong based on individual opinion but legally I don't think we can consider a zygote as anything more than a potential human.",
