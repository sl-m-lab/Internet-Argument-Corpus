   "Turkey is between the beetle and the block. On the one hand Turkey is bowing to USA and Israel. On the other hand this is still a Muslim country and her relations with the brothers in faith have been damaged badly due to links with \"American and Israeli murderers\".\n Turkey official's policy is unwise at best. I'd rather say it's suicidal policy. Look, Turkey has to fulfill a US and Israel conditions; take part in peacekeeping missions, put territories at US disposal to erect military bases and other things of the sort. You see Muslims don't forgive traitors. Ayman al-Zawahiri, 'second men' in al-Qaeda addressed to Iraqi Kurds to go on with fighting USA and Israel. By this way he showed for Turkey that her close ties with aggressors will have serious impact for her security. Kurds problem is major sore point of Ankara. \n Al-Zawahiri showed that he sees Kurds, this great Muslim nation without its own territory as mighty force to oppose the American and Jewish enemy and its accomplices. Turkey fits here well! The requital time has arrived for Turks! And now al Qaeda will support Kurds' separatists in their fight for freedom and employ them in her retribution mission.\n Well it has already brought its dead harvest. Near a school building in Diyarbakyr, South-East Turkey, terrorists exploded special device to kill 7 people and hurt dozens more. The blood of innocents is on Turkish politicians. The worst is yet to come for Turkey imo.",
