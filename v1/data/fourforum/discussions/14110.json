   "Marcus, a black conservative who is now involved in the growing tea party movement, attributes the problems of his childhood neighborhood, his extended family and the black community in general to a \"cradle-to-grave government dependency\" that in the case of his cousins enabled an idle life of crime and drug abuse. \n \n To Marcus, President Obama's policies perpetuate that dependency. That's why, he says, it baffles him and other black conservatives when the tea party movement is dismissed as somehow anti-black, as a rowdy bunch of ignorant, white protesters who have it in for the nation's first black president. \n \n \"This is the nicest angry mob I've ever seen,\" Marcus said. \n \n Marcus is one of a number of black conservatives who have joined up with, and helped lead, the conservative tea party movement since its inception. Though the movement has attracted criticism for its supposed lack of diversity -- MSNBC host Chris Matthews recently called the groups \"monochromatic\" and \"all white\" -- those minority activists who are involved say the movement has little to do with race, and that it is attracting a more diverse crowd every day. \n \n \"I think a lot of black people are waking up from their Obama night-of-the-living-dead fog,\" Marcus said. \"They were walking around like zombies going Obama, Obama, Obama.\" \n\n \n FOXNews.com - Black Conservatives Take Lead Role in Tea Party Movement\n \n Those teabaggers are soooo racist! emoticon_rolleyes",

   "The tea party movement originated with Ron Paul's presidential candidacy as essentially a constitutionalist response to growing government power. The first tea party was a fundraiser for his campaign.\n \n It has grown since then, and like any organic movement, there will be a diversity of views within it. In particular the two main streams of thought within it are the constitutionalist school, generally in favour of smaller and less intrusive government, and the \"Republican\" school, that basically views it as a platform to get the democrats out of power. It is difficult to say which side is dominant now. There is no major \"racist\" stream of thought in there.\n \n I suspect that the few apparently racist protestors attending tea party rallies shouting absurd things are FBI plants. The FBI has a long-standing method of operating which involves sending agents or informants to attract attention with borderline criminal stunts, then entrapping anyone near by who shows an interest. I would be very surprised if they weren't doing this with the tea parties, with law enforcement agencies having identified the militia movements as political groups of interest.",

   "I think a lot of the tea party people aren't the brightest bulbs and miss the boat on a lot of things but they are not racist. This is not to say they don't know what they are talking about. Anyone can smell XXXX :) But look at it this way, not everyone is supposed to a \"thinker\" and so many are just doing what they can with what God gave them...can't fault you for that. I just hope they aren't manipulated into thinking the republicans are the answer.",
