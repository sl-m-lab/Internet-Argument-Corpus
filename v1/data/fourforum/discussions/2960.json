   "From http://www.isometry.com/bush490477.html\n \n Transcript of the Bernie Ward talk program on KGO \n \n \n\n ~snip~\n FLYNT: No. I see no concern there, because they \n asked George W. Bush the question about his use \n of cocaine without any evidence at all, and he \n sidestepped the issue. Of course, he admitted he's \n been a drunk for twenty years and so that coupled \n with the additional information that we have, you \n know, would just be devastating to him. \n \n WARD: Well, Let's talk about the information that \n you have. \n \n FLYNT: Well, we've been doing an investigation for \n a little over eight months to the effect that an \n abortion took place in 1970 in Houston, Texas. \n He was working for his father's campaign when he \n was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen, \n and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was \n the campaign manager. He got a girl pregnant during \n this period of time, and she had an abortion. We've \n been able to locate the doctor who performed \n the procedure (unintelligible) hospital in Houston. \n Not only that but we have the affidavits from four \n of her friends stating that they knew about the \n affair, the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion. \n The only thing we could not have which we needed to \n break the story was the girl to come out, and she \n would not come out. Whether she was afraid or \n whether she was paid off, I don't really want to \n speculate, because I don't know what the actual \n reason was. But when I started taking this to the \n mainstream media, I said you don't have to break \n the story, just ask the question, you know. You \n asked the cocaine question, so just ask if he's \n ever facilitated an abortion or paid for an abortion \n or if he was the father of a child. Just give him \n the chance to admit or deny it. No one would touch \n it. \n \n WARD: As of now, the woman who you know denies that \n she had the abortion? \n \n FLYNT: No, no, no. She doesn't deny that. We know \n she had the abortion. We know she was Bush's \n girlfriend at the time. This was in the 1970's, \n he would have been in his twenties at the time. \n But she does not want to come out. The last \n conversation my investigators had with her, she \n said I don't have anything bad to say about \n George W. And they said, well, how about \n when he did not come to visit you in the \n hospital when you had the abortion, didn't \n that upset you? So she got very upset and \n irate because I took that line of questioning, \n and said, you know, I am not going to talk \n to you anymore about this issue. \n \n WARD: But when your investigators talked to this \n woman, did she ever say to them that you guys are \n wrong, I never had the abortion. \n \n FLYNT: No. No. \n \n WARD: And in these affidavits, I assume you have \n copies of the affidavits, you have affidavits from \n four of her friends saying that they know she \n had the abortion? \n \n FLYNT: Yes, and we have this guy, Robert Chandler, \n who I said was George Bush's campaign manager at \n the time, his girlfriend is one of our key sources \n on this story who actually accompanied the girl who \n had the abortion to the hospital. \n \n WARD: Were abortions legal in Texas at this time? \n \n FLYNT: No, that was before Roe versus Wade and that \n makes it a crime. And that's the reason why I felt \n the story was important, because I felt the media \n should ask him: Is abortion okay for you and your \n family but not the rest of America? I felt \n the issue of it being a crime should be brought \n up as well. \n ~snip~\n \n\n \n As the Christian Right's poster boy, this is hugely damaging, don't you think? Also makes him very hypocritical (or, dare I say, a FLIPFLOPPER?! emoticon_ic ;) ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now.",

Lets review several points here:\n \n 1)The need to display current information. This article is almost four years old, I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush's presidency. George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history, few will argue this whether they support him or not. Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details. This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years. The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true.\n \n 2)The need to display information from a reputable source. Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out. This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda. The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality. I'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced.\n \n 3)Make sure the parts of your source that you don't quote don't contain info that harms your argument. Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion. If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion. Flynt says so himself:\n \nFLYNT: They have no direct knowledge that he \n knew about it, but they knew the women that we \n interviewed that lived in the complex all admitted \n that they had been told by this girl who was \n pregnant and that George Bush was the father.\n\n This quote also shows that the supposed \"friends\" were women who lived in the same complex as the woman, not necessarily anything more than neighbors. Flynt also tried to get the media to pick up his story but instead they insisted as told by Ward:\n \nthe news sources \n we contacted today who told us to be very wary of \n you because you have yet to produce any evidence of \n this\n\n \n All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.",

I apologize, I was typing all of it before work and I was a bit late :P\n \n Neither of us know too much about it, but doesn't it stand to reason that the woman in question knows the 4 women fairly well in order for the affair and subsequent abortion to be known?
