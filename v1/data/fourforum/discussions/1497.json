   "This is the same post as a post I've just put on \"Quit trying so hard\"\n \n Man is a complex animal. With evolution being generally accepted by academia as a 'given' people have tried to explain, within the context of evolutionary theory, all manner of aspects of being human.\n \n Firstly, let's look at Feminist Evolutionary Theory...\n Gender issues have been explained by evolutionaries. Some would like to ignore this, but it is part of the way evolution has been taught - by men for men. As men's ideas about gender have changed, so have their interpretations of evolutionary evidences.\n \"Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring\" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-02/su-sag021003.php\n \"In the mid-nineteenth century, social Darwinists invoked evolutionary biology to argue that a woman was a man whose evolution - both physical and mental - had been arrested in a primitive stage. In this same period, doctors used their authority as scientists to discourage women's attempts to gain access to higher education. Women's intellectual development, it was argued, would proceed only at great cost to reproductive development. As the brain developed, so the logic went, the ovaries shrivel. In the twentieth century, scientists have given modern dress to these prejudices. Arguments for women's different (and inferior) nature have been based on hormonal research, brain lateralization, and sociobiology.\"\n Londa Schiebinger, \"History and Philosophy\", in Sex and Scientific Inquiry, eds. Sandra Harding and Jean F. O'Barr, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 26-27.\n Quoted at: http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html\n \n Feminists claim that evolution, long the domain of men has present biased accounts of science in order to explain gender.\n \"Men's claims to \"know\" women's natures, abilities, limitations, and so forth have been a fundamental element of feminist criticisms since its genesis, primarily because it is precisely these claims which are used to justify the social and political subordination of women.\"\n Ibid.\n \n Feminist call for a re-look at evolutionary theory, in light of these gender issues. \"Yet feminist critiques of science have recast many evolutionary arguments, particularly those concerned with sex and gender, as patriarchal rather than politically neutral.\"\n http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/rpeg-cfp1.html\n \n A symposium was called for... \"The symposium will highlight Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling's feminist critiques of biology, who will lecture on Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality. In the academic world Dr. Fausto-Sterling is known as a developmental biologist who offers interesting counterpoints to the view that the role division between men and women is largely predetermined by evolution.\"\n http://www.biu.ac.il/Spokesman/News-Briefs/Jan_2001.html\n \n Anne Campbell's research interests are in sex differences in social behaviour. She has worked on sex differences in aggression from an evolutionary perspective, arguing for the importance of fear as an evolved emotional response that is sex differentiated and that serves to restrain females from engagement in risky behaviours that would compromise their reproductive success.\n http://psychology.dur.ac.uk/research/seep/\n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, there are feminist theories of evolution to explain sex and gender issues, and how we evolved into the roles we have today. They show that men have dominated evolutionary theory thinking and have brought their engendered bias to the interpretation of 'evidences'. \n \n But wait, there's more... other aspects of the human condition are also covered by diversified evolutionary theories. Ageing, being one...\n \n \"Evolutionary Theories of Aging and Longevity\" at http://longevity-science.org/Evolution.htm explores three different evolutionary theories to explain ageing and death...\n 1) the theory of programmed death suggested by August Weismann, 2) the mutation accumulation theory of aging suggested by Peter Medawar, and 3) the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggested by George Williams.\n \n \n Which evolutionary theory you decide to adhere to will be a decision in part based on your worldview. If you are a male chauvinist, then you can have a look at theories that show that women have evolved submissive, and maternalistic traits, and that man has evolved more hunter-like and aggressive traits.\n \n There's an evolutionary theory out there to suit you.",

   "Science itself is 'male-orientated'1 and culturally biased 2. It is filled with these biases, no matter how 'empirical' the evidence may seem.\n \n One online debater summed it up well...\"Postmodern thinkers have also drawn attention to the fact that what poses as objectivity is often pervaded with bias, and that science can never escape this, no matter how strictly it defines its epistemology\"3\n \n Thus Evolution reflects in part the minds of the people interpreting it. This is recognised by feminists who include courses to make people more aware of gender bias in science formation.\n One course asks...\n \"How has sexist (racist, classist) bias influenced the practice, results, and political uses of science? To what extent is scientific inquiry and, by extension scientific knowledge, objective, rational, reliable? Is science primarily a social activity? How might a feminist political agenda change, improve scientific inquiry, knowledge, and practice?\"4\n \n Surely, it's objective evidence science uses?\n \"Science has also come under attack by a group of feminists who claim that it has a Eurocentric, masculinist bias, which needs to be rooted out. In a recent book entitled Feminism and Science (1996), editors Evelyn Fox Keller and Helen Longino observe that feminist movements have implicated scientific research and technology \"in the continuing subordination of women.\"\n Exemplifying this claim in the book is an essay by anthropologist Emily Martin, who says that both popular and scientific accounts of the behavior of human egg and sperm in the reproductive process rely on stereotypes. According to her, these are stereotypes that \"imply not only that female biological processes are less worthy than their male counterparts but also that women are less worthy than men.\"\n In a popular recounting of the same subject, reporter Sharon Begley wrote in Newsweek (April 21, 1997) that biologists in the 1960s portrayed sperm as active, \"macho adventurers,\" eggs as passive, \"coy damsels.\" According to the article, it was only recently discovered that \"sperm are ineffectual swimmers\" and that \"the egg actively grabbed the sperm.\" Begley acknowledged that by 1964, researchers knew that the early development of the fertilized cell was guided by genetic material of the egg, but she quoted Martin as saying that \"no one knew what to do\" with this research.\n Are these charges of masculinist bias in scientific accounts valid? In a recent (October 1997) debate at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., Gross gave a scathing response. He noted that research published as early as 1878 and 1919 clearly described the egg as actively engulfing and pulling in the sperm, and that since then, the egg's role has not been considered passive \"in any scientifically meaningful way.\" And he reaffirmed the scientific observation that sperm do swim.\"5\n Thus, the behaviour of the sperm and egg, as observed, are reported as according to a person's bias. A general worldview on the nature of what it is to be male and female has affected scientific study.\n \n Of course the holders of the dominant 'science' will sneer at any attempts to storm their bastions of power. Some alternative scientific theories are deemed 'pseudo-science.' However, this label affixes no permanent stigma. Many aspects of eastern medicine, such as acupuncture, now widely accepted, were deemed 'pseudo-sciences'.\n \n \n References...\n \n 1 http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/women/women_contents.html\n 2 http://www.cis.vt.edu/sage/journal/ \"The Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering\" was created to over-come this.\n 3 http://www.directionjournal.com/alextech/Beliefs/belief01.html\n See also http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/ which has a very good account of the knowledge of science.\n 4 http://www.haverford.edu/femgenstudies/Brokes.html and includes for reading Belk, C.M. 2000. \"Gender bias in biological theory formation.

In so doing feminists have not only highlighted the patriarchal perspectives implicit in more traditional evolutionary theorising but have also illustrated the potential multiplicity of interpretations of 'the natural' (as well as of 'the cultural') and the inevitably political nature of any interpretation whether patriarchal or feminist; colonialist or liberal. Thus, whilst evolutionary theory is most frequently underpinned by an empiricist epistemology, many feminist theorists and others have asserted the political and cultural locatedness of any knowledge thus suggesting that debates around evolutionary theory should address not only how we conceptualise 'the natural' but also how we understand our knowledges and truth claims about 'the natural'. The purpose of this Special Issue is therefore to bring together papers, which address these ontological and epistemological issues about the nature of 'the natural' and the nature of our knowledges of 'the natural'.\"\n http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/rpeg-cfp1.html",

It is filled with these biases, no matter how 'empirical' the evidence may seem.\n\n \n I agree with you here, and in general on the subject of so-called scientific objectivity, but I think it is necessary to differenciate between science itself (which is only a method of study) and the scientific communities (which are made up of people with degrees of power, agendas, biases, etc.) If you want to argue that the scientific method itself is flawed, I think that's another subject entirely. It is clear that people using scientific methods have come up with very wrong answers many times, and others using very unscientific methods have been later proven right by the very same scientific method.\n \n Therefore, because people can be wrong, they can use science to be wrong. Also, because humans can only use their own senses and whatever technology we have ourselves come up with to deduce everything scientific, science is always limited by our own ability to perceive, whether on our own or with instruments.\n \n About the link you provide on the nature/nurture theses, the author is explicit about addressing Neo-Darwinism, such as sociobiology, which is not at all the same as evolutionary theory.\n \n \nDarwin's own thought processes were influenced by the growing imperialism around him.\n\n \n Indeed. He wasn't the only person coming up with that theory around that time. \n \n Hence many people's misunderstanding of \"survival of the fittest\" to mean \"survival of the best\" instead of \"survival of those who most fit/adapt to the environment\". Thus, if it makes evolutionary sense for certain creatures to develop extremely long necks because this happens to be an open ecological niche, that is what will happen. It does not mean that giraffe's neck's are superior to horses', and in fact in another environment and in other circumstances their necks might be a hindrance. \n \n Therefore, people will interpret information to suit their worldview, but that does not make the original information necessarily inaccurate.",

   "Many studies have been shown that scientific error is often a process of scientists own bias. Evolutionaries are not isolated from society. Conventions of society and transferred into the laboratory of science.\n \n \"In all of these cases, gender bias is represented as a cause of error, or at least delay in recognizing the truth.\"1\n \n \n \"Presently, curriculum designers around the world may differ in their views about topics to include in the science curriculum. However, they almost all would include the nature of science in science curriculum (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989; Hazen & Trefil, 1991; Lederman, 1992; and Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990).\"2\n \n Why is this so? It is because it order for science to be less in error, people need to know that science is part of human thought organisation, and is prone to be subjected to all the biases and flaws of the scientists themselves. Note too, that this comment above states that science curriculum's around the world differ. Thus what is considered important for a science education differs from nation to nation; this is influenced by socio-political factors. Thus the 'science' of a communist nation is not the same as the 'science' of a occidental capitalist nation - though both may be applying 'scientific' principles.\n \n Feminist science claims to be more pluralistic. \"Most advocates of feminist science argue, in this vein, that scientific inquiries informed by feminist values are based on legitimate, generative limiting biases. They argue not that feminist sciences should exclude other ways of doing science, but that feminist sciences should be included as among the legitimate choices available to investigators.\"3\n \n Narrative conventions form part of scientific description. These are forms of words that are typical of a particular thought process.\n Haraway (1989) uses the tools of literary theory to demonstrate how hypotheses in primatology and evolutionary theory depend on narrative conventions (for example, casting the transition from ape to hominid as a heroic drama) and tropes (for example, casting primates as mirrors of human nature).\"4\n \n This means that in the male-dominated western idea of evolution, male-dominated forms of description are used (conventions) to convey evolutionary theory.\n \n Further errors may present themselves with the advent of 'big science'; \" the organization of large numbers of scientists bringing different bodies of expertise to a common research project.\"5 \n Hardwig in 1985 published research on the 'big science' project. He suggests that because a project becomes so large, no one scientist is an expert on all matters of the project; therefore there is a reliance upon the expertise of others in the project. \"This leads Hardwig to ask two questions, one about the evidential status of testimony, and one about the nature of the knowing subject in these cases. With respect to the latter, Hardwig says that either the group as a whole, but no single member, knows or it is possible to know vicariously. Neither of these is palatable to him. Talking about the group or the community knowing smacks of superorganisms and transcendent entities and Hardwig shrinks from that solution. Vicarious knowledge, knowing without oneself possessing the evidence for the truth of what one knows, requires, according to Hardwig, too much of a departure from our ordinary concepts of knowledge.\" 6\n \n A knowledge of these concepts is essential before blind faith is placed in evolutionary theory. One needs to know the men* behind the theory and an understanding as to what drives them. Many scientists themselves are unaware of their own a priori biases when dealing with evidences, because science itself is supposed to be about objectivity, and proofs, not on faith. The inquiry of scientists is said to be 'value-laden' that is, full of the values that the scientists bring with them to any experiment. Much of evolutionary theory is couched in the values of materialism.**\n \n There is also a need to undermine traditional Christian values. One of the ways of doing this is to ridicule Christianity, to undermine its position as a source of authority. Usually, without consciously realising this, the mind of evolutionaries switches to stock-standard forms of attack...\n \"In other words, it is the same old Scopes Trial stereotypes, which are considered great fun and an endless source of amusement amongst the \"intelligent folks,\" but which accomplish little towards the end of advancing intelligent, fruitful discussion on the vexed scientific/philosophical issue of origins. The Galileo incident is used in exactly the same sense. What Scopes is to fundamentalist Protestantism, Galileo is to Catholicism (in the eyes of those who love to cite -- and distort for their own ends -- these incidents).\" 7\n Without insight into their own thought processes, evolutionaries react with these automatic arguments.\n \n Evolutionary theory has come to replace religion for many, as it can be applied to all manner of social behaviours; politics, marriage/sex attraction, economics etc.\n \n \n *\n Mostly men.\n **\n Philosophy. The theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything, including thought, feeling, mind, and will, can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena.\n The theory or attitude that physical well-being and worldly possessions constitute the greatest good and highest value in life.\n A great or excessive regard for worldly concerns. 8\n \n References\n 1 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/\n 2 http://www.balfakih.net/epistemology.htm\n 3 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/\n 4 Ibid\n 5 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/\n 6 Ibid\n 7 http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ355.HTM\n 8 http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=materialism",

   "There is also a need to undermine traditional Christian values.\n\n \n \nYou continue to demonstrate your lack of understanding of science in general and evolutionary theory in particular. Science goes where the evidence leads.\n\n \n No, 'fraid you're wrong there. Your form of evolution is dominated by materialist constructs.You fail to realise the influences behind evolution; hence the last post you said evolution had nothing to do with 'materialism' (a misunderstanding on your part about evolution), when I posted several spots from www.talkorigins.com showing that this is not the case.\n \n I am here to help you develop an awareness of your own thought processes. The very fact you've not even touched upon the issue that there is no 'one' science, but many; feminist, Marxian, capitalist etc, shows a dogmatic unwillingness to accept these facts. I can understand your desire for it to be otherwise, especially as you've pinned so much of your world views on the notion that the western male-orientated evolution you follow is 'it'.\n \n Epistemological studies conducted by feminists have shown your stance to be rather ignorant, if not arrogant. That you are carrying bias, and don't realise it.\n \n \nCreationists always seem to object to \"evolution,\" which hides the real scope of their problem. Creationists frequently talk about the big bang as part of the theory of evolution, which only demonstrates the extent of the ignorance of the typical creationist.

When science reaches conclusions that disagree with this bronze age world view, creationists claim that their religion is being attacked. The news is that their religion wasn't even a consideration.\n\n \n Yes a stock standard reply. I agree totally that we bring our world views to any study. Oddly, you only think this is true for scientists. You have raised them to a level beyond human frailties; as if they can never be affected by bias, a priori misgivings etc.\n \n \nOne of the ways of doing this is to ridicule Christianity, to undermine its position as a source of authority.\n\n \n \nNaah.

You're attacks on traditional religious thought are demonstrative of my claim. You posit your arguments in terms of dominant, rational behaviour. You believe that it is normative of scientific thought processes to be beyond the human world. This is just not so. Scientists are human. Observation by humans changes. Recall that through observation, scientists once held the view that the earth was the centre of the solar system.\n \n \n Usually, without consciously realising this, the mind of evolutionaries switches to stock-standard forms of attack...\n\n \n \nAnd creationists switch to stock-standard forms of defense. Quoting the bible and citing some unknown with whom they agree\n\n \n Indeed. So, now you admit we both do the same? That is because evolution is a philosophy.\n \n \n \"In other words, it is the same old Scopes Trial stereotypes, which are considered great fun and an endless source of amusement amongst the \"intelligent folks,\" but which accomplish little towards the end of advancing intelligent, fruitful discussion on the vexed scientific/philosophical issue of origins.

But I don't think you are asking that. I am demonstrating that another poster, and yourself - as you've gone into the earth-centred/religious debate too, are going through a set series of arguments. They are formed by the belief that science is rational, religion is not. That traditional religion has stifled scientific truths.\n \n \nPerhaps you are unaware that Scopes was found guilty. A victory for cretinism. And, of course, Galileo was right. Did you have a point with that quote?\n\n \n You show a fundamental lack of knowledge of the Scopes trial. It was a set-up by evolutionaries.\n \n Galileo was right. So? He was found guilty of what? The trial wasn't about his theory, but that he taught his theory when he was banned from teaching full stop.\n \n Further, you lack the grace to acknowledge two points...\n a) at the time the majority of scientific opinion was against him\n b) the Catholic church had a tradition of teaching against the flat earth/earth-centric models.\n \n \n Without insight into their own thought processes, evolutionaries react with these automatic arguments.\n\n \n \nArguments from any science are not automatic.\n\n \n That's not what I'm saying here, I'm saying that bringing up Galileo, or Scopes are stock retorts of evolutionaries to show that science has always had to battle religion.\n \n \nAny argument from science requires education in that science. The problem is that creationists don't realize that the standard cretin objections to science have been refuted over and over again.\n\n \n Again, lack of awareness on your part. I understand this, because you live in an isolated male chauvinistic western orientated society. If you were in communist China, the sciences you are taught there, would be communist approved. The sciences you are taught are Western Capitalist approved. The curriculum in science is different from nation to nation as each country decides what is 'science'.\n \n \nIt isn't a case of evolutionists responding with stock answers, the case is that the objections have been answered so many times that every evolutionists has heard them. They are on the PRATT list (Points Refuted A Thousand Times).\n\n \n Yes, both parties can be guilty of this.... except according to you. The dogmatic attachment you've shown towards your own brand of evolution rivals my own views on Orthodoxy; there is only one God.\n \n \n\n Evolutionary theory has come to replace religion for many, as it can be applied to all manner of social behaviours; politics, marriage/sex attraction, economics etc.\n\n \n \n\n Now you are being silly. \"Social behaviours; politics, marriage/sex attraction, economics etc.\" have nothing to do with either religion or evolutionary theory. And evolutionary theory hasn't replaced religion for anyone I know. Certainly not myself. And while it may be true that some points of the struggle for survival may be applied to politics and economics (after all, Malthus was an economist), that doesn't even begin to encompass the scope of evolutionary theory. Marriage is a social custom. The only thing you got right was sex attraction - definitely a consideration - except that evolutionary biologists call it \"sexual selection.\"\n\n \n The first point is certainly not true. In the realm of science, even in western capitalist male-chauvinistic ones, evolution is used to explain behaviours. Sex is a fundamental part of evolution as you admit. However, I believe you are referring to strictly biological functionalist notions of sex...Your beloved bonobos are used as an example http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html.\n However, to divorce sex from the rest of human behaviour is damn well impossible. Sex is a dominant influence on how we behave.\n Evolution and behaviour...\n http://www.geocities.com/jieyin98/evolution.html\n Evolution and marriage can be studied through...\n http://www.anthro.rutgers.edu/grad/ebc.shtml\n Social customs are said to have drawn upon biological needs.\n \n I know you don't want evolution sullied by such things, but wishing it to be so doesn't help. Once you see whole societies in evolutionary terms, you can move onto evolutionary constructs of social behaviours, such as politics, law, religion, and economics.\n Marxian theorists have constructed over-arching theories of society to describe economic evolution - how over time needs change and desires differ.",

Marxism attempts to offer a comprehensive framework for understanding human society, and whatever else it is, science is obviously a product of human society. Marxists thus reject the view that science can be adequately understood in abstraction from the social and historical circumstances in which it develops.

No tool in the hands of humans is ever really \"objective\". That does not mean that science, no matter how fallible, is wrong about evolution.\n \n One of the logical fallacies described on the How to Debate thread is called the \"fallacy fallacy\"- that is to say that even if someone's argument is \"wrong\", invalid or weak, that does not mean that the theory they are defending is untrue. \n \n Therefore, if I say \"Montalban's hair stands up on end. I know this because Montalban is Australian and Australia is on the other side of the world.\" I am trying to argue that a- Montalban's hair stands up on end, using the arguments 1- (Montalban is Australian) and 2- (Australia is on the other side of the world) as support for my statement. The logical fallacies here abound, but nonetheless, my statement that Montalban's hair stands on end could very well be true. So, even if you argue with me forever about gravity and geography, that would not disprove my thesis, just my arguments.\n \n What I want to know is, how do you explain dinosaur bones, finches differenciation according to geography, etc?

In the fossil record, transition from one species to another is usually abrupt in most geographic locales -- no transitional forms are found. In short, it appears that species remain unchanged for long stretches of time and then are quickly replaced by new species. However, if wide ranges are searched, transitional forms that bridge the gap between the two species are sometimes found in small, localized areas. For example, in Jurassic brachiopods of the genus Kutchithyris, K. acutiplicata appears below another species, K. euryptycha. Both species were common and covered a wide geographical area. They differ enough that some have argued they should be in a different genera. In just one small locality an approximately 1.25m sedimentary layer with these fossils is found. In the narrow (10 cm) layer that separates the two species, both species are found along with transitional forms. In other localities there is a sharp transition. \n\n \n I don't see any of this as mutually exclusive.\n \n \nI believed in a creation without any belief in a particular time-table.

After all, you can debate all you like about what \"soon\" or \"is at hand\" could possibly mean, but in the context of a world that has only existed a couple thousand years, it must have meant sooner than now- thousands more years later!",

One lineage (presapiens) evolved directly into modern H. sapiens populations and closely resembles these modern forms at an early date. The second lineage (preneanderthals) evolved into the European Neanderthal populations of the earlier Wurm glaciation and subsequently became extinct.\n http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/p.html\n \n That shows differences in the models... these two were the most alike of all the four theories I mentioned, but which one...?\n \n \"Where do the genes of the Europeans come from? A good, but trivial, answer is: From Africa, like everybody else's genes. Paleontologists agree that the long-term human ancestors, a million years ago or so, dwelt in Africa. There is disagreement, however, about what happened after archaic presapiens humans (Homo erectus) spread over much of the Old World. The anatomically archaic populations of Europe, Northeastern Asia, and Southeastern Asia may have gradually evolved into the modern Homo sapiens sapiens populations inhabiting, respectively, Western Eurasia, East Asia, and Australia; this is the multiregional theory of human evolution (1). On the contrary, the Out-of-Africa theory regards all modern populations as descended from an anatomically modern group that dispersed from Africa less than 200,000 years ago and replaced archaic populations (2). \"\n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/1/22\n \n How the different types of man came about? They don't know... And the presapiens school was undermined by their faith in Piltdown Man...\n \"The focus of research on human evolution had already switched to Africa some years before 1953, and the debunking of Piltdown had no discernible effect on that. The \"presapiens\" paradigm which Piltdown had once helped to support was on a decline, although it still had its followers such as Vallois. Zuckerman used Piltdown to argue for statistical analysis in human palaeontology, which since 1947 had been his ongoing method of rejecting Australopithecus (Zuckerman 1971 [orig. 1954]).\"\n http://home.tiac.net/~cri_a/piltdown/piltref.html\n \n Some sites say that presapiens is now 'consigned to the dustbin'. Some conflicting theories have gone, some have arisen.\n \n I will have to get some books on the latest conflicting theories. Such as\n \"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction \"\n by Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan and Rachel Caspari, University of Michigan \"Race and Human Evolution is a far-ranging account by leading researchers in the field that describes the latest scientific evidence and \n  the conflicting theories about human evolution.\" \n http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus-cgi-bin/display/0-8133-3546-9\n \n Mizmaxx, your inspired me to update my critique - the outline is still the same; that there are mutually exclusive theories, just different ones.\n \n \"Evolutionary Models of Modern Humans\"\n \n \"Diregional Evolutionary Hypothesis\"\n \n will now enter my vocabulary.\n \n Thus...\n \"The recent African-origin model championed by many genetic researchers relies on genetic findings that fit just as easily into a contrasting multiregional model. That is, populations of H. sapiens living in different parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe interbred enough over at least the past 1 million years to evolve collectively as a single species. The various populations around the world derived from even older ancestors of H. sapiens in this scenario.\n Practitioners of what has been dubbed anthropological genetics now operate with a sense of caution and a hunger for better explanations of how evolutionary forces produce genetic diversity among individuals and groups.\n \"A lot of us have been too eager to assume that a strict out-of-Africa model is correct because it's compatible with the genetic data, without considering that the data also fit with the multiregional theory,\" says anthropologist John H. Relethford of the State University of New York at Oneonta. \"It's time to go back to the drawing board on this issue.\"\n A fundamental conflict between the two current theories--each of which has several proposed variations on its theme--lies in their differing assumptions about the evolutionary significance of genetic differences among individuals and populations, Relethford asserts. DNA analyses appear unable to determine which perspective proves superior, he says.\"\n http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1200/6_155/53965045/p1/article.jhtml\n \n \n  Punk Eek \n \n I don't think anyone believes that 'gradual' evolution and punctuated equilibrium are mutually exclusive anymore.\n\n \n Certainly I find support for your statement...\n \"The theory and history of the concept\n The theory of punctuated equilibrium was proposed by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in the 1970s. It relies heavily on Ernst Mayr's concept of peripatric speciation, and it is usually contrasted with phyletic gradualism, though critics, notably Richard Dawkins, have argued that phyletic gradualism is merely a straw man. The actual differences between the various evolution theorists are not as large as the opponents of punctuated equilibrium have suggested (Gould himself said that punk eek, as it is affectionately called, did not in fact refute Darwin's gradualism theories, just added to them the ideas of catastrophism and stasis) and the current debate is often more a debate on the relative degree of punctualism and gradualism than one between two fully different extremes. \"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium\n This suggests both\n a) there is criticism\n and\n b) that criticism is not warranted.\n However, not the last line; no one can agree still to how things evolved.... the mix of fast or slow is still in dispute.\n \n There is in fact such concern over it's controversy, that articles such as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\" by Robyn Conder Broyles\n (http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/1366/pe.html) have been drawn up to address the alarm of such evolutionary luminaries as Richard Dawkins.\n \n And, not everyone is so convinced... see review for \"Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest\" by Kim Sterelny\n Icon Books (UK) Totem books (USA), 2001 at\n http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/nettle.html\n \n I've no idea who Hoffman is :) but he seems to think that 'punk eek' isn't too cool...\n \"Contrary to claims by Hoffman (1989, 1992) that the punctuated equilibrium model is either trivial, false, or irrelevant, it has been one of the most stimulating and provocative hypotheses in paleobiology. Witness the enormous literature it generated, or the fact that there have been several recent symposia on the subject (e.g., Somit and Peterson, 1992) and twenty-year retrospectives at national paleontological meetings in Chicago in July, 1992, and Cincinnati in October, 1992. Although a survey of the programs of recent meetings would show fewer studies about evolutionary patterns than a decade ago, there are still many new studies with major new insights being published every year\"\n http://www.skeptic.com/01.3.prothero-punc-eq.html\n \n And, this still doesn't account for Monsterism.\n \n  Addendum\n \n\n A couple things here-\n - Why doesn't Genesis mention dinosaurs?\n - Why don't we have fossil records of our existence until hundreds of thousands of years after the earth was in existence?\n - If the Earth is only a few thousands years old (say 4000-8000), doesn't that make the Biblical predictions and prophesies of the Second Coming big lies? After all, you can debate all you like about what \"soon\" or \"is at hand\" could possibly mean, but in the context of a world that has only existed a couple thousand years, it must have meant sooner than now- thousands more years later!\n\n \n What part of \nI am not yet in a position to present a case beyond merely how I feel on the matter personally.!\n do you not get?\n \n \n Oh,\n I did find this too..\n There are various kinds of dynamics of macroevolution. Punctuated equilibrium theory proposes that once species have originated, and adapted to the new ecological niches in which they find themselves, they tend to stay pretty much as they are for the rest of their existence. Phyletic gradualism suggests that species continue to adapt to new challenges over the course of their history. Species selection and species sorting theories claim that there are macroevolutionary processes going on that make it more or less likely that certain species will exist for very long before becoming extinct, in a kind of parallel to what happens to genes in microevolution. \"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution.html\n That is, there are many different theories on the rates of change, and the patterns of change",
