   "I came across this article and thought it was totally awesome.\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20050803/1a_cover02.art.htm\n \n \nPastor Russell Johnson paces across the broad stage as he decries the \"secular jihadists\" who have \"hijacked\" America, accuses the public schools of neglecting to teach that Hitler was \"an avid evolutionist\"\n\n \n How dare they neglect to teach such an important fact? :) \n \n \nThat is his mission. Johnson leads the Ohio Restoration Project, an emergent network of nearly 1,000 \"Patriot Pastors\" from conservative churches across the state. Each has pledged to register 300 \"values voters,\" adding hundreds of thousands of like-minded citizens to the electorate who \"would be salt and light for America.\"\n \n And, perhaps, help elect a fellow Christian conservative, Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, as governor next year. That has alarmed some establishment Republicans who back rival contenders and warn that an assertive Christian right campaign could repel moderate voters the party needs.\n",
