Republicans in Congress said the White House had signaled to them that Bush would put the issue at the top of his domestic agenda in the coming year.\n .\n But the White House has never answered fundamental questions about Bush's plan. In particular, it has not explained how it would deal with the financial dilemma created by its call for personal accounts.\n .\n The way Social Security works now, the payroll tax on current workers goes to pay benefits to current retirees. If the system is changed to allow current workers to divert a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into the accounts for their retirement, then that money is no longer available to pay benefits to current retirees. The difference has to be made up somewhere.\n .\n Some conservative analysts and Republicans in Congress said a portion of the gap could be closed through measures like holding down the growth in overall government spending. But nearly everyone involved in the debate over Social Security agrees that some borrowing will be necessary.\n .\n The main Republican players in Congress on the issue say they expect to endorse an increase in borrowing to finance the transition to a new system. But they remain split over whether to back plans that would include larger investment accounts and few painful tradeoffs like benefit cuts and tax increases - and therefore require more borrowing - or to limit borrowing and include more steps that would be politically unpopular.\n .\n \"Anybody who thinks borrowing money for the transition to personal accounts is going to solve the problem of the long-term solvency of Social Security doesn't understand the size of the problem,\" said Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the retirement system.\n .\n Grassley said Congress would also have to put on the table benefit reductions and tax increases, in part to hold down the need for borrowing and in part to assure that any changes restore Social Security's long-term financial stability.\n .\n Under current projections used by Social Security's trustees, the government will have to begin drawing on general tax revenue to pay benefits to retirees in 2018, the first year in which scheduled benefit payments will exceed revenues from the payroll tax dedicated to the retirement system.\n .\n By 2042, the government will have exhausted the Social Security trust fund - its legal obligation to pay back to the retirement system the temporary surplus in payroll tax revenues it has borrowed over the last several decades to subsidize the rest of the budget - and after that Social Security would be able to pay only about three-quarters of promised benefits.\n .\n Opponents of Bush's approach said Social Security's financial problems could be dealt with more easily without the addition of personal accounts, and that any large-scale borrowing would erase the presumed economic advantage of establishing the accounts: spurring more national savings, a goal that nearly all economists agree is worthy and important.

   "Political desperation to keep the GDP acceptable to Joe Sixpack with public debt and federal growth, business as usual for this administration. I'm still looking for any faint hint of fiscal conservatism in the so-called Republican congress, but as of yet, no luck.\n\n \n If we're successful in taking social security tax money away from the federal government on the basis that the individual could invest it smarter, why stop there? Let's take away ALL the tax money while we're at it, there is zero doubt in my mind the private sector could do just about everything the government does better, cheaper, and faster. I have little doubt that some individuals are sharp enough to outperform the current system by investing privately, but I also look back a fews months ago and remember billions of dollars in wealth being erased by \"market corrections\". What happens to the people that don't invest wisely when it's time to retire?? Then there's that catchy phrase this administration has become so fond of: \"borrow\" emoticon_rolleyes",

Today's pseudo-conservatives haven't realized that it's far more efficient and, more important, less expensive to keep those without somewhat at bay and geographically positioned by using combined contributions (taxes) for social engineering rather than fielding personal security. Nor do the less affluent understand that their personal retirement investments, government approved, will be locked in to a retirement age more in line with current and future actuary tables. Perhaps a new social security type of private fund quickly raided by both government and private industry without the trust facade?",

This plan is somewhat based on the Chilean privatisation which occured I believe before 1998. Due to the stock market correction and other bubbles many Chileans have lost quite a bit of their retirement savings. For young people, possibly no problem for the older worker, big probles.\n \n Imagine if this program started before the internet bubble. How many people would have lost 50%, 70% or all of there SS money. What then would happen to these individuals when they retire? If they didnt have enough other saving? Lots of poor old people asking for more government handouts. Since old people are the ones who vote in numbers, they will also likely get it.\n \n Overall I see it as a way to increase revenues for the big brokerage companies and boost the share prices on the stock market in order to pay for the pensions of companies like Ford, GM and the Airline industry. All of which have pension problems along with health care funding problems",

   "The primary reason for the government looking at partial privatization of SS is short-term political benefits. Legislation enabling public debt to make the change will, by admission of the proposers, be in the many trillions of dollars. As the US economy is now primarily driven by consumer and government spending/debt, those trillions will be a large contribution to GDP polishing, one of the major numbers to pacify voter economic interest. \n \n Politicians walk a fine line with this one. They can't politically afford to offend the older voting group, the largest voting block, by arbitrarily reducing benefits and younger voters, told that SS will be tapped out within their lifetimes, need some semblance of hope for retirement purposes to assume debt service on the rapidly expanding public debt. What better method than to tap public funds in the form of debt for a 'changeover' to temporarily sate both groups and continue polishing the GDP.\n \n As pointed out by Lord Tammerlain, SS was originally formulated as a retirement insurance program. From a business viewpoint, it was a sound program, with both employee and employer contributions paid for by the employee and customer. It failed partially because legislation didn't include periodic updates of retirement ages (the average male lifespan at the time SS originated was early '60s) and was doomed when politicians discovered they could divert any public trust revenue into general funds to avoid raising taxes and incurring self-defeat during election periods. \n \n To assume that equity investments can replace structured insurance, where reserves are collected in advance, is pure fantasy promoted by brokerages, banks (who now own a hefty portion of the brokerage business) and a government always eager to trade public money for votes. As pointed out by others, equity markets are subject to drastic changes for a variety of reasons, including near failure as proven in 1929. For those of you who believe margin restrictions have since eliminated a repetition of that occurrence, dream on. Any brokerage account provides for, depending on your investor (or fund) rating, a minimum of 50% margin selling. What market could survive a 50% margin withdrawal? \n \n As GM, Ford and others see the writing on the wall with enormous potential losses from underfunded pension and benefit funds drained by actuary reality, most have started to distance themselves from those liabilities through bond funds, sharper legal separation from operating entities and spin offs of decades old 100% owned subs. If one takes a look at the federal agency that guarantees corporate pension funds, it's now running a $14-billion deficit as more companies tank and dissolve to avoid those liabilities, with lots more to come. Both Ford and GM would be deliriously happy (as would their shareholders) if their revenue was derived from a corporate center holding portions of operating entities that didn't subject them to pension liabilities. And they're heading in that direction. The difference between corporations and government is that there's no way for an elected government to hide from hungry, angry people when investments fail.",
