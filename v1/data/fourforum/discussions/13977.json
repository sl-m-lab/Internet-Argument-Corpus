   "  Revive 'privileges or immunities' -- 14th Amendment clause ought to protect against state red tape limiting economic freedom. \n One of the biggest cases the U.S. Supreme Court will decide this year involves the right to bear arms. But in the long run, its decision in McDonald v. Chicago may be far more important to America's entrepreneurs. It all depends on whether the justices decide to revive a constitutional provision it has neglected for more than a century. \n \n When it was ratified in 1868, the 14th Amendment added several revolutionary new provisions to the Constitution, barring states from violating the \"privileges or immunities\" of citizens, or taking anyone's life, liberty or property without \"due process of law,\" or depriving people of the \"equal protection of the laws.\" But the first time it heard a case under that amendment - in the 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases - the Supreme Court basically erased the privileges or immunities clause, dramatically limiting the way the federal government would protect people against wrongful acts by state officials.\n \n (The article explains what Slaughterhouse is and what is meant and what Alan Gura is attempting to overturn) \n \n That's where the gun cases come in. Last year, in Heller v. District of Columbia, the Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to possess firearms. That case only applied to the federal government, because it involved a Washington ordinance, but it was quickly followed by the McDonald case, which asks the justices to decide whether the 14th Amendment requires states to respect that right also. The justices have also agreed to consider whether that right should be protected by the privileges or immunities clause. A decision reviving that dormant clause would signal a return to the amendment's original purpose. Better still, it would give entrepreneurs a chance to defend themselves from the often burdensome and abusive regulations that states now enforce with impunity. \n\n Heller already struck down one regulation, a ban on handguns, can called into question the ridiculous Safe Storage law that DC had on the books, which we can also assume is another reg that has been effectively struck down.\n \n Here is an article on what this ruling could mean the states, but with heavy emphasis on California. Get ready for a lot of Legal costs California! Expect to go a lot further into the hole as far as your deficits go. A LOT further into the hole! A LOT! \n   U.S. Supreme Court to take on battle over gun rights \nExperts generally agree that whatever the Supreme Court decides, it will not erase many of California's gun laws. But gun rights groups already are gearing up for lawsuits that would renew challenges to California laws, including its assault weapons ban, on the grounds they trample on the fundamental right to bear arms. \n \n California. a lot at stake,\" said Dennis Hennigan, vice president of law and policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which rates the state first in gun control laws. \"You could certainly see increased litigation over all these laws.\"\n \n Chuck Michel, a lawyer for the National Rifle Association in California, adds: \"There will be lots of stuff, especially the stuff that's really extreme and high-profile, that will be challenged as vulnerable.\"\n \n The Supreme Court case is the second in the past two years that takes on a legal debate over the Second Amendment that went unresolved for more than 100 years: how much, and whether, constitutional protection restricts government's ability to regulate gun ownership, possession and sales.\n\n A LOT!\n \n A LOT!",

Get ready for a lot of Legal costs California! Expect to go a lot further into the hole as far as your deficits go. A LOT further into the hole! A LOT! \n   U.S. Supreme Court to take on battle over gun rights \n A LOT!\n \n A LOT!\n\n \n Here are my thoughts. This case has the potential to be much greater than the issue of gun rights. It also has the potential to be the most important civil rights case in the last century, and perhaps the most far reaching case ever to consider the 14th. Amendment. \n \n A. A brief history review to put McDonald in context\n \n Remember that Barron v. Baltimore, Cruikshank, Presser, and other cases held the 1st. 8 amendments in the BoR were originally intended to apply only to the federal government, and to prevent state abuses of these rights the citizens were required to look for protection in the state constitutions. This proved inadequate protection for newly freed blacks after the civil war, and many abuses were noted (including laws and private militia action denying the black man his RKBA). These abuses led, in 1868, to the 14th. Amendment of which here is section 1:\n \n Section 1. Citizenship Rights Not to Be Abridged by States. -- All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n Now it has been generally understood that Section 1 of the Amendment, and particularly the \"privileges and immunities clause\" portion, was passed to incorporate the Bill of Rights against the states-effectively \"cutting and pasting\" the federal BoR and applying it wholesale as a bar against state infringement of these rights. See, for example, a House sponsor or the 14th. Amendment:\n \n This immortal bill of rights embodied in the Constitution, rested for its execution and enforcement hitherto upon the fidelity of the States. . . .The proposition pending before the House is simply a proposition to arm Congress. . .with the power to enforce this bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.--Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 1033-34 (February 26, 1866) and p. 1088 (February 28, 1966) [Speeches by Congressman John A. Bingham (Republican-Ohio)]\n \n See also the speech of the Senate sponsor of the 14th. Amendment:\n \n To these privileges and immunities should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.. . .[A]ll these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees. Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 3, p. 2765 (May 23, 1866) [Speech of Senator Jacob M. Howard (Republican-Michigan)] \n \n And see this:\n \n In the entire Senate debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, running from May 23 to June 8, not a single senator challenged Senator Howard's declaration that Section 1 made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states. Irving Bryant, The Bill of Rights, p. 337 (1965).\n \n But in 1872 SCOTUS decided the Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1872). You will hear this case discussed in the McDonald arguments. This surprise decision gutted the privileges and immunities clause, holding that Congress didn't really mean what it said-that the 14th. Amendment's \"P&I\" clause did not incorporate the first 8 amendments of the BoR. Instead, the court ruled that this clause includes only those rights that \"are dependent upon citizenship of the United States, and not citizenship of a State.\" Id. at 80. These national citizenship rights include the right to \"free access to its seaports,\" to \"use the navigable waters,\" to \"peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances,\" and to \"become a citizen of any state.\" Id. at 79-80. This was, IMO, one of the most egregious anti-civil rights cases in the history of our nation. For decades thereafter states were free to ignore the rights in the BoR (unless their own state constitutions required them). IMO, this case set back the progress of civil rights for nearly a century (for example, the states were not finally required to recognize the 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury until the 1968 case of Duncan v. LOUISIANA, 391 U.S. 145).\n \n So it was only in the 20th. century that SCOTUS began forcing the states to recognize some of the rights in the BoR. SCOTUS did so by bypassing the Slaughter-House roadblock, and instead it used the \"due process\" clause of the 14th. Amendment. But in doing so SCOTUS refused to incorporate all the rights in the BoR. Instead, it did so by a process of \"selective incorporation\" whereby it took each right individually as presented in a case and decided whether or not it was important enough to be incorporated. Those rights found important enough were declared \"Fundamental Rights.\" SCOTUS defined \"fundamental rights as those rights \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" See Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937).\n \n As it stands today, the process of \"selective incorporation\" under the \"due process\" clause has incorporated most of the rights in the first 8 Amendments against the states as they have come up. It has also been used to incorporate some unenumerated rights that have been declared to exist outside the written word of the BoR under the \"penumbra doctrine\"-which holds that the BoR is not the only source of fundamental rights (for example, the right to abortion was created and incorporated in Roe v. Wade, and more recently the right of consenting adults to engage in homosexual sodomy in the privacy of their homes was incorporated in Lawrence v. Texas). \n \n \n B. McDonald and why it is an important case for civil rights beyond just the RKBA\n \n Now, with McDonald, the 2nd. Amendment RKBA has its turn. McDonald is a combination of more than one case challenging gun laws in the City of Chicago, involving lawsuits brought by both the 2nd. Amendment Foundation and the National Rifle Association. Both organizations asked SCOTUS to accept the case and incorporate the 2nd. Amendment RKBA under both the 14th. Amendments \"due process\" clause (the established \"selective incorporation\" route) and, more importantly, under the \"P&I\" clause. In effect, both organizations are asking SCOTUS to overturn Slaughter-House and declare that the \"P&I\" clause is a blanket incorporation of the entire BoR (including the RKBA) against the states. This is the sensational aspect of this case, and a revitalized \"P&I\" clause would have a far reaching impact on the concept of federalism. \n \n Chicago originally argued that the writ should not be granted and SCOTUS should not review the case for incorporation on either \"due process\" or \"P&I\" grounds, but as a fall back Chicago argued that if a writ were granted then SCOTUS should only review the case under the traditional \"due process\" \"selective incorporation\" review (and Chicago argues that the RKBA is not a fundamental right and should not be incorporated even under \"due process.\")\n \n SCOTUS dropped a civil rights/federalism bombshell when it agreed to a full review of both incorporation issues as petitioners wanted. Here is the issue to be argued:\n \n \"Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities or Due Process Clauses.\"\n \n And so the stage is now set for arguments tomorrow. If incorporation is to be had under \"due process,\" then SCOTUS must declare that the RKBA is a \"fundamental right.\" That is, (1) whether the right at issue is \"necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty,\" Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 n.14 (1968); and (2) whether the right is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" Moore v. E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion). I have argued for \"Fundamental Right\" status for the RKBA for years. \"Fundamental right\" status \"due process\" incorporation would be a tremendous victory for civil rights supporters in the field of the RKBA-it would require \"strict scrutiny\" review of RKBA infringement laws for constitutionality. But, if SCOTUS goes further and \"P&I\" is used to incorporate, then SCOTUS will overturn Slaughter-House and effectively cut and paste the entire BoR against state infringement (which would be, IMO, the most far reaching civil rights decision in 100 years).\n \n You can find all published briefs in support of both sides here:\n \n Merit Briefs for February Supreme Court Cases, Term 2009-2010 (ABA Division for Public Education)\n \n Scroll down about half the page and you will find \"McDonald v. City of Chicago, IL, Docket No. 08-1521\", and links to PDFs for all briefs filed.\n \n A few are worth noting:\n \n *McDonald and the SAF have filed their joint brief arguing for the 2nd. Amendment to be recognized as a \"Fundamental Right\" and incorporated under both the \"due process\" and \"P&I\" clauses, overturning Slaughter-House.\n \n *The NRA has filed its brief arguing for essentially the same.\n \n *The Chicago/Oak Grove brief argues that the Court should not overturn Slaughter-House, and that it should reject the \"P&I\" route to incorporation. It also argues that the 2nd. Amendment RKBA should not be granted \"Fundamental Right\" status and should not be incorporated under the established \"due process\" framework. Chicago/Oak Grove have also argued that if incorporated the RKBA needs to be watered down from what it is in Heller, but that is another issue for another post....\n \n *55 members of the House of Representatives have filed a joint brief in favor of the City of Chicago, arguing against incorporation in any form. \n \n *58 senators and 251 members of the House of Representatives have filed a joint brief in favor of McDonald arguing for \"Fundamental Right\" status and incorporation under both \"due process\" and \"P&I\"\n \n *38 states have filed a joint brief arguing for 2nd. Amendment \"Fundamental Right\" right status and incorporation against the states, but interestingly only through the \"due process\" clause of the 14th. Amendment.\n \n *The NAACP has filed a brief in support of neither party. The organization criticizes Slaughter-House (rightly, IMO): \n \n \"Slaughter-House, and the other late nineteenth century cases that effectively wrote the Privileges or Immunities Clause out of the Constitution, have been thoroughly discredited, and their continuing doctrinal significance has been substantially eroded by this Court's use of the Due Process Clause to incorporate key constitutional rights as against the states.\"\n \n However, the NAACP argues that SCOTUS should consider the case only under the Due Process clause. The NAACP fears that using the \"P&I\" clause could upset the apple cart and potentially weaken existing \"due process\" incorporation protections (a position that I disagree with). The NAACP argues that any use of the \"P&I\" clause should supplement, and not replace, the Court's existing incorporation of other rights. The NAACP refuses to take a position on whether the 2nd. Amendment RKBA should be incorporated. All it will say is the right defined in Heller does not automatically command incorporation. \n \n We will get a feel for how the justices are leaning tomorrow....",

And there's few things more modern than an AR-15 or M1A.\n\n \n Yeah, Heller did shoot down the absurd argument that the RKBA is limited to weapons in existence at the nation's founding:\n \n Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment . We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997) , and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35-36 (2001) , the Second Amendment extends, prima facie,to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.\n \n But I'm not sure Heller by itself protects so-called \"assault weapons.\" First of all let me say that incorporation of the right as outlined in Heller will destroy Chicago's handgun ban. This is what Heller said about the D.C. handgun ban: \n \n As the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of \"arms\" that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute. Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights,27 banning from the home \"the most preferred firearm in the nation to 'keep' and use for protection of one's home and family,\" 478 F. 3d, at 400, would fail constitutional muster. \n Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's handgun ban. And some of those few have been struck down. In Nunn v. State, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a prohibition on carrying pistols openly (even though it upheld a prohibition on carrying concealed weapons). See 1 Ga., at 251. In Andrews v. State, the Tennessee Supreme Court likewise held that a statute that forbade openly carrying a pistol \"publicly or privately, without regard to time or place, or circumstances,\" 50 Tenn., at 187, violated the state constitutional provision (which the court equated with the Second Amendment ). That was so even though the statute did not restrict the carrying of long guns. Ibid. See also State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\").\n It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.\n \n Heller ties the right (correctly, IMO) to self-defense. Heller then invalidates the handgun ban on the basis that it denies the citizen a class of arms that are most favored for self-defense. Now some will argue that the reverse must be true-that Heller therefore implies all other types of firearms can be banned since they are not weapons most favored for the right of self defense. But if SCOTUS wanted to say this then it would have. Instead, Heller takes U.S. v. Miller and uses it to project potential limits on the types of firearms the emerging RKBA will protect:\n \n We may as well consider at this point (for we will have to consider eventually) what types of weapons Miller permits. Read in isolation, Miller's phrase \"part of ordinary military equipment\" could mean that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected. That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act's restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939. We think that Miller's \"ordinary military equipment\" language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \"[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\" 307 U. S., at 179. The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \"in common use at the time\" for lawful purposes like self-defense. \"In the colonial and revolutionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\" State v. Kessler, 289 Ore. 359, 368, 614 P. 2d 94, 98 (1980) (citing G. Neumann, Swords and Blades of the American Revolution 6-15, 252-254 (1973)). Indeed, that is precisely the way in which the Second Amendment 's operative clause furthers the purpose announced in its preface. We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns. That accords with the historical understanding of the scope of the right, see Part III, infra....\n \n and\n \n  We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \"in common use at the time.\" 307 U. S., at 179. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\" See 4 Blackstone 148-149 (1769); 3 B. Wilson, Works of the Honourable James Wilson 79 (1804); J. Dunlap, The New-York Justice 8 (1815); C. Humphreys, A Compendium of the Common Law in Force in Kentucky 482 (1822); 1 W. Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 271-272 (1831); H. Stephen, Summary of the Criminal Law 48 (1840); E. Lewis, An Abridgment of the Criminal Law of the United States 64 (1847); F. Wharton, A Treatise on the Criminal Law of the United States 726 (1852). See also State v. Langford, 10 N. C. 381, 383-384 (1824); O'Neill v. State, 16Ala. 65, 67 (1849); English v. State, 35Tex. 473, 476 (1871); State v. Lanier, 71 N. C. 288, 289 (1874).\n It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service-M-16 rifles and the like-may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment 's ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.\n \n IMO, this speculation about the future limits of the types of protected arms, by itself, does not offer sure support for protection of so-called \"assault weapons.\" For example, the Brady Campaign will undoubtedly argue that \"assault weapons\" are exactly the type of \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" Heller says are not automatically protected. So I am not ready to say incorporation of the RKBA in Heller will protect \"assault weapons\" at this time.\n \n However, Heller is not the end-it is the beginning of the recognition of the RKBA. The question of fundamental right status, incorporation, whether to use \"strict scrutiny\" in future law challenges, etc. are all undecided. The goal of the BC and other anti-RKBA organizations is to build a wall around Heller and contain the further development of the RKBA. The goal of the NRA and other pro-RKBA organizations is to prevent that wall from being built. We will have to wait and see whether McDonald helps build that wall or instead paves the road forward. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.",

   ".... (Heller case) In Nunn v. State, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a prohibition on carrying pistols openly (even though it upheld a prohibition on carrying concealed weapons). See 1 Ga., at 251. In Andrews v. State, the Tennessee Supreme Court likewise held that a statute that forbade openly carrying a pistol \"publicly or privately, without regard to time or place, or circumstances,\" 50 Tenn., at 187, violated the state constitutional provision (which the court equated with the Second Amendment ). That was so even though the statute did not restrict the carrying of long guns. Ibid. See also State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\").\n \n It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.[/I]\n\n Someone correct me if I am wrong, but California has a Right to Keep and Bear Arms provision in their State Constitution.

The Miller conviction was for not paying the tax.\n \n \nBut as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment 's ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty.\n\n I have a HUGE surprise for all who want to claim the Militia dodge for banning the useful Military type stuff.\n   A quote from one of our Founders. Tenche Coxe\n \"Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American . . . . The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.\" -- The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788\n\n \n This is Current United States Law. \n Who are the Militia today   United States Code, Title 10 Chapter 13.\n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are - Organized and unorganized\n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard \n and the Naval Militia; and \n \n (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.\n\n Ohio's Militia requirements require us to serve in the Militia until the age 60. emoticon_smile\n But again, this is just the Militia Requirements.

   " Regarding Scalia's statement about \"dangerous and unusual weapons\". Couldn't it be argued that since there's no such thing as a weapon that isn't dangerous, that Scalia's opinion is in direct contradiction with the court's findings? \n\n \n No I don&#8217;t think so. Scalia is explaining that the RKBA, like all rights, is not absolute&#8212;and he is using past case history and other legal sources to speculate about the outer limits of the RKBA:\n \n We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those &#8220;in common use at the time.&#8221; 307 U.S., at 179. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of &#8220;dangerous and unusual weapons.&#8221; District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 55 (2008)\n \n Look at it from the Brady Campaign&#8217;s view. The BC effectively considers Heller as a cancerous tumor which, if it cannot be excised, then must be attacked to prevent its spread to other areas (like incorporation against the states, like a declaration of fundamental right status, or any other expansion). So let me play Devil&#8217;s advocate on the so called &#8220;assault weapons&#8221; issue. If I were a Brady Campaigner then I would argue for a link between the phrase &#8220;in common use at the time&#8221; (citing back to Miller) and the phrase &#8220;dangerous and unusual weapons&#8221; (citing back to Blackstone and other early laws). My BC argument would be the more &#8220;uncommon&#8221; the weapon the more &#8220;dangerous and unusual&#8221; the weapon is and therefore the more subject to regulation or ban. I would argue, for example, that since so called &#8220;assault weapons&#8221; are not as common today as handguns then they must be more &#8220;dangerous and unususal&#8221; and therefore more subject to a ban. But, my BC friends, consider this portion of Heller:\n \n Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 35-36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 8 (2008) (bold emphasis added)\n \n My Devil&#8217;s advocate argument runs into trouble here, for my argument in effect advances the same position rejected in Heller&#8212;it just freezes the RKBA to arms known and commonly held at this time as opposed to those commonly held in 1789. Both arguments stagnate the right, which is something SCOTUS appears unwilling to accept (indeed, such a position on any right would create a threat to have the same theory spread into the evaluation of other rights). \n \n And so it appears we start with the position that all bearable arms are within the scope of the right (including so called &#8221;assault weapons&#8221;). But the right is not absolute within this scope. Those bearable arms considered &#8220;dangerous and unusual&#8221; may not be fully protected&#8212;and SCOTUS will have to look at each type of weapon as the regulations affecting it are challenged.\n \n \n Also, couldn't it be argued that to call semi-automatic firearms \"unusual\" would be to show complete ignorance to the last 125 years of firearms development, and how their long history exempts them from Scalia's opinion? \n\n \n Oh I agree, and Heller did not discuss any distinction between the actions of the firearms. As an aside, I talked with a friend this weekend who is a tremendous &#8220;front end loader&#8221; fan. He still clings to his belief that this whole cartridge ammunition thing is just a fad. I asked him when he was going to upgrade from his flintlock passion to at least consider percussion caps, and he said If God wanted man to shoot percussion caps then he would have littered the ground with them the same way he does with flints.\n \n \n Was this an intentional cite of Heller Bryan? Or was it just a gift to me? \n\n \n It was intentional, but also consider it a gift.\n \n \n As I remember, what seemed contradictory to me about Heller was that the court said that \"bear arms\" means carry a gun but later in the decision they said that laws that ban the carrying of concealed weapons are okay. Does it make much sense to say that there is a Second Amendment right to carry gun and then say that laws that forbid the carrying of guns are okay? \n\n \n It makes sense if we consider that rights are not absolute or unlimited. Here is what SCOTUS said:\n \n Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. See, e.g., Sheldon, in 5 Blume 346; Rawle 123; Pomeroy 152-153; Abbott333. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. See, e.g., State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann., at 489-490; Nunn v. State, 1 Ga., at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340, n. 2; The American Students' Blackstone 84, n. 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884). Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of [Slip Op. 55] arms.\n District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 54-55 (2008)\n \n And, since we are already on this topic, remember that there was a footnote at the end of this quote which reads:\n \n We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 64 (2008)\n \n This goes back to an absurd argument against recognition of an individual RKBA (in fairness, not one advanced by Galileo). That argument claimed the right is expressed in the amendment in unlimited terms and if it is an individual right then people can own nukes&#8212;and we just can&#8217;t have that. It intentionally ignores SCOTUS history which holds that in society few if any rights are absolute. Each right has a scope and a nature. The scope defines what items or conduct the right protects, and varies with the right. The nature, however, is almost always limited. That is, it is not &#8220;anything goes&#8221; within the protected scope of the right. The necessity for limitation is imposed by society. Look at a few other rights as examples&#8230;.\n \n Freedom of speech is also written in my constitution in absolute terms. And the right is absolute for a lone castaway on a deserted island. He can say anything he pleases. But society cannot exist without some limitation on the right, and when a man enters society he loses that portion of the right that permits him to cry &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater, for example. The same goes for the unlimited wording of the right of freedom of religion, which can be limited by laws which define human sacrifice as murder. It is this understanding of the give and take between society and individual rights that permits (and commands) the unlimited wording of our rights to have some limitations. \n \n So to answer your question, Galileo, &#8220;Does it make much sense to say that there is a Second Amendment right to carry gun and then say that laws that forbid the carrying of guns are okay?&#8221; I say it makes about as much sense as SCOTUS saying you have a right of free speech and then saying laws preventing libel, slander, threats to kill or harm others, incitement to riot, etc, are OK. \n \n The RKBA is no more or less important than these other rights&#8212;and within the scope of protected &#8220;bearable arms&#8221; it is not unlimited. The problem I have with the BC and others is they have taken a decidedly anti civil rights view of the RKBA. They so fear how this right will develop that they want to take this newly reborn RKBA and smother it in the crib. While others, like the NAACP, who have for so long spoken up as champions of other civil rights, are witnessing what the BC wants to do and have blanched and fallen silent. \n \n I disagree with the premise that within the Bill of Rights all rights are equal, but some are more equal than others. I&#8217;m not asking that the RKBA be afforded any more special treatment than the other rights I enjoy. I just want people to stop treating the RKBA like it was the red headed stepchild of the Constitution.",

   "Look at it from the Brady Campaign's view.\n\n \n I's sorry but I can't be that dishonest, or that afraid of the common man.\n \n \nSo let me play Devil's advocate on the so called \"assault weapons\" issue. If I were a Brady Campaigner then I would argue for a link between the phrase \"in common use at the time\" (citing back to Miller) and the phrase \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" (citing back to Blackstone and other early laws). My BC argument would be the more \"uncommon\" the weapon the more \"dangerous and unusual\" the weapon is and therefore the more subject to regulation or ban. I would argue, for example, that since so called \"assault weapons\" are not as common today as handguns then they must be more \"dangerous and unususal\" and therefore more subject to a ban.\n\n \n Cute trick, but to make such an argument the Brady Campaign would have to contradict themselves on earlier statements, about the prevalence of \"assault weapons\" used in crimes. They painted the picture of common criminals arming themselves with AR-15s and AK-47s in a manner suggesting there were tens of millions of such firearms on the open market and nothing could be done about it. So if they take the route you suggested then they'd have to claim that an AR-15 or AK-47 is hard to find, like only one model to every ten gun stores or so, so they're uncommon, used by almost nobody, and their banning wouldn't affect anybody; which would then unravel their claim that they're commonly used by criminals.\n \n I personally view it as a catch-22 argument the Brady Campaign is faced with: either the guns they want banned are in common use by the regular people and available throughout most of the country, or they're next to impossible to find through regular channels, meaning it would be almost unheard of for a criminal to get ahold of them and use them.\n \n \nAnd so it appears we start with the position that all bearable arms are within the scope of the right (including so called \"assault weapons\"). But the right is not absolute within this scope. Those bearable arms considered \"dangerous and unusual\" may not be fully protected-and SCOTUS will have to look at each type of weapon as the regulations affecting it are challenged.\n\n \n I still think that if the history of firearms technology is introduced, showing the semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines have been around for well over a century, then the \"dangerous and unusual\" test against them would fail. After more than a century something is no longer viewed unusual, or uniquely dangerous.",

   "As I remember, what seemed contradictory to me about Heller was that the court said that \"bear arms\" means carry a gun but later in the decision they said that laws that ban the carrying of concealed weapons are okay. Does it make much sense to say that there is a Second Amendment right to carry gun and then say that laws that forbid the carrying of guns are okay?\n\n Besides what Bryan said, Scalea, in Heller, mentioned   Klein v. Leis, 99 Ohio St.3d 537, 2003-Ohio-4779.\n {\u00b615} The General Assembly has determined that prohibiting the carrying\n of concealed weapons helps maintain an orderly and safe society. We conclude that that goal and the means used to attain it are reasonable. We hold that R.C 2923.12 does not unconstitutionally infringe the right to bear arms; there is no constitutional right to bear concealed weapons. \n \n {\u00b623} However, as the majority articulates, R.C. 2923.12 regulates only\n the manner in which a firearm may be carried. Accord State v. Nieto (1920), 101 \n Ohio St. 409, 413, 130 N.E. 663. Because a restriction on the manner of \n exercising a right necessarily leaves open other means of exercising the right, the \n lesser standard of intermediate scrutiny is applicable\n \n {\u00b624} Under intermediate scrutiny, a regulation will be upheld only if the \n regulation is narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest and \n leaves open other means of exercising the right ..... Further, the state correctly asserts that the statute leaves open the ability to bear arms by openly carrying a firearm, satisfying the third prong of the test. \n\n So Concealed Carry may be regulated, (And or Banned) just as long as Open Carry avenue or remedy exists. As per Ohio Supreme Court.",

   "I understand, Nato. I'm a fan of Sun Tzu, and I believe in \"knowing your enemy as you know yourself.\" I deliberately paid little attention to whether my example of a BC argument contradicted prior positions taken by the organization. I was just trying to accurately assume the role of a BC advocate. \n \n Still, it was interesting to me to approach gun control that way. It is the first time I have ever approached a problem with the absolute freedom one gets from an \"end justifies all means\" mentality-that all is possible and if in the name of expediency I happen today to contradict some position I took earlier then I can just pretend I never took that earlier position (even if I need to revert back to it again at a later date). I guess this exercise in fantasy \"doublethink\" gave me an insight into how O'Brien justifies himself in Orwell's 1984-and how Brady justifies himself here.\n \n Never fear, however. While doing this I did not hear Sarah Brady say \"Bryan, I am your mother\"-and I did not feel seduced by my flirtation with the Dark Side of the Force.",
