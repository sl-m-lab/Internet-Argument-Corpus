He, Pat Buchanan, and others were talking about Obama, and terms like 'prom king' and 'messiah complex' turned up. It was mentioned how the candidate Obama is nothing like president Obama, and how he has been viewed more as someone who takes positions rather than actually being the leader he promised that he would. I thought it was a very fair assessment. \n \n Kudos for Matthews for being one of the few on MSNBC with the cojones to actually report critically about Obama. It is far too bad that the other Liberal mouthpieces like Maddow and Olberman can't learn a little something from him. Same goes for Beck, Rush, and Hannity. They just can't get past their own partisan hatreds to actually examine the issues fairly.",

Most of what he says is not a \"fair\" assessment but that's why I have the internet :) Rush and Hannity are the same way expect Hannity is annoying with the \"you're a great American\" bs. Maddow and Olberman are just not entertaining. No creativity or innovation in delivery. At least Bill Maher is funny so I watch that.",

You'll only see ratings for CSI-Miami go up emoticon_xclown\n \n And I don't think it is because they are the only conservative network. They are consistently better entertainment shows. CNN realized this and has tried to copy with many of their shows format (limited success). I'm sure having the monopoly doesn't hurt either but it isn't everything...conservative talk radio has a lot of competition yet all those get insane numbers of ratings.\n \n \nBut Maher actually trys to be a funny man, and in no way touts himself as a journalist...yet he still has a much better grasp of the actual issues than those who many Americans rely on for their news.
