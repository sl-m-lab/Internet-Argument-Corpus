   "\"The Mexican Ambassador to the United States, Auturo Sarukhan, appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico. The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because \"most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.\" That is not true, but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda. \n \n ATFE's Fake Number\n \n We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has made so many contradictory statements on the matter. ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90% of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US. \n \n The problem is that 90% number isn't true. Yet, that hasn't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, of course, Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico's problems. \n Real Weapons Source?\n \n The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now \"clarified\" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. \n \n We can easily understand Mexico's reasons for preferring the 90% number to the more accurate 17%. Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels. Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police. Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from purchases in Eastern Europe. But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government's failure to police its borders, its ports of entry and its military installations. \n \n Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels? \n \n Lax Vehicle Inspection \n \n Certainly, no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance. You can't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona. But for the sake of argument, what if it was true that 30% of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S.? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S.? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections. And could it be that Mexico's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun-smuggling operations? \n \n Why Strange Obama Response? \n \n But what accounts for the Obama administration's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence? Two explanations are possible: It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem. If we can end Mexico's chaos by making changes on this side of the border, that's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage. \n \n The other explanation is more troublesome. Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself. It is obvious that Obama's teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans. The Obama crew's hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months. This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel's maxim: \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" \n \n Mexico needs to face its own demons, beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry. The U.S. can help in many ways, such as enhancing our own border security. But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico. \n \n If we are lucky, this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction. If it is more than that, if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico's problems, then we are lost in a swamp. \"",

   "If these fabrications, and continued lies, were about ANY other subject, other than the 2nd Amendment, these reporters would be fired on the spot, for lack of journalistic integrity! But somehow this part of the Constitution does not deserve respect, or strict adherence to the rules of journalistic integrity! \n \n Why?\n \n Lefties! This anomaly in the media's code of conduct can and WILL show up in something YOU care about some day! The question should be, what about your Integrity as a citizen of this great and unique country? Can your lack of Constitutional integrity spell the end of our Great and Unique Constitution? But don't take my word for it. Here is the warning directly from the mount of one of yours! \n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor  Alan Dershowitz agrees,and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n",

   "The truth is out.\n \n \nHandgun Control Memo\n \n Received info as follows:\n \n \n In 1993, it was discovered that Handgun Control, Inc. had developed a\n \n five year plan to disarm the law abiding citizens of the United States of\n \n America. This plan continues with a total 15 year plan that includes\n \n banning of military accouterments, censorship and the loss of the second\n \n amendment.\n \n \n The following is copy of a memo that leaked to the public...\n \n \n D-Day is in January 1994...\n \n \n This month will be crucial to swaying votes for Senator Feinstein's\n \n Assault Weapon Ban. Once this passes, we will see the beginning of a\n \n landslide that the NRA thugs will not be able to stop or their few pawns in\n \n Congress be able to filibuster.\n \n WHAT IS PENDING NOW AND CAN BE LAW IN 1994:\n \n .Ban of all clips holding over six bullets\n \n .Ban of all semi-autos that can fire more than six bullets without reloading.\n \n .Ban on all pump shotguns capable of being converted to over five shots\n \n without reloading\n \n .Banning of all machine guns, destructive devices, short\n \n shotguns/rifles, assault weapons, Saturday night Specials and non-sporting\n \n ammunition\n \n .Arsenal licensing (for possession of multiple guns and large amounts of\n \n ammunition)\n \n .Elimination of the Dept. of Civilian Marksmanship, long considered a\n \n sacred cow and a dinosaur from the Cold War years (thank you, President\n \n Clinton!)\n \n .Ban on possession of a firearm within a home located within 1,000 feet\n \n of a schoolyard\n \n .Ban on all realistic replicas/toy guns or non-firearms capable of being\n \n rendered realistic\n \n .The right of victims of gun violence to sue manufacturers and dealers\n \n to be affirmed and perhaps aided with money from government programs\n \n .Taxes on ammo,dealer licenses and guns to offset the medical costs to\n \n society and\n \n .The eventual ban of all semi-automatics (regardless of when made or\n \n what caliber)\n \n \n What was only a dream 10 years ago can be reality as early as this year!\n \n \n AFTER THE MEETING, THE FOLLOWING IDEAS WERE THE RESULT OF A\n \n BRAINSTORMING SESSION TO GUIDE THE FOCUS OF GUN CONTROL\n \n INITIATIVES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE CONSIDERED THE BEST\n \n IDEAS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY EXPANSION. THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR ACTION.\n \n \n FIVE YEAR PLAN\n \n \n Licenses\n \n \n 1. National licensing of all handgun purchases.\n \n 2. Licenses for rifles and shotguns: Strict licensing should be mandatory\n \n for all firearms, whether handguns or not.\n \n 3. State licenses for ownership of firearms.\n \n 4. Reduction of the number of guns to require an arsenal license: Right\n \n now the proposed arsenal licenses, which Senator Feinstein should be\n \n pushing for, require an \"arsenal license\" for those people who feel they\n \n need more than 20 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. We feel that this\n \n number is too generous, due to the fact that any number of guns constitutes\n \n a grave threat to the safety of the community. We suggest strongly that\n \n this license limit be reduced to possession greater than five guns and 250\n \n rounds of ammunition.\n \n 5. Arsenal license fees: It is not unreasonable to require a yearly fee\n \n for an arsenal license to be at least $300, with a cap of $1000. The money\n \n collected can be used to defray the immense medical costs directly\n \n attributed to these deadly weapons.\n \n 6. Limits on arsenal licensing: No arsenal licensing to be permitted in\n \n counties with populations of more than 200,000.\n \n 7 Requirement of federally approved storage safe of all guns: All\n \n licensed gun owners should be required to have a storage safe that meets\n \n minimum federally mandated requirements.\n \n 8. Inspection license: Each safe would be registered with a specific\n \n serial number and the serial numbers and types of weapons stored should be\n \n on file with federal and state authorities. Since unannounced inspections\n \n can ensure that all declared weapons are being properly stored, all safe\n \n licenses should have an additional yearly fee to offset the cost of these\n \n spot inspections.\n \n \n PUBLIC SAFETY REGULATIONS\n \n \n 9. Ban on manufacturing in counties with a population of more than 200,000.\n \n 10 Banning all military-style firearms.\n \n 11 Banning of any machine gun parts or parts that can be used in a\n \n machine gun.\n \n 12 Banning the carrying of a firearm anywhere but home or target range or\n \n in transit from one to the other.\n \n 13 Banning replacement parts (manufacturing, sale possession, transfer,\n \n installation) except barrel/trigger group.\n \n 14 Elimination of the curio relic list: A gun is a gun. Even an old gun\n \n can kill people. This is a loophole in federal law that has allowed\n \n thousands of dangerous weapons to be distributed unchecked. This\n \n regulation, if enacted, would automatically eliminated the need for a curio\n \n or relic collector's license. All handguns, rifles and shotguns would fall\n \n under the same category as their modern counterparts.\n \n 15 Control of ammunition belonging to certain surplus firearms.\n \n 16 Eventual ban of handgun possession: This may be closer to reality than\n \n many of us think.\n \n 17 Banning of any ammo that fits military guns(post 1945): We suggest\n \n following the lead of Mexico by prohibiting the sale, manufacture,\n \n possession or transfer of any caliber fitting a military firearm in service\n \n with a recognized military force after 1945.\n \n \n AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES\n \n \n 18 Banning of any quantity of smokeless powder or black powder that would\n \n constitute more than the equivalent of 100 rounds of ammunition.\n \n 19 Ban on possession of explosive powders of more than one kilogram at\n \n any one time.\n \n 20 Banning of high-power ammo or wounding ammo: In addition to the\n \n banning of military calibers, there is a plethora of dangerous rounds that\n \n are too high-powered for sporting use. This includes the highest calibers\n \n of pistol and rifle ammunition.\n \n 21 A national license for ammunition: This is an idea whose time has\n \n come. We should look at a federal license of purchasing of ammunition of\n \n all kinds. A special form should be forwarded to a new federal office to\n \n track those who are purchasing too much ammunition.\n \n 22 Banning or strict licensing of all reloading components: Ammunition\n \n regulation laws can be regularly passed by home loaders, creating an\n \n underground cottage industry of ammo manufacture. Possession or purchase of\n \n reloading materials and machines should be restricted and those who wish to\n \n use specially loaded ammunition can go to a federally licensed \"reloader\".\n \n 23 National registration of ammunition or ammo buyers.\n \n 24 Requirement of a special storage safe for ammunition and licensing:\n \n Like the storage safe for guns, there should be a national requirement for\n \n special safes to store ammo. Those safes should be tamperproof and\n \n fireproof and be registered themselves so that on the spot inspections can\n \n be held. Again, the costs for these inspections can be absorbed by the\n \n license fees.\n \n \n GUN RANGES\n \n \n 25 Restricting gun ranges to counties with populations of less than 200,000.\n \n 26 Special licensing of ranges: Those ranges that conform to the previous\n \n requirement should get special licensing above and beyond that which is\n \n required now. Additional, each existing or new shooting range must get in\n \n writing the permissions of all property owners within a radius of seven\n \n miles.\n \n 27 Special range tax to visitors: Additional revenue can be a surtax on\n \n ranges, requiring the collection of a minimum of $85 per visit per person.\n \n This can be in addition to required membership fees, upon which the state\n \n and local governments get a sizable portion, to help defray the immense\n \n cost of gun violence.\n \n 28 Waiting period for rentals on pistol ranges: It has been suggested in\n \n the past that felons can acquire pistols and other automatic weapons\n \n without a background check by renting a gun on a target range. Deranged\n \n individuals are basically being given a license to \"practice hunting\n \n humans\" at these so-called \"sporting rages.\" We think that a national\n \n waiting period for gun rentals is yet another idea whose time has come.\n \n \n ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE GUN VIOLENCE\n \n \n 29 Banning gun shows: Illegal transfers and the sales of assault weapons\n \n and submachine guns are common event at these so called gun shows. A huge\n \n dent can be made in the illegal trafficking of weapons by banning these\n \n shows altogether.\n \n 30 Banning of military reenactments: The questionable \"historical\" value\n \n of these events has escaped public scrutiny for too long. Many of these\n \n so-called historical events are a mere excuse for gun nuts to blast the\n \n countryside with automatic weapons. What is to keep them from loading live\n \n bullets and having those stray bullets kill innocent children? What lives\n \n in the future will be lost due to this paramilitary training going on right\n \n under our noses? We propose the prohibition of survivalist/paramilitary,\n \n World War I and World War II and Civil War reenactments on federal land and\n \n hope to encourage the states to prohibit them from state and county lands\n \n as well.\n \n 31 Making unlawful the assembly of more than four armed individuals who\n \n are not peace officers of military.\n \n 32 Begin to curb hunting on all public lands: Blood sports are an\n \n anathema to a civilized society; however, it has been a political reality\n \n that the hunters and their ilk have too strong of a stranglehold on\n \n Congress. We feel that the impending defeat of high-tech assault \"killing\n \n machines\" will open the door to other restrictions. With the diminishing\n \n number of hunter, we feel that perhaps in five years we can open up much\n \n more of our country to campers and hikers and eliminate the threat to\n \n families out camping, by looking at much more restrictions as to what\n \n parcels of land will allow hunting. This will not infringe on sportsmen's\n \n right to hunt on private land.\n \n 33 Making gun owners records and photos a matter of public record.\n \n 34 Random police checks for weapons ( like sobriety check points) The\n \n political climate can become right to initiate these random vehicle stop\n \n and checks at all levels and in all types of neighborhoods. If we continue\n \n to maintain the pressure, we can make this a reality.\n \n \n THE NEXT 15 YEARS\n \n \n With all that is going on, who knows what is possible in the next 15 years?\n \n Here are some ideas to consider for the long term:\n \n \n .Banning of military accouterments\n \n .Stricter guidelines for violence in television and the movies\n \n .The total elimination of arms from society\n \n .Control of dangerous literature (bomb-making, machine gun conversions etc.)\n \n \n The year 1994 sounds the death knell for the bully tactics of the NRA and\n \n the culture of violence in America!\n \n We are pressing on all fronts, and much of this can become reality sooner\n \n than we expect. With the loss of power and clout of the NRA and their\n \n various smaller crony organizations crumbling to dust, we can eliminate a\n \n 200-year old license to murder into history and enter the 21st century a\n \n safer place for our children and our children's children. \n",

   "Now lets add one more wrench into the Anti-gun works! When the American people read, 90% of weapons come from the U.S. they are led to think, bought in an American gun store. \n \n Something even Sinjin apparently believes as well.\n \n \nHow many U.S. prosecutions will result from even the 17%? \n Will that be dealers or \"straw purchasers\"?\n\n However, doing some research, I found this April 19, 2005 report that tells how U.S. weapons can end up in Mexico and be things that the Citizen cannot buy in a gun store. Why? Because they came from the U.S. Government, DEA and the CIA.\n \n Military grade weapons. Now how many can be traced back to legally purchased U.S. weapons? \n   Central America: The FARC, the Contras and the Flow of Weapons \n The April 15 seizure of 218 weapons in Honduras has uncovered a major arms- and drug-smuggling network that moves weapons from Central America to Colombian militants by way of Honduras and the Colombian island of San Andres. Although Honduran government officials have hinted that the weapons came from the United States, they more likely originated with former U.S. Cold War allies in Nicaragua and El Salvador.\n \n The weapons, found inside a parked truck on the ranch, included 145 short-barrel M-16 assault rifles, 28 long-barrel M-16s, 26 Soviet-era AK-47 rifles, 11 U.S.-made M-60 machine guns, four FAL 7.62 mm assault rifles of unknown origin, nine grenade launchers for attachment to M-16s, 54 crates of ammunition totaling more than 50,000 rounds, and 374 ammunition clips for M-16 and AK-47 rifles.\n \n Police also seized what official government reports described variously as five \"rocket launchers\" and \"anti-tank rockets,\" though they likely were Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenades. Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez, who said the weapons' serial numbers had been removed, hinted that they could have been smuggled into Honduras from the United States.\n \n These sources also said that the large number of M-16s suggest the original suppliers could have links to former U.S.-supplied forces in the region. Such forces include former members of El Salvador's military and former members of the Contras, the Nicaraguan guerrilla group that sought to topple Nicaragua's Sandinista regime in the 1980s.\n \n Central America's illegal arms market has flourished since the end of the Cold War left the region flooded with tens of thousands of assault rifles, handguns, machine guns, mortars and other weaponry. Many of these weapons have found their way into the hands of maras. However, Colombian militant groups, such as the FARC and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, have been major arms shoppers in the region for years, swapping cocaine and heroin for weapons and ammunition.\n\n America!

Our ultimate goal - total control of handguns in the United States - is going to take time. My estimate is from seven to ten years. The problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns sold in this country. The second problem is to get them all registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition - except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors - totally illegal.\" \n -Pete Shields, Chairman and founder, Handgun Control Inc.,(Source) \"A Reporter At Large: Handguns,\" The New Yorker, July 26, 1976, 57-58\n",

   "\"The Mexican Ambassador to the United States, Auturo Sarukhan, appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico. The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because \"most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.\" That is not true, but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda. \n \n ATFE's Fake Number\n \n We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has made so many contradictory statements on the matter. ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90% of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US. \n \n The problem is that 90% number isn't true. Yet, that hasn't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, of course, Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico's problems. \n Real Weapons Source?\n \n The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now \"clarified\" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. \n \n We can easily understand Mexico's reasons for preferring the 90% number to the more accurate 17%. Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels. Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police. Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from purchases in Eastern Europe. But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government's failure to police its borders, its ports of entry and its military installations. \n \n Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels? \n \n Lax Vehicle Inspection \n \n Certainly, no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance. You can't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona. But for the sake of argument, what if it was true that 30% of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S.? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S.? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections. And could it be that Mexico's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun-smuggling operations? \n \n Why Strange Obama Response? \n \n But what accounts for the Obama administration's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence? Two explanations are possible: It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem. If we can end Mexico's chaos by making changes on this side of the border, that's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage. \n \n The other explanation is more troublesome. Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself. It is obvious that Obama's teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans. The Obama crew's hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months. This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel's maxim: \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" \n \n Mexico needs to face its own demons, beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry. The U.S. can help in many ways, such as enhancing our own border security. But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico. \n \n If we are lucky, this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction. If it is more than that, if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico's problems, then we are lost in a swamp. \"\n\n \n \"As President Calder\u00f3n and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war,\" President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month. He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America. (In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States. And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico's government.) \"We're going to be very focused on this. It's going to be a top priority.\" ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama \"felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a[s] it affects their safety.\"\n \n You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90% figure, Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it. Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they don't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico. \n \n Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either can't or won't get control of their criminals. \n ",

You are not serious are you? If they are purchasing grenades and RPG's could it then be conceivable that they are purchasing full auto weapons from the same suppliers? :) \n \n Lets see. What does it say?\n   Drug cartels' new weaponry means war \n Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned.\n \n Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n \n Traffickers have escalated their arms race, acquiring military-grade weapons, including hand grenades, grenade launchers, armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals.\n \n The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years, in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years. The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar, with grenades and launchers produced by U.S., South Korean, Israeli, Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers. Many had been sold legally to governments, including Mexico's, and then were diverted onto the black market. Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies, authorities and experts say.\n\n But if you are happy putting forth that argument I fully support your right to go for it! emoticon_smile\n \n \nLet's examine this for a second - One one in four weapons are asked to be traced by the Mexican Authority and 10 % of those are found to not be from the U.S. \n \n Starting with 1,000 guns, knowing that 1 in 4 guns are being traced, that's 250 guns. 10% of those 250 are not from the US? That means 225 guns are from the US, and 750 guns are not being traced at all. We don't know how many of those 750 guns have come from the US. In other words, 75% of the information is unknown.\n\n   The Myth of 90 Percent: Only a Small Fraction of Guns in Mexico Come From U.S. \n In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n \n So, if not from the U.S., where do they come from? There are a variety of sources:\n \n -- The Black Market. Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar, with fragmentation grenades from South Korea, AK-47s from China, and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain, Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers.\n \n -- Russian crime organizations. Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico.\n \n - South America. During the late 1990s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel, according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress.\n \n -- Asia. According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report, China has provided arms to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico.\n \n -- The Mexican Army. More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years, according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo. Many took their weapons with them, including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium.\n \n -- Guatemala. U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants, stolen cars, guns and drugs, including most of America's cocaine, along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border. On March 27, La Hora, a Guatemalan newspaper, reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border. Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan, a border town.\n\n \n   Mexican police seize anti-aircraft gun \n \n Now if you have any evidence to the contrary.

   "\"The Mexican Ambassador to the United States, Auturo Sarukhan, appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico. The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because \"most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.\" That is not true, but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda. \n \n ATFE's Fake Number\n \n We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has made so many contradictory statements on the matter. ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90% of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US. \n \n The problem is that 90% number isn't true. Yet, that hasn't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, of course, Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexico's problems. \n Real Weapons Source?\n \n The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now \"clarified\" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. \n \n We can easily understand Mexico's reasons for preferring the 90% number to the more accurate 17%. Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels. Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police. Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline, weapons that often originate in Venezuela, Colombia, and Nicaragua, or from purchases in Eastern Europe. But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own government's failure to police its borders, its ports of entry and its military installations. \n \n Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels? \n \n Lax Vehicle Inspection \n \n Certainly, no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance. You can't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona. But for the sake of argument, what if it was true that 30% of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S.? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S.? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections. And could it be that Mexico's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun-smuggling operations? \n \n Why Strange Obama Response? \n \n But what accounts for the Obama administration's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence? Two explanations are possible: It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem. If we can end Mexico's chaos by making changes on this side of the border, that's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage. \n \n The other explanation is more troublesome. Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself. It is obvious that Obama's teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans. The Obama crew's hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months. This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel's maxim: \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" \n \n Mexico needs to face its own demons, beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry. The U.S. can help in many ways, such as enhancing our own border security. But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico. \n \n If we are lucky, this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction. If it is more than that, if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico's problems, then we are lost in a swamp. \"\nIf Obama and his admin.really believes it,or as you say use it for their own agenda(not quote unquote).then maybe we are lost in a swamp.A swamp on the eve of 1861.Oh by the way did anyone mention which corner gun store or gun show(can't forget the gun show now)\n where all those hand grenades were bought?",

   "site with held due to the leftard practice of going for the site rather than debate or discuss the merits of the article.\n \n \"A top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admits that drug cartels have \"gatekeepers\" who control part of the U.S.-Mexico border, and that securing the southwest border to stem the flow of illegal activities is something that ICE is devoting \"time and effort\" thinking about. \n \n \"We are very conscious of the fact that routes into the United States are controlled by criminal syndicates; that those same routes are often used for narcotics, alien smuggling and vice-versa,\" John Morton, assistant secretary for ICE, told CNSNews.com Tuesday. \n \n Morton pointed out that ICE is also aware that criminals watch their every move with the intentions of \"thwarting\" their enforcement efforts. \n \n \"I don't want to get into the hard investigative specifics, but let me just tell you personally, we're spending a lot of time and effort thinking about this,\" he added. \n \n Morton's comments came in response to a question from \"censored\" about whether securing the southwest border would stop the illicit dealings that take place there. \n \n Specifically Morton was asked: \"If gatekeepers hired by drug cartels are controlling part of the border, why don't American authorities mainly focus their efforts on securing the border? Wouldn't that solve the problem of illegal activities?\" \n \n Morton agreed that the problem with the drug \"gatekeepers,\" mentioned in a March 2009 report by the National Drug Intelligence Center, an arm of the Justice Department, is real, and he said ICE plans to collaborate with other agencies on enforcement. \n \n \"I think that part of your question goes to the recognition that this problem along the border is multifaceted and that many of the same people who are involved in the smuggling of guns are also involved in smuggling of narcotics, and of money and of people,\" Morton told \"censored\". \n \n He added: \"That's the whole reason for us to not only just put more agents, put more inspectors along the border, but rather to do it in a way that pulls together the various authorities that each of the agencies have in a coordinated manner so that we can really focus on the full range of problems that even a given case can present.\" {Really shutting down the border, a novel approach!}\n \n Morton's comments came during a telephone news conference June 30 that also included Deputy Attorney General David Ogden and Kenneth Melson, acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n \n The conference call took place after a summit in Albuquerque, N.M., titled \"Violent Crime and Firearms Trafficking,\" where the ATF and ICE signed a memorandum announcing a new joint effort to combat problems of drug smuggling and gun smuggling that affect both sides of the border. \n \n \"This morning, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) took another step forward in our combine efforts towards a more efficient and effective law enforcement approach to the challenges we face from the Mexican cartels,\" Ogden, the number two man at the Justice Department, said. \n \n Ogden said the agreement means that ICE and the Justice Department will share \"critical intelligence\" on investigations. \n \n \"One of the other elements . . . is the creation of an inter-agency working group at the highest level of ATF and ICE that will be working with our respective agents in the field to make sure we continue to coordinate and cooperate out there and to share intelligence and investigative information,\" said Ogden. \n \n Morton said the agreement sends an \"unambiguous and clear message\" to drug cartels and \"should also go out to those individuals who are trafficking illegally in guns.\"\n \n \"We are now working more closely than ever with respect to these investigations and we are going to be more effective, I think, with respect to ferreting out the gun traffickers and prosecuting them with association to the U.S. attorneys,\" he added.\n \n As for when the American people can expect to see results, the ATF's Melson said that currently it is hard to tell, but how success will be measured will depend on the \"investigative techniques\" that are put into place. {Is that police work being mentioned?}\n \n \"The issue of metrics is a very important one and a lot of that will depend on the investigative techniques that we employ. We'll be using a number of metrics -- the number of guns seized, the number of guns that are traced, (and) the number of prosecutions,\" he said.\n \n Melson said that Mexican authorities are submitting an increasing number of guns to U.S. authorities asking them to trace the weapons, and ATF plans to improve its e-Trace gun tracing system. \n \n \"With respect to e-Trace, Mexico submitted 7,500 trace requests to ATF to help determine the origin of those weapons and we expect that with Spanish e-Trace coming out in December of this year . . . those e-Traces will increase,\" said Melson. \n \n Stopping the tide of illegal weapons across the U.S. Mexican broder is a top priority, Ogden said. \n \n \"We are very focused on enforcing the laws on the books against illegal gun trafficking and this agreement is a critical step in doing that as effectively as we possibly can,\" Ogden said. {Oh really, this some thing new. Here we were led to believe new laws were needed?}\n \n A June 18 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on illegal gun trafficking recommended that the DOJ work more closely with DHS in sharing information and duplicating efforts.\n \n However, the panel of DOJ and DHS officials said they were considering joining forces before the GAO released its report. {Someone should have told big O before he started flapping gums for new laws.\"\n \n Melson pointed out the new agreement between ATF an ICE should not indicate that the two agencies have not worked together before, but it should rather shed light on a new approach of how to combat the Mexican drug cartel induced violence. \n \n \"We are not indicating that we have not been partners before, but all over the United States ICE and ATF agents and field officers are working very closely together to combat the flow of guns down south and gun trafficking in the United States in general,\" he said.\"",

   "Mr. Cox's claim is supported by what evidence?\n\n \n you little hunting pecker.\n \n Alberto Islas, a security consultant who advises the Mexican government, says the drug cartels are using the Guatemalan border to move black market weapons. Some are left over from the Central American wars the United States helped fight; others, like the grenades and launchers, are South Korean, Israeli and Spanish. Some were legally supplied to the Mexican government; others were sold by corrupt military officers or officials.\n \n Ed Head, a firearms instructor in Arizona who spent 24 years with the U.S. Border Patrol, recently displayed an array of weapons considered \"assault rifles\" that are similar to those recovered in Mexico, but are unavailable for sale in the U.S.\n \n \"These kinds of guns -- the auto versions of these guns -- they are not coming from El Paso,\" he said. \"They are coming from other sources. They are brought in from Guatemala. They are brought in from places like China. They are being diverted from the military. But you don't get these guns from the U.S.\"\n \n Some guns, he said, \"are legitimately shipped to the government of Mexico, by Colt, for example, in the United States. They are approved by the U.S. government for use by the Mexican military service. The guns end up in Mexico that way -- the fully auto versions -- they are not smuggled in across the river.\"\n \n Many of the fully automatic weapons that have been seized in Mexico cannot be found in the U.S., but they are not uncommon in the Third World.\n \n The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years -- but those grenades and the rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) are unavailable in U.S. gun shops. The ones used in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey in October and a TV station in January were made in South Korea. Almost 70 similar grenades were seized in February in the bottom of a truck entering Mexico from Guatemala.\n \n \"Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semi-automatic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California,\" according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.\n \n In 2007-2008, according to ATF Special Agent William Newell, Mexico submitted 11,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n \n So, if not from the U.S., where do they come from? There are a variety of sources:\n \n But Tom Diaz, senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center, called the \"90 percent\" issue a red herring \n \n Do you find anyone other than the usual suspects claiming otherwise?

   "Federal agents hunt for guns one house at a time | Chronicle | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle\n Federal agents hunt for guns, one house at a time\n By DANE SCHILLER Copyright 2009 Houston Chronicle\n June 30, 2009, 9:36PM\n In front of a run-down shack in north Houston, federal agents step from a government sedan into 102-degree heat and face a critical question: How can the woman living here buy four high-end handguns in one day?\n \n The house is worth $35,000. A screen dangles by a wall-unit air conditioner. Porch swing slats are smashed, the smattering of grass is flattened by cars and burned yellow by sun.\n \n \"I'll do the talking on this one,\" agent Tim Sloan, of South Carolina, told partner Brian Tumiel, of New York. \n \n Success on the front lines of a government blitz on gunrunners supplying Mexican drug cartels with Houston weaponry hinges on logging heavy miles and knocking on countless doors. Dozens of agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - sent here from around the country - are needed to follow what ATF acting director Kenneth Melson described as a \"massive number of investigative leads.\" \n \n All told, Mexican officials in 2008 asked federal agents to trace the origins of more than 7,500 firearms recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. Most of them were traced back to Texas, California and Arizona.\n \n Among other things, the agents are combing neighborhoods and asking people about suspicious purchases as well as seeking explanations as to how their guns ended up used in murders, kidnappings and other crimes in Mexico.\n \n \"Ever turning up the heat on cartels, our law enforcement and military partners in the government of Mexico have been working more closely with the ATF by sharing information and intelligence,\" Melson said Tuesday during a firearms-trafficking summit in New Mexico. \n \n Firearms dealers visited\n The ATF recently dispatched 100 veteran agents to its Houston division, which reaches to the border.\n \n The mission is especially challenging because, officials say, that while Houston is the number one point of origin for weapons traced back to the United States from Mexico, the government can't compile databases on gun owners under federal law.\n \n Agents instead review firearms dealers' records in person.\n \n People who are legally in the United States and have clean criminal records, but are facing economic problems are often recruited by traffickers to buy weapons on their behalf in order to shield themselves from scrutiny.\n \n Knocks at the door of the shack that looked to be the definition of hard times went unanswered.\n \n \"I am out of here,\" Sloan said a few moments later, as a pit bull lazily sauntered from the back yard. \"I don't like pit bulls walking up behind me.\"\n \n Best information source\n On second thought, Sloan switched to Spanish and interviewed a neighbor.\n \n The neighbor said the woman left a month ago after a fight with her husband or boyfriend, who still lived there with what she called \"other degenerates.\"\n \n \"An angry ex-girlfriend or wife is the best person in the world, the greatest source of information,\" Sloan said. \n \n The night before, the duo were in a stakeout where they watched a weapons sale. \n \n They also combined efforts with the Drug Enforcement Administration for an aircraft to stealthily follow traffickers to the border.\n \n On this day, agents weren't wearing raid jackets or combat boots and weren't armed with warrants.\n \n Guns were hidden under civilian shirts.\n \n Another tip took agents on a 30-minute drive from the shack to a sprawling home with a pool in the back and an American flag out front.\n \n It turned out two handguns, of a type drug gangsters prefer, were bought by a pastor for target practice.\n \n Some stories, they say, are hard to believe. \n \n The lamest so far came from a police officer: He said he bought a few military-style rifles, left them in his car and - on the same night - forgot to lock a door. He couldn't explain why he didn't file a police report or why he visited Mexico the day after the alleged theft. \n \n Gee and no mention of any arrests. I wonder why? Could it possibly be a closer watch needs to be on the border? ",

   "KTAR.com - Gun control debate hangs over U.S.-Mexico violence\n Gun control debate hangs over U.S.-Mexico violenceby Associated Press (March 24th, 2009 @ 6:53am) \n Members of Congress may be alarmed by the surge in Mexican drug violence and its potential to spill across the border, but they grow silent when the talk turns to gun control as a solution. \n \n With related kidnappings and killings occurring in the U.S., the Obama administration is likely to shift dozens of enforcement agents and millions of dollars to the fight against Mexican drug cartels. \n \n Yet when Attorney General Eric Holder suggested reinstituting a U.S. ban on the sale of certain semiautomatic weapons, many lawmakers balked. The 1994 ban expired after 10 years. \n ``The Second Amendment Task Force opposes the discussed ban and will fight any attempts that infringe on our Second Amendment rights,'' said Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., a chairman of the group. Six Democrats and six Republicans co-signed his statement. \n \n Mexico has long tried to get the United States to curtail the number of guns, many purchased legally, that wind up south of the border, where gun laws are much stricter. The State Department says firearms obtained in the U.S. account for an estimated 95 percent of Mexico's drug-related killings. \n \n ``If President (Felipe) Calderon's policies to roll back organized crime are to be successful, we need to defang the power of the drug syndicates to inflict damage upon our state, local and police forces,'' Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, said in January. ``The best way we can do that is for a real ratcheting up of the United States' capabilities of shutting down the flow of weapons.'' \n \n That may prove tough to do. \n \n After opposition from the National Rifle Association, 22 Democrats joined Republicans in a Senate vote this month to negate the District of Columbia's tough gun registration requirements and overturn its ban on rapid-fire semiautomatic weapons. More than 80 House Democrats backed a similar measure last year. \n \n The gun lobby has raised more than $20 million for political candidates since the 1990 election cycle, with about 85 percent going to Republicans. That ranks 68th among about 80 industry groups tracked by the OpenSecrets.org campaign finance watchdog. \n \n When border violence comes up in hearings, lawmakers say they don't see a need for new gun laws. \n \n ``I don't think the solution to Mexico's problems is to limit Second Amendment gun rights in this country,'' said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate GOP's election committee. ``What we can do is help our Mexican friends enforce their own laws.'' \n \n Republican Rep. Jeff Flake said he believed a recent hearing on Mexico drug violence was actually a discussion of gun control. \n \n ``Instead of punishing law-abiding Americans with stricter controls, we must continue to punish those who break the law,'' said Flake, of Arizona, where 700 cartel-related kidnappings have occurred over two years. \n \n For his part, Obama has signaled a willingness to tighten restrictions on guns, calling the flow of drug money and guns ``a two-way situation.'' Yet 65 Democrats said in a letter to Holder that they would oppose any attempt by the administration to revive a ban on military-style weapons. (I wonder why?)\n Congress did provide $45 million this year for Project Gunrunner, a federal program aimed at curbing the flow of guns. Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, a Texas Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said he will seek another $30 million over two years for the program and $30 million more to fund efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on gun trafficking. \n \n Tom Diaz, an analyst at the Violence Policy Center, a gun control group, said cartels use military-style weapons such as the Armalite AR-50, a .50-caliber sniper rifle. \n \n He brought one to a recent congressional hearing, with the help of two police officers, and said he found the weapon on the Internet, bought it for $3,200 from a Maryland ``kitchen table'' dealer and had it registered in the District of Columbia, all in about six hours. \n \n Semiautomatic rifles used by the cartels are imported legally into the U.S. as ``sporting'' weapons, a policy that was stopped for years but revived under President George W. Bush. The government could stop importation of those weapons under the 1968 Gun Control Act and thus keep them from winding up in Mexico, Diaz said. \n \n Rep. John Tierney, D-Mass., who chaired a hearing on guns going to Mexico, said he is not seeking widespread gun control but Congress must do something. \n \n ``We don't want to get distracted by the gun industry lobby of the NRA trying to talk about (how) every attempt to bring some sanity to the situation is somehow an attempt to get rid of everybody's Second Amendment rights,'' he said. ``That's a red herring.'' \n \n Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador, said Mexico simply wants existing U.S. gun laws applied. \n \n ``Just on the Arizona and Texas border, there are 12,000 gun shops and countless other gun shows that week in and week out rove around the border area,'' Sarukhan said.",
