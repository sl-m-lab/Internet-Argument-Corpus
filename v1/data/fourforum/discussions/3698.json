   "http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/FJ30Dj01.html\n \n \n The above article gives a strong idea why the current stimulus packages of the Bush admin and by Greenspan have not had the same impact in the US as they did back during the Reagan administration.\n \n The following quote is probably the best short explanation\n \n \nThe act of lending usually stimulates economic activity. It enables the borrower to consume more than he would otherwise, or to invest in productive assets. There are exceptions, to be sure: if the assets in question are not physical but financial ones, the effect is not necessarily stimulative.\n \n\n \n \nWe are now facing the stark reality of a country and its consumers swimming in debt (household liabilities rose 65% faster than nominal GDP between 2000 and 2003).\n \n The job market is stagnant - new jobs created are not enough to support the new entrants into the labor market. The dollar is crumbling against all major and many minor currencies. And we could soon face the prospect of a world going on strike against US dollar debt. Over the 12 months ending August 2004, 33% of net foreign purchases of long-term US securities have come from the official sector - double the 15% share of the prior 12 months and over four times the portion of the 2000-02 period, according to Morgan Stanley. \n \n Private investors are turning their backs on US securities and the buck. The Asian central banks are still net buyers, for political reasons, but there are signs that ball game is in its late innings. \n \n",
