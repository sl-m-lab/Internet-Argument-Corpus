In addition, in 2003, scientists from Rice University after some study found that poly-unsaturated fatty acids as the result of burning charcoals also contributed to the atmosphere pollution in Houston. \n \n Another impact on health is the risk of cancer. Grilling meat from charcoal barbeque grills can potentially produce hazardous carcinogenic compounds, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA). These chemicals are created when fat dripped from meat come into contact with burning charcoal, then they evaporate in form of smoke and get deposited back into charred parts of barbecue meat. The hotter the cooking temperature is and the longer the smoking session lasts, the higher the risk of food poisoning. This phenomenon can actually happen when you broil and pan-fry meat as well. \n Benefits of Charcoal Barbeque Grills - Its Effects on Your Health and Environment\n \n emoticon_xhoho",
