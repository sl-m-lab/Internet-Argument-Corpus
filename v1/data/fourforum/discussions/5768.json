   "Well this article put a smile on my face today:\n \n \nCo-op Bank bars 'anti-gay' Christian group\n \n The Co-operative Bank has asked an evangelical Christian group to close its account because of its anti-gay views.\n \n The ethical bank has given Christian Voice 30 days from June 6 to take its business elsewhere.\n \n Christian Voice, which recently protested about the BBC showing Jerry Springer the Opera, has always been vocal about its opposition to homosexuality.\n \n A Co-operative Bank spokesman said: \"It has come to the bank's attention that Christian Voice is engaged in discriminatory pronouncements, based on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n \n \"This public stance is incompatible with the position of The Co-operative Bank, which publicly supports diversity and dignity, in all its forms, for our staff, customers and other stakeholders.\n \n Stephen Green, national director of Christian Voice, said the group was the victim of religious discrimination. He said: \"The Co-op bank, for all its fine words, is discriminating against us on the grounds of conscience and religion.\"\n\n \n From: http://www.ntlworld.com/partners/itn/business/story597174.php\n \n Off course, Christian Voice had something to say about the matter on their webpage:\n \n http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/Press/press001.html\n \n A bold decision on the part of Co-op Bank, I think they deserve a pat on the back for their action.\n \n I wonder where Christian Voice will go bank now?",

   "Probably somewhere that doesn't disciminate against people based on their religious beliefs.\n\n \n Similar to the way you discriminate against my religious belief of what marriage is? At least that bank isn't advocating taking away the legal rights of anyone who disagrees.\n \n If anyone is going to criticize this bank for discriminating based on people's religious beliefs, they'd better be ready to follow that up with, \"And the Boy Scouts of America as well as any church which disallows homosexual members are both equally bad.\"\n \n I support the right of the Boy Scouts to disallow homosexuals, and I support the right of this to disallow an anti-gay organization from using their facilities. I would change that support only if I felt that either was being denied an equal opportunity; if I thought there were no banks which would accept Christian Voice, for example.\n \n I feel bad about this decision. Neither the Boy Scouts nor the bank should be discriminating like this. But we cannot allow one to discriminate and disallow the other. Both groups deserve the same rights. However I can sympathize much more with the bank. The bank is discriminating against an organization which seek to strip the legal rights of homosexuals, which seeks to harm others. The Boy Scouts are discriminating against people who would harm no one.",

I seriously doubt they ask each invester and/or depositor for their religious affiliations. Now THAT would be religious discimination! \n \n The one's who are \"hysterical\" are this group, not the bank.",

   "Personally, I don't care if a homophobe is christian or not. I would prefer not to do business with them anyway.\n\n \n You are quite correct, but I always find anyone who hides their prejudices behind religion to be particularly offensive.\n \n \nCuriously, though, what do the laws in Britain say about discrimination based on political views (I cannot say religious views, becasue it seems - to me - that the discrimination is based on a political view, rather than towards a particular religion)?\n \n Is that legal?\n\n \n Well according to this page it depends:\n \n \nSince the 2 December 2003 it has been unlawful to discriminate against somebody in the workplace on the grounds of their religious or other belief. Religion or beliefs are defined by the law as meaning any religion, religious belief or similar philosophical belief. This very broad definition means that as well as including all major religions it will also cover much smaller fringe groups and beliefs such as humanism, it may also include pacifism or indeed vegetarianism. It is not likely to cover political opinions unless that political belief extends to a broader perception of the world. So, a member of the Conservative Party would probably not be covered but a member of the Green Party might be.\n\n \n It is legal to actively discriminate against members of certain political groups in the UK, a good example being the National Front. It is now a sackable matter to be a member of the NF and be a serving Police Officer for example.",
