It says that Christ is coming here, to join together the heavens and the Earth in an act of new creation.\"\n \n In the Gospel of John, Jesus himself is quoted as saying, \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\" (John 3:13).....\n \n .....many people have been confused about what happens at death by Jesus' statement to a thief who was being executed next to him.\n \n He explained: \"There is Luke 23, where Jesus says to the good thief on the cross, 'Today you will be with me in paradise.'

   "Why do atheists/agnostics/skeptics always feel that the burden of proof should be placed on the believers? \n \n ( As an aside, I am proud to be a religious nutjob, but I'm the kind that doesn't deal in absolutes, or condemn anybody for not being a religious nutjob like me. If I hadn't had the experiences I did, I wouldn't believe either. Yes, I think it's funny when some of us nutjobs try to prove something by quoting the bible to people that don't believe in the bible.)\n \n So you are absolutely right. There is no empirical way for us to prove life after death. However, if we are right, then God did that on purpose. This life is a test to see of we can live on faith. \n \n *HOWEVER*\n \n I submit that there is no empirical evidence to convince me that there is no life after death. Pesky thing, ain't it? \n \n \nIsn't it a little arrogant to think you know exactly what happens after death?\n\n \n SO: It must be just as arrogant to say that nothing happens after death. That's thinking you know what happens after death. \n \n THEREFORE: Since the proof is non-existent on either side, any guess is technically just as valid as the next. The more I study molecular and quantum physics, the more I am convinced that this is a universe of infinite possibility. In such a universe, believing that we will end up with a Supreme Being in a state of eternal happiness depending on how we lived our life is just as likely that we will end up disappearing into oblivion as our body stops functioning. It's also just as likely that we will end up watching eternal re-reruns of \"I Love Lucy\" from some sort of giant cosmic bubble bath. I'm convinced that it's the one, but I'm fine to agree to disagree.\n \n Speaking personally, I know exactly why I believe I know. I feel that each of us has the ability to communicate with God. He speaks to the heart. After having felt it, I feel that it is very apparent that He exists, and that all of reality as we know it is His handiwork. To me it is clearer than the sun shining in the sky. However, this is a personal thing, and just as I am not the only one to feel the way I do, you are not alone in feeling that this is complete blarney. It is completely understandable to be perplexed at the conviction of us religious nutjobs and our \"magical spider sense\". I am sure that people will begin to rip this to shreds, and please feel free to; but as you tear it apart, I ask you to be respectful. This is very dear to me.\n \n BOTTOM LINE: If you don't feel like trying out the believing thing, or have tried it, and decided against it; that's fine. In that case, the only way to find out if there is life after death is to get there. (Or wait until science finds something about it, which I think is impossible,) If I am wrong, I won't be around to regret believing in an afterlife. If we are right, then come find me when you get there, and I'll explain what's going on. ;) Unless it's the Cosmic Bubble Bath. Then you're on your own. \n \n (Please don't take me seriously on that last comment. Just making jokes. If they aren't funny, just ignore them. I know my jokes are usually lame. My friends tells me that all the time.)",

   "Do you know? \n \n There is your proof you don't know.\n I do know. And that \"proof\" of yours is not empirical. I'm just saying that if you want me to prove I'm right with tangible evidence, then you should be prepared to prove you are right by tangible evidence. Why are believers the only ones that should have to prove something to be allowed to believe it? I have proof enough for me. It's not empirical, and therefore cannot convince you, but I am certain in my position.\n \n Here's what I just posted in response to an atheist on another thread. I know that you are all eager to rip it to shreds and laugh at it, but I'll post it anyhow:\n \n \nQuote:\n \n Quote: I ask why he would not speak to me if he had something to say?\n It is the fact that there is no plausible answer to that question that leads me to the conclusion that he does not (if he exists in the sense being spoken of) communicate to humans.\n There is indeed an answer. And I can almost promise that you have heard it, and just don't like it, therefore you consider it not an answer. Your conclusion is based on a given understanding of the nature of God. We understand the nature and purposes of God differently. If what we believe (and feel that we know,) is true, then God exists, and that purpose of life is a test to see if we can live by faith. This means God will not prove Himself to exist. A belief means that we must first open our minds to the possibility of its reality. Then we experiment with the idea. I submit this as an excellent (and fairly short,) discourse on the subject of experimentation of faith with an open mind: Reference Search: Alma 32:26-40 \n The language used is fairly archaic, but you seem to me intellectual enough that it shouldn't be a problem.\n One must also ask oneself how God may respond. If you are looking for big, shining messages written in the sky, then good luck. This life is based on faith, so it will be something that is possible to disbelieve. A feeling. A strong feeling, but a feeling. If you go with the feeling, you get a stronger reassurance, then stronger still, and so on. \n \n I know, it is very easy to protest, and explain this all away with psychological principles of reinforcement. That's the point. It's all based on faith. If what we believe is true, then if you want to believe it, God reinforces it. If you don't want to, then God does not force you to. \n \n The bottom line is that faith is a choice. \n \n Quote:\n What does \"allowed God to speak to you\" consist of?\n According to me, it would be being willing to change your life, even in the most difficult of ways, based on the answer you get. Asking God if He exists, and sincerely, deeply wanting to know. A casual approach rarely gives results. God is not interested in casual followers. You have to work really hard to open the account before He will make a deposit. It's called a \"leap of faith.\" Sincerely giving yourself the possibility that He exists. Fully opening one's mind AND one's heart to the idea.\n \n Quote:\n Why is it not the healthy conscious state of a human being that God would wish to speak to, he created us right?\n Perhaps a Buddhist meditation belt or some South American trance drugs could help?\n Lol, I wouldn't recommend the drugs... Hey, if you like the belt, why not? But srsly, He does speak to the healthy conscious state, when you put yourself into one by realizing how very little we know. We like to think we're pretty smart, but God will not force faith on people who think they know He doesn't exist. He won't try to pour anything into a cup that you have already filled. You must be willing to relearn what you think you know, and admit to yourself that you might be mistaken. \n \n Quote:\n Trying hard enough consists of telling yourself something so many times that you form the illusion its happening.\n Yup. But what makes you say it's an illusion? Like I said, if we are right, then God will always leave you some other way to explain it; an out that allows you to disbelieve. It seems to me that He gives ten reasons to believe and one not to. It's up to you which way you go.\n \n Yes, it's easy to say, \"Keep telling yourself that fairy tale if it makes you feel better.\" That's funny though, because that's exactly how we believers feel about your position. I think you will agree when I say that it all boils down to faith, and how badly you want to believe in God. (We just have different opinions about what exactly that means. I say it means you must allow God to convince you. You say it means that you must allow you to convince yourself.)\n \n I have no empirical evidence that God exists. God planned it that way. Yet I submit that you have no empirical evidence that He doesn't. When I say that, I mean empirical. Tangible. I am not a sophist. Mere talk will not convince me, just as it will not convince you. All I can really say is that I believe in Him. He has taught me to love all people for the spark of divinity that we all carry as children of God. He has taught me that every one is my brother or sister. He has taught me not to judge, because I am so very imperfect that I would not want to be judged. I don't pretend to be perfect, or remotely close. I am not a very good example of a follower of Christ. I make mistakes like anybody else. I just believe that God's and Christ's teachings make bad men good and good men better. I'm somewhere on the road after \"bad man,\" and trying to make it to \"good man.\" Where I am now, who knows. I just know that I make fewer mistakes than I used to. To you, this is probably all just emotional, deluded babble. Sorry if it comes across that way.\n \n Even if somebody were able to prove to me that it was all untrue, (which, because of the metaphysical nature of the topic is just as impossible as proving it true,) I would still follow it, because living the way I believe now makes me happier, more at peace than I was before. I believe it. Yet I cannot blame you for not believing it. Religion is, and always will be, a personal choice.\n\n \n That's the end of my emotional rambling for the night. Have fun with it! I've given you plenty to tear apart, there. Please at least try to be respectful though. This is really close to my heart.\n \n Bottom line: Believe if you want, don't if you don't. Just understand the that the \"evidence\" which you seem to think is on your side is just as subjective as the \"evidence\" we seem to think is on ours. Actual evidence is impossible.",

UNITED STATES, 143 U. S. 457 (1892) -- US Supreme Court Cases from Justia & Oyez\n \n Oh and thank you for completely missing the point. I was bringing to the front that in the span of a generation we went from a country that felt itself a Christian nation to one that was actively trying to distance itself from religion. Secular humanists were not that prevalent 1890 - 1960's so it's really hard to blame them and it wasn't the pagan hordes giving US Christians the stink eye from overseas, jump in any time you think you might have an answer.\n\n \n I know exactly what you are referring to and am quite well versed on that particular case. \n \n And besides, the POINT is that once the secular humanist activist atheist judges got in control of the Supreme Court, actually back around 1939 not 1960, they started the turn away from established law. Did they ask We The People what we thought? Go back and read my responses to Pandion in the 'Christian Nation Thread', don't take up the dabate with me.\n \n And pappy, please try to avoid flaunting your 'superior intellect' at me with such condescension.

   "That was easy to agree with. \n \n \n \n In the 1830's what few available schoolbooks that existed were so biblically based that using the bible would not be a significant difference.\n \n It isn't the secularists that are the enemy of Christianity. Christianity is it's own worst enemy. In a span of 50 - 70 years Christian activist judges went from declaring this a Christian Nation to the ejection of religion from public schools (1890's - 1960's). I think the Christianity felt and is still feeling the backlash from it's unwillingness to admit errors, the activities of clergy and it's failure to make itself relevant to changes in society. Without issues such as these secular ideology would not have gained the momentum and following it has.\n \n \n \n I don't oppose the idea that the founding fathers were Christian. I encourage it, because to think otherwise dimineshes the fact they recognized the threat to the freedom they fought so hard to achieve could so quickly and easily be lost. \n \n They believed that religion had it's place in America, but it wasn't as the leader. They understood that religion, however well the intention may be, must control and by it's nature suppress that which is contrary to it.\n \n Just from your statement we can see the tip of the iceberg. However you meant it, as with all things it is built upon and evolves.\n \n \"...corrupt it for their secular agenda so we must oppose issues which shouldn't even be up for debate in a rational and sane environment.\"\n \n You forget that secular agenda is what helps to keep your particular version of Christianity available for your enjoyment. Christians seem to take for granted that if this country was run by the church that that church would be Christian. Probably, but maybe not and which denomination. \n \n \n \n I am with you on the sentiment, but a little iffy on the wording.\n\n \n Rather than even bother responding to your off topic and disconnected response to my very clear previous post, let me get to the issue regarding what is commonly referred to as the separation clause. The FACT is that it has been so distorted by the leftists in this past century that its true reference as the ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE has been erased from the lexicon of Constitutional terms. \n \n The reason it was always called the establishment clause is because it means a very specific thing and nothing more in its original intent, and it is very clearly written so that it requires o special interpretation to understand what the founders intended for us in this clause.\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n I would challenge you to explain how the atheists and secularists take this clause and deduce from it the right to take prayer out of schools, to prevent God from being mentioned or referred to in a speech or prayer given at a public function on school property, or imposing policies which disallow the use of the christian bible as a study or reading source in our public schools today? And further more, show how the separation interpretation of the establishment clause doesn't directly and specifically prohibit the free exercise of religion? I can't wait to hear your excuses for this one.\n \n And although you smoothly avoided acknowledging the powerful precedent made by the Congress in the 1830s decision to distribute 10,000 bibles to fill the void in a text book shortage in Public Schools, let me explain the true repercussions of that decision for any truly objective and honest observer. \n \n They proved that by distributing bibles to students in public schools for the purpose of learning history, reading and writing, in no way forced any students to be christian or to adopt christianity as their religion. Here's the relevant point, the so called \"SEPARATION CLAUSE\" as an application of this legal interpretation of the \"ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE\" is completely fictional, and has no basis in reality according to our Constitution in any way. \n \n What you secularists love to ignore is that by invoking this nonexistent separation interpretation of the establishment clause, you in fact deny the majority of americans our right to practice our religion in schools in favor of secular groups which represent every godless and atheistic special interest group and philosophy imaginable, as long as it doesn't refer to the christian God.",

Please provide your source.\n \n I will expand on my brief response that education in the 1830s was just begining with passing of mandatory school attendeance. It wasn't until 1836 that a textbook for the intended purpose of instruction for kids came out. Bibles in school also sparked the riots and clashes with Catholics in Phildelphia because Catholics were not permitted to substitute a bible of their choosing and were denied money to fund private schools. \n \n Government and religion working hand in hand.

   "Comments?\n \n Robert Lanza, M.D.: Do You Only Live Once? Experiments Suggest Life Not One-Time Deal\n \nWe think we die and rot into the ground, and thus must squeeze everything in before it's too late. If life-yours, mine-is a just a one-time deal, then we're as likely to be screwed as pampered. But experiments suggest this view of the world may be wrong.\n \n The results of quantum physics confirm that observations can't be predicted absolutely. Instead, there's a range of possible observations each with a different probability. One mainstream explanation, the \"many-worlds\" interpretation, states that there are an infinite number of universes (the \"multiverse\"). Everything that can possibly happen occurs in some universe. The old mechanical-\"we're just a bunch of atoms\"-view of life loses its grip in these scenarios. \n \n Biocentrism extends this idea, suggesting that life is a flowering and adventure that transcends our ordinary linear way of thinking. Although our individual bodies are destined to self-destruct, the \"me'' feeling is just energy operating in the brain. But this energy doesn't go away at death. One of the surest principles of science is that energy never dies; it can neither be created nor destroyed. When we die, we do so not in the random billiard ball matrix but in the inescapable life matrix. Life has a non-linear dimensionality-it's like a perennial flower that returns to bloom in the multiverse. \n \n A series of landmark experiments show that measurements an observer makes can influence events that have already happened in the past. One experiment (Science 315, 966, 2007) confirmed that flipping a switch could retroactively change a result that had happened before the switch was flipped. Regardless of the choice you, the observer, make, it'll be you who will experience the outcomes-the universes-that will result...\n \n \"Whenever anything in nature seems to us ridiculous, absurd or evil,\" said Spinoza \"it is because we have but a partial knowledge of things.\" \n \n Life has a power that transcends any individual history or universe... \n \n",
