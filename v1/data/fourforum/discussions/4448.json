   "Childish games with bioweapon in Georgian Pankisi\n The Chechen and Arab terrorists find shelter in Georgia. It's a well-known fact, though some still choose to have a blind eye for it. Georgian leaders are just pretending to wipe out terrorists and criminals from Pankisi Gorge while the last in their turn are pretending to leave Georgia. Childish games, these are! The recent Georgian Foreign Ministry denial of any terrorists present in Pankisi fits in the pattern. Btw France has asserted that terrorists in Pankisi are trying to produce biological weapon. That's why I guess the Georgians exploited the French ambassador in their denial statement, which looked more like a justification try. Perhaps the ambassador has got interests of his own in corrupted Georgia. Why not? I am dead sure both Paris and Tbilisi are well aware of the total chaos in Pankisi. Paris would rather tell off its envoy in Georgia and push Saakashvili to some concrete moves against terrorists posing deadly threat to European security. That's how things should stay in Georgia becoming more and more troublesome for Europe.",
