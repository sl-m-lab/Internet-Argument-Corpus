   "All of the responses you have chosen to give are built upon the supposition that your explanation for theistic views are the reality behind them, you have not once ventured out into the ground we might share to try and justify your judgments. Since you take a priori that which I will not concede, I think no ground will be made unless we go backward and center our discussion on your prior argument. Forgive me if this is posted in the wrong thread, but I wanted to maintain a degree of continuity with our previous discourse.\n In your explanation for the existence of theistic views you have not pointed out a causal relationship but a correlation, and stamped onto it one of several possible interpretations. To clarify, you cite the existence of theism throughout history as a result of man, confronted with purposelessness, subconsciously inventing-or being tricked into by nature-the defense mechanism of theism. One alternative to this explanation of the correlation between man's need for meaning and theism is that theistic beliefs are an intentional power structure of early man and that the need we feel for purpose was a result of them, and not the cause. I am glad to find the commonality that we have both rejected that and agreed that the drive for hope is a legitimate need. However, there are still other, more legitimate causal relationships we might derive from this correlation, which is the point I will make shortly.\n I believe we have agreed that purpose is a real need of mankind. For your part your entire argument hinges upon the supposition that man from his early stages felt a deep conviction of the temporality of his life and wanted for it to mean something that would transcend death. Thinkers throughout history have pointed out the power of our drive for purpose; one I would note is Viktor Frankl, who in his \"Man's Search for Meaning\" wrote something to the effect of 'with a sufficient why a man can endure any what'. All of us experience a need for our lives to have significance beyond the concerns of what we eat and where we work and sleep, though some suppress that need rather than seek to satisfy it. Those who feel that need the strongest, Frankl I think would have said, and have in some way satisfied it are those most likely to survive. You and I would both agree to this; it is the whole point.\n But here perhaps our conclusions part ways. We look at the world about us and see that for every need humans have there is an end-it is not always readily available, but it does exist. We need fuel for our bodies, and oxygen, and there is food and air. We need companionship and there are others with whom to share our lives. We require a very specific range of radiation, a certain composition of atmosphere, and here all is supplied-for you by chance, for me by intelligent design. But that really is beside the point. We're still on the same page, we both agree that a form cannot take rise unless there exist the conditions to meet its needs. The human race would not be here in the first place unless all these things were just right. What's more we can hardly take credit for the good earth we have. We may cultivate it, but we did not create it. It would seem that, not only are there ends for all are needs (ends that pre-existed us) but that those ends arose independent of our control. Still we track together, but any further? Here I say, what about this final need which is the subject of our discourse, the need for purpose? Is it any less legitimate than the others? Certainly not, we have already established that it is a real need-some die because they do not have it! But your argument is based on the idea that early man found himself with this need and no solution; there was no stopping death. That doesn't match up with everything we have just said. All our other needs have ends, we would not have been able to come into being were it not so. Is it more likely, then, that by some chance all of our needs except one has been met, or that this need does in fact have an end? I would assert that it is the latter. That is what has the greater probability in the light of all of our life experiences. With warmth and energy, with companionship, nature does not deceive us about these needs, she provides their ends. If she deceived us about them we would die nonetheless. It is entirely inconsistent to think that all our needs except one are met. Far more rational is the assertion that we only have those needs to which there exist ends.\n But you will perhaps modify your position so that we yet remain in agreement. Perhaps you shall say that this too is agreeable to you; there is an end to our need for purpose, only that end is not theism. Theism is an easy answer to that end, one that primitive man was able to discover because they were not yet as sophisticated/enlightened/evolved as us, but we have the truth now. If somehow we have been on the same page until now we must finally part ways and allow our divergent views of history to inform the difference between us. You think theism a simple solution, thus the natural one for man to reach, perhaps because he was crippled by power structures, perhaps he simply was not as wise as contemporary men like yourself. I think that man knows he has the need for meaning and as in all other areas, here also man found the only satisfactory solution-or at least something that shared many of the correct characteristics. There was for man more than just a need for purpose determining what would satisfy in this way, there was a need for a first cause, for a moral law-giver, for telos-there was a need for God. Finding God, perhaps, was the greater difficulty than seeing the need for him. This correlation of human needs and the widespread existence of theism throughout history is, I think, far the stronger of our two interpretations.\n But you cannot agree. Perhaps because your argument has assumed that there is no God; which I hope is no evidence that you have fallaciously made yourself out to be a god and decided you were omnipotent, claiming there is no God. The best you can do is assert that you find it highly unlikely that there is a God, but this is beside the point. It is also quite likely, even necessary, that you will argue against the other needs I find entwined with the need for purpose. That will, in your mind, make this correlation weaker, but I still think it would be more probable than the one you have made.\n As to my assertions on the futility of pleasurable pursuits to satisfy one's need for purpose, I can offer nothing more than my own experiences, and what I find to be the breadth of human experience as well. When I think of what has made my life worthwhile, its not the times I've spent myself upon passing pleasures that come to mind. The great majority would say the same, so I can only conclude that those few, so few, who at their death claimed hedonism was good enough, evidence not the reality of fulfillment but rather those who best deceived themselves away from their need for purpose.\n Your correlation, whereby you elevate yourself above the ignorant masses of past humanity, hinges upon preconceptions about the evolution of man in known history. Saying nothing of origins, it is evolution in known history that informs you-not biological evolution necessarily, but a perceived elevation of yourself that stretches beyond the advances in science and technology. How else can you justify the manner in which you discard the theistic pursuits of all humanity past? You have moved beyond them, you create your own purpose, you're stronger. But history defies you. History is cyclical, because throughout history men remain the same. Are we more sophisticated because of our science, our widespread learning? Then we will take power over one another by more sophisticated means, we will make war more destructive and grow all the more callous to the evil within ourselves. Perhaps the last time this truly came home to us was the second World War and the atrocities therein, less than a century ago. If anyone thinks that just because our technology and our learning has grown more sophisticated and we've evolved beyond that, I should encourage them to wait for the hammer to fall again. We do not require enlightenment, we require redemption...but to say that is pointless in this situation, because faith comes first.\n For myself, and in reply to the demand that I must make my own purpose, I can conceive of no purpose that can come from a man's heart or mind that will have any lasting value. I can think of a few that would be of temporary value, but none of them satisfy the need we have established that man experiences. The need within us far exceeds the ends that we can give. The only satisfactory explanation for that is that we were meant for something bigger, something beyond ourselves and this temporary world we find ourselves in.\n Confronted by the power of our needs and the force of history, your correlations no longer appear legitimate. For theism to be a defense mechanism against futility defies the reality in which we live, where there exist ends for all the needs in our lives. For making our own purpose to be sufficient requires that we devalue that need for meaning within ourselves and make it something as insignificant as the scope of our short lives. The deception of humanity, it would appear, arises when we are confronted by the fact that we are not in control of our own lives and that there is something greater than us. The response is indeed one of denial, denial that leads to false self-actualization and a rebellion against the evidences of the ultimate authority to whom we would feel compelled to give our allegiance.",

   "All of the responses you have chosen to give are built upon the supposition that your explanation for theistic views are the reality behind them, you have not once ventured out into the ground we might share to try and justify your judgments. Since you take a priori that which I will not concede, I think no ground will be made unless we go backward and center our discussion on your prior argument. Forgive me if this is posted in the wrong thread, but I wanted to maintain a degree of continuity with our previous discourse.\n\n OK I'm listening...\n \n \nIn your explanation for the existence of theistic views you have not pointed out a causal relationship but a correlation, and stamped onto it one of several possible interpretations. To clarify, you cite the existence of theism throughout history as a result of man, confronted with purposelessness, subconsciously inventing-or being tricked into by nature-the defense mechanism of theism. One alternative to this explanation of the correlation between man's need for meaning and theism is that theistic beliefs are an intentional power structure of early man and that the need we feel for purpose was a result of them, and not the cause. I am glad to find the commonality that we have both rejected that and agreed that the drive for hope is a legitimate need. However, there are still other, more legitimate causal relationships we might derive from this correlation, which is the point I will make shortly.\n\n I agree a correlation rather than causality is at this stage of the investigation fairer and more precise.\n \n \nI believe we have agreed that purpose is a real need of mankind\n. \n Not so, my position is more about survival and instinct. Divine purpose compliments and rationalizes the supreme tenant of theism - immortality. I suspect ontological purpose is entirely a cultural construct, which logically leads to immortality. \n \n\n For your part your entire argument hinges upon the supposition that man from his early stages felt a deep conviction of the temporality of his life and wanted for it to mean something that would transcend death. \n \n This embellishment of my position exaggerates the determining force of Mankind's need for meaning, while quietly withdrawing from my raw contention of how the consciousness of perishabilty, on its own, operates as a powerful cognitive determinant in Man's apprehension of existence.\n \n \nThinkers throughout history have pointed out the power of our drive for purpose; one I would note is Viktor Frankl, who in his \"Man's Search for Meaning\" wrote something to the effect of 'with a sufficient why a man can endure any what'. All of us experience a need for our lives to have significance beyond the concerns of what we eat and where we work and sleep, though some suppress that need rather than seek to satisfy it. Those who feel that need the strongest, Frankl I think would have said, and have in some way satisfied it are those most likely to survive. You and I would both agree to this; it is the whole point\n.\n That is divine and also secular purpose. Either one can function independent of the other.\n \n \nBut here perhaps our conclusions part ways. We look at the world about us and see that for every need humans have there is an end-it is not always readily available, but it does exist. We need fuel for our bodies, and oxygen, and there is food and air. We need companionship and there are others with whom to share our lives. We require a very specific range of radiation, a certain composition of atmosphere, and here all is supplied-for you by chance, for me by intelligent design. But that really is beside the point. We're still on the same page, we both agree that a form cannot take rise unless there exist the conditions to meet its needs. The human race would not be here in the first place unless all these things were just right. What's more we can hardly take credit for the good earth we have. \n \n Yes.\n \n \nWe may cultivate it, but we did not create it. It would seem that, not only are there ends for all are needs (ends that pre-existed us) but that those ends arose independent of our control. \n \n We are in fact beholden to Nature.\n \n \nStill we track together, but any further? Here I say, what about this final need which is the subject of our discourse, the need for purpose? \n \n Again, I understand the desire for purpose as an 'artificial' construct - manufactured by Man from his comprehension of his biological limits. If Man was now immortal, would he equally crave purpose? Would not his immortality become that purpose?\n \n \nIs it any less legitimate than the others? Certainly not, we have already established that it is a real need-some die because they do not have it! But your argument is based on the idea that early man found himself with this need and no solution; there was no stopping death. That doesn't match up with everything we have just said. All our other needs have ends, we would not have been able to come into being were it not so. Is it more likely, then, that by some chance all of our needs except one has been met, or that this need does in fact have an end? \n \n This need for purpose, although more psychological driven in contrast to the compulsive biology of hunger, is being met. Spiritual practice effectively fulfills this craving for purpose - it is the end in itself. Ontological despair creates a real psychological need, enter spirituality.\n \n \nI would assert that it is the latter. That is what has the greater probability in the light of all of our life experiences. With warmth and energy, with companionship, nature does not deceive us about these needs, she provides their ends. If she deceived us about them we would die nonetheless. It is entirely inconsistent to think that all our needs except one are met. Far more rational is the assertion that we only have those needs to which there exist ends.\n\n It is abundantly \"rational\" that Nature endowed Man with the required intelligence to empower him with the mental ability to devise the cognitive comforters of religion.\n \n \nBut you will perhaps modify your position so that we yet remain in agreement. Perhaps you shall say that this too is agreeable to you; there is an end to our need for purpose, only that end is not theism. Theism is an easy answer to that end, one that primitive man was able to discover because they were not yet as sophisticated/enlightened/evolved as us, but we have the truth now. If somehow we have been on the same page until now we must finally part ways and allow our divergent views of history to inform the difference between us. You think theism a simple solution, thus the natural one for man to reach,perhaps because he was crippled by power structures, perhaps he simply was not as wise as contemporary men like yourself. \n \n \"...as wise as contemporary men like yourself.\" I am known by many adjectives, but \"wise\" is NOT one of them. Thanks anyway.\n \n \nI think that man knows he has the need for meaning and as in all other areas, here also man found the only satisfactory solution-or at least something that shared many of the correct characteristics. There was for man more than just a need for purpose determining what would satisfy in this way, there was a need for a first cause, for a moral law-giver, for telos-there was a need for God. Finding God, perhaps, was the greater difficulty than seeing the need for him. This correlation of human needs and the widespread existence of theism throughout history is, I think, far the stronger of our two interpretations.\n\n My rhetorical reply to this is: Can absolute nihility (mortality) and god co-exist? Surely the god concept is manifestly contingent on human perishabilty.\n \n \nBut you cannot agree. Perhaps because your argument has assumed that there is no God; which I hope is no evidence that you have fallaciously made yourself out to be a god and decided you were omnipotent, claiming there is no God. \n \n Me an \"omnipotent god\" - sounds exquisitely Nietzschean. I have no agenda to deconstruct god concepts or to reinvent Nietzsche's 'superman' complex. My 'grievance' lies with the cultural power engendered by the consciousness of mortality. Deity and messianic concepts are, for me, subsidiary components of the discourse.\n \n \nThe best you can do is assert that you find it highly unlikely that there is a God, but this is beside the point.\n\n \n A more accurate interpration of my \"assertion\" would be mortal Man demands immortal god.\n \n \nIt is also quite likely, even necessary, that you will argue against the other needs I find entwined with the need for purpose. That will, in your mind, make this correlation weaker, but I still think it would be more probable than the one you have made. As to my assertions on the futility of pleasurable pursuits to satisfy one's need for purpose, I can offer nothing more than my own experiences, and what I find to be the breadth of human experience as well. When I think of what has made my life worthwhile, its not the times I've spent myself upon passing pleasures that come to mind. The great majority would say the same, so I can only conclude that those few, so few, who at their death claimed hedonism was good enough, evidence not the reality of fulfillment but rather those who best deceived themselves away from their need for purpose.\n\n Earth is populated with 6 billion 'souls', many of whom neither subscribe to your and my choice of religion and lifestyle. This blinding diversity of faith and culture is impossible to ignore, and at once points to the relativity, spatiality and evolutionism of morality and spirituality. \n \n \nYour correlation, whereby you elevate yourself above the ignorant masses of past humanity\n\n The truth be known I regard myself as an outstanding member of the ignorant masses.\n \n \nhinges upon preconceptions about the evolution of man in known history. Saying nothing of origins, it is evolution in known history that informs you-not biological evolution necessarily, but a perceived elevation of yourself that stretches beyond the advances in science and technology.\n\n I accord with this assessment, my position necessarily presents sweeping generalizations, although this academic defect was declared in the penultimate paragraph.\n \n \nHow else can you justify the manner in which you discard the theistic pursuits of all humanity past?\n\n I want to define these \"theistic pursuits\" more than I want to \"discard\" them. Spiritual faith is a supreme mechanism in sustaining Mankind - it naturally has its place, it is the glue that binds us to Nature and to a lesser extent to each other. \n \n \nYou have moved beyond them, you create your own purpose, you're stronger. But history defies you. History is cyclical, because throughout history men remain the same. \n \n More or less.\n \n \nAre we more sophisticated because of our science, our widespread learning? Then we will take power over one another by more sophisticated means, we will make war more destructive and grow all the more callous to the evil within ourselves. Perhaps the last time this truly came home to us was the second World War and the atrocities therein, less than a century ago. If anyone thinks that just because our technology and our learning has grown more sophisticated and we've evolved beyond that, I should encourage them to wait for the hammer to fall again. We do not require enlightenment, we require redemption...but to say that is pointless in this situation, because faith comes first.\n\n Progressive positive evolution is a relative concept, a view which I dismiss because it immediately implies the existence of a secular means to a moral end. So the Luddite spiel on technology is unwarranted. I have no scientific background or agenda, including one charged with morality.\n \n \nFor myself, and in reply to the demand that I must make my own purpose, I can conceive of no purpose that can come from a man's heart or mind that will have any lasting value. I can think of a few that would be of temporary value, but none of them satisfy the need we have established that man experiences. The need within us far exceeds the ends that we can give. The only satisfactory explanation for that is that we were meant for something bigger, something beyond ourselves and this temporary world we find ourselves in.\n\n Compulsively I feel the same, but then I seek to dispel these debilitating primal sentiments by staring into the horizon of a possible utter nihilism, and ponder a world purged of the ontological neurosis that chains it to unreason.\n \n \nConfronted by the power of our needs and the force of history, your correlations no longer appear legitimate. For theism to be a defense mechanism against futility defies the reality in which we live, where there exist ends for all the needs in our lives. \n \n Once again I don't deny the superb success achieved by religious faith in meeting the instinctually engendered need for ontological purpose.\n \n \nFor making our own purpose to be sufficient requires that we devalue that need for meaning within ourselves and make it something as insignificant as the scope of our short lives. The deception of humanity, it would appear, arises when we are confronted by the fact that we are not in control of our own lives and that there is something greater than us. The response is indeed one of denial, denial that leads to false self-actualization and a rebellion against the evidences of the ultimate authority to whom we would feel compelled to give our allegiance.\n\n Insignificance, futility and nihility are ontological themes that are difficult if not impossible to reconcile with. This stalemate is more understood, when it is remembered that Mankind has not and cannot know a state of nothingness - it is an extremely alien and revolting concept. I respect your particular faith and thank you for the time you have taken to post this thread.\n \n If you wish to rebut, could you do so in the original topic post to avoid confusion?",

   "Such purpose is ultimately without any substance. Perhaps it is a flaw in my personality, I don't love showing other people how I'm right and they're wrong so much that I could take it as the driving force behind my continued existence. \n\n \n Yet it's all related to your other posts. What greater substance is there than you, your actions, and the actions of others? Your life is more meaningful if I tell you what to do, rather than you getting to decide? I don't believe you mean that!\n \n I also disagree with your driving force.\n \n A car is speeding towards your 6 year old child.\n \n \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!!\", you yell at your son, knowing the driver of the car will never see him in time and surely kill him.\n \n Now, your moral dillema is:\n Do you want your son to agree that you're right, that he should move, or shall he agree with your notion that being right or wrong, or even defining it, is meaningless to you?\n \n Ask me. I will not hesitate to save my son and to demand that he agree that I am right. I would consider it a failure as a father if he thought perhaps I was lying, or worse, that he thought reality had pink flying bunnies and other such nonsense flitting about, waiting to save him. In fact, if I taught him such things, I think I shoud be convicted of child endangerment.\n \n \n What is the truth of reality worth if there is no supernatural, metaphysical grounding in which to base it? The cold, stark, physical truth of the naturalist does him no good, it cannot if he's right, because nothing he does can ultimately have any significance. \n \n \n Your second moral dillema.\n \n Your son sees the speeding car towards him, hears your cries for him to move, but tells you this:\n \"Father, I see a car, I believe it can kill me, but I also believe...\n that a supernatural entity, based on no evidence (since indeed it's a contradiction), will swoop in and save me, AND I BELIEVE THIS BASED NO NO EVIDENCE. Father, you think contradictions are the foundation of truth, you must agree then, that it is true that I should wait here, because indeed I will be saved by a \"supernatural, metaphysical being\", despite there being no reality to suggest otherwise.\n \n I saved my son again, and watched in horror as you let your son die. And you still think your notion of good/bad, right/wrong, truth/false, realtiy/fantasy, is a good one? You want concrete examples, you have them.\n \n \n If I saw the world as you do I think that I should either live a life of unshakable anxiety, dreading ever my impending annihilation, or commit suicide, confronted with the pointlessness of it all.\n\n \n Then you admit you are a slave to your fear. Recognizing it is the first step. Overcoming it is your choice. Well, fortunately for the weak of will, there are those in your species who face the fear, and overcome it, and achieve great things that help all of our species, without asking for thanks. It's on their broken backs that you declare it's OK for you to be paralyzed by your fear. Time enough for paralyzing fear when your dead, start living, fear is a pre-requisite of life, just don't be ruled by it, if you have the will. While you are anxious about dying, a cop is stopping someone on a routine traffic violation, he's got it in the back of his head that he needs to be careful, but he proceeds forward, unshaken by the fear that speaks to him, the fear he NEEDS, and WANTS, since it sharpens his actions, and decisions. Is he consumed by it? No.\n \n Would you fight for your freedom? For your life? Would you be fearful and paralyzed or would you grab your life by the reigns and take it where you will? Which kind of man are you? Would you perhaps let the man of action save you, then turn around and tell him he leads a meaningless life, and will be damned to hell, and that his choices are empty? Or will you thank him, and learn from him?\n \n \n words like purpose and hope and resolution and have anything meaningful invested in them, and those few brief sentences you gave don't constitute the justification I need in order to understand you.\n\n \n These words ONLY have meaning through freedom of choice, and with eyes focused on reality.\n \n HOPE! The human desire for something they view as good, to come to pass.\n When faced with the unknown, we have three choices (and the stages in between). Despair, hope, or don't think about it.\n \n I choose, I choose hope. That's right, it's a choice, and given the choice I live with my decision to look for the good, rather than the bad, in what I see.\n \n RESOLUTION!\n Resolution implies an end, no change. Who wants RESOLUTION, when we are alive! You aren't dead man, time enough for a resolution to your life when you're gone, for now, you are experiencing reality, no doubt emotions and observing events, and having thoughts, ever changing. Embrace your life, and don't keep worrying about the resolution of all those decisions (your inevitable death). At least don't let it consume you.\n \n Resolution is obtained by agreeing on logic, first. Without it you cannot have reasoned resolution, since you couldn't define it in the first place. With logic and obsevation, you can resolve most things. The ones you can't, you can either make up answers, or admit you don't yet know the answer. Finality with regards to knowledge is the ideal, but rationally it remains a goal, not an achievment. I don't care so much about resolution, only the striving for it.\n \n Your son sees the car speeding his way. \n You want absolute resolution to the dillema \"Does he need to move\".\n well, you cannot know the future, so it cannot be resolved, so you say nothing.\n \n Do you really rely in resolution, or other such useless absolutes, or do you rely on something a little more...human.
