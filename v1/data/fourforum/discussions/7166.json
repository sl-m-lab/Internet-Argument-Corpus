   "\"Ukraine can stop deliveries of Russian gas this winter,\" Ukrainian president said lately. I think it's a good lesson for all of us what's happening now in Ukraine. We've been criticizing Schroeder for his decision to become the head of the Russian Gazprom. Still it's the German ex-chancellor, a wise and far-seeing politician, who has foreseen the troubles EU could face putting stakes at such unreliable partners as Poland or Ukraine. \n If president Yuschenko was a democrat and a man of honor he would have never walked away from the obligations stipulated in the gas supply contract and would have never initiated confrontation with Russia which leads nowhere. \n It's obvious for Yuschenko he has no stakes left on the eve of the parliamentary elections. Since his coming to power he has made one blunder after another. His policy has brought the country on the verge of bankruptcy. \n So Yuschenko is aware that he will face impeachment as soon as the new parliament is elected. So the only way for him to stay in power is to split the country by this artificial confrontation with Moscow even at the cost of the tragedy of his own people. Even if the size of his princedom in the result of the split is three times less than it was. He just wants to stay in power and be a prince. His stance endangers European energetic security.\n I suppose the only way for Europe to soften such blows in future or even stave them off is to trust and rely more on predictable Russia which can guaranty our common energetic security. It's my personal conviction EU should support Moscow in its intention to get control over Ukrainian national gas transport system. It's only then we'll be sure we're on the safe side.",
