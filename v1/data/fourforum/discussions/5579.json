   "This article from todays English edition of Times caught my attention: \n \n Anti-rape device must be banned, say women\n From Jonathan Clayton in Johannesburg\n FURIOUS South African women have called for a controversial new anti-rape device, dubbed a \"rat trap\", to be banned by the Government.\n \n The tampon-like device, invented by a woman, supposedly protects women from rapists by cutting into a man's penis.\n \n It has sparked an empassioned debate over the high number of rapes committed each day in the country and the authorities' apparent failure to tackle the issue.\n \n Activists are outraged and want to stop it going on sale alongside tampons in chemists and supermarkets next month.\n \n Charlene Smith, a leading anti-rape campaigner, said: \"This is a medieval instrument, based on male-hating notions and fundamentally misunderstands the nature of rape and violence against women in this society. It is vengeful, horrible, and disgusting. The woman who invented this needs help.\"\n \n The device, which Sonette Ehlers, its inventor, has patented, is worn like a tampon but is hollow. In the event of a rape, she said that it would fold around the rapist's penis and attach itself with microscopic hooks. It is impossible to remove the clamped device without medical intervention.\n \n \"We have to do something to protect ourselves. While this will not prevent rape, it will help identify attackers and secure convictions,\" Ms Ehlers told the Johannesburg Star.\n \n Women's groups disputed her claims, which have reopened a debate over violence against women in South Africa. The country has been called the rape capital of the world. Lisa Vetten, of the Centre of Violence and Reconciliation, said: \"This is like going back to the days when women were forced to wear chastity belts. It is a terrifying thought that women are being made to adapt to rape.\"\n \n The South African Law Commission recently estimated that 1.69 million women a year were raped in the country but that only 52,000 cases a year are reported. Other estimates put the rate even higher.\n \n Ms Smith said: \"More than 40 per cent of those raped are children and nationally more than 65 per cent are gang rapes. Whether this translates as a woman raped every 26 seconds or more is irrelevant. It is far too many and not enough is being done to tackle it. This is not a male-only problem, it is a societal problem.\"\n \n The activist's views were echoed by Jenny Crwys- William, the host of a popular radio talk show, who described the device as a \"profoundly disturbing\" development that underlined how society was in danger of accepting rape as a reality of everyday life. \"We need more police and more sensitive police responses to rape. When more rapists go behind bars, rape rates will go down,\" she told listeners.\n \n Many callers criticised the Government for a \"head in the sand\" approach similar to its well-known reluctance to accept the gravity of the HIV/Aids epidemic in the country.\n \n \"This will increase the danger to women, who are already in great danger during a rape. The Government must not allow this to go on sale,\" one rape victim, who was stabbed twice during an attack, said. \n \n What are your thoughts on this?",

   "Very, very good advice above.\n \n Being aware of your surroundings and what is really going on is the number one most important self-defense technique without a doubt. And that applies not only to rape but to most street crime. There is a reason drunks are a favorite target of street thugs, they are unaware.\n \n I have a bit of a problem with the submission thing, but I am a man. I've twice in my life been in the position of being \"strongarmed\" by street punks. I made it clear I wasn't handing over one damn penny and it worked for me. One incident ended up with two shitbag wannabe gangbangers walking away yelling back threats, the other ended in a fight in a grocery store parking lot and I was threatened with arrest by the police for defending myself to well.\n \n However, especially for women, I am a firm believer in the \"walk softly and carry a big stick\" principle. \"I'd rather be judged by twelve, then be carried by six\" is another personnal belief.",

   "Anybody else have ideas? This might make for an interesting thread. Tips on staying safe. Any cops out there?\n\n \n You've pretty much covered it.\n \n A few things I would add - \n \n 1 - Trust your instincts. If your sisters new boyfriend is giving you a bad 'vibe', try not to be alone in the room with him. Your instincts are subconscious conclusions reached by your mind based off little things your conscious mind may not have noticed. They are not always right, but not are they always wrong. Better safe than sorry.\n \n 2 - Situational awareness. Always be aware of your situation. At all times. Know where you are, how to escape in an emergency, who is with you, where they are, the best way to get back to your car, and so on. Try and be alert at all times. Don't just walk around with your head down thinking about life.\n \n 3 - Set triggers and responses. A lot of good martial artists get brought down in the street because they let their assailant get too close. A street fighter will sidle up to them, not being directly aggressive, until he is close enough to pounce. When talking about personal safety, it is important to set personal triggers and responses. For example:\n \n Trigger - You think you are being followed.\n Response - Head towards a police station if nearby, or a brightly lit area with lots of people (mall, restaurant, etc).\n \n 4 - If you are going to use a weapon, make sure you have trained in its use. OC sprays, tasers, telescopic batons, a cake of soap in a sock, you need to be confident and capable with your chosen weapon. And you need to make sure you have the right type of weapon. Tasers work by firing needles into the targets flesh, and transmitting heaps of electricity to them. A thick coat will prevet this, so carrying a taser in a cold winter climate probably isn't smart. An OC 'spray' will disipate quickly outdoors, possibly blowing back into your own eyes. A 'stream' will work much better.\n \n 5 - Self defense. The most important things they will teach you in self defense classes is to be mentally aware of your surroundings, and how to identify and avoid dangerous situations. You will probably learn a lot of ground based stuff as well. This will result in some very erotic positioning between students, and some may be uncomfortable with this, especially as some women who seek out SD training are already victims. The most effective stuff you learn will be on the ground though, so be prepared for it.",

When it comes to your safety - feel to bring out the inner b*tch.\n \n 3 - Cars. Check your car - get in and go - especially in ramps. Don't sit there and balance your check book, etc.\n \n 4 - If the assailant wants your stuff - hand it over, if they want to get you alone - raise hell.\n \n 5 - Groups are good. Buddy up. \n \n 6 - Noisemakers. Whistles and portable alarms on your key chain (my dad gave me one when I was a teenager). \n \n 7 - Be alert to what and who is around you.\n \n hmmmmm\n \n Anybody else have ideas?

   "Nurglitch, you must have glossed over the consequences portion of VOR's post. If you can explain how a dead man (or woman) can continue to sexually assault the public, I'd love to hear it.\n I did that on purpose, because I wanted see VoR explain that a rapist who has been executed cannot rape again.\nThe person that commits the rape and is executed will never do it again......You can take that to the bank........\n And VoR has provided the skeleton of an explanation, from which we can reasonably infer that VoR thinks that execution will prevent recidivism among rapists.\n \n Now, if we prevent recidivism in all rapists by employing execution, then it seems that we have prevented much rape. By executing rapists, however, we have only prevented recidivist rape. This obviously does not prevent all rape, as a rapist must commit a rape before we may execute them for rape and thus prevent them from raping again.\n \n Me, I'm all in favour of putting down incorrigible rapists. However, once we have eliminated recidivism, we are still left with all those first-time rapes (assuming that we manage to catch all rapist before they attack again). Executing rapists does not prevent rape in the first place, and merely prevents recidivism.\n \n I suppose you could say that the threat of execution might prevent rape, but frankly I don't think rapists think they're going to get caught. \n \n So I'm not arguing that executing convicted rapists doesn't help prevent rape. I think it obviously does, and does so effectively enough that we can easily justify killing a number of innocent people along the way equal to the margin of error. \n \n I am arguing, however, that this is a band-aid solution, and we need to offer solutions that prevent rape in the first place.",

Before the law, armed robberies had fallen by 50% from 1993 to 1997, but as soon as handguns were banned the robbery rate shot back up, almost back to their 1993 levels. \n \n The 2000 International Crime Victimization Survey, the last survey done, shows the violent-crime rate in England and Wales was twice the rate in the U.S. When the new survey for 2004 comes out, that gap will undoubtedly have widened even further as crimes reported to British police have since soared by 35%, while declining 6% in the U.S. \n .......\n Britain is not alone in its experience with banning guns. Australia has also seen its violent crime rates soar to rates similar to Britain's after its 1996 Port Arthur gun control measures. Violent crime rates averaged 32% higher in the six years after the law was passed (from 1997 to 2002) than they did the year before the law in 1995. The same comparisons for armed robbery rates showed increases of 74%. \n \n During the 1990s, just as Britain and Australia were more severely regulating guns, the U.S. was greatly liberalizing individuals' abilities to carry guns. Thirty-seven of the 50 states now have so-called right-to-carry laws that let law-abiding adults carry concealed handguns once they pass a criminal background check and pay a fee. Only half the states require some training, usually around three to five hours' worth. Yet crime has fallen even faster in these states than the national average. Overall, the states in the U.S. that have experienced the fastest growth rates in gun ownership during the 1990s have experienced the biggest drops in murder rates and other violent crimes. \n \n Many things affect crime; the rise of drug-gang violence in Britain is an important part of the story, just as it has long been important in explaining the U.S.'s rates. Drug gangs also help explain one of the many reasons it is so difficult to stop the flow of guns into a country. Drug gangs can't simply call up the police when another gang encroaches on their turf, so they end up essentially setting up their own armies. And just as they can smuggle drugs into the country, they can smuggle in weapons to defend their turf. \n \n Everyone wants to take guns away from criminals. The problem is that if the law-abiding citizens obey the law and the criminals don't, the rules create sitting ducks who cannot defend themselves. This is especially true for those who are physically weaker, women and the elderly. \n \n Mr. Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of \"More Guns, Less Crime\" (University of Chicago Presss, 2000) and \"The Bias Against Guns\" (Regnery 2003). \n \n http://www.tsra.com/Lott112.htm \n",

   "I think it's just an arms race and gets you nowhere.\n \n 1. Using it takes time, money, ernergy and resources.\n Once it's used it will be effective for a short time, but only effective in clamping an offenders organ.\n \n Scenarios that make it less than perfect:\n \n - Rapist gets it attached, OMG you f'ing b***, and kills her, whereas before it would have been a rape without murder. (Replace kill with maim, beat, etc. as well)\n - Useless against multiple rapists.\n \n - Someone forgets to take it out before consensual sex, ouch.\n ==========\n \n Once it's publicized rapsists, being intelligent primates, will wise up and check for the device first, making rape involve one more necessary requirement other than the long list of requirements for comitting a crime in the first place.\n \n Not a good idea. I agree that it's a useless patch to a problem with deep roots.\n \n -Mach",
