This applies in many areas, such as concern for the poor-the whackos in Hollywood are quick to tell us what WE should do for the poor, when in fact they have the means to feed and clothe and perhaps even house every homeless person on the street...do they do it...NO. Therefore, what is actually glaring IS the hypocrisy. Any LIB who espouses concern for the environment and drives a gas guzzler or pollutes in any way is a hypocrite. No need to run through every possible hypocritical actions they could take.

My favorite is the proposed lifting of road building bans in many \"wilderness\" areas in this country. Taxpayers have always footed the bill for the \"prospecting\" of large companies be it lumber or minerals or oil. In many cases private concerns need only lease the land and the government pays to provide access to extract the resources.
