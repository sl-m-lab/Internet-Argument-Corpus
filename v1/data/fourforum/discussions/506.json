You may use a cell phone, you may aviod danger by using smarts, you may rely on combined saftey from neighbors, you may use mace, or you may use a .45?\n \n I use a .45 because a phone call to the cops or a yell for help is too slow. I will always use a weapon of somekind even if you can promise that all felons will be reduced to using pointy sticks.\n \n What do you use?\n \n In my town a 100 lb woman shot and killed an unarmed attacker at a shopping mall. The felon was 6 ft tall and more that 270 lbs. The judge rulled it justified because if the criminal got his hands on her it would have been her death. Does a 100 lb woman use a knife? at arm length with a felon?\n \n I have to add, it is illegal to carry a firearm into a shopping mall. If she did obey the law, she would be dead.",
