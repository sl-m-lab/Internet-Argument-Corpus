   "WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Brady Center today made public its letter questioning the National Rifle Association's \"improper influence\" over Centers for Disease Control (CDC) firearms research. The letter, dated March 1, 2011, was e-mailed and sent via the U.S. postal service to the Honorable Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n \n The letter was prompted by comments from CDC Spokesperson Thomas Skinner, who indicated that researchers financed by CDC are asked to give the CDC a \"heads-up\" when they conduct firearms-related studies. The CDC then, \"as a courtesy,\" informs the National Rifle Association before the studies are published or released to the general public. Skinner's comments were reported by the New York Times in a January 25, 2011 article, \"N.R.A. Stymies Firearms Research.\"\n \n \"If the CDC is allowing the NRA to review its studies, it's a deeply troubling practice,\" said Brady Center President Paul Helmke. \"To have a government agency open itself and its science to the influence of any interest group, particularly one whose policies undermine the safety of our families and communities, is improper, offensive, and unjustifiable. We need science that we can trust.\" \n \n The Brady Center letter pointed out also that actions like these would be directly at odds with the Obama Administration's goal to assure transparency in the use of science to inform public policy. Those aims were announced in the President Obama's March 9, 2009 Memorandum on Scientific Integrity and reinforced in a December 17, 2010 Memorandum on the same subject by John P. Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Holdren, in part, said, \"[s]cience and public trust in science, thrives in an environment that shields scientific data and analysis from inappropriate political influence.\"\n \n In its letter, the Brady Center asked Secretary Sebelius a number of questions, including those regarding the extent of the NRA's special 'courtesy' notice of firearms-related studies, the extent the NRA has influenced CDC decision-making on the nature and content of firearms-related research, and the justification for the practice of giving the NRA such preferential treatment.\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Media\n \n Whats next? Research about lung cancer has to be approved by the tobacco lobby? Airport security regulations have to be approved by al qaida? The insanity never ends.",

Instead of doing its own scholarly work or at least relying on the expert work of Dr. Martin Fackler, the foremost wound ballistic expert in the United States, it unfortunately relied, for political purposes, on unscientific data and even sensationalized newspaper articles, one of which claimed that watermelons fired upon and blasted with \"assault weapons\" are appropriate human tissue simulants to demonstrate wound ballistics! It has been pointed out, correctly, I may add, that if that were the case, an 18\" drop of a watermelon would also be appropriate for the study of head injuries.(7)\n \n Before proceeding further, allow me to clarify some general terms. A theory is a general principle that is proposed as to explain observed facts. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is an assumption that must be defined in advance and then tested before it can subsequently be used as a theory to explain observed facts or natural phenomena. If after a hypothesis is properly tested, it's not supported by objective, scientific observations, it must be rejected. That is why Albert Einstein himself announced, \"no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.\" On the other hand, if experimental data or observations support the hypothesis, the latter should be accepted, at least until the time when another given observation properly rejects it.\n \n In science, a posteriori reasoning (whereby the attainment of knowledge occurs from observations and experience) is preferred over a priori reasoning, which relies on the deduction of knowledge from self-evident propositions, independent of observations or experience.\n \n Above all, scrupulous researchers must avoid post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning, \"after it, therefore because of it\"; they must make sure their conclusions truly follow from their observations and experiments, rather than assume that a conclusion follows simply because a certain independent event preceded it. Take, for instance, the often heard proposition, repeated time and again, without dissent, in the medical literature on the subject of \"guns and violence\" --- namely, that guns in the U.S. are responsible for high rates of suicide. When in reality, the overwhelming available evidence compiled from the discipline of psychiatry is that untreated or poorly managed depression is the real culprit behind high rates of suicide. Moreover, from the social science of criminology, we solve the seeming paradox that countries such as Japan, Hungary, and Scandinavia which boast draconian gun control laws have much higher rates of suicide (2 or 3 times higher) than the U.S. And that is, that in these countries where guns are not available, citizens simply substitute for guns other cultural or universally available methods such as Hara-kiri, drowning in the Blue Danube, suffocation (with poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide), or hanging, and they commit suicide by these methods at higher rates than in the U.S.(8)\n \n Today, sadly, many government researchers who depend on government funds (naturally, extracted from the taxpayers) are frequently placed in a conflict-of-interest situation or position themselves in dubious circumstances in which their credibility (and professional reputations) can be called into question. (I would also say honor, but the term is considered anachronistic and antiquated in many quarters.) Given the nature of research impacting directly on public policy, many of these researchers are veritably pressed to reach preordained conclusions about scientific projects in which government officials and political leaders have a vested political interest or an ideological ax to grind.In these circumstances, particularly when politics and ideology are at stake, we end up not with objective research and the attainment of scientific truth, but with what Dr. Edgar Suter of Doctors for Integrity in Policy Research (DIPR), myself, and others have called politicized, results-oriented research.(9,10,11) This kind of pseudo-science, masquerading as scientific research has adverse and detrimental effects on public policy generally, and science and medicine, in particularly.\n This \"results-oriented research\" has reached a pinnacle of sophistication and preordination with the work carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which has, until very recently, enjoyed a high degree of respect and credibility with both the scientific community and the public, because of its historic record and continuing work in fighting truly epidemiologic and contagious diseases afflicting humanity. The problem today stems from the gun control propaganda coming out of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) branch of the CDC and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).A number of us who have studied this problem --- namely, gun control research promulgated by the CDC/NCIPC and published in the mainstream medical journals including AMA-sponsored journals, have found that conclusions are preordained-that is, data are collected and observations made as to reach desired, foregone, politically-oriented conclusions.\n How this travesty of unscientific, preordained \"research\" has been carried out, published and disseminated in the mainstream medical journals, and how this preordained \"research\" and unscientific information could have (and is having) adverse and detrimental effects on public policy are the subjects of Part II of this essay, \"The Perversion of Science and Medicine --- Soviet Science and Gun Research.\" \n \n \n (snip)\n - Dr. Miguel Faria\n see footnotes:",

   "WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Brady Center today made public its letter questioning the National Rifle Association's \"improper influence\" over Centers for Disease Control (CDC) firearms research. The letter, dated March 1, 2011, was e-mailed and sent via the U.S. postal service to the Honorable Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n \n The letter was prompted by comments from CDC Spokesperson Thomas Skinner, who indicated that researchers financed by CDC are asked to give the CDC a \"heads-up\" when they conduct firearms-related studies. The CDC then, \"as a courtesy,\" informs the National Rifle Association before the studies are published or released to the general public. Skinner's comments were reported by the New York Times in a January 25, 2011 article, \"N.R.A. Stymies Firearms Research.\"\n \n \"If the CDC is allowing the NRA to review its studies, it's a deeply troubling practice,\" said Brady Center President Paul Helmke. \"To have a government agency open itself and its science to the influence of any interest group, particularly one whose policies undermine the safety of our families and communities, is improper, offensive, and unjustifiable. We need science that we can trust.\" \n \n The Brady Center letter pointed out also that actions like these would be directly at odds with the Obama Administration's goal to assure transparency in the use of science to inform public policy. Those aims were announced in the President Obama's March 9, 2009 Memorandum on Scientific Integrity and reinforced in a December 17, 2010 Memorandum on the same subject by John P. Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Holdren, in part, said, \"[s]cience and public trust in science, thrives in an environment that shields scientific data and analysis from inappropriate political influence.\"\n \n In its letter, the Brady Center asked Secretary Sebelius a number of questions, including those regarding the extent of the NRA's special 'courtesy' notice of firearms-related studies, the extent the NRA has influenced CDC decision-making on the nature and content of firearms-related research, and the justification for the practice of giving the NRA such preferential treatment.\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Media\n \n Whats next? Research about lung cancer has to be approved by the tobacco lobby? Airport security regulations have to be approved by al qaida? The insanity never ends.\n\n \n Asking for peer review is certainly appropriate. Seems you just want to put out propaganda and more lies emoticon_xbye",

   "Well this should be a very interesting discussion.\n \n Before we begin arguing over whether or not the National Rifle Association was responsible for cutting the funding of the Center for Disease Control for carrying out gun-related studies we need to keep something in mind. In the Heller case the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment is not only an individual right it's a constitutionally recognized and protected right. And in McDonald they ruled that the Second Amendment right applies to all 50 states and must be considered. That means the Second Amendment protects a fundamental right to be armed for legal purposes. They even ruled that any restriction that would make a gun inaccessible for the purpose of defending oneself is an unconstitutional infringement on that right, meaning trigger locks and storage mandates aren't legally allowed.\n \n Fundamental right status is very important when it comes to any discussion about future prohibition attempts because fundamental rights are protected by the strict scrutiny test. In order for any proposed law to pass the strict scrutiny test it must: be justified by a compelling governmental interest, must be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest, and must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest.\n \n This is all just a brief refresher on the history of the matter so everyone who wants a dissenting opinion must keep it in mind.\n \n We're not interested in shutting down honest and legitimate debate. However we have absolutely no interest in the Center for Disease Control abusing its position and authority to paint a fundamental right in a way to suggest it's a public health threat and must be regulated as such to the point that it's rendered impotent and moot. Such a standard is neither honest nor legitimate and shouldn't be seen as such. It shouldn't even be allowed for possible consideration.\n \n The Center for Disease Control has absolutely no legitimate basis for examining gun-related deaths in a manner to suggest that gun ownership itself poses a threat to public health and well being. Nor do they have any business in making recommendations for mandatory storage rules that would make privately owned guns inaccessible to their legitimate owners when they're needed most.\n \n Regardless of whatever propaganda you choose to believe in there's a vast difference between lawful gun ownership and criminal possession of a firearm. The Center for Disease Control trying to pull a compare and contrast between the two standards and treat them as if they're similar and interchangeable is intellectual dishonesty as its worst. If they truly can't tell the difference between a single mother owning a handgun to protect her children from an abusive ex-husband, and a drug dealer who's been in and out of jails and prisons since he was 14, then they really aren't the type of people who should be carrying out studies regarding legal practices.\n \n Gun ownership isn't a threat to public health. Gun ownership isn't a disease or an epidemic. Gun ownership isn't sinful or something that should be ashamed of. Gun ownership is a constitutionally recognized and protected right and deserves to be treated with respect and recognition.\n \n I've noticed that there's a convenient absence of studies carried out by the Center Disease Control when it comes to other fundamental rights such as the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has long held that a vast array of offensive messages are protected under the First Amendment, ranging from neonazis holding protest marches in Jewish neighborhoods, to the most recent ruling that anti-gay protests may be held at the funerals of dead American soldiers. Such speech is hateful, inflammatory, derogatory and has the potential to spark riots and other acts of violence, it might even lead to the premature death of various individuals due to stress-related illnesses like hypertension and high blood pressure. So why isn't the Center for Disease Control reviewing that fact?",

They testified before the US House to that effect. Faria wanted to defund the NCIPC entirely.[24][25][26][27]\"\n \n You certainly wouldn't know from the name that the \"Association of American Physicians and Surgeons\" is actually a right wing political advocacy group.

It seems to me that you are deliberately and shamelessly trying to muddy the waters.\n\n \n The Second Amendment does nothing to prohibit the \"research\" that the Center for Disease Control has been trying to conduct. Don't try and confuse the issue here with nonexistent points.\n \n What's being said is that the Second Amendment protects a right recognized as fundamental in nature, and the actions of the Center for Disease Control is nothing more than a thinly disguised plot to try and portray that fundamental right as a public health threat in an attempt to gain ground for it to be legislated more than it already is.\n \n Simply because some people are being feloniously killed with a particular implement isn't sufficient grounds for arguing that fundamental rights need to be more vigorously regulated as one would try and do to a tobacco company or car manufacturer.\n \n You might not like it. You might not agree with it. But the Second Amendment must be given the same respect and recognition that any other right within the Bill of Rights must be treated to. And unless the Center for Disease Control is interested in analyzing the potential health threats linked to freedom of speech, or right to privacy, or right to an attorney, then they really have no business singling out private gun ownership for harassment.",
