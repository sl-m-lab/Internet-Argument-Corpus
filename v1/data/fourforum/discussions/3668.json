   "Quote from your appeal to authority:\n\n Mach, you are embarrassing yourself by continually miss-applying this term. Never have I said \"This is it\", it is however a definition; you deny even this by your following statements.\n The fallacy of an appeal to authority is to appeal to an authority of one subject, to give a statement about another.\n \nKeep' coming, these appeals to authority.\n\n See above. Check your own citation that you made!\n \nNo answers to the questions of what's non-material? Odd, you seem to \"know\" certain things that are \"non-material\". I thought you'd want to support your claims.\n -Mach\n\n It is amazingly dishonest for you to post this. You have a complete lack of the grasp between the difference between 'evidence/opinion presented' and 'evidence/opinion disagreed with'. If someone presents evidence or opinion, and you disagree with it, then you claim that they've presented no evidence/opinion. That is what you are doing here. You are in fact ignoring what is posted and pretending that nothing has been posted; by claiming that no one's answered your question about what's non-material. Close_slave_can and Tastyfish have also responded to your thread. But you just sit in your own world and state that no one has! You invite people to respond, but pay them no courtesy for having done so. Why? Is it because you couch your version of reality on the philosophy of objectivism?\n \n It is pointless then to urge people to present evidence and/or opinion, not because you'll never agree to it, but because you'll state that they've presented NO evidence/opinion & their efforts are wasted.\n \n I wonder really what you are doing here? I get the feeling you've made a number of beliefs, you enter this forum and berate other people's beliefs, and when they present evidence to at least suggest a reasoned debate, you dismiss that too, that no amount of evidence will convince you. In other words you enter this debate, not with the intention of debating, but pronouncing your version of truth, and stating a just-so about other people being wrong.\n \n If you were genuine about debate, you'd at the very least look at your own citation on 'appeal to authority' which oddly by your own misapplication of the term, is therefore an appeal to authority!\n \n (You have shown no intent on dealing with your own quote regarding the unknowable.)\n \n For everyone else actually interested in the subject... the psyche is non-material. Other things that are said to be non-material include 'ideas'.\n For those that believe ideas are material, it must be similar to the notion that the words you read here, exist because of electrons; in the computer. This however doesn't explain how 'meaning' is or could be material. The words can exist for a moment on the computer screen, a collection of electrons and so on, but that is independent of meaning. Meaning itself must therefore be non-material. Thus a symbol might be material; such as a stop-sign, but the meaning contained within it is non-material.\n \n In effect the idea that there's nothing non-material is to open the way for science to be able to (in theory) provide an answer on everything; as many people believe that science can and should deal with the material, and therefore if everything is in the realm of science, science will be the over-arching/all encompassing belief system.\n Some have stated the belief that, just because science doesn't provide an answer now, it might well be able to, one day.

In fact, even after making this false claim of yours, you end your current post with an invitation to post evidence; which has already been done, which you already ignore, and then, as I stated, you just go on calling for people to post evidence.\n \nWho are you appealing to and why?

You can't differentiate between 'evidence presented' and 'evidence disagreed with'. It is quite a fanciful construct you have created. You don't believe in the non-material; therefore you don't believe there is any evidence for it. Yet in a bout of self-deceit you call for evidence of the non-material. You either ignore this, or dismiss it out of hand as being illogical; based on the notion that the non-material doesn't exist. Then you call for people to present evidence, which you ignore, or dismiss out of hand as being illogical; based on the notion the non-material does not exist. Then you call for people to present evidence... and so it goes on, and on and on. The difficulty lies in this maddening false construct of yours; any evidence presented will be treated the same, then you call for more!\n In short you're not here to debate at all. You are here to make a continual series of announcements of what you perceive to be correct, based on your belief that they are correct. No amount of evidence presented can possibly be recognised by you as evidence. It is why, even when you contradict yourself, you don't recognise that as evidence against you; because for you THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. Further you make the irrational claim that any argument made against your a priori is illogical; based on the notion there's no evidence for counter-claim.\n And when you do actually provide other argument, it consists of a repeat of the statement 'it's illogical, it doesn't exist'. Why? Because for you, this just happens to be true.\n Your stuck in a circle of illogic.\n \n I wonder really what you are doing here? I get the feeling you've made a number of beliefs, you enter this forum and berate other people's beliefs, and when they present evidence to at least suggest a reasoned debate, you dismiss that too, that no amount of evidence will convince you. In other words you enter this debate, not with the intention of debating, but pronouncing your version of truth, and stating a just-so about other people being wrong.\n \n \nIs any of this relevant to the specific claim you make? No, of course not. You pontificate, and use rhetoric, and make claims about my motives in a negative tone. In short, you insult me with this latest post. Please try to debate the claims, not the person, their motives, and do try to avoid fallacy as the basis of your claim.\n\n As stated earlier, you insult everyone else by pontificating that any theory counter to yours is not based on evidence, and is illogical. And then oddly, as if lacking any insight into this, you ask people to debate you!\n [quote=Montalban]For everyone else actually interested in the subject... the psyche is non-material. Other things that are said to be non-material include 'ideas'.\n For those that believe ideas are material, it must be similar to the notion that the words you read here, exist because of electrons; in the computer. This however doesn't explain how 'meaning' is or could be material. The words can exist for a moment on the computer screen, a collection of electrons and so on, but that is independent of meaning. Meaning itself must therefore be non-material. Thus a symbol might be material; such as a stop-sign, but the meaning contained within it is non-material.\n \nThen your definition of non-material is \"psyche, meaning, ideas\".\n That reads to me like a list of things that are non-material.\n So, I repeat the question which you have avoided.\n What is the non-material?\n\n I've already answered this. But ho-hum, there you go on asking again.\n [quote=Montalban]In effect the idea that there's nothing non-material is to open the way for science to be able to (in theory) provide an answer on everything; as many people believe that science can and should deal with the material, and therefore if everything is in the realm of science, science will be the over-arching/all encompassing belief system.\n Some have stated the belief that, just because science doesn't provide an answer now, it might well be able to, one day. This is based on a philosophy; which can also be non-material (as are 'values'). Culture is also non-material. \n \nIncorrect. The fact that non-material as you use it is an unknowable, and is meaningless, and is not required, requires you to force others to accept contradictions to make room for your dogmatic beliefs. Which is, irresponsible, and illogical, and in the view of some...the root of all evil.\n\n There you go on making your grandiose statement; based on your 'just-so' and as I stated, you don't believe certain things, so no argument put to you could possibly be in the least bit valid, because for you, it's already invalidated.\n \nNow that you got that out of the way, tell us what \"non-material\" is, and how you know something is, or is not, non-material.\n \n NOTE: I am not asking you to tell us some \"things\" that are non-material, I'm asking what non-material is, the definition:\n \n DEFINE NON-MATERIAL:\n ============================\n \n \n ============================\n ^^^\n Your definition goes here.\n \n -Mach\n\n This is the ultimate spam, you've created. Continually asking for something you believe can never be answered, anyway. No other poster responds so consistantly with such disrespect for other people's ideas; so readily dismissive of them, and yet you seem quite unaware of this.",

   "In principle I agree. And science might one day, perhaps discover that the conscious self is more than the brain. That's not what I'm arguing Occam'sRazor was strongly suggesting in the way the post was worded that we ONLY KNOW about it following studies of the brain.\n And this is not true. Man knew of 'blood' before it was subject of modern science; and sure, blood circulation wasn't known until then, but that's a different thing than stating that man had no knowledge of blood until science.\n And that's what was said about consciousness. \n\n \n You argue first about \"modern\" science. Then switch to the more broad \"science\". Yes, if man knew of blood before you define \"Modern\" times, it was logically not known through \"modern\" science, if your definition is based on time.\n\n Further, it was not based on science.\n \nThen you switch to a general \"science\", and your claim becomes false.\n\n Only if you assume that science reaches into everything that is; which you do. And please note, you've still as yet to prove your version of science by science. It is a philosophy of science that you hold, tinged with scientist and objectivism.\n \"Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful.\"\n http://skepdic.com/scientism.html\n [quote=Mach]Science: such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena. \n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictiona...nary&va=science\n If I were to answer as you do, I'd shout \"Appeal to authority\". Odd that you seem so blissfully unaware that you continually go against your own objections. When presented with any citations that disagree with you, this is what you argue \"Appeal to Authority\" :). However, rather than dwell on your illogical inconsistency when it comes to evidence (you only accept what is already believed true) the mere observation of a phenomena is not science. It is observation. Science includes a system, or method (not necessarily the one method)\n A more precise definition is\n \"The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.\"\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=science\n (See below where your own site says this)\n Otherwise for you every single observation is scientific. St. Peter saw Jesus walk on water. You've now given me the basis to couch my claim in terms of science. I observe a ghost; that's science. I observe a troll, that's science! Mere observation; for you, is science. I observe a non-material, such as 'love', and it's science; it's natural, so it must be real.\n \nMan does not need science to have knowledge. Science IS the knowledge. If man actually had knowledge of blood, then he had science.\n\n That is not true. Mere observation is not science. You guys have been at me about science following 'scientific method'. What testing was conducted? Show me that the observation of blood was done in a scientific manner; it doesn't even matter that the manner is now a discarded method. Do this, and you have a claim to make.\n That is an objectivist construct. Which is why you give the following...\n \nOR\n Science, broadly defined, is the study and explanation of natural phenomena.\n http://www.whatisobjectivism.com/consequences/page4.htm\n If man observed blood, and thus had knowledge of blood, he conducted \"science\".\n Either way, it's consistent, and they are correct. \n -Mach\n\n Read further...\n \"Science, broadly defined, is the study and explanation of natural phenomena. The method of scientific inquiry is based on reason - observation (sense perception), testing and confirmation (sense perception and logic). As such, any correct application of the scientific method is by necessity objective.\"\n (Ibid)\n Your theory therefore actually contradict this site of yours. It'd help you if you read more than a single sentence into your own sources. Note it's not mere observation of natural phenomena, its a study and explanation of the phenomena. If ancient man observed blood, and just covered up a wound, that is not science, even if he observed it. Even if he observed the blood flow stopping.\n \n By the way, how did ancient man observe a consciousness?",

I don't agree with them. You have a problem with any thing you disagree with. For you; it just vanishes. I have said on numerous occasions that you have a problem between the concept of 'theory presented' and 'theory presented that you disagree with' For you, these are absolutely interchangeable. Why?

You make an assumption based on your disbelief.\n \nSo, non-material is non-material.\n Or alternatively\n Non-material is non-substance.\n So, if it's not matter, and not substance, what is it?\n -Mach\n\n You don't like the definition. But you've been given one in my words, and one in the dictionary. Are you going to decease from the fallacy that you demand one? I expect so. It is akin to your argument on 'unknowables', where for you an argument consists of repeating a mantra. Even you own dictionary site defined it, which is to know something about it; it's logical that you can only define what you know something about, even if it's just the definition is all you know. But, you've already got you objectivism blinkers on, and will continue to spam the pages.\n \n To the other readers: A plea for help.\n I am not used to dealing with such irrational argument as I do here.\n When I cite evidence to back up the concept 'unknowable' such as\n \"Chaos theory grounds a post-modern science that is unpredictable, hence unknowable to the degree of precision demanded by modern science. Indeed; the essence and presence of a factor in a given degree cannot be used to predict, linearly, the behavior of a system; bird, atom, molecule, photon, person, species, or society. No longer may we use formal axiomatic theory in conjunction with binary logic with which to model reality, predict and thus control system dynamics. Indeed control itself becomes a casualty of post-modern science.\"\n \n http://www.critcrim.com/redfeather/chaos/001intro.html\n \n \"(Chaos is) the unpredictable evolution of the behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems. Because of their sensitive dependence on initial conditions, the error in predicting the future states of such systems grows exponentially with time, so that the future states of such systems becomes essentially unknowable in a relatively brief period of time. Although chaos means unpredictability, it should not be understood to mean that the system was not or is not determined (Masterpasqua & Perna, 1997, p. 304).\"\n \n http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2001/BrainsBodiesBifurcations.htm\n \n The Unknown and The Unknowable\n \n \"Another famous negative result, due to the British genius, Alan Turing, states that you cannot tell in advance if a certain abstraction of a digital computer called a Turing machine will ever halt with the correct answer.

Take the diet of a given person living in a village in the year 1300. \"You may know on average what his diet was,\" said Jesse Ausubel, the program officer of the Sloan Foundation. \"But you cannot say what he ate on Dec. 15, 1300.\"\n \n http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/nation/98/02/02/unknowability.2-2.html\n \n \n \n It is ignored.

Of course, even though these sites above are about science, and they deal with science, he adds the illogical claim that they are 'an appeal to authority'. As well as this, he's stated no amount of citations will convince him. In other words he demands discussion, it's given, but he says its all illogical, based on his own rationale, and devoid of evidence.\n \n \n \n The problem is that he believes in Objectivism which as stated in the previous post\n \n \"The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system.

What's the speed of dark?\n\n \n An on topic post, which unfortunately follows an off-topic attack. Almost commendable.\n \n Let's examine Darkness:\n 1 a : devoid or partially devoid of light\n : not receiving, reflecting, transmitting, or radiating light\n \n \n First of all, Montalban, it's an adjective. For you to suggest that I'll claim it's not real, is partially right. Are adjectives things that exist, or functioning of the brain? I don't think \"red\" exists, it's an interperetation of the wavelength of light reflected from a source, by our visual organs. Red ultimately describes a specific wavelength as viewed by the average human. Which is something we can measure, observe, etc. Does \"rough\" exist? Or is it the touch perception categorization of matter that is irregular when sensed?\n \n \n Darkeness describes something in reality, a region of space/time, that has no light energy to observe. It's an adjective, it isn't the object itself.\n \n OK, that's something, it's a description of any region of space/time, with either no light, or an area with such low light that our human perception cannot make out details (etc.) Can darkness be measured? Sure, as the absence of light. Can we \"see\" darkness? Yes, we can see low levels or absence of light. OK, it seems to be something we can observe, test, and even define adequately. \n \n Can we apply this to non-material?\n \n Hm. That seems reasonable. \n \n It's an adjective, that is used in conjunction with a noun.\n \n Where is your non-material noun? What IS non-material?\n \n So following your example of dark, non-material is the absence of matter?\n \n So it's a vacuum.\n \n An area of space/time with little or no matter. Vacuum.\n \n So God is partially a vacuum?\n \n I'm not sure this is leading you where you'd like to go.\n =============================================\n Secondly, let's do examine the webster definition of non-\n \n Main Entry: non-\n Pronunciation: (')n\u00e4n also \"n&n or 'n&n before '-stressed syllable, \"n\u00e4n also \"n&n before \"-stressed or unstressed syllable; the variant with & is also to be understood at pronounced entries, though not shown\n Function: prefix\n Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin non not, from Old Latin noenum, from ne- not + oinom, neuter of oinos one -- more at NO, ONE\n 1 : not : other than : reverse of : absence of\n 2 : of little or no consequence : unimportant : worthless <nonissues< <nonsystem<\n 3 : lacking the usual especially positive characteristics of the thing specified <noncelebration< <nonart<\n =============================\n \n OK, as a word, we can define \"non-material\", and know tha it means \"not material\".\n \n So we're back to square one. The definition matches are assumption that it's a \"negative\" of something, or absence of. Darkness was the absence of light, but refers to an area of space/time, can be measured, etc. Color is the wavelength of light that an average human observes. So non-substance..i.e. non-matter...the absence of matter, a vacuum.\n \n Interesting. So is our consciouness a vacuum, or made up of vacuums? Why can't we just measure the vacuums? How do we know our ideas originate from the interaction soley of vacuums?\n \n Personally, the only version I've read that makes sense is Alan Ryan's defninition:\n \nConsciousness = the state of an individual when his faculties of thinking, seeing, hearing, etc. are functioning \"normally\". It contrasts with a state of unconsciousness - in say a coma or in a dreamless sleep. At present it is not known what the full set of necessary and sufficient conditions are for the functioning of our perceptual and cognitive faculties. (I would wish to emphasise that the present uncertainty about these mental functions is very unlikely to persist - given the scientific effort to understand them).\n Finally, for now, I want to also emphasise that consciousness is a creation of the material components of the brain.\n\n \n It's the functioning of the brain. The continuous awareness of sensory perceptions and stored memory.\n \n I like this definition best however:\n \n Consciousness:\n That annoying time between naps. \n www.vikarsrant.net/Jokes/DefinitionsNewAge.htm\n \n \n Of course, we can choose between that, which we can debate, and \"a vacuum\", which I think won't stand up to scrutinity, but good try nonetheless.\n \n \n -Mach",

Take a step back for a moment and consider from the perspective that everything in the universe is inter-related somehow... the idea that everything is connected... that it all flows together. It is our ego-mind that insists upon using reason to 'figure out' the world around us. It is our ego-mind that sees the world in terms of a duality. It is our ego-mind that insists on making distinctions and seeing boundaries between different types of matter.\n \n When we recognize that there is a little voice inside our head (that same little voice that right now is asking, \"What little voice?\"), and we recognize that the little voice is not necessarily 'ME,' but rather just a part of any given individual... then we can tune out that little voice and listen instead to everything that is. Just being.\n \n Though I have not yet read the book, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tole (sp?) appears to be a fascinating look into this realm. There may very well be a realm that our ego-mind, or our little voice, or that which we typically perceive to be 'ME,' is incapable of comprehending. If there is a reality that exists beyond the tangible world of reason, we will never be able to experience that world through the tools of reason.\n \n Perhaps God really is a synonym for non-existence in a material sense... in the sense that can be comprehended through reason. Perhaps when we quiet the ego-mind such that what we typically perceive to be our individuality no longer exists, it is then that we experience non-existence... or, if you prefer... 'God.'",

Kant argued that our cognitive faculties require that we conceive of the world as containing substance, i.e., something that remains constant in the face of continuous change.\"\n http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/substanc.html\n That is just about substance, but what does Aristotle actually say about the unknowable?\n In his book \"Physics\"...\n \"Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is infinite in multitude or size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite in variety of kind is unknowable in quality. But the principles in question are infinite both in multitude and in kind. Therefore it is impossible to know things which are composed of them; for it is when we know the nature and quantity of its components that we suppose we know a complex.\"\n http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/Weird...sics_entire.htm\n also at\n http://www.non-contradiction.com/ac_works_b7.asp\n and\n http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.1.i.html\n Mmmm..... seems he can make a statement about what is unknowable. Does this mean he believes that the infinite, in the capacity of being infinite does not exist? Or, is he saying that the infinite is unknowable? There is a difference, can you spot it?\n \n How can he even discuss what the unknowable is, if it doesn't exist, and if you can't know anything about it? How do you know something about something that is beyond knowing?\n What does Aristotle mean?\n \"Matter, for Aristotle, is unknowable in itself because it has no properties for the mind to grasp, it is indefinite.\"\n Cf. Physica 207a 25\n http://www.examinedlifejournal.com/...dpotency2.shtml\n \n In fact what he is saying is that all substance (material) can be known, but all non-substance can not. Note also he doesn't disagree with non-material. Not only that, he deemed evolution impossible. Go 'father of logic, Go! \n \"Plato and Aristotle, who governed biology until 1859. The world was eternal, species were fixed from all eternity, and the idea of evolution was inconceivable. Aristotle said that non-material agencies operate in nature and Plato said that eternal ideas generate earthly varieties\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Education/Aulie7-03.html\n \n It is in fact a western trait to search into the unknowable, coming under the term Scholasticism, and not an Orthodox tradition. We believe that God is, in his essence \n unknowable, and we make no concerted attempt to define him.\n \n It is in fact this search for God that produced western science. The idea being that to understand the world, would lead to an understanding of God... which is why materialism rose in Christian thought...as opposed to Aristotle.\n \"In 17th century England the chemist Robert Boyle, of Boyle's Law fame, vigorously opposed Aristotle. A pious Christian, he believed that divine purpose invested nature, but that Aristotelian purpose was not efficacious in science. For Boyle, creation meant that scientific explanation lay in the material connections in nature, without any Aristotelian non-material agencies\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Education/Aulie7-03.html\n \n In summary. Aristotle does say that contradictions can't exist. A tick for Mach. But does this mean that Aristotle agrees with Mach? \n Aristotle believes in\n non-material causes\n unknowables\n and is against evolution.\n The father of logic has spoken.",

   "You stated that science can test for darkness.

Can you even claim it exists if it cannot be observed? \n \n ============\n Also, pnac=ww3's question (similar to above)\n \n So, my answer (question) to that is: if there are such things that are non-material (would they be things?) would we ever know they exist? If they exist, what is non-material about them and how would we know that that they exist and are non-material? \n ==================================\n \n ^^^^\n \n Please do answer the questions, otherwise, we're left with your claim of God being identical to \"non-existence\", which is fine by me.\n \n -Mach",

   "No, and do not misrepresent my claims again.\n\n Which claims? The ones where you said science could test for darkness, or your current claim that darkness is not material? (see posts below)\n It would be handy if you knew what it is in fact that you are trying to argue, and stick to that.\n \nOnce again, you must be corrected.\n\n Once again you can give refutation of a previous statement you made. The odd thing here is you seem rather indignant about a claim at being misrepresented; when you were the one to try to show science can test for darkness\n \n can take my pick:\n Dark: My observation that the region I \"observe\", or think I observe, has little or no light.\n Dark: a region of space time in which light is absent or present only in small amounts. One can measure light using a light meter, and if the presence of such light is below the level we arbitrarily define as \"Dark\", then you can define the region as \"dark\".\n I DO NOT CLAIM TO KNOW DARKNESS \"EXISTS\" AS A SUBSTANCE.\n\n Then why did you attempt to show science could test for darkness? Were you trying to prove that science can test for something that doesn't exist? What are you trying to argue now? Why don't you just admit that your previous stance was illogical?\n \n DO NOT CLAIM \"DARK\" AS A NOUN EXISTS.\n\n Do you mean that it doesn't exist as a noun? It's hard to tell what you are trying to argue, because you raised some silly point about it being an adjective before. (Post #62; I don't know where that little gem was going)\n \nDO NOT MISREPRESENT MY POSTS AGAIN.\n\n Do not go around making one statement, then completely reversing it. You have done this on so many issues that it would be laughable if not for the fact you seem not to be aware of this. I keep posting these glaring errors, you keep ignoring them. You should petition the Admin to change the name of this site from \"You Debate\" to \"You Pontificate\", because you have no real sense of debate, hence you claim you've been misrepresented. Read what you said (below)...\n \n It is positively the worst debating style to first argue that you can show science can test for darkness, which failed, then to switch to saying it doesn't exist, without even having the honesty to admit you were wrong to attempt to prove it was material in the first place.\n Post #46\n \nCan darkness be measured? Sure\n\n The absolute laughable thing now is you are saying it doesn't exist. So, how do you propose measuring something that doesn't exist?\n \n Further I gave you a challenge to show the science that can test for darkness\n There's plenty of people here with more science than I. Does anyone know of science tests for 'dark'?\n \n If not, would this not suggest that it is non-material? \n Post #62\n \n You've got to be kidding me.\n\n You were so incredulous then that someone would even question the idea. But you went on///\n \n\n Dark: [a region of space/time] devoid or partially devoid of light \n \n Even Amazon.com:\n \n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/s...7167429-5007155\n \n http://www.dasdistribution.com/prod...ical_models.htm\n \n http://www.professionalequipment.co.../qx/default.htm\n \n Although I think the average adult could have answered it, or a photographer, or someone who can do a search on amazon.com.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n I expect you will ignore what you said then as you always ignore these monumental foul-ups.",

   "Montalban,\n \n Despite your nonsensical attacks, the questions about your claims remain, unanswered.\n \n I'll take that as a withdrawl, or acceptance that god is synonymous with non-existence (as is your definition of darkness, consciousness, psyche, ideas, love). We've shown clearly that's what your claims of:\n \n Cannot be tested/observed\n neither matter nor energy\n \n leaves you with. \n \n A big fat nothing. \n \n Actually, it leaves you with another logical contradiction, but I know you don't like to hear that.
