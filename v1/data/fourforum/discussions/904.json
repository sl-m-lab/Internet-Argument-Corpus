   "Poet,\n \n The Catholic position on this is that it is not either faith or works. We must be called to faith first by God. Then because God has endowed us with free will we must choose to cooperate with the gift of his grace or to reject it. Works are a cooperation with the grace of God. Too many seek to put isolated verses of scripture in opposition instead of having a comprehensive view. It does not have to be either/or it can be both/and.\n \n You must also be aware that the context of the epistles of Paul was of Christians living in a Jewish society. Some Christians believed that works of the Old Law must be maintained in addition to their Christian faith. Often times when Paul speaks of works, he speaks of works of the Old Law.\n \n It is entirely possible that a man could be saved by faith on his deathbed without receiving any of the Christian sacraments--Catholics describe this as a baptism of desire. It is possible that a man could be saved by works--laying his life down for another--a baptism of blood. Jesus says that man hath no greater love than this. It is very surprising to many to learn that the Church teaches that \"Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved.\" (CCC 1260) But for those of us living through everyday life as Christians, the most complete adherence to Christianity is through faith and  works.\n \n I have written more extensively on this on the Christianity Poll thread if you wish to read more.",
