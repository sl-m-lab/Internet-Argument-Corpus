I don't believe that a 50% divorce rate means marriage is a \"stable institution\". Actually, when I think of what legal marriage means through my eyes, it doesn't resemble what it was meant to stand for.\n \n Straight people say that gay marriage will \"redefine\" marrige. From the looks of things, it could use a little \"refefining\"...for the better. If marriage is so strong, why so threatened by a very small percentage of the world's population you think would destroy it? How would we destroy it? It would still be a loving union between 2 people. Perhaps it should have started out that way.\n \n I'm not against straight marriage like I use to be, but it's just not something I want to be a part of. I'm also not threatened by straight marriage either just because most people believe in it.",
