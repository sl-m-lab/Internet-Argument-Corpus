   "http://americablog.blogspot.com/\n \nAccording to the AFA and media reports over the past two weeks, in order to avoid a boycott from the extremist gay-hating organization, Ford allegedly agreed to:\n \n 1. No longer run ads promoting Jaguar or Land Rover in the gay press.\n \n 2. No longer support gay events or organizations.\n \n 3. Continue running Volvo ads in the gay press, but no longer tailor those ads to the gay community (i.e., in the future such ads would be the same ads that are run in the mainstream media, rather than the crafting the ads to appeal to a gay readership).\n \n Ford addressed and resolved each of our three concerns regarding the above:\n \n 1. Ford announced that it will continue to support gay organizations and gay events in the coming year and beyond.\n \n 2. Ford is going to run advertisements in the gay media NOT ONLY promoting the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, but the ads will promote ALL of Fords brands, by name, including Jaguar and Land Rover.\n \n 3. Ford states unequivocally that it will continue to tailor its ads for the specific audience it is trying to reach, and then goes one step further. Ford challenges us to keep an eye out on their upcoming ads in order to verify that they will in fact be tailored.\n The letter itself can be read here: http://americablog.blogspot.com/Ford%20Letter%2012-14-2005.pdf",

The idea that this could be called a 'victory' for anyone of anyone is pretty silly, no matter which way it went. Ford is simply going to do what makes them the most money when its all said and done.

In fact MOST of his life's work has been about other issues. He is generally quite well-regarded when it comes to parenting issues in particular. Hiw view on homosexuality isn't even what he's known for, in most circles.\n \n AFR has long spent a very large proportion if it's \"talk\" airtime railing about homosexuality. The thing is, they bill themselves as a general Christian radio station, and they do play Christian music between their \"talk\" segments. But they seem to me to be mostly a one-issue station, that issue being how bad homosexuality is for our culture. After listening into some of their broadcasts, I truly believe they have genuine bias against gay people. I'm telling you, more times than not, when I turn the dial to AFR they happen to be talking about homosexuality. They do talk about some other issues too, but it just seems that if a network is going to call themselves Christian, they'd spend time talking about others matters that pertain to Christianity. And they don't oppose homosexual relations in a Christian way, but rather in a spiteful way. So I can't support them. They truly are an \"anti-gay\" network, as much as I hate that sort of terminology.",

   "Undaunted by yet another failure and always looking for new opportunities to disenfranchise, demean, denigrate and hurt gays and lesbian Americans, AFA is now bristling about Wal-Mart. The following is from a December 15 article posted by the Christian news service Agape Press:\n AFA spokesman Randy Sharp says his organization has obtained a copy of a Wal-Mart staff memo inviting home office associates to a seminar on December 16 entitled \"Why Market to Gay America?\" The memo, dated December 8, notes that America's homosexual community has $610 billion in purchasing power, and that the seminar -- sponsored by Wal-Mart's Office of Diversity -- will \"provide insight into the purchasing decisions of GLBT . . . customers.\" . . . \n \n \"Basically what they're doing is they're giving their stamp of approval on homosexuality, recognizing it as a facet in America that deserves their support and their encouragement,\" he says. \"And they want their business. [italics mine]\n Apparently Mr. Sharp is unaware that the purpose of retail businesses is to sell things to people who have the money to buy them. Sharp's other statement betrays his blindness. Homosexuals, their children and their families are a facet of America, whether he likes it or not. But then again, what can be expected from someone who works for an organization headed by Rev. Wildmon whose comment had no connection to reality, reason or logic, only hate and bias: \"Based on the memo, Wal-Mart is recognizing homosexuality as equal to race and national origin . . . it is only a matter of time before this group demands same-sex partner health benefits, 'pride parades,' and diversity workshops.\" Wildmon's wallowing is not surprising: equality and diversity are anathema to hate-mongering theocrats and ultra-conservatives. One organization offers T-shirts that proclaim it.\n http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_345.shtml",
