   "I keep seeing predictions of $4-$5 gas this year. Personally, I think the predictions are probably correct. While the \"recovery\" in the US is anything but, most of the world is back to their pre-collapse oil consumption. \n \n Anybody want to toss out a guess as to where gas prices are likely to turn out?\n \n Personally I think it will be interesting to see not just where prices go but their impact on the wider economy.",

   "Well they just upped the prediction for fuel consumption per day for 2011. What I'm not clear on is if the US has increased at all. Frankly I've felt people have cut back and I understand natural gas consumption is down this winter as well. \n \n I'm not really up on the energy side of things but are we looking at a prediction for another collapse like in 08 or is this a more sound $100 a barrel?",

   "Gas Prices in My area Jumped as much as 15 cents a gallon over the weekend, going from between 2.94 and 3.00 per gallon. I think personally it will continue to go up as the year goes.. Probably ending in the 4 to 5 dollar a gallon range. Oil Will more than likely go 100 a barrel if not more before it's over. I don't see this Government releasing any Oil reserves to try to drive it back down, If I'm not mistaken they have been talking about another 15 cent tax on fuel so they will want the price of oil high to maximize their profit.\n \n That's just my opinion though, I haven't done much research on the subject.",

The $140 run up was a sound run up based on fundamentals. Every producer in the world was running flat out and there was no spare capacity. Our president went and begged the Saudis to increase production (most powerful country in the world....yea...) and they could not. Coupled with the falling dollar, prices went up. \n \n The increase in fuel and food prices drove disposable income for many americans into negative territory which led to a wave of defaults on mortgages and got people looking at how secure sub prime mortgages really are. At the same time, the fed raised interest rates in an attempt to put a floor under the dollar, leading to increased rates on ARMs. Defaults accelerated.\n \n This is the problem. The price run up in oil was completely justified and was based on fundamentals, but it crashed the world economy. The new run up will be completely justified and is based on fundamentals, but may well crash the global economy and will certainly do horrid things to the US economy. \n \n We are caught in a loop. Unfortunately America has more exposure on this than most of the world because our entire system and economy are built around cheap hydrocarbons. Our food is a good example. 80% of our flour production is done in new jersey, while 95% of our wheat is produced in the midwest, so we ship the wheat all the way to new jersey where it is turned into flour, then shipped out across the entire nation. We use 3 calories of energy for every calorie of finished food that we produce. For the most part our public transportation system is a joke. We have a rail system that Bulgaria would be ashamed to claim. \n \n We can obviously do things on a small, personal scale to mitigate the impact of higher hydrocarbon prices, and those do add up, but they do not add up to a situation where we are actually going to be able to prosper. We essentially need to restructure our entire nation with the idea of energy efficiency in mind. \n \n Granted market forces will do that for us in time, but it wont be pretty or pleasant when they do. Markets react in real time. to what is happening RIGHT NOW. They tend to be VERY poor at either predicting the future or adapting to foreseeable macroeconomic changes. We will eventually see the changes taking place, but a lot of people are going to get thrown under the bus on the way there.",
