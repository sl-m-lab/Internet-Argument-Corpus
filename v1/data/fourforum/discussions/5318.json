   "Meanwhile we are told by some here that the American economy and dollar is going into the toilet. What's wrong with this picture? Twice the unemployment and only 5% of U.S. growth in France compared to the U.S. Immediately below is the U.S. economy. Then see the article below.\n \n Since 1970, GDP growth has averaged 3.16 percent per year, after inflation. During President Bush's first year in office in 2001, the economy slipped into and pulled out of a recession and yet overall output managed to grow slightly. Since 2001, real output has grown at an average annual rate of 3.47 percent. This rapid expansion has been concentrated in the five quarters following the 2003 Bush tax cuts. Since the third quarter of 2003, growth has averaged 4.62 percent.\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/wm601.cfm\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/images/wm_601_chart3.gif\n ==============================\n \n French Economic Growth Slowed in 1Q\n \n By Associated Press\n \n May 20, 2005, 6:19 AM EDT\n \n PARIS -- Growth in the French economy slowed sharply in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 as consumer spending sagged, the national statistics institute Insee said Friday.\n \n In a preliminary estimate, Insee said first-quarter gross domestic product growth was 0.2 percent, well below the 0.5 percent increase forecast by economists. (U.S. is 4.4%)\n \n The new data suggests that French growth is well below the pace needed to deliver the 2 percent to 2.5 percent expansion targeted by the government this year as it struggles to bring down its public deficit and unemployment, currently at a five-year high of 10.2 percent.\n \n Even before Friday's disappointing data, most economists believed growth was unlikely to be much above 1.8 percent in 2005.\n \n \"In these conditions, French growth won't be 2.5 percent or 2 percent this year, but around 1.6 percent,\" said Marc Touati, chief economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.\n \n \"Considering that employment stagnated last year with 2.1 percent economic growth, it's not a GDP expansion of 1.6 percent that will change things this year.\"\n \n Insee has changed its base year to 2000 from 1995 since it last published quarterly data. That brought changes to estimates for 2004, which combined to put full-year growth at 2.1 percent, down from the 2.4 percent it previously estimated.\n \n Fourth-quarter GDP growth was 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, Insee said, rather than the 0.9 percent it estimated previously.\n \n Consumer spending growth also slowed in the first quarter to 0.7 percent, Insee said, from 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, and French exports contracted 0.1 percent after a 0.9 percent expansion.\n \n Consumer spending remained solid through 2004, helping the euro zone's second-biggest economy to outperform its neighbors Germany and Italy.\n \n But observers have been warning for some time that stubbornly high unemployment would undermine consumer confidence and ultimately spending as the French take to topping up savings in uncertain times.\n \n http://www.newsday.com/business/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-france-economy,0,317867.story?coll=sns-ap-business-headlines",

   "Without subtracting the debt required to make that injection.\n\n \n This debt allegation is bulloney. Our national debt falls right in the middle of most nations. Now I'm sure we will once again be told about consumer debt as though it is going to drag down our economy. We've been hearing about this for years. Our national net worth is about 48 Trillion dollars. That's AFTER the debt is subtracted out. For some additional perspective:\n \n MAY 23, 2005\n \n Sure, The Trade Deficit Is Scary -- But We Can Handle It\n America's wealth is growing fast enough to cover its debt easily\n \n Everyone has a favorite statistic, and those who are pessimistic about the U.S. economy love to cite the trade deficit. The numbers released on May 11 were no exception. While the trade figure for March was a bit better than expected, the gap for the first three months of 2005 is running at a $696 billion annual rate. That's well ahead of the $617 billion total for 2004, guaranteeing another chorus of warnings about a dollar crisis and the danger of excess spending.\n \n Optimists are quick to point to the latest figures on productivity growth. Data released on May 5 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show output per hour rising at a 2.9% rate over the past 10 years, not much below the 1960s postwar high of 3.3%. From the perspective of long-term productivity growth, the U.S. couldn't be much healthier.\n \n Which is more important, big trade deficits or high productivity? For now it looks as if productivity wins. Why? The net wealth of the U.S. is huge compared to 10 years ago, even after taking into account that Americans owe foreigners some $3 trillion because of cumulative trade gaps. Rising net wealth means the positive influence of higher productivity -- which boosts economic output -- has been stronger than the negative impact of big trade deficits.\n \n Think about it this way: The U.S. is like a family enjoying rising income even as it takes on sizable debt -- not too unusual in these days of big mortgages. You'd worry if such a family had to sell off assets or draw down savings to pay for today's consumption, a sign that it was living beyond its means. The family would soon be in trouble if it didn't curtail spending. But if the family's net worth -- assets minus debt -- is going up, its financial position is actually improving.\n \n That's essentially what's happening to the financial position of the U.S.: Not only is it getting better, it's getting a lot better. The best way to show this is to look at a new measure of national wealth that I call \"net real wealth per capita.\" Start with the net worth of households as reported by the Federal Reserve. Then subtract federal, state, and local debt, and adjust for inflation and changes in population. What's left is a figure that measures, somewhat imperfectly, the average net value of the liabilities and assets of Americans, assuming that they are responsible for the government's debt as well as their own.\n \n By this measure, net real wealth per person is up 16% since the end of 2002. While it's still a bit below the all-time high reached in early 2000, over the past 10 years it has risen 57%. That's one of the biggest 10-year rises on record, beaten only by the decade ending in 1999. By comparison, net real wealth per person rose by 36% in the 1980s, 21% in the 1970s, and 32% in the 1960s...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_21/b3934053_mz011.htm?chan=db",

   "I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n \n Yeah you did. LT explained it very accuratly. \n \n Furthermore your figure of 4,4% US growth also represent the annual growth of 2004. There has been a general slowdown in the world economy the first quarter in 2005 and America has been hit as well. I can`t seem to find any actual figures for the first quarter growth in the US for 2005, but the annual economic growth between the first quarter 2004 and the first quarter 2005 was 3,1%. considering that the growth for 2004 was 4,4%, this implies that the economic growth the first quarter 2005 was quite bad in the US as well... \n \n One can also question the relevance of comparing economic growth figures without correcting for population growth. If you want to compare economic performance or changes in individual wellfare, correcting for the annual population growth of 1% in the US should be appropriate. \n \n \n Europe's economy is in the tank. All the economic evidence points in that direction. By contrast the U.S. economy is behaving the way a dynamic, market oriented economy can be expected to behave. I could post statistic after statistic to prove my point. Is that what you want me to do?\n\n \n If you do, at least post comparable figures ;). And, yes, I agree that Europe has it`s fair share of problematic economies. Ecpessially the long term unemployment figures are worrysome in certain mainland european countries. The situatiopn in the US is at first glance, slightly more promising IMO, but the difference you present here is just hyperbole and not based on facts.\n \n \n You did say something that I can agree with. I do care about Europe's performance because it will impact on our economy as well. I take no pleasure in pointing out the miserable performance of France's economy. Germany is about the same and Italy is horrible. \n\n \n France is doing pretty allright. I can agree that Germay and Italy are having significant economic problems. Germany is still trying to come to terms with the economic reality created by Kohl when West- and East Germany was reunited. In this respect, Germany is like Japan; stuck in a serious recession caused by bad polycie. \n \n \n The truth is that Europe is probably teetering on the verge of going into a major recession or even a depression. \n\n \n Why would it? Economic figures and forecasts doesn`t support this notion.\n \n \n If Europeans revert to putting their money under the mattress and not spending, sure it will affect our economy. The only major economy doing very well would of course be Britain and that is because Margaret Thatcher was PM a number of years ago and broke the stranglehold of the unions there.\n\n \n UK is doing pretty allright. They have far better unemployment figures than the larger mainland european countries, but economic growth is not significantly higher than the in France or Spain.\n \n I have no real idea of what Tatcher actually did other than destroy the conservative party in the UK and increasing poverty and lining the pockets of the rich. It would surprise me however if she had anything to do with the current economic performance in the UK",

   "And free market economics will lead to the situation as it was in Britain in the middle of the 19th century. The poor earning less than a living wage, inadequate sanitation to due to private vested interests, no social mobility, no education or healthcare for the poor. The key, for the moment at least, is the balance between private and public. In the 70s the state was used to prop up union power, with the closed shop etc, since then it has been used to prop up private business, with the ban on secondary picketting et al. Thatcher didn't \"do what needed to be done\" she persued a personal vendetta against the working class that threw the socialist baby out with the statist bathwater. Just because you see Thatcher as a goddess through your market tinted spectacles does not make it true. I lived through the after effects of Thatcherism, schools having to sack teachers to make \"efficiency savings\" waiting lists in hospitals spiralling to months for the same reason. Communities in the north of england wrecked by her desire to screw over working people in favour of her City buddies. Social mobility in the UK ground to a halt in the 1980s, and the poor have got poorer since then, while the rich have got hugely richer. Free market economics is not a magic wand.",
