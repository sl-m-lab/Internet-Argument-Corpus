   "Howdy,\n \n There will be a new biological classification system to be proposed soon to replace the system developed by Carolus Linneaus in 1758.\n \n It's called PHYLOCODE and will attempt to better reflect how organisms are related in evolutionary terms.\n \n The Phylocode would abolish all rankings above species and instead would be based on clades, groups of ancestral species and all their descenants.\n \n Since the entire biological community will likely switch to this system in the near future, should taxonomy be derived solely from an evolutionary perspective?\n \n Darwin used the heirarchical Linnean system to suggest that these species within genera were related by common ancestry. Do you think the Linnean system works just fine in an evolutionary context or should the new system based on cladistics be adopted. In other words, would a biologists work become easier if he structured all his taxonomy within an evolutionary framework?",

Simply by changing the perspective from which one considers a question, new answers and solutions become obvious.\n Evolution, in it's many proven and debated forms, is the foundation of modern biological science. The old taxonomic system is a burden, devised before we had a truer understanding of the relationships between all forms of life.",

   "I don't know how much of a burden it is to study modern animals in relation to each other using the Linnean system, but it does get hairy when you want to relate birds to reptiles and reptiles to amphibians, etc. \n \n The cladistic system would also help in the \"debate.\" No longer would someone be able to say, \"A reptile never gave birth to a bird,\" without someone answering \"Maybe, but an Amniote gave birth to an Amniote!\"\n http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Amniota&contgroup=Terrestrial_Vertebrates\n \n This is a very nice site:\n http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html",
