   "Here is some more twisted logic. The dishonesty is overwhelming. \n \n Gay marriage threatens society\n \n \n Dona Albert asked how society is threatened by legalizing gay marriage. She alleges that we are forcing everyone to live by our Christian beliefs.\n \n It's not just Christianity that limits marriage to a man and a woman. Judaism and Islam do, too and for good reasons. Why throw out thousands of years of Judeo-Christian tradition to accommodate one group? Would polygamy be next?\n \n A study of gay men in the Netherlands, where gay marriage is legal, found that \"steady partnerships\" last less than two years on average and gay men in \"steady relationships\" had an average of eight \"casual\" sex partners a year.\n \n Contrast those findings with the 1994 National Health and Social Life Survey which found that the vast majority of married men and women are monogamous. If all of that is true, it would seem to indicate that monogamy is rare among homosexuals but common among married men and women.\n \n It follows that if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as marriage, the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be seriously compromised. I call that threatening to society.\n Gary Hardin\n Montgomery",

Do you not realize that this man most likely was not try to deceive in any way?\n\n \n Maybe this will help you understand. This gives some insight into the study regarding sexual partners that gets his information from. Like usual, your side doesn't point out the details that are important for perspective. \n \n What the \"Dutch Study\" Really Says About Gay Couples\n \n Jim Burroway \n January 9, 2006\n One Sunday evening, I finally got around to reading that day's newspaper when I saw a letter to the editor from Glen Lavy, Senior Vice President of the conservative Alliance Defense Fund's Marriage Litigation Center. He objected to an editorial that suggested that same-sex marriage may help to provide stability in the lives of gay men and women. Lavy's letter read in part:\n \n According to a Dutch study, same-sex \"partnerships\" for young men are temporal at best, and men in \"steady partnerships\" have an average of eight partners per year aside from their \"main\" partner...1\n \n We've seen that claim before. Whenever discussions about gay marriage come up, these statistics are tossed around with startling consistency:\n \n What does a homosexual marriage look like? Well, the longest term that we have available to look at is in the Netherlands. Researchers found that the average \"marriage\" between two men lasts one and a half years. Furthermore, during that time, men have eight other partners per year. - Dr. James Kennedy2\n \n A recent study from the Netherlands, where gay marriage is legal, ...found that even among stable homosexual partnerships, men have an average of eight partners per year outside their \"monogamous\" relationship. - Christianity Today3\n \n A recent study on homosexual relationships finds they last 1-1/2 years on average - even as homosexual groups are pushing nationwide to legalize same-sex 'marriages.' The study of young Dutch homosexual men by Dr. Maria Xiridou of the Amsterdam Municipal Health Service, published in May in the journal AIDS...found that men in homosexual relationships on average have eight partners a year outside those relationships. - Washington Times4\n \n Now that you've read these claims, what can you assume? Like most people, you're likely to guess that these statistics can from a broad-based general population survey in the Netherlands studying homosexual behavior and gay relationships. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. It turns out this \"Dutch Study\" was performed by a team of researchers led by Dr. Maria Xiradou that appeared in the May 2, 2003 issue of the journal AIDS. And what is the title of that study? \"The contribution of steady and casual partnerships in the incidence of HIV infection among homosexual men in Amsterdam.\"5\n \n This turns out to be a very common tactic among anti-gay extremists. Because they're eager to portray their positions as being backed by scientific research, they often turn to medical studies to support their arguments. And they are especially fond of studies of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD's), which they can count on to provide especially juicy statistics to describe \"what homosexuals do\". But of course, all you really learn from these studies is what some homosexuals do - the ones who go to STD clinics because they've picked up a disease. By turning to Dr. Xiridou's study, these activists are following a well-worn path.\n \n Dr. Xiridou and her colleagues based their research article on the Amsterdam Cohort Studies of HIV infection and AIDS among homosexually active men.6 These studies began in 1984, and had several different protocols in their lifetime:\n \n Oct 1984-1985: Gay men aged 18-65 with at least two sexual partners in the previous six months. In other words, monogamous partners were explicitly excluded. \n April 1985-Feb 1988: Study enrollment was continued, except HIV-negative men were now excluded. Only HIV-positive men were added. \n Feb 1988 - Dec 1988: The study was re-opened to HIV-negative men. \n Various additional enrollments continued from through 1998. Especially notable was a special recruitment campaign for men under the age of thirty beginning in 1995. After 1996, all men above the age of thirty were dropped from the study. Their data was excluded from subsequent analyses. \n Nobody outside of Amsterdam was accepted into the study except for AIDS patients who attended clinics in Amsterdam for treatment. This makes the study almost exclusively an urban one. \n So, what do we have? We have a study population that was heavily weighted with HIV/AIDS patients, excluded monogamous participants, was predominantly urban, and under the age of thirty. While this population was good for the purposes of the study, it was in no way representative of Amsterdam's gay men, let alone gay men anywhere else.\n \n And of course, to spotlight the far-right's most disturbing deficiency in logic, I would like to point out that these \"statistics\" have nothing to do with lesbians at all.\n \n So let's review the claims against what the study actually says.\n \n Claim #1: The study was of homosexual relationships between married homosexual men.\n This study was not about homosexual relationships. The authors are mostly doctors and epidemiologists - they study how diseases are passed along from one person to the next. Their research article presented a mathematical model that was intended to predict how HIV and AIDS would spread among gay men. If a couple is monogamous, then by definition they would not be contributing to the spread of HIV and AIDS. Monogamous couples were simply irrelevant to the study, which is why they were explicitly excluded.\n \n Claim #2: Homosexual relationships last for an average of only one and a half years, making same-sex marriages short-lived.\n The first problem we have here is that anyone who was over the age of thirty was excluded from the study. By keeping the age of the sample population to those thirty and under, this artificially limits the length of time any of them could have been in a \"steady relationship\". You're certainly not going to find any twenty-nine-year-olds in thirty-year relationships, or even fifteen-year ones.\n \n But that's not the only problem. The study didn't ask if any of the participants were married because they couldn't marry. Marriage equality didn't arrive in the Netherlands until April 2001, two years after the study ended. Instead the participants were simply asked if they had a \"steady relationship\" with no further guidance on what that means. People dating for a few weeks could consider themselves in a \"steady relationship\" - which would be a far cry from full-fledged marriage. \n \n This is an important pont. If legally recognized marriage had been an option for these couples (and if the researchers had been interested in studying only married gay men), they would have had a consistent standard for excluding those couples who were merely dating, or even those who were living together but who didn't want to get married. That would have been the only valid way to compared married gay couples to married straight ones. You would have weeded out those who don't want to marry, or who weren't at that stage in their relationships where they felt ready to be married. After all, not all straight couples in \"serous relationships\" are married. By including couples in short-term relationships as well as those who don't want to be married, the average length of relationships is significantly lowered.\n \n And of course, monogamous couples were excluded from the study altogether. I don't think it is too much of a stretch to assume that non-monogamous relationships are less likely to be as stable as monogamous ones. By excluding monogamous couples, the average is likely reduced even more.\n \n To make a valid comparison to straight couples, we would need to compare this group of gay men to married and unmarried urban straight couples - all under thirty and all non-monogamous. This didn't happen.\n \n Claim #3: Men in homosexual relationships on average have eight partners a year outside those relationships.\n The authors quoted that average in their study, but they never tried to claim that it was true for gay men as a whole. Because the study excluded monogamous couples, the stated average would naturally be excessively high. What's more, we don't know how much this average was skewed because we don't know how many monogamous couples were excluded.\n \n The only thing we can conclude from this study is that when people decide to be non-monogamous, they decide to be really non-monogamous.\n \n As we have seen, the \"Dutch study\" claims made by anti-gay activists are seriously distorted. Like most of their claims about gay men's sexual behavior, anti-gay activists rely on studies that are not representative of the general population. What's worse, they especially rely on studies culled from STD clinics for most of their claims. And by not telling you the nature of these studies or their participants, they are engaging in a deliberately deceptive practice. And they get by with it because they assume you won't read these studies yourself, which is a safe assumption for most readers. After all, who has the time to go to a medical library to look up these studies in arcane professional journals?\n \n These activists know that STD studies are a reliable source of statistics describing the behavior of irresponsible gay men and women. But these studies are far from representative of the gay population as a whole. If you don't believe that, then perhaps you should check out what straight STD patients are doing.",

You will also note this paragraph:\nIt is unclear what causes a paraphilia to develop. Psychoanalysts theorize that an individual with a paraphilia is repeating or reverting to a sexual habit that arose early in life. Behaviorists suggest that paraphilias begin through a process of conditioning. Nonsexual objects can become sexually arousing if they are repeatedly associated with pleasurable sexual activity. Or, particular sexual acts (such as peeping, exhibiting, bestiality) that provide especially intense erotic pleasure can lead the person to prefer that behavior. Although the origins of most paraphilias are not understood, in some cases there seems to be a predisposing factor such as difficulty forming person-to-person relationships.\n There is no evidence that homosexuality results from any of the above, and much evidence to suggest that it is innate. No such evidence exists to suggest a biological (genetic, hormonal, whatever) origin for paraphilia.",

   "Dear MrWriteLA,\n \n In reply to your post #19 of 7/28/06:\n \n The words \"nigger\" and \"###\" are terms that have emotive meaning but lack cognitive meaning, as far as the nature of the individuals denoted goes. The terms are purely pejorative. Other than telling us the attitude of the user, the terms give us nothing informative regarding the individuals so labeled who are, respectively, a member of the negro race and a homosexual. \n \n In contrast the term \"sexual perversion\" has cognitive meaning. In other words, bestiality and necrophilia are categorized cognitively not just emotively. They are seen negatively as not just repugnant but against the natural order and being against the natural order that repugnance is justified. Of course there is subjectivity involved. One supposes that the bestialist and the necrophile don't find their activities negative and repugnant; and I suppose they might deny that they are against the natural order.\n \n \n\"If we're discussing logic (remember the topic?), why do you insist we use emotionally charged words instead of objective ones?'\n \n \n By the term \"twisted logic\", as given in the title of this thread that you point out, I suppose that you mean, to be a little more precise, that you see me involved in an error of fact or reasoning based on the test-criteria of fallacy or contradiction. Do you? Or are you viewing this thread as involving pleasing/displeasing rather than true/false?\n \n In closing, what's the difference between a paraphilia and a sexual perversion?\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "Since someone apparently didn't bother reading any of the sites I linked to...\n \nBefore the 20th century, the term usually meant religious perversion, i.e., changing one's religion to an erroneous one. In that sense, who was considered a pervert always depended on one's point of view. In the present day, the term most often refers to \"sexual perversions\", more neutrally called paraphilias, many of which can contribute to sex crimes. The term, in a general sense, is most often applied to the more abnormal or disturbed types of sexual behavior, mainly those involving compulsion and coercion. Used casually, the term can be meant to simply describe someone who is seen as having \"dirty\", \"unnatural\" or ambiguous thoughts. Still, the definition and usage of the concept can vary by such variables as time, person, religion, and culture; and what some would describe as perversion, others might say is simply a variant form of human sexuality. Homosexuality was once considered to be a perversion in many cultures, and indeed still is in some; it is nevertheless widely seen today as a natural sexual variation.\n (emphases mine)\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perversion",

Calling something a sexual perversion to me says it is outside the norm and is a \"bad\" thing. For sexual behavior to be \"bad\", to me it should be harmful to one or more of the parties, either mentally or physically. Coercion, disease, obsession could all cause harm to one of the parties. I honestly cannot think of any healthy expression of sex with a dead body in our culture, but perhaps it could be a ritual in another culture. I do not find the idea of sex with animals at all appealing, but my understanding is that there is many a farm boy whose early sexual experiences was with Bossy. My point is that I would not be willing to label a sexual behavior as \"perverse\", unless one was referring to a specific instance. Even then, I don't think the term carries much meaning, because of its connotations of disapproval from the speaker rather than some more objective criterion.",

   "If the question is, \"Are there certain kinds of sexual behavior that would be universally condemned as morally wrong as well as physically repugnant,\" I'd have to say it depends on the culture in which it occurs as well as the specific behavior. \n \n Just saying \"bestiality\" or \"necrophilia\" doesn't cut it. Is a farmboy who has sex with a sheep for want of anything better a \"pervert\"? Is someone who gets off looking at pictures of people in coffins as \"perverted\" a necrophile as someone who actually has sex with a corpse? \n \n A tribe in New Guinea forces its young men to commit fellatio and drink the semen of an elder as a rite of passage. ( http://www.gettingit.com/article/56 ) Cultural ritual or perversion? In one state, the age of consent is 18; in another, it's 14. Legal marriage or pedophilia?\n \n Personally, I'd consider a \"perversion\"--if I was the sort to use such an outdated term--as sexual activity that as harmful or non-consensual as well as viscerally repellent. But as the articles I linked to make clear, the word is so subjective as to be virtually useless.

I thought I explained that.\n If you came to a message board about apples, and you start talking about oranges, it should come as no surprise that the regulars who talk about apples have no interest in discussing oranges with you.\n \n \n \nThe topic of this thread is in regard to opposition to gay-marriage and the extent to which that opposition is based on reasoning that is unsound --\"twisted\". In showing that such opposition is factual, rational and fair, rather than anything twisted, I have, as a preliminary, gone into the nature of perversions as matters of a misdirected reproductive drive. I believe that can be seen most clearly in necrophilia and bestiality.\n\n My point being that you have meandered around for several posts without even hinting that you were going to talk about homosexuality.\n You have finally started filling in the big picture with all the ulterior motives for your previous discussion.\n \n \n \nSo far no one has wanted to go into that simply because, as far as I can see, that contention, if shown to be true, may lead to displeasing conclusions. In other words, this is not a matter of true false, but of pleasing vs displeasing. The truth or falsity of what I'm proposing is not up for rational consideration.

Do you see pro-gay readily ignoring others just because they are afraid of the potential conclusions?\n \n \n \nIf you'll check the title of this thread, the matter at hand is unsound (\"twisted\") reasoning, which is pretty precisely what I'm pursuing: am I using unsound reasoning in my opposition to gay marriage? Or am I in a taboo area that is displeasing and will be cut off without an in-depth probing, twisted logic or no twisted logic on my part simply being irrelevant. I think that's what it boils down to.\n\n If you'll check out the content of your previous posts, you have done a pretty thorough job of avoiding talking about any \"gay\" or \"gay marriage\". Instead, you spent a lot of time talking about necrophilia and bestiality. You avoided discussing any relevance to gay issues for SEVERAL posts. As such, I think you bored people...\n \n Like I said. You showed up to an apples message board talking about oranges. Eventually, you got around to discussing the issue of fruits and it's relevance to apples...\n \n But of course, you probably know what is going through the other posters minds, so I shouldn't bother contradicting you...\n \n \n \nThe rest of your message is better, involved in showing me that my reasoning is false, but it appears, from what preceded it in your post, that reasoning the matter out is not a real interest of yours, so, unless you want a reply to the points you've brought up I won't waste your time and mine.\n\n It's interesting how I chose to reply to your eventually topical statements, yet you have chosen to avoid my response.\n \n Let me re-iterate.\n If you're going to talk about bestiality and necrophilia, don't be too surprised if people aren't interested. This is a GAY themed message board. If you've got a topical point to make, then make it. Beating around the bush will only bore people.\n \n It seems you're now more fixated on discussing what motivates people who post on this forum than the actual topic.\n \n If you want to get back to discussing my comments on the topic of homosexuality, I will discuss the issue of homosexuality with you.\n \n But be fore-warned. If you're going to avoid the topic of homosexuality and talk only about your imagined motives for other posters, I'm not going to be interested. If you're going to talk about your thoughts on people talking about homosexuality, without actually really talking about homosexuality, I'm not going to be interested.\n \n Is that clear enough?",

The various people you are debating with all think that you have an ulterior motive.\"\n\n \n Well, what is it? \n \n My overt motive is to show that there is a factual, rational and fair basis for rejecting gay marriage and that it does not rest on the twisted logic mentioned in the title of this thread. Showing that requires a very careful, in-depth explanation that, as is starting to become apparent, is simply not acceptable out of hand. Logic, twisted or untwisted and despite the title of the thread, is irrelevant unless it supports Gay Liberation ideology. But there is no ulterior motive (or hidden agenda), although I guess it would be nice to think that there is.\n \n \n\"They all suspect, as do I, that you are trying to get them to accept a somewhat vague definition of perversion, so that you can then step in and say, \"So by that definition gay people are perverts.\" That's where we all think you're going with this line of discussion.\"\n \n \n I believe I understand your point completely, but in this matter, as it stands at present, one is is either a pervert or a homophobe. \n \n I try to use words that are as inoffensive as possible but it isn't possible.

But when it comes to opposing gay marriage, opponents of it have to have some way of rationally conveying their opposition. The common terminolgy, for those opposing homosexuality as something we should all accept and institutionalize in marriage, is to categorize it as a) a sexual perversion and/or unnatural. But to do that is offensive. One is insensitive if one uses that kind of terminology. Right? So one finds oneself deprived of any way of expressing one's disapproval. Do you know of any way to do it in rational terminology? Meanwhile, gay ideologues and proponents of gay marriage are free to use terminology like homophobic, insensitive, mean-spirited, ignorant, prejudiced, bigoted and the \"twisted logic\" of the title of this thread.\n \n Am I telling you anything you don't already know?\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack.",

I admit I haven't been following this thread closely (didn't seem to be much point) so I'll just point out that if your \"reasoning\" relies on people accepting that a pergorative term applies to them, than your reasoning is not in fact based on reason.

I think they're psychopaths. Can I express my disapproval without using that, or any other, pergorative term? Sure! I can discuss how killing is bad, about the grief he's causing to the victims families, about the need for a socitey to have laws. There are lots of concrete things I can talk about to show why I disapprove of mass murderers without resorting to name calling. If your disapproval of gays is based on anything concrete than you could explain that to us. If all you have is a personal feeling that gays are icky, than don't sleep with anyone of your gender yourself, but don't expect anyone to call that rational.",

One supposes that the bestialist and the necrophile don't find their activities negative and repugnant; and I suppose they might deny that they are against the natural order.\n\n One of the things I found interesting about your dialogue is how I believe I never saw you really DEFINE \"perversion\" in the first place.\n You claim it has \"cognitive meaning\", but what exactly does \"perversion\" mean?\n Merriam-Webster defines \"perversion\" using the word \"perverted\". Somebody at the company should be slapped for that.\n http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/perversion\n \n Merriam-Webster defines \"pervert\" as follows:\n 1 a : to cause to turn aside or away from what is good or true or morally right : CORRUPT b : to cause to turn aside or away from what is generally done or accepted : MISDIRECT\n 2 a : to divert to a wrong end or purpose : MISUSE b : to twist the meaning or sense of : MISINTERPRET\n \n And quite frankly, looking at the definition it is nothing but subjective, filled with perjorative. (Claiming that something is not \"good or true or morally right\" is perjorative.)\n Look at the words used.\n \"good or true or morally right\" \n \"is generally done or accepted\"\n \"divert to a wrong end\"\n All highly subjective with no concrete interpretation.\n \n YOU may have incredibly strong feelings about what is \"perverted\", but that doesn't mean the definition of \"perverted\" isn't extremely vague and subject to change. Dependent upon the morals of the people independent of any objective standard.\n \n Quite frankly, INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE could be viewed as a \"perversion\" up until a little under two decades ago. The majority in this country saw interracial marriage as wrong up until the late 80's / early 90's. It was not generally done or accepted.\n \n \"perversion\" is just too arbitrary of a classification to be taken seriously.",

   "Dear thelmoose,\n \n In reply to your posts #36 and #43:\n \n The question that I'll pose at this stage stems from my post #22 to MrWriteLA and has been given to foundit66 in my post #49. You are obviously trying to point out that I'm in error, that I have some erroneous beliefs, which, of course, is possible. What I'm proposing is that we use two test-criteria to identify falsities in our beliefs: fallacies and contradictions. Do you agree, as I do, to be bound by those test-criteria and only those test-criteria in identifying errors of fact and reasoning?\n \n \n\"You seem to think of yourself as some kind of dispassionate evenhanded debator, but you have not asserted anything factual yet. You have provided no evidence for any of your contentions. It was clear from the beginning to all that you wanted to do was attempt to demonstrate that homosexuality ia a perversion. Your blatant, hamhanded approach was ineffective.\"\n\n \n Those are the the sort of accusations that point up pretty clearly the need for objective test-criteria to identify errors of fact and reasoning. \n \n \n I believe it would be appropriate to address my reply to your message #43 to both you and the rest of the group posting to this thread.\n \n \n\"1. Necrophilia and bestiality are unrelated to homosexuality.\n 2. Homosexuality is not a sexual perversion.\n 3. Homosexuality is not (due to?) a \"misdirected sexual drive\", whatever that is.\"\n\n \n Do we all accept that list of postulates as ex cathedra truths and articles of faith? No demurrers? No questions?\n \n If we accept those requirements as a basis for a dialogue, opposition to gay marriage without the use of twisted logic is impossible. This is precisely the sort of ploy that I pointed out to Kronos in my message #44. And if you think about it what we see is an adamant secular-left mirror-image of the religious-right.\n \n For my part I suggest that we explore thelmoose's list as one of propositions whose truths/falsities depend on the facts and reasoning they rest on.

   "There is no logic between your initial statement and your conclusion. What SOCIETY classifies as \"perversion\" is independent of what the GOVERNMENT recognizes as marriage. Even the classification of \"perversion\" cannot be used as a realistic means for criteria on what is \"marriage\".\n\n \n And that's where I disagree with you. I think the values of society are exactly how society determines govt. policy, and marriage legality is no exception. It happens all the time--everytime a president is voted in (who might appoint SCOTUS judges), everytime a ballot initiative takes place, everytime a public judge is not voted in, everytime an amendment is passed or overturned by another amendment, etc. The will of the people is the bottom line in our society.\n \n \nOne of the things I am amazed at is how some people cannot separate the issues of SOCIETY and GOVERNMENT in their logic.\n\n \n One of the things I am amazed at is how some people think they totally separate. Ours is a govt. by the people and for the people.\n \n \nSociety can determine what it WANTS at large, but that doesn't mean that the government has to follow what society \"wants\".\n\n \n Yes, it does. We make sure it follows what society wants everytime we elect officials and make changes. Govt. is reworked according to society's values every 4 - 8 years or so, and the means are in place to do it more often if need be (via impeachment, ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments, etc.)\n \n \nIn the 2000 election, a majority showed they wanted Al Gore for president. Didn't happen. At the time of Loving v Virginia, a VAST majority in this country did not want interracial marriage. The government acknowledged that the constitution mandated that it be recognized anyways.\n\n \n In the example of Loving, if the people really had wanted that case to not apply, they certainly could have prevented it. They could have passed an amendment, for instance, that made sure interacial marriage would remain illegal. The reason they didn't is because that wasn't something the people felt was high enough of a priority to do so. So the will of the people DID prevail. If society had been strongly enough against interracial marriage, rest assured it would NOT be legal today.\n \n The case of the 2000 election is because of the Electoral college. If the will of the people were to eliminate the electoral college in favor of across-the-board national popular vote, then they certainly could do so. If society felt it was important enough that Gore didn't get the presidency, the electoral college would NOT be in place now, and rest assured Gore would have been nominated and elected elected in 2004. The reason it didn't happen is because society really DIDN'T will it.\n \n \nSociety can \"want\" all it wants.\n Society can \"disapprove\" all it wants.\n\n \n And society can DO what it wants, if it wants to badly enough. Not only are you sorely naive for thinking otherwise, it shows a serious lack of understanding on your part regarding how our system works. \n \n \nWhy don't you read my Court quotes above and actually ADDRESS them instead of insisting on false statements?\n\n \n My statements aren't false at all, but sure, I'll deal with your quotes . . .\n \"Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate state interest\"\n -- Kansas v Limon\nI don't think this really addresses what I'm talking about, which is society's values. You can call that \"morality\" if you want, but it's beside the point; if it is the will of the people there is nothing any judge can do about that. Our system is set up to allow the people to elect, pass ballot initiatives, and even alter the constitution if it so chooses. Whether or not that's due to moral values doesn't matter--if the people want to do it they can.\n \"In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded that (1) the fact a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice, and (2) individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of \"liberty\" protected by due process. That analysis should have controlled Bowers, and it controls here.\"\n -- Lawrence v Texas\n\n \n I disagree with this if society at large wills it--society can do what it wants as long as it follows due process. Sorry; like it or not it's the people's government. This ruling is moot; it's all bark and no bite and toothless because to truly and completely enforce it would be to eliminate democracy. Like it or not if the people want to do it, it will be done.\n \n But even aside from that, you've made a jump in assuming that society's view of what is \"perversion\" is automatically a form of \"morality.\" I didn't use that term here. What if society thinks murder is immoral? They do, you know. By your use of quotes you must think murder must be allowed to be legal! After all, morality can't be a factor, you say. Your view on this is simply unrealistic. Society itself determines what it in it's best interests. Not you. What will you do if society decides gay marriage is not in it's best interest? Or that making sure it's illegal IS in it's best interest? They certainly can, and there's nothing you can do about that. I would argue the reason gay marriage is failing in state after state is exactly because society has decided it's NOT in society's best interest.",

   "Dear Kronos,\n \n In reply to your post #47 of 7/30/06: \n \n \n\"Really? I'm a straight that supports gay rights. Where does that put me?\"\n\n \n Yes, it looks like you're outside that classification. In your case, and if we don't get into religion, perhaps we could say that you're either a Gay Liberation ideologue or a secular realist. Let's face it, maybe I'm wrong; I haven't denied that. \n \n But you bring up an interesting point. I classify myself as a factual/rational realist, and to be so I don't see how one can actually approve of homosexuality and consider it a suitable basis for marriage. How would you classify yourself? \n \n \n\"But at least I see that my supposition about your line of reasoning was correct. I admit I haven't been following this thread closely (didn't seem to be much point) so I'll just point out that if your \"reasoning\" relies on people accepting that a pergorative term applies to them, than your reasoning is not in fact based on reason. If you think that something is bad, you have to show that it's bad, not that it fits defintion 2a of a word which is generally considered insulting.\"\n\n \n Hmmmm....... That's a bit complicated and I'm not sure I quite follow you. Let me break your point down: \n \n \n\"...if your \"reasoning\" relies on people accepting...\" \n\n \n If my \"reasoning\", as you put it, is sound, then I rely on people's accepting it. Of course if that reasoning, no matter how sound, leads to a conclusion that is displeasing, I know that many or most of the people finding it so won't accept it. (Watch this thread and the reaction of the idea of test-criteria for determining what is sound reasoning.) \n \n \"...that a pergorative term applies to them...\"\n \n I see nothing wrong with pejorative terminology if it denote accurately, is based on sound reasoning and is not simply an insult. Take calling a person a drunk as an example. If he's not, to call him a drunk is unreasonable. If he is, then it is reasonable.\n \n \n\"...than your reasoning is not in fact based on reason.\"\n \n \n I'm sorry, Kronos; you lose me there. Is there something I've failed to grasp?\n \n \n\"Let me give an example. I disapprove of mass-murderers. I think they're psychopaths. Can I express my disapproval without using that, or any other, pergorative term? Sure! I can discuss how killing is bad, about the grief he's causing to the victims families, about the need for a socitey to have laws. There are lots of concrete things I can talk about to show why I disapprove of mass murderers without resorting to name calling. If your disapproval of gays is based on anything concrete than you could explain that to us. If all you have is a personal feeling that gays are icky, than don't sleep with anyone of your gender yourself, but don't expect anyone to call that rational.\"\n\n \n \n I suspect that you would use the term \"mass-murderer\" and wouldn't object to its use by others, if you were not in the Gay Liberation environment of this thread. For my part I see nothing wrong with calling a murderer a murderer or a thief a thief and I see no need to look for euphemisms or describe what a murderer or thief does to avoid calling him what he is. And I suppose we both realize how widely used the term \"homophobe\" is in Gay circles. (See my post to gaetano #59.) You can't be too thin-skinned in this matter. Civility should suffice. \n \n The distinction I make, which I already covered in post #22, is between calling a black a nigger or a homosexual a ###. Those terms are used to insult, not denote. On the other hand the term \"sexual perversion\" is used to denote and can be explained factually and rationally, but because it is taken only as denigrating, one has to go into the most exquisite detail in order to lay the concept out in factual and rational terms.\n \n But why waste time explaining the concept if we have no agreed-upon test-criteria for judging the truth/falsity of what I lay out? As I see it the fundamental conflict here is in regard to whether or not those test-criteria are going to revolve around the identification of pleasing/displeasing, on the one hand, or true/false on the other.\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

For your convenience here is you oft-referred to post 22: 'Okay, now getting back to the twisted logic idea that is one component of this thread, have you found me making any errors of fact or reasoning using the test-criteria that I proposed --fallacies or contradictions-- back in my message #22?'\"\n\n \n They're right there in the sentence you quote: fallacies and contradictions. \n \n In order for you to understand the concept of a sexual perversion that you want a definition of, we have to have an agreed-on means of separating truths from falsities. The test-criteria that I am proposing are fallacies and contradictions and only fallacies and contradictions. If either of us involves himself in a fallacy or contradiction, he has a falsity to discard which automatically gets us closer to a truth, at least in a provisional sense.\n \n In other words why waste my time and yours if truths/falsities are to be determined on the basis of a pleasing/displeasing criterion whereby what is pleasing is true and displeasing is false?\n \n Do you have any further questions on the point?\n \n Skip the jibberish if it makes no sense to you.\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "Dear thelmoose,\n \n In reply to your post #58 of 7/30/06:\n \n \n\"You want to identify 'falsities' in belief by using two and only two criteria.\"\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \n\"-what specifically do you mean by fallacy and contradiction as test criteria?\"\n\n \n If either of us tries to base a contention on either a fallacy or contradiction, he has an error to discard.\n \n \n\"You speak as thought these are universally agreed upon terms.\"\n \n \n Aren't they?\n \n \n\"- why two and only two?\"\n\n \n To avoid lapsing into subjectivities as much as possible, especially the pleasing/dipleasing one, and because I think that they're all that are necessary. I won't hold you to any other test-criteria. If what you contend does not, on probing, contain either a fallacy or contradiction, I must accept it as true.\n \n \n\"- why are you doing this at all?\"\n\n \n To get to the truths of the matter we're discussing.

In a game the only goal is to win. To prevail. In contrast, in the exchange we're involved in if you have to discard an error, even though a pleasant one, you gain a truth. You win. In that sense it's not a game.\n \n \n\"You still have not given evidence for you assertions.\n 1. The definition of sexual perversion.\n 2. That homosexuality is one of those perversions.\"\n\n \n And, frankly, I wouldn't waste my time and yours trying to unless we have a solid, nailed-down basis for knowing what you'll accept as objective truths, how they can be identified beyond the pleasing/displeasing test-criterion.\n \n Any further clarification that I can provide?\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "And that's where I disagree with you. I think the values of society are exactly how society determines govt. policy, and marriage legality is no exception. It happens all the time--everytime a president is voted in (who might appoint SCOTUS judges), everytime a ballot initiative takes place, everytime a public judge is not voted in, everytime an amendment is passed or overturned by another amendment, etc. The will of the people is the bottom line in our society.\n\n No. It isn't.\n The constitution habitually puts in road-blocks to the people, EXPRESSLY HINDERING the people in the efforts of insuring justice and equality.\n \n The CIA world factbook describes the U.S. government as \"Constitution-based federal republic; strong democratic tradition\".\n We have a democratic TRADITION, but the basis of our government is CONSTITUTION BASED.\n \n \n \nOne of the things I am amazed at is how some people think they totally separate. Ours is a govt. by the people and for the people.\n\n Ours is not a pure democracy.\n The constitution puts many checks upon the people to prevent the prejudice of the masses from discriminating against the rights of the minority.\n \n \n \nYes, it does. We make sure it follows what society wants everytime we elect officials and make changes. Govt. is reworked according to society's values every 4 - 8 years or so, and the means are in place to do it more often if need be (via impeachment, ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments, etc.)\n\n Jyoshu, I'm not saying that examples of democracy exist.\n I'm saying that in PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, we do not have democratic traditions.\n Take a look at our history with blacks. NUMEROUS examples of where the local \"will of the people\" wanted discrimination and segregation, and the \"will of the people\" was ignored in favor of equality.\n \n \n \nIn the example of Loving, if the people really had wanted that case to not apply, they certainly could have prevented it. They could have passed an amendment, for instance, that made sure interacial marriage would remain illegal. The reason they didn't is because that wasn't something the people felt was high enough of a priority to do so. So the will of the people DID prevail.\n\n This is inane and missing the forest for the trees.\n Suppose a man had a burglar break into his home and lock him in the closet while the burglar raped his wife. The burglar doesn't know the lock doesn't work, and that the man keeps a gun in his closet. The man could decide not to risk his wife's life by approaching them with the gun, and chooses not to escalate matters.\n By your logic, that means the man WANTS his wife to get raped...\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n You're missing the big picture here. You can't start out with \"polls show that the majority didn't want interracial marriage\", and then conclude that the will of the people was satisfied. Interracial marriage WAS LEGALIZED. It's obvious that the will of the people WAS NOT satisfied.\n \n And even then, you're missing an even bigger irony on the analogy parallel, covered next.\n \n \n \nIf society had been strongly enough against interracial marriage, rest assured it would NOT be legal today.\n\n Jyoshu, are you aware that a MAJORITY in this country do not want a constitutional amendment against gay marriage?\n The will of the people IS ALSO not strong enough on the issue of gay marriage.\n And it's falling each year. Each year that the polls have examined people's opinions on gay marriage have found that the opposition to gay marriage is less than the year before.\n \n Ergo, if gay marriage is legalized and there is no anti-gay marriage amendment, by your logic, the people will have their will satisfied, right?\n \n \n \nThe case of the 2000 election is because of the Electoral college.\n\n You're missing the point.\n We have rules in place which supplant the majority rules doctrine.\n It is possible to change those rules, but using your logic, the majority must not want the majority to get its way...\n \n \n \nAnd society can DO what it wants, if it wants to badly enough. Not only are you sorely naive for thinking otherwise, it shows a serious lack of understanding on your part regarding how our system works.\n\n Jyoshu, I understand that \"society\" can influence the government via laws, and in this case an amendment would be required.\n But the point is that there IS NO amendment.\n Two attempts at an amendment HAVE FAILED.\n A majority DO NOT WANT the amendment.\n \n Ergo, we're stuck with the current constitutional analysis. \n \n \n \nMy statements aren't false at all, but sure, I'll deal with your quotes . . .\"Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate state interest\"\n -- Kansas v Limon I don't think this really addresses what I'm talking about, which is society's values. You can call that \"morality\" if you want, but it's beside the point; if it is the will of the people there is nothing any judge can do about that.\n\n Using your logic, the will of the people IS CLEARLY not strong enough to supplant a constitutional ruling.\n QED, you have to address the statement as is.\n \n UNLESS the people ACTUALLY DO change the constitution to state that moral disapproval of a group IS a legitimate state interest, we have to rely on the EXISTING situation.\n \n Deal with what we got. Not what you wish for.\n \n \n \nOur system is set up to allow the people to elect, pass ballot initiatives, and even alter the constitution if it so chooses. Whether or not that's due to moral values doesn't matter--if the people want to do it they can.\n\n And the people don't want a constitutional amendment.\n Ergo, you're stuck with \"Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate state interest\"\n \n \n \nI disagree with this if society at large wills it...\n\n Your second reply is pretty much the same.\n You rely on hypothetical future hopes (\"IF society at large wills it...\")\n Until you actually DO have \"society at large\" passing a constitutional amendment, it is your conjecture which is irrelevant.\n \n \n \nThis ruling is moot; it's all bark and no bite and toothless because to truly and completely enforce it would be to eliminate democracy. \n\n And this is where you get TRULY funny.\n This ruling is \"moot\" because you have an \"if\" whereby society COULD pass a constitutional amendment to put something else into the constitution???\n ROFLMAO!\n How about we stick to REALITY until we actually get that done, eh?\n YOUR REPLY is what is moot. The ruling stands.\n \n One of the funny things here that you don't seem to realize is that the CURRENT RULINGS on gay marriage DO NOT try to take the \"society can say whatever moral disapproval it wants, therefore we don't recognize gay marriage\" approach. They can't, because these legal rulings ARE NOT moot.\n \n \n \nBut even aside from that, you've made a jump in assuming that society's view of what is \"perversion\" is automatically a form of \"morality.\"\n\n It's not a jump.\n READ the definition of \"pervert\": \n 1 a : to cause to turn aside or away from what is good or true or morally right : CORRUPT b : to cause to turn aside or away from what is generally done or accepted : MISDIRECT\n 2 a : to divert to a wrong end or purpose : MISUSE b : to twist the meaning or sense of : MISINTERPRET\n \n It's a perfect example of a \"moral\" classification. You contest that fact without actually showing why...\n \n \n \nI didn't use that term here. What if society thinks murder is immoral? They do, you know. By your use of quotes you must think murder must be allowed to be legal!\n\n And by your lack of reasoning, you would let murderers go...\n You don't get it Jyoshu, although it's been explained MULTIPLE times to you.\n \n It's regarding moral disapproval OF A GROUP. Murder laws are about AN ACTION.\n Murder laws are not about discriminating against people who commit murder, but rather the ACT of committing murder.\n It's funny how you hype on that distinction, yet you obviously fail to recognize it here...\n \n There are other areas where your analysis is fatally flawed in misinterpreting those statements (like how A not being a good reason does not mean B can't be used as a reason when A is present), but I think I'll leave it at that, considering I find that observation INCREDIBLY poignant and tying in with other observations I have made where it's not really the \"action\" that people are JUST disapproving of.",

   "\n Yes, it looks like you're outside that classification. In your case, and if we don't get into religion, perhaps we could say that you're either a Gay Liberation ideologue or a secular realist. Let's face it, maybe I'm wrong; I haven't denied that. \n\n Sorry if you've covered this, but I'm curious. The term \"Gay Liberation\" hasn't been in common usage for about 30 years. Why do you use it?\n \n \n\n But you bring up an interesting point. I classify myself as a factual/rational realist, and to be so I don't see how one can actually approve of homosexuality and consider it a suitable basis for marriage. How would you classify yourself? \n\n I've never really seen a need to classify myself. I believe in truth, fairness, and rationality. If you have a label for people like that than I guess it applies to me.\n \n \n\n Hmmmm....... That's a bit complicated and I'm not sure I quite follow you. Let me break your point down: \n \n ...\n \n I'm sorry, Kronos; you lose me there. Is there something I've failed to grasp?\n \n\n I think the problem is that you took one sentence and split it up into three phrases, which you analyzed independantly of each other. No wonder it didn't make sense. My point was simply that if you think something is bad, the way to show that it's bad isn't to simply define it as bad. Reasoning is based on real evidence, not linguistic tricks. \n \n \n \n\n I see nothing wrong with pejorative terminology if it denote accurately, is based on sound reasoning and is not simply an insult. Take calling a person a drunk as an example. If he's not, to call him a drunk is unreasonable. If he is, then it is reasonable.\n\n Sure, but that's not quite what's happening here. You want people to accept a broad definition first, then you're going to turn around and apply it to gays, right? And then say that being gay is bad because a bad term applies to them. That's not reasoning, that's just word games. \n \n \n\n I suspect that you would use the term \"mass-murderer\" and wouldn't object to its use by others, \n\n Actually, the term I was refering to was \"psychopath\". I think that may change your take on what I was saying.\n \n \n\n But why waste time explaining the concept if we have no agreed-upon test-criteria for judging the truth/falsity of what I lay out? As I see it the fundamental conflict here is in regard to whether or not those test-criteria are going to revolve around the identification of pleasing/displeasing, on the one hand, or true/false on the other.\n \n\n Why waste time on this at all? As I said, it appears that all you're doing is playing games with words, devoid of any input from reality. If being gay were wrong than you should be able to show that it's wrong, even if we can't agree on the label to put on the wrongness. Show us how being gay is bad first, than we can worry about a name for the problem.",

If I gloss over or miss something you feel important, then please sing out and point it out.\n \n Otherwise, you need to realize where the real disjoint is in this discussion.\n I AM NOT denying the fact that the people can put together a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. I am not denying the fact that the people could amend the constitution to state that \"moral disapproval of a group\" is a legitimate state interest.\n I yield that HYPOTHETICAL potential.\n \n But those are all HYPOTHETICAL OCCURRENCES.\n Let's say I came up with a mathematical proof that proved that the solution of an equation = X.\n You step forward and point out that we could all agree to eliminate the number \"2\" from the number system, changing the solution to my equation to Y instead.\n Now, we all COULD eliminate the number \"2\" from the number system and it would indeed alter the solution to my equation, but unless that were to ACTUALLY HAPPEN your observation is moot and meaningless.\n \n So, unless the people ACTUALLY DO what we both admit they can do, the court's rulings ARE NOT moot. In fact, they have already been applied in a variety of cases demonstrating they ARE NOT moot.\n \n Got it?\n \n So to summarize, pointing out \"well, this COULD happen\" is not going to win any points in a debate.

The will of the enough people really didn't want it to be illegal, or else they would have made it so via amendment.\n\n And this is part of my point.\n In today's society, we have anti-gay marriage amendments and legislation written at the state level.\n In past times, we had anti-interracial marriage amendments and legislation written at the state level.\n But the CONSTITUTION SUPERCEDES those issues.\n \n Therefore, if preventing gay marriage violates the constitution and the people have not amended the constitution, we reach the EXACT SAME CONCLUSION about gay marriage.\n \n \n \n \nYes, we can, because the people had other means to make it illegal had they so wanted, and they didn't do so. It obviously wasn't high enough of a priority.\n\n And quite frankly, gay marriage has a similar BUT LOWER priority today.\n The anti-gay marriage opponents ARE IN THE MINORITY for amending the constitution.\n They have TRIED TWICE to amend the constitution, and twice failed.\n The gay marriage issue IS ALSO not high enough of a priority...\n \n \n \n \nAnd even then, you're missing an even bigger irony on the analogy parallel, covered next. Jyoshu, are you aware that a MAJORITY in this country do not want a constitutional amendment against gay marriage?\n The will of the people IS ALSO not strong enough on the issue of gay marriage.\n\n \nI'm not missing this at all, but I think given your stance here it's one YOU may need to realize more so than you do. You're the one taking the stance here that the will of the people should have absolutely no bearing on this, either way.\n\n 1) The will of the people SHOULD NOT have a bearing on issues of minority rights. If the only real reason you have for preventing a minority right is \"will of the people\", then it's obvious that it is nothing more than a prejudice. And as pointed out earlier, the courts currently hold that \"moral disapproval\" of a group is insufficient reason.\n Until the people ACTUALLY CHANGE that, that interpretation of the constitution stands.\n The people DO NOT interpret the constitution. The courts do.\n 2) While the will of the people SHOULD NOT have a bearing on issues of minority RIGHTS, I do acknowledge that the will of the people CAN HAVE an impact on the issue of minority rights. The main recourse being a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\n And as previously discussed, you don't have that. It doesn't look like you'll ever have that.\n \n \n \nThat's right. I've made clear here numerous times that I don't support the amendment, but you deceptively act as if I've never said so. You also need to remember that the amendment isn't technically to outlaw gay marriage, but to define marriage in a certain way.\n\n 1) There was nothing \"deceptive\" in what I said with regards to your stated position.\n Can you point to what I ACTUALLY SAID and show how I was trying to \"deceive\" people on your position?\n Of course you can't. You're just trying to get a knee-jerk jab in...\n 2) The \"technicalities\" are irrelevant to the arguments at hand, so why bring them up.\n If I phrased everything in the future as \"define marriage in a certain way\", it wouldn't change my arguments in the slightest.\n Remember, miscegenation laws \"defined marriage in a certain way\" as well.\n It \"defined\" marriage as requiring the same race. The \"definitions\" are not immune from constitutionality challenges.\n \n \n \nI also think that you're blaise' assumption that an amendment isn't going to happen is dangerous on your part. The trend in this country right now is moving more against gay marriage, not in favor of it.\n\n Prove it.\n And note I AM TALKING TREND here. Not just the current score-card...\n If you have a football game where the home team is behind 21-7 at the end of the first quarter, and they have a trend of scoring two touch-downs a quarter while the opponent scores only one a quarter, the home team WILL WIN even though they are currently behind.\n \n You currently have a winning score, but a LOSING TREND.\n \n \n \nNo, not just \"influence.\" Society DETERMINES what happens, ultimate.\n\n Unless, according to you, they don't really want it to happen because they want it to happen, the courts say otherwise, and society doesn't take it to the next level.\n \n What you may not realize is that miscegenation laws had HIGHER SUPPORT than the anti-gay marriage laws do today. Miscegenation laws were favored THREE TO ONE, while anti-gay marriage laws are only favored two to one.\n \n And NO poll has ever shown a majority support for a constitutional amendment.\n \n \n \nApparently many of the activists in your movement don't think so, given that they fight so hard to make sure that amendment doesn't happen. But go ahead . . . have your movement assume it's just a mere \"hypothetical\".\n\n Jyoshu, it's an issue of not counting your chickens until they hatch.\n IF they do hatch, then you've got a point. And my side realizes that. I admit to that.\n We are doing our best to ensure that they don't hatch.\n \n But the point is that UNTIL YOU GET a hatched constitutional amendment, you can't count it.\n Got it? \n \n \n \nI'm saying that ruling is unenforceable. It can have no teeth. It's a symbolic ruling. If the people want badly enough for something to be a certain way, it will be that way. That's the bottom line.\n\n Bullspit.\n It is CURRENTLY ENFORCEABLE. You don't seem to get that THOSE COURT CASES where those statements were made are an EXAMPLE OF THE ENFORCEABILITY of that standard. It's also an example of the non-existent \"mooting\" hypothetical actions of the \"will of the people\".\n \n YOU will need a change to the status quo to make it moot.\n You admit \"If the people want...\"\n You're basically arguing that something IS NOT a certain way, because we COULD HAVE a different situation.\n And that's inane. You're arguing that the equation doesn't = X because we could strike \"2\" from the number system.\n \n \n \nAlright, given that definition, I'll concede that.\n\n So you were arguing to utilize \"perversion\" as a standard, but you had no clue as to what the word actually meant?\n Is that what I'm hearing?\n \n \n \nNo, YOU don't get it. Both are about actions. You've been explained this many times now.\n\n 0) Jyoshu, it's not an issue of \"not getting it\". It's an issue of not agreeing with your interpretation of how things are REALLY playing out. I understand fine what you are saying. I also see it as a non-existent distinction.\n 1) I've heard people say that they don't have a problem with blacks, but they do have a problem with them \"acting black\".\n In observing those people, they are invariably prejudiced against ALL blacks regardless of whether or not they ACT black. They are demonstrating prejudice against ALL blacks and not just the \"action\" of \"acting black\".\n \n The issue with gays is quite similar. The legislation restricts ALL gays regardless of whether they have gay sex or not. In fact, the law doesn't make ANY EFFORT to distinguish inbetween gays who have gay sex, and gays who do not have gay sex.\n \n If you wish to contradict this with ACTUAL LOGIC instead of just claims, I recommend you do so.\n \n 2) Your complaint about \"not getting it\" is in some ways pointless.\n The opinion of the mechanisms that you and I have essentially don't wind up changing the law.\n The COURTS THEMSELVES have made these observations, and it is the COURTS who are applying a logic similar to mine to these situations.\n So you can insist that you see the sky as one color. The people who JUDGE the CONSTITUTIONALITY of these laws are saying something different.\n And unless you pass an amendment requiring them to see what you see, they are going to continue to hand out rulings saying you are wrong.",

It's how the situation is CURRENTLY working. The EXISTING rules.\n You are HYPOTHETICALLY arguing that the rules could change. And my point is that the rules HAVE NOT changed, ergo, arguing about the situation with changed rules doesn't make much sense.\n \n \n \nWe don't work only on the assumption that things HAVE happened, we work on the assumption that they CAN happen.\n\n Who is this \"we\" you talk about?

Nada. No, that's not likely to happen, nor would I want it to happen in terms of an amendment, but the point is that the process doesn't work the way you say.\n\n Why?\n Because you say so?\n I find it interesting to note that I am giving COURT PRECEDENT for why the situation is as I describe.\n Yet all you do in reply is give empty claims of situations with no proof of the specifics of your claim.\n I give specific court rulings and statements from those court rulings, and you claim they are moot and unenforceable.\n \n All you are giving is your opinion and a bunch of empty platitudes which don't speak to the SPECIFICS of OUR SITUATION.\n \n \n \nOurs is a govt. by the people for the people. The constitution doesn't own our society; rather we own the constitution. And the body of laws around it.\n\n Again, society has to AMEND the constitution in order for society to supercede the constitution.\n Argue against that, or keep ignoring it and ignoring what I am saying.\n I'm guessing you'll do the latter...\n \n \n \nSure the constitution supercedes, but there's been no ruling overturning any of those state level amendments. They stand. For now, the PEOPLE have spoken.\n\n And to that end we have examined the RATIONALES GIVEN in those rulings and noted how arbitrary they are and how they create standards which are essentially unheard of in non-gay application.\n \n To that end, we have separate arguments about WHY those rulings are invalid.\n \n \n \nI disagree. I think a society should be able to set it's standards, even in terms of minorities.\n\n What you \"think\" and what the constitution ACTUALLY SAYS are two entirely separate issues.\n Have you ever read the 14th amendment and read up on the application of \"equal protection\"?\n \n You have your opinion about how the government should be run, but it's not consistent with the way things ARE ACTUALLY run.\n Tell me Jyoshu. Can you tell me any REAL EXAMPLE (a successful one) of a case when the majority restricted the rights of a minority based solely on majority opinion?\n \n \n \nFirst, I am not on that team, and so I say yet again, I am not in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Apparently, you simply cannot read! Or more likely, your are being intentionally obtuse by pretending I haven't declared that more than once now.\n\n Jyoshu, Jyoshu, Jyoshu.\n Apparently you insist on obfuscation, and I had such high hopes for you in the way you were presenting yourself in this thread. I should have realized they would be short-lived.\n Did I say the \"football game\" was about a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT???\n No. That was YOU PUTTING WORDS into my mouth so that you could claim I was misrepresenting you.\n So either you are incapable of realizing the obvious, that I DID NOT claim the football game was a \"constitutional amendment\", or you were purposely misrepresenting my statements.\n \n And furthermore, my obtuse opponent, you SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REASON that the \"football game\" I was talking about WAS NOT the constitutional amendment.\n Remember? I have REPEATEDLY stated that there is a majority OPPOSITION to the gay marriage amendment.\n So WHY would I claim that example was about a gay marriage amendment.\n \n Come now Jyoshu. You should be able to THINK about some of these things instead of blindly trying to accuse me of what you are so obviously guilty of.\n \n The \"football game\" I was referring to was SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING your prior discussion (which should have been seen by you in context, unless you were dishonestly misrepresenting me or just too lazy to figure it out) that you were WINNING the gay marriage battle.\n It was NOT referencing a gay marriage federal amendment, like you dishonestly pretend.\n \n ..........\n \n Oh my.

   "Second, do you actually think getting gay marriage in ONE state and losing it in many others is a trend in your direction????? \n\n 1) Gee. HERE you seem to realize my analogy was about GAY MARRIAGE ITSELF and NOT a gay marriage amendment.\n WoW! Guess you slipped up in revealing your dishonesty on that one.\n \n 2) Do you understand what \"trend\" means?\n Take my example. At the end of the second quarter, what will be the score?\n Away Team: 28. Home Team: 21. Home team is still losing.\n Third quarter? Away Team 35. Home Team 35. Finally tied it.\n Fourth quarter? Home team wins...\n \n Your discussion of these things ARE NOT looking at a trend. They are looking ONLY at the score at ONE PARTICULAR TIME.\n You're like the Away Team that is winning in the second quarter (and most of the third) that hasn't figured out that they are going to LOSE THE GAME...\n \n TREND Jyoshu.\n Do you know what the word means?\n It means talking about the CHANGE in the support / opposition to gay marriage OVER TIME.\n \n \n \nHow do you come to that conclusion? The trend is obviously the other direction. We could break it down state-by-state if you like, but I think you know what the result of that would be, and it sure wouldn't show a trend in your favor since ballot initiatives have started up on this issue.\n\n I don't have the link with me, but gallup poll has shown a CONSISTENT FALL in the anti-gay marriage numbers and a CONSISTENT RISE in the pro-gay marriage numbers. (Note: Fall and Rise are TREND words.)\n If you look at the COMPARISON of those numbers, the anti-gay marriage number is still higher than the pro-gay marriage numbers, by a factor of about two to one.\n \n But like the TREND in the football game, you cannot predict the OUTCOME of the game just based on the score in the first quarter. If you have the first quarter score AND THE TREND, you can clearly see that the team that was winning in the first quarter will ACTUALLY LOSE the game.\n \n \n \nAnd I SURE wouldn't get into court cases if I were you--gay activists are already shifting their sights to legislation because they've been losing so badly in the courts as of late.\n\n 1) Do you have any news articles on this thing you are discussing?\n I'm curious.\n \n 2) Pshaw! People on the pro-gay marriage side need to sit back and relax. The away team is winning right now, but they are losing the war.\n And from an objective stand-point, where are we? Ten years ago, gay marriage wasn't recognized by the government.\n Today? Still not recognized by the government with the exception of one state.\n \n Not much of a change, except for one state getting better.\n \n 3) From a historical stance, Loving v Virginia decided that interracial marriage laws were unconstitutional based on the 14th amendment.\n The 14th amendment was legalized ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE Loving v Virginia was decided.\n That's like having a lego set sitting around that turns into a house, and realizing that's what it is and making the house one hundred years later. Silly, but that's the way things work in this country we call the U.S. of A.\n Gay marriage is similar in that it will take a while before the courts start realizing that the legos are there for the gay marriage house, but they just haven't put them together yet. \n I guess that makes Massachusetts a prodigy :) \n \n \n \nI've never argued against that, and by shifting your argument to whether or not gay marriage will get support like interracial marriage you've changed directions with your arguments here. (no doubt because it's easier for you to defend.)\n\n < yawn <\n Jyoshu? I am capable of holding a battle on multiple fronts.\n I have not abandoned my other argument, but rather I have introduced an ADDITIONAL argument as to why gay marriage JUST PLAIN WILL happen despite what the nay-sayers say.\n \n Amazingly, the courts acknowledged the country's opinions on interracial marriage were wrong while the country said \"no interracial marriage\" at a rate of three-to-one.\n \n I don't know what the rate will be when the courts eventually come to their senses on this one. Taking a look at interracial marriage, I believe EVERY state had to have a court revoke the laws.\n \n The count is now two-to-one against. It may be possible that the count will have to eventually be majority support for gays before something gets done. I doubt it, but it could happen.\n \n The point is that there are TWO WAYS that the opponents of gay marriage could lose. Not that I had one way, and I now abandon it for another way...\n \n \n \nThe issue I took is your idea that society can't decide these issues based on the will of the people. But in fact, the very opposite is true--the will of the people has been the main factor in every change that has ever happened to our society.\n\n 1) Miscegenation laws.\n 2) Segregation laws.\n 3) Rosa Parks.\n \n Some issues have come down to the will of the people voting against inequality.\n Other issues have come down to the will of the people being overturned by the courts.\n \n I challenge you to show me ANY case in history where the equality of the courts was overturned by the will of the people.",

They can disagree with the behavior if they want.\n\n Can you see how Christians who condemn somebody for an ACTION that they have no knowledge of a person ACTUALLY violating is contradictory with being opposed to JUST the action?\n \n \n \nSo you say, but those who oppose it don't think so.\n\n Fine.\n Show me the gay sex in that display.\n SHOW me where the gay sex is...\n \n They are seeing a black person, and thinking \"acting black\"...\n ... or at least claiming \"acting black\" is their motivation, when there IS NO LINE inbetween \"acting\" black and \"being\" black.\n \n You claim that they \"think\" this way, but actions speak louder than words...\n If a person said he was opposed to Christians singing loudly, but then objected to seeing Christian jewelry, wouldn't that demonstrate his REAL concern wasn't about \"singing\", but rather a prejudice against Christians in general?\n ------------------------------------------------------\n \n Something else you failed to address. Again...\n \n This is like the example I gave earlier which you predictably avoided. Where people claim they are just against people \"acting black\" (an action) but not against just \"being black\".\n The truth of the matter comes out when they show their prejudice towards ALL who ARE BLACK and not just those who \"act black\".\n \n Likewise, the people are objecting to the PEOPLE who are gay and ASSUMING that they are guilty of an action. Demonstrating their prejudice and unwillingness to care about the distinction which you claim is important.\n \n \n\"Well since you didn't address my points, I'll assume you're done!

I will talk about homosexuality.\"\n \n \n Taking that as summarizing your objection, what that demand decocts to, in so many words, is that I have a false belief that you don't have.\n \n But what I believe is coming up here, as in my experience inevitably does in this matter, is an attempt to arbitrarily seize control of the discussion, deciding what topics will be discussed and what topics will be prohibited. \n \n Neither of us controls the topics used in the approach of the other. More directly to your point as you give it, you don't control the discussion here. You approach the matter as you see fit and I do the same. No topics forbidden by either you or me . The only response with which we each provide the other is in regard to errors of fact and reasoning. Untruths. An accusation of fixating doesn't do it. An accusation of having used a fallacy or contradiction does. \n \n What I've attempted to do, as appropriate to the controversy, is address the matter of sexual perversions, what they are, their nature, and how homosexuality can be classified as one on the basis of facts and sound reasoning. To do that by the use of more easily understood examples of such perversions is completely legitimate, as far as I can see. It does not involve me in either an error of fact or reasoning --unless you can show me that it does.\n \n Please read my post #72 to thelmoose on this. It explains where I'm coming from and what you are pretty obviously exemplifying the attempt to use the criterion of pleasing/displeasing rather than true/false. \n \n \n \n\"I responded to your message #22 with my post #55.

N.

   "Dear Kronos,\n \n In reply to your post #76 of 7/31/06:\n \n \n\"Sorry if you've covered this, but I'm curious. The term 'Gay Liberation' hasn't been in common usage for about 30 years. Why do you use it?\"\n \n \n Because it seems a handy label for the movement to accept homosexuality as normal. What have you used or heard used for that movement?\n \n \n\"My point was simply that if you think something is bad, the way to show that it's bad isn't to simply define it as bad. Reasoning is based on real evidence, not linguistic tricks.\" \n\n \n I'm trying, to the extent possible, to say away from the terms good and bad as too generalized and subjective. I feel a bit safer using the term \"sexual perversion\" because I think I can reason that out better --and do it in detail-- if I'm permitted to do so. There's some doubt about the permission.\n \n \n\"You want people to accept a broad definition first, then you're going to turn around and apply it to gays, right?\"\n\n \n You're right. The broad definition is \"a misdirected reproductive drive\", with appropriate examples where such a misdirection can be pretty clearly discerned, then show how that definition applies equally well to homosexuality. There is currently some doubt as to whether I'll be permitted to go through with the complete presentation, along with how that contention and presentation are free of errors (fallacies and contradictions).\n In other words, usually a contention is shot down after its presentation is complete. That may not be the case with this one. I see that some on this thread are going to do what they can to see that the presentation will not be completed.\n \n \n\"Why waste time on this at all?\"\n\n \n A valid question and one with which I see nothing wrong. If the topic and thrashing it out to a conclusion doesn't interest you, post to a thread that does.\n \n \n\"As I said, it appears that all you're doing is playing games with words, devoid of any input from reality. If being gay were wrong than you should be able to show that it's wrong, even if we can't agree on the label to put on the wrongness. Show us how being gay is bad first, than we can worry about a name for the problem.\"\n\n \n I guess that all I can say in response is to refer you to the matter of method and procedure laid out in my post #72 to thelmoose. What I'm contending, at its most fundamental, is that a) what I'm saying is true, and that b) I have rational, untwisted test-criteria that I accept as showing that it's not. You must accept some sort of specific, stated test-criteria for proving me wrong, aside from the unexpressed but pretty obvious one of my contention's being displeasing. \n \n Beyond that it's just a matter of going through the procedure/discussion to completion.\n \n Hang in there, Kronos!\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

You have gone round and round in an effort to make sexual perversion and homosexuality interchangeable. But first how does one go about proving that a reproductive drive even exists in homosexuals? It could very well be as non existent as their desire to have sex with a woman. \n Let's explore your definition of sexual perversion as a misdirection of the reproductive drive, as a reason for preventing gay marriage. What are we to do with straight people who use birth control and/or abortion because children have nothing to do with their reason for getting married? In the first example the couple is conciously and deliberately blocking their reproductive drives from going whatever direction that a certain group of people think they should be going. Let's talk more about this \"misdirected reproductive drive\". You have called this a sexual perversion, then attached it to homosexuality. What began as human beings fighting for equal rights at the start of this thread, you have attempted to reduce to \"sexual perversions\" whose rights must be denied. But these so called perverts are being called perverts due to what you claim is a misdirected reproductive drive. It sounds so unobtrusive, like maybe something that AAMCO could fix, while you wait. Tell us how this misdirected reproductive drive is going to harm society if those who suppossedly have this condition are allowed to get married. \n \n Take it from there.

How often does this occur? The figures vary depending on how the question is asked, but homosexuality runs between 3.5% and 10.1% of the population. These numbers are surpisingly consistent across cultures and across time. The percentage of gays who form pair bonds? While I haven't seen numbers, the number has to be quite high.

Subsequent to that your posts continued to be as convoluted and obfuscating as always. I also don't think you are being intellectually honest. You repeatedly espoused attempts at striking common ground with initial agreed-upon assertions, but you never provided any evidence for the assertions you put forth. Despite numerous complaints, you persist in using the wholly subjective and useless term of perversion. You defined your own term of \"misdirected reproductive drive\" that you never defined to anyone's satisfaction and persisted in using despite essentially everyone's objection. It became apparent you had no desire to debate in a coherent and reasonable way. I felt it was foolish to continue. Sorry for the attack, but really, one can get away with so much pompous and tedious double-talk before your fellow debators lose patience.",

Homosexual couples have been surveyed to determine just how pair-bonding compares to heterosexual couples, and it has been found that they tend to bond between pairs (though bonded groups of more than two are not unknown), and those bonds tend to compare to those of heterosexual couples for longevity and depth of bonding. How often does this occur? The figures vary depending on how the question is asked, but homosexuality runs between 3.5% and 10.1% of the population. These numbers are surpisingly consistent across cultures and across time. The percentage of gays who form pair bonds? While I haven't seen numbers, the number has to be quite high.

But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant - society collectively over the separate individuals who compose it - its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates; and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling, against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development and, if possible, prevent the formation of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence; and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs as protection against political despotism.\n",

A drive that is arguably more powerful than the \"reproductive\" drive.\n \n Suppose a heterosexual man boinks a woman with a condom on. They climax, and are satisfied.\n Is the \"reproductive drive\" satisfied? No. No potential for reproduction took place.\n Is the SEXUAL drive satisfied? Yes.\n \n Ergo, considering a presumption that both the reproductive drive and the sexual drive caused the sexual encounter (and note, NOBODY calls it a \"reproductive encounter\"), it's obvious that if the reproductive drive were stronger that the lack of a potential for reproduction at the end would cause the reproductive drive to go unsatisfied.\n \n \n \nHow about my right, when it came up for a vote here in California, to express my belief that \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Did I, as you if a Californian, have a right to vote on that? Is it a truth that I was morally obliged to vote \"no\"? And how and by whom was that truth determined?\n\n 1) You have a right to \"express\" your belief, via the first amendment.\n 2) You do NOT have a right to VOTE IN LAW on that belief, if that belief is contradicted by the constitution.\n 2a) Corollary: You do have the right to vote FOR AN AMENDMENT on that belief, if that belief is contradicted by the constitution.\n \n \n \nVery briefly, the cornerstone of marriage is sexual fidelity. That's irrelevant in homosexuality.\n\n 1) Says who?\n Is a bird telling a fish how the fish lives under the water?\n 2) It is a fallacy to assume that homosexual marriage will affect straight fidelity.\n There is no logical basis for assuming that straight couples will decide to engage in affairs just because gays can marry.\n \n \n \nSecond, why would bestialists not have their rights? Such marriages are now offered and apparently taking place.\n\n Show me a dog that can consciously and intelligently consent to marriage, then we'll talk.\n Bestialists don't have this right because marriage requires cognizant participants.\n \n \n \nThird, and maybe this is the most dangerous aspect of the matter, it has been my experience that when pressed, Gay Liberationists lapse into an irrationality that all of us are supposed to accept.\n\n Fallacy.\n You don't have to \"accept\" anything.

   "To be perfectly honest I think that it's unnatural. Biologically it does not work; the parts just don't fit lol. Now I've heard many different reasons for homosexuality, some biological some sociological. However, I do know that the biological reasons are hotly debated and there's actually no undeniable proof that states that there is a biological factor involved. Anyways, on to the subject of Gay marriage. I believe that it is dangerous to society. I see it as a stepping stone to other discussing acts like polygamy, incest, and even bestiality. Because after all, a polygamist loves all his wives, the brother loves his sister, and my neighbour loves his German Sheppard. Who am I, or who are you to say other wise? I'm drawing the line at what's biologically sound. Also, if gay's are given the right to marry then what's stopping them from adopting a child? In order for a child to be raised the very best way they need both a strong father figure and mother figure. In the name of being politically correct or out of fear of being labelled a homophobe agency adoption agencies will be giving children to the gay family over a tradition family. I think that's a dangerous decision considering its a child's life.",

It just isn't going to go down like that.\n \n \n \nIf your backing is in court cases than prior to 2003 homosexual conduct was really not in the constitution and was created. Not only that, but we have had 3 courts say gay marriage is not a constitutional right and one say it is. I guess with your standard I am right.\n\n You don't know WHAT my standard is...\n I understand completely that I'm bucking the courts on this one. That's why I don't sit here blindly and just say \"they are wrong\" and leave it at that.\n \n I GIVE REASONS WHY they are wrong. I quote the constitution. I quote court cases. I show the reasons WHY my logic is correct.\n \n Unless you do that, then you really are just blindly saying somebody else is wrong without giving anybody any reason to think you're right.\n \n So, Steeeeeve, I've used a court case to prove your interpretation of the 9th amendment is wrong.\n I've used court statements to prove that marriage is a right.\n I've used the 14th amendment, and the example of Loving v Virginia, to show the requirements of the constitution applying to a right.\n \n What the heck have you actually done?",

   "Let's cut through the XXXX Steeeeve. You can stop making things up.\n That may be how you \"interpret\" it, but that is NOT how the courts interpret it.\n I do like that you chose a few wikipedia quotes but you should have excluded the second one as it proves my point. \n \n \nI do not mean to imply that the .... Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government\n\n \n This says that the ninth amendment does not contain constitutionally protected rights in the 9th amendment. Furthermore, who decides what these rights are? Your interpretation makes no sense and thus it is a minority view among judges as shown by you.\n \n \nActually, the 14th amendment establishes that those rights CANNOT be voted away without a legitimate state interest.\n And as I have repeatedly pointed out, morality IS NOT a legitimate state interest.\n Wait, so you admit that the 9th amendment does not protect the \"other\" rights not listed in the constitution? With that we can get to the 14th amendment which doesn't say you need a legitmate state interest...I don't know how judge would know what a legitimate state interest is other than his or her own opinion...you could look at what people voted for but these judges don't seem to like that either. ANd yes, morality is a fine state interest...if interest mattered (which it doesn't). Prostitution is illegal for the sole reason that people think it is wrong. That would be a moral judgement and law...not unconstitutional.\n \n \nSee, THIS is what I don't get...\n A court EXPLICITLY says something cannot be done, and you blindly and without substantiation claim that it's wrong. With no examples and no reasoning.\n \n Sorry, but NO. If you're going to have to contradict the courts, you're going to have to do better than just claim they are wrong.\n If I find a court case that says the opposite or a judge that says the opposite then does that make you wrong? You seem to rely on what a court says so much....why don't you follow this all the time?\n \n \nAnd your opinion that the courts decided it wrong doesn't mean ANYTHING to the law or the courts which interpret the law in conjunction with the constitution.\n So you can believe what you like. It just isn't going to go down like that.\n Well a living constitution has no basis in law so if you support a lawless society then you are ok. I actually support a constitution that means something though.\n \n \nYou don't know WHAT my standard is...\n I understand completely that I'm bucking the courts on this one. That's why I don't sit here blindly and just say \"they are wrong\" and leave it at that.\n Did you really want to get into a debate on why Lawerence was wrongly decided? Issue a challenge on the debate forums.\n \n \nI quote the constitution.\n misquote...\n \n \nI've used court statements to prove that marriage is a right.\n I'll give you three that say the opposite if you like.\n \n \n\n So, Steeeeeve, I've used a court case to prove your interpretation of the 9th amendment is wrong.\n No you didn't. You proved that a minority of judges agree with that. Just look at your reasoning. You think the 9th amendment has constitutional protected rights with them (unknown of course) or perhaps you think it grants rights but are not yet protected until the 14th amendment....either way, these rights are unknown and must be decided by someone. So you say \"hey, why not have a judge do it\". The judge then says \"hmmm...do I like this law or not\"...based on nothing but his own thoughts he or she will decide which things will be rights and what won't be. If you want this then we might as well elect the judges since we would probably want them to think the way we think. \n \n Looking at the alternative, you could say the 9th amendment just recognizes that other amendments exists and that one can't take the bill of rights (in this case) and say \"oh, its not here so therefore you are not granted this\"....but you are granted it unless a law says otherwise. It is almost the same as the 10th amendment which says the powers not in the constitution go to the states or the people. This doesn't imply that the people have powers to be determined by a judges whim. You gotta stretch pretty far and go through a lot of cases to get one understanding of it your way.\n \n It is as simple as reading the text and doing as it says. \n \n Since you like quotes though:\n \n \n\"the Constitution's refusal to 'deny or disparage' other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people.\"\n\n \n A good example of what I am talking about can be found here:\n http://shinbone.home.att.net/nino.htm\n \n With the following example:\n \n \nTo illustrate this, let's use the example of a bill being considered in Hawaii, that would criminalize the eating of dogs and cats. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that this bill passes, and is signed into law. A group of committed cat-eaters then challenges the law, saying that they have a fundamental right to eat cats, although that right is not enumerated in the Constitution. How must the justices rule?\n \n Scalia would conclude that the Constitution does not authorize him to declare an unenumerated right to cat-eating, and that therefore the state of Hawaii has the power to ban the practice in accordance with the Tenth Amendment. His detractors might illogically deduce from this that he thinks there are no such things as unenumerated rights, but that clearly isn't the case, as shown in the following hypothetical.\n \n This time, let's assume that the Hawaiian bill does not pass, but that a lawsuit is subsequently filed by opponents of cat-eating, on the basis that no such right appears in the Constitution. According to Scalia's rules, the cat-eaters win this one. The Ninth Amendment forbids the Court from using the Constitution's silence on the issue as a means of denying or disparaging people's claim to such a right. Therefore, the power to ban cat-eating is not delegated to the federal government under the Constitution, which means that the power is reserved to the states. Since there is no ban in Hawaii, the feline feast can carry on, regardless of whether Antonin Scalia personally approves of it or not.\n",

   "Dear Gaetano,\n \n In reply to your post #98 of 8/1/06: \n \n (Jack:) \"My definition was given to you in my message #38: 'To put it quite briefly, a sexual perversion is a misdirection of the reproductive drive. N. B., the drive, not what is done with the drive.'\"\n \n \n \n Are we to assume that reproductive drive and sex drive are one in the same? If so is it the thought of having children or the sight of naked woman that causes an erection? Reproduction is a by product of the sex drive, if both male and female are capable of reproducing. Reproduction is not a by product of same sex encounters, which an overpopulated world should be thankful for.\n \n \n \n As test-criteria for detecting errors of fact and reasoning, \"fascinating\" and \"pitiful\" don't cut it.\n \n \n I was referring to your desperate attempts to make gay people appear to be somewhat less then what they should be from your exalted point of view.\n \n \n \n By means of observation and reasoning. (But I thought that the idea of drives was pretty much an accepted term in psychology.) Follow what I've started in my post #96 and frame your objection as a rebuttal to what is laid out there. \n \n \n \n To start, you're ignoring a distinction that I took pains to point out to you and emphasize in my message #38 and that you quote, above.\n \n With the term \"reproductive drive\" I'm talking about the blind, primitive biological push to copulate. In the case of males, to release an excess of semen. Birth-control is governed by the functioning of another area of the brain, the ability to reason, to know consequences and act on the basis of that knowledge. Do you see the distinction? If not, what fallacy or contradiction do you see in what I'm saying?\n \n \n The blind primitive biological push to copulate is what is known as a sex drive. What does it have to do with marriage in a modern society that is suppossedly based on commitment and love? The blind primitive push to copulate has one screwing anything with a heartbeat. \n \n \n \n How about my right, when it came up for a vote here in California, to express my belief that \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Did I, as you if a Californian, have a right to vote on that? Is it a truth that I was morally obliged to vote \"no\"? And how and by whom was that truth determined?\n \n \n \n I can't really say what anyone is morally obliged to do since morality has as many variations as \"sexual perversion\". But in a free country it seems odd that you would vote to not extend the freedom you have to those who do not have it. What gives you preference over others who obey the law and pay their taxes? \n \n \n \n Very briefly, the cornerstone of marriage is sexual fidelity. That's irrelevant in homosexuality.\n \n \n \n It appears to be just as irrelevant in heterosexuality as well, from way back when. Thou shalt not commit adultery. That commandment came about because heterosexuals NEVER engage in extra marital affairs. They are all just as pristine as yourself. \n \n \n \n \n Why not stress sharing instead? Don't you like to share? You're not selfish, are you?\n \n \n \n \n Mr. Rodgers used to ask those same questions in regards to children and their toys. What is it that you would like to know if I would share? \n \n \n \n Second, why would bestialists not have their rights? Such marriages are now offered and apparently taking place. \n \n \n \n We have been through this before. We are talking about marriage between two consenting adults.\n \n \n \n \n \n Third, and maybe this is the most dangerous aspect of the matter, it has been my experience that when pressed, Gay Liberationists lapse into an irrationality that all of us are supposed to accept.\n \n \n \n And what exactly is that irrationality all of you are suppossed to accept? It couldn't be any more irrational then your aversion to equailty for fellow gay citizens.\n \n \n \n \n To repeat, I suggest that you follow and participate in what is coming out in my post #96 and in the responses to it.\n \n \n \n Okay, it's about reproduction again. This time I am informed of defective genetalia, and sterility, etc. Please tie this into why homosexuals should not be allowed to be married.\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack\n...................................",

   "Dear foundit66,\n \n In reply to your posts #109 and #114 of 8/1/06:\n \n I can't keep up with you. You just give me too many points for me to deal with them all in even a number of messages.\n \n That being so, I'm going to have to cut back. I can get around to all of your points if given more time, but not as fast as you're bringing them up. I suggest that we slow down a bit and deal with points a bit more systematically. I'll pick out one or two point that I think are the most important and address them. If you think the points I select are not the important ones, select the one or two that you think are the most important and lay them out.\n \n Okay, here's the first couple.\n \n \n\"Contradictions are an obvious indicator of an error. However, other indicators also exist.\"\n\n \n What are they, when dealing with objective facts and reasoning and trying to avoid subjectivities and beliefs as personal preferences?\n \n \n\"You DO NOT EVEN MENTION homosexuals in post #96. So HOW can you think that in any way provides any direction for a discussion on reproductive drive in homosexuals?\"\n \n \n My contention is that homosexuals, male or female, have complementary physical parts of Homo sapiens' reproductive system. I see no difference, in that respect, between homosexuals and heterosexuals. Can we start with that? And does that remedy my failure to mention homosexuals?\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "Dear gaetano,\n \n In reply to your post #121 of 8/1/06: \n \n \n\"Are we to assume that reproductive drive and sex drive are one in the same?\"\n\n \n No, that starts confusing what's involved. Homo sapiens has a reproductive system that is sexual, not a sexual system that is reproductive.\n \n \n\"If so is it the thought of having children or the sight of naked woman that causes an erection?\"\n \n \n I would say that --at least in the majority of cases-- it's the sight of a naked woman.\n \n \n\"Reproduction is a by product of the sex drive, if both male and female are capable of reproducing.\"\n\n \n Why wouldn't it be a product of its source, the reproductive system which comprises both the physical organ and the accompanying drive to use it?\n \n \n\"Reproduction is not a by product of same sex encounters, which an overpopulated world should be thankful for.\"\n\n \n Agreed. That's an advantage shared by pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles. \n \n \n\"The blind primitive biological push to copulate is what is known as a sex drive.\"\n\n \n Yes, if you're talking loosely. \"Sex\" is a much abused word. I, and I presume you, have heard all kinds of things called \"sexy\", from pistols to peace. We need to talk with greater precision in this discussion.\n \n \n\"What does it have to do with marriage in a modern society that is suppossedly based on commitment and love?\"\n\n \n Sexual relations have no necessary connection to committment and love in the sense of philia and agape. (Look them up.) Consider the prostitute and patron.\n \n \n\"The blind primitive push to copulate has one screwing anything with a heartbeat.\"\n\n \n What? How is that determined? Are you talking for yourself?\n \n \n\"I can't really say what anyone is morally obliged to do since morality has as many variations as \"sexual perversion\".\n\n \n But Aren't you saying that I should ( \"should\" meaning moral obligation) vote to grant homosexuals the right to marry? Your whole series of posts seems to be pushing in the direction of granting them that right. Am I mixed up or you?\n \n \n\"But in a free country it seems odd that you would vote to not extend the freedom you have to those who do.not have it.\"\n \n \n Homosexuals have the same right I do. They can marry any member of the opposite sex who will have them. The same is true of pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles.\n \n \n\"It appears to be just as irrelevant in heterosexuality as well, from way back when.\"\n\n \n It's not. Reproduction is impossible in homosexual relations. In heterosexual relations it isn't. \n \n \n\"Mr. Rodgers used to ask those same questions in regards to children and their toys. What is it that you would like to know if I would share?\"\n\n \n I was being a bit rhetorical. I don't want to get personal. I mean I don't know if you are heterosexual or homosexual, married or single. What I was pointing out is the danger of having a marriage vow in which promising to be faithful would no longer be relevant and the consequences of such a change. Just as obedience has been eliminated, why not eliminate fidelity if homosexuals can marry? I believe that is already being pushed by Gay Lib spokesmen. We should all share each other sexually.\n \n \n\"We have been through this before. We are talking about marriage between two consenting adults.\"\n\n \n Yes, and 75 years ago when marriage was talked about it was between two member of the opposite sex. Times have changed. We now talk about that which pleases vs that which displeases us. Why are bestialists excluded? You aren't a zoophobe or speciesist (now in the dictionary) are you? You're going to have to be a bit more progressive.\n \n \"And what exactly is that irrationality all of you are suppossed to accept?\"\n \n Contentions that, when probed --if such probing will be permitted, which it isn't-- one finds are based on fallacies and contradictions. \n \n \n\"Okay, it's about reproduction again. This time I am informed of defective genetalia, and sterility, etc. Please tie this into why homosexuals should not be allowed to be married.\"\n\n \n Since you said nothing about any fallacies or contradictions in what I laid out in my post #96, I'll assume that you accept it as free of errors --at least as far as you can see for now-- and continue laying it out. (Incidentally, you can always come back and point out any errors that you didn't catch at first. I'm not asking you to sign a contract on this.) \n \n Homo sapiens' reproductive system has two basic components, the physical organ and the drive to use it.\n \n As the physical organ can be defective, so can the drive. The defect of the drive can be identified by its directing the individual exclusively to an object that makes reproduction impossible. \n \n Acceptable? Any fallacies or contradictions?\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "I do like that you chose a few wikipedia quotes but you should have excluded the second one as it proves my point. \n\n Those quotes come from COURT RULINGS. Wikipedia has no claim on them.\n And it's interesting how you claim \"the second one\" supposedly \"proves your point\", but then you completely fail to give the second one.\n \n Is THIS the \"second one\" you were referring to?\n The U.S. Supreme Court has explained as follows, in United Public Workers v. Mitchell (1947):\n \"If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail.\" \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n \n All it is saying is that the Constitution EXPLICITLY RESERVES a \"granted power\" to the government, then it follows that the 9th and 10th amendment cannot be read to granting that right or power to the people.\n \n Also discussed here...\n \"Moreover, contrary to what McAffee's theory would predict, Madison rested his argument against the claimed power to grant a monopoly charter in part on the fact that such a power violates the \"equal rights of every citizen.\" In other words, these \"equal rights\" restrict the scope of the necessary and proper clause. If all this were not enough, Madison's concluding observation definitively refutes McAffee's thesis: \"In fine, if the power were in the Constitution, the immediate exercise of it cannot be essential; if not there, the exercise of it involves the guilt of usurpation\" 107 Here Madison is arguing that the ninth amendment is authority for limiting the exercise of enumerated powers that \"were in the Constitution\" to those which are \"essential.\" According to McAffee's \"residual rights\" thesis, if a power were in the Constitution, its exercise could not violate a residual right. 108 \"\n http://randybarnett.com/rightsbypeople.html\n \n \n \nThis says that the ninth amendment does not contain constitutionally protected rights in the 9th amendment.\n\n It doesn't \"contain\" rights.\n It ACKNOWLEDGES the EXISTENCE of rights ABOVE AND BEYOND those explicitly listed in the constitution.\n It's basically saying that the government can't come along and say \"This right is not found in the constitution, therefore you don't have it\"\n \n \n \nFurthermore, who decides what these rights are? Your interpretation makes no sense and thus it is a minority view among judges as shown by you.\n\n You don't even understand my interpretation in the first place.\n The people who acknowledge the existence of these rights are the legislature and the judiciary.\n \n \n \nWait, so you admit that the 9th amendment does not protect the \"other\" rights not listed in the constitution? With that we can get to the 14th amendment which doesn't say you need a legitmate state interest...\n\n Oh gee. You finally get what I'm saying?\n But now you're going to quote ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and conclude something COMPLETELY OPPOSITE of what is the actual interpretation of law.\n \n So just out of curiousity, all these years when people have interpreted the 14th amendment as requiring a legitimate state interest for discrimination, they were all wrong?\n Almost 140 years of people with ACTUAL LAW degrees were wrong, and you are right?\n \n Do more than claim Steeeeve. Do a LOT more.\n \n \n \nI don't know how judge would know what a legitimate state interest is other than his or her own opinion...\n\n Steeeeve, your ignorance IS NOT AN ARGUMENT.\n Just because you \"don't know\" something doesn't mean you've come up with an argument.\n Just because you don't know how quarks work in subatomic physics doesn't mean that they don't exist.\n READ and LEARN what legitimate state interests are.\n \n Then get back to me when you have a REAL argument.\n \n \n \nyou could look at what people voted for but these judges don't seem to like that either. ANd yes, morality is a fine state interest...\n\n And again, Steeeeve does nothing but blindly contradict.\n 1) \"the people voted\" for miscegenation laws. They thought the morality of those laws were a \"state interest\".\n Why were they wrong? Because YOU say so?\n 2) \"Morality\" is a lame excuse. The KKK and nazis claim \"morality\" as their rationale.\n \"Morality\" is ridiculously arbitrary and without bounds.\n \n \n \nif interest mattered (which it doesn't). Prostitution is illegal for the sole reason that people think it is wrong. That would be a moral judgement and law...not unconstitutional.\n\n You can argue for making prostitution illegal for the state health concerns and for the effect that prostitution has on a society.\n It doesn't have to rest just on claims of \"morality\".\n \n \n \nIf I find a court case that says the opposite or a judge that says the opposite then does that make you wrong?\n\n FIND IT first Steeeeve, then we'll talk.\n You're trying to make hypothetical IFs an argument just like Jyoshu. And it doesn't work for him either.\n SHOW ME such a court case, and then we'll talk. \n Considering you haven't even bothered trying to figure out what \"legitimate state interest\" means, I expect no real reply.\n \n \n \nYou seem to rely on what a court says so much....why don't you follow this all the time?\n\n In deciding a LEGAL matter you use LEGAL analysis.\n Understand?\n \n \n \n Did you really want to get into a debate on why Lawerence was wrongly decided? Issue a challenge on the debate forums.\n\n Yes.\n But I warn you, if you step into the ring then be prepared.\n Don't start arguing on your ignorance as a reason for not believing in legitimate state interests and the like.\n \n \n \nI'll give you three that say the opposite if you like.\n\n Enough with the empty promises.\n DO it already.\n Threats of being able to prove something are not an argument.\n \n \n \nNo you didn't. You proved that a minority of judges agree with that.\n\n \"minority of judges agree with that\"?\n Where the heck do you get \"minority of judges\"?\n These are LEGITIMATE court rulings that still stand.\n You haven't shown ANY judges that disagree.\n \n But you blindly allege \"minority of judges\"...\n You're a hoot.\n \n \n \nJust look at your reasoning. You think the 9th amendment has constitutional protected rights with them (unknown of course) or perhaps you think it grants rights but are not yet protected until the 14th amendment....\n\n So you're admitting your clueless as to what my argument actually is.\n But you're arguing scatter-shot anyways?\n \n Why is it that I have EXPLICITLY told you what I interpret the 9th amendment as saying, but you can't figure it out?\n \n \n \neither way, these rights are unknown and must be decided by someone. So you say \"hey, why not have a judge do it\". The judge then says \"hmmm...do I like this law or not\"...based on nothing but his own thoughts he or she will decide which things will be rights and what won't be. If you want this then we might as well elect the judges since we would probably want them to think the way we think. \n\n That's your claim on how these things work. An inaccurate claim at best.\n \n \n \nLooking at the alternative, you could say the 9th amendment just recognizes that other amendments exists and that one can't take the bill of rights (in this case) and say \"oh, its not here so therefore you are not granted this\"....but you are granted it unless a law says otherwise.\n\n The funny thing is that the first part of your statement here (before the ....) is ACTUALLY MY ARGUMENT.\n But you claim it's an \"alternative\"...\n \n Man! You're hilarious!\n \n Tell me. What good is a right if it isn't protected and anybody can make a law that infringes upon it?\n Your last sentence about how a law can just restrict a \"right\" is inane.\n And it's ignoring the 14th amendment, which you earlier degraded but have given no proof of why \"legitimate state interest\" isn't a real 14th amendment issue.\n \n \n \nIt is almost the same as the 10th amendment which says the powers not in the constitution go to the states or the people. This doesn't imply that the people have powers to be determined by a judges whim. You gotta stretch pretty far and go through a lot of cases to get one understanding of it your way.\n\n Your interpretation makes a classification of \"rights\" as MEANINGLESS.\n It's a \"right\" until the government blindly make a law which takes it away? That's inane.\n \n And there is no \"stretching\" here. The courts INTERPRET the constitution. They have since it is written.\n Of COURSE they are going to be the ones to acknowledge the existence of rights as discussed in the 9th amendment.",

   "...................................\n\n \n \n \n \n ..............................QUOTE=jackowens]Dear gaetano,\n \n In reply to your post #121 of 8/1/06: \n \n \n \n No, that starts confusing what's involved. Homo sapiens has a reproductive system that is sexual, not a sexual system that is reproductive.\n \n \n \n The thought of children (reproduction) is not the catalyst that draws two people together. It is the physical attraction. Without that desire for intimacy the reproductive system would be pretty much null and void. \n \n \n \n I would say that --at least in the majority of cases-- it's the sight of a naked woman.\n \n \n Okay we agree, it is the naked woman that causes an erection, not the the thought of reproducing. Thank you.\n \n \n Why wouldn't it be a product of its source, the reproductive system which comprises both the physical organ and the accompanying drive to use it?\n \n \n It can be, and it is in most cases. In the case of homosexuals who actually want children they can and do reproduce, despite the fact that their object of desire is not who they reproduced with.\n \n \n \n Agreed. That's an advantage shared by pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles. \n \n \n \n Again, I would like to remind you this issue is dealing with two consenting adults, which does not include pedophiles, bestialists, or necrophiles. Of course I know you aware of that, but you can't seem to help yourself from including homosexuals in your collection of unseemly practices. Do your best to keep this in accordance with two consenting adults.\n \n \n \n Yes, if you're talking loosely. \"Sex\" is a much abused word. I, and I presume you, have heard all kinds of things called \"sexy\", from pistols to peace. We need to talk with greater precision in this discussion.\n \n \n \n Alright, what would you like to call the blind, primitive, biological urge to copulate. If it is not the sex drive, what is it?\n \n \n \n Sexual relations have no necessary connection to committment and love in the sense of philia and agape. (Look them up.) Consider the prostitute and patron. \n \n \n \n Who said that they did? I was asking what the blind, primitive, biological urge to copulate had to do with marriage in a modern society that is suppossedly based on commitment and love. Homosexuals are just as capable of love and commitment as heterosexuals. Whether or not their urge to copulate with one another has no bearing on this issue. People marry one another out of love, children come as a result of that love.\n I am familiar with the nature of love and it's three aspects, eros, philia and agape. \n The prostitute and the patron have sexual relations without love and commitment, is that something that people are not aware of? \n \n \n \n What? How is that determined? Are you talking for yourself?\n \n \n \n This passive aggressive approach to whatever it is you are leading up to is not necessary for progress in this discussion. In the chance that you asked these three questions because you really wanted to know what I was going to say, I'll answer you........... What? the blind, primitive, biological urge to copulate would have one screwing anything with a heartbeat. How is that determined? Just a wild guess based on three words, blind, primitive, and urge. Are you talking for yourself? No, just for those with blind, primitive, biological urges to copulate. \n \n But Aren't you saying that I should ( \"should\" meaning moral obligation) vote to grant homosexuals the right to marry?\n \n \n It is not my place to tell you what you should or shouldn't do, remember this is a free country.\n \n \n \n Your whole series of posts seems to be pushing in the direction of granting them that right. Am I mixed up or you?\n \n \n \n About whether you should vote yes or no for gay marriage? I have no idea if you are mixed up. \n \n \n There is a big difference in what seems to be the direction of my posts and me telling you what you should or should not do.\n \n \n \n Homosexuals have the same right I do. They can marry any member of the opposite sex who will have them.\n \n \n \n As Marie Antoinette said to the starving people, \"Let them eat cake.\" The bottom line is you could really care less. And that's fine. Why did you take so long to spit out what you wanted to say all along. \n \n \n \n The same is true of pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles.\n \n \n \n Remember, the issue is involving two consenting adults.\n \n \n \n It's not. Reproduction is impossible in homosexual relations. In heterosexual relations it isn't. \n \n \n \n \n Why are you stuck on reproduction? Say that word in China and it's all over.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n I was being a bit rhetorical. I don't want to get personal. I mean I don't know if you are heterosexual or homosexual, married or single. What I was pointing out is the danger of having a marriage vow in which promising to be faithful would no longer be relevant and the consequences of such a change.\n \n \n \n Where do you come up with such things. Are you saying that heterosexuals are faithful to their wedding vows? Sometimes they are. Sometimes they divorce, beat one another, beat their children, kill their children, kill one another,etc. And sometimes they live happily ever after,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,with their third spouse. What is your point. And you assume that gay people would not be faithful and the consequence of such a change. That change has already happenned, long, long ago, where have you been? And it is due to heterosexuals and only heterosexuals since gay people as of yet cannot get married. You are speaking as if marriage never goes wrong, but it will if gay people start getting married.\n \n \n \n Just as obedience has been eliminated, why not eliminate fidelity if homosexuals can marry? I believe that is already being pushed by Gay Lib spokesmen. We should all share each other sexually.\n \n \n \n Homosexuals cannot marry, and heterosexuals eliminate fidelity quite frequently. \n \n \n \n \n We should all share each other sexually.\n \n \n \n That's a new one on me. \n \n \n \n Yes, and 75 years ago when marriage was talked about it was between two member of the opposite sex. Times have changed. We now talk about that which pleases vs that which displeases us. \n \n \n \n \n You mean when interracial marriage laws were changing.Interracial marriage pleased some and displeased others\n \n \n \n \n Why are bestialists excluded? \n \n \n \n Two consenting adults\n \n \n \n \n You aren't a zoophobe or speciesist (now in the dictionary) are you? You're going to have to be a bit more progressive.\n \n \n \n I had a brief affair at one time with a transgendered Dalmation. I don't know how I would be classified today, but back then they called me a Vet, short for Vetinarian. And before you pass any judgement on me, the transgendered dalmation was not a patient of mine. We were introduced by mutual friends.\n \n \n \n \n \n \"And what exactly is that irrationality all of you are suppossed to accept?\"\n \n Contentions that, when probed --if such probing will be permitted, which it isn't-- one finds are based on fallacies and contradictions. \n \n \n \n By all means probe and expose these fallacies and contradictions.\n \n \n \n Since you said nothing about any fallacies or contradictions in what I laid out in my post #96, I'll assume that you accept it as free of errors --at least as far as you can see for now-- and continue laying it out. (Incidentally, you can always come back and point out any errors that you didn't catch at first. I'm not asking you to sign a contract on this.) \n \n Homo sapiens' reproductive system has two basic components, the physical organ and the drive to use it.\n \n As the physical organ can be defective, so can the drive. The defect of the drive can be identified by its directing the individual exclusively to an object that makes reproduction impossible.\n \n \n Wrong, it makes reproduction a chore, not an impossiblity. \n \n \n \n Acceptable? Any fallacies or contradictions?.........\n \n \n \n Yes, as I just illustrated. You have established a complete lack of understanding of homosexuality as well as any interest in learning to understand it. You categorize homosexuals and homosexuality as perversions not worthy of things you feel they should not possess. It is a contradiction to the way that you would want to be treated if they categorized and legislated you in the same fashion.................................\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Regards,\n \n Jack[/QUOTE]",

The last time I checked it was not against the law to have a misdirected reproductive drive. And how would you determine if someones reproductive drive was indeed misdirected. Perhaps their drive to reproduce is not tied in with their blind, primitive urge to copulate. In that case you would have something more on the order of a reproductive drive that works independently. Now you must prove the horrors and consequences of those who are in possession of independent reproductive drives. Ultimately it is those who are sterile who present the biggest problem with your theory. Since evrything seems to be about reproduction with you, they serve absolutely no purpose, as far as marriage goes. I know you care as deeply for them, as you do for homosexuals as human beings. Your empathy, respect, and understanding of the human condition is without peer. \n \n \n Gaetano\n \n \n \"It is a contradiction to the way that you would want to be treated if they categorized and legislated you in the same fashion.........\" \n \n \n Jack Owens\n What am I affirming and denying (the definition of a contradiction). Please be specific.\n \n \n Gaetano\n In other words, how would you feel if someone was attempting to connect you to perversion, with some theory that they dug up? You have failed to show how you are entiltled to something that they are not. And then there are hemaphrodites. What category do you place them in and how do you plan on regulating their lives. They are dealing with both a misdirected and/or a defective reproductive system. Or maybe no reproductive system at all. Then we have sex change after marriage, and what started out as a marriage between a man and a woman, evolves into two members of the same sex, legally married. Again, how do you plan on dealing with such defiance. People have alot of nerve thinking they can live their lives as they see fit.\n \n \n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "Homo sapiens has a reproductive system that is sexual, not a sexual system that is reproductive.\n\n Good. Got that acknowledgement out of the way.\n And moreover, sexual activity obviously serves more purposes than just \"reproduction\".\n \n \n \n\"Reproduction is a by product of the sex drive, if both male and female are capable of reproducing.\" \n\n \nWhy wouldn't it be a product of its source, the reproductive system which comprises both the physical organ and the accompanying drive to use it?\n\n You're getting vague in your terminology. Too many pronouns.\n Why wouldn't what \"it\" be a product of what \"its source\".\n There is a difference between reproductive drive and sex drive.\n Reproduction can be a product of the reproductive drive, IF the intention of the sexual encounter IS TO HAVE SEX.\n Otherwise, it doesn't really seem sensible to say that a sexual encounter WHICH INVOLVES PRECAUTIONS AGAINST REPRODUCTION is brought on by the \"reproductive drive\".\n It's like saying Jack got in his car and drove to the store because he was hungry, but then he bought a bedroom set. Doesn't make sense.\n \n \n \nAgreed. That's an advantage shared by pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles. \n\n And by heterosexual couples who have been fixed, who utilize contraceptives to avoid pregnancy, or who engage in sexual activity which obviously cannot result in pregnancy like oral sex.\n So we've got pedophiles, bestialists, necrophiles, and people who like oral sex all in one nice happy boat...\n \n \n \nYes, if you're talking loosely. \"Sex\" is a much abused word. I, and I presume you, have heard all kinds of things called \"sexy\", from pistols to peace. We need to talk with greater precision in this discussion.\n\n How is \"sex drive\" loose terminology?\n Please. Elaborate and be specific.\n You have named no contradictions or fallacies in the other person's statement...\n \n And quite frankly, I suspect it is only you who is in need of \"greater precision\" for this.\n \n \n \nSexual relations have no necessary connection to committment and love in the sense of philia and agape. (Look them up.) Consider the prostitute and patron.\n\n Sexual relations have no necessary connection to reproduction either, right?\n But that's avoiding the point, isn't it.\n \n Sexual relations CAN BE A PART OF reproduction and committment and love.\n The purpose of sexual relations are diverse.\n \n \n \nBut Aren't you saying that I should ( \"should\" meaning moral obligation) vote to grant homosexuals the right to marry? Your whole series of posts seems to be pushing in the direction of granting them that right. Am I mixed up or you?\n\n It seems you have significantly strayed from the topic and from the actual observation: \"\"I can't really say what anyone is morally obliged to do since morality has as many variations as \"sexual perversion\".\"\n \n \"sexual perversion\" is an obviously subjective standard. Thus, using its classification as a judgment for ANYTHING is suspect...\n \n People who engaged in oral sex used to be considered as \"perverse\".\n \n \n \nHomosexuals have the same right I do. They can marry any member of the opposite sex who will have them. The same is true of pedophiles, bestialists and necrophiles.\n\n Oh puh-leaze Jack. That's like saying a law outlawing the wearing of cross Jewelry affects everybody, Christian and Jew alike, and therefore it's not discriminatory.\n Marriage caters to the heterosexual. Heterosexual pairings are recognized in law in conjunction with over 1,000 rights and privileges, while homosexual pairings are often expressly forbidden such recognition.\n \n \n \nWhat I was pointing out is the danger of having a marriage vow in which promising to be faithful would no longer be relevant and the consequences of such a change. Just as obedience has been eliminated, why not eliminate fidelity if homosexuals can marry? I believe that is already being pushed by Gay Lib spokesmen. We should all share each other sexually.\n\n This has also been pushed by Straight spokespeople as well. It's not a new thing just with gays. In fact, many states have adopted \"no fault divorce\" which ignores infidelity WITHOUT gay marriage being a reality, so it's really a moot point.\n And why can't we allow gay marriage AND keep the fidelity issue on the table?\n \n \n \nYes, and 75 years ago when marriage was talked about it was between two member of the opposite sex. Times have changed. We now talk about that which pleases vs that which displeases us. Why are bestialists excluded? You aren't a zoophobe or speciesist (now in the dictionary) are you? You're going to have to be a bit more progressive.\n\n Actually, 75 years ago when marriage was talked about it was between two members of the opposite sex AND SAME RACE. It wasn't until the late 80's / early 90's that the \"majority\" shifted in this country from being against interracial marriage to being for it.\n \n But regardless, I warned you about rehashing your old arguments without addressing people who responded to them. The issue with bestialists is that the animal cannot consent. We don't allow heterosexual marriage between two people if one of the people cannot consent. Consent is intrinsic to the modern ideal of marriage, although that hasn't always been the case. Some historical societies have forced marriage despite the participants wishes. In the Bible, a rapist could marry his rape victim if he paid the father a few shekels.\n \n But since then, we have moved significantly away from the idea of \"forcing\" people into things, like slavery. As such, Consent is an obvious key factor which bestialists lack.\n \n \n \nSince you said nothing about any fallacies or contradictions in what I laid out in my post #96, I'll assume that you accept it as free of errors --at least as far as you can see for now-- and continue laying it out.\n\n It has been pointed out that something free of \"fallacies and contradictions\" doesn't mean it isn't thoroughly subjective, and thus not a prima facie standard.\n \n \n \nHomo sapiens' reproductive system has two basic components, the physical organ and the drive to use it.\n As the physical organ can be defective, so can the drive. The defect of the drive can be identified by its directing the individual exclusively to an object that makes reproduction impossible. \n Acceptable? Any fallacies or contradictions?\n\n What constitutes a defect in the \"REPRODUCTIVE drive\" though?\n You keep confusing the drive to REPRODUCE with the drive to HAVE SEX. You keep pretending that having sex in ways where reproduction is impossible is the same thing as a defect in the reproductive drive. That isn't the case\n The two are different.\n \n Many homosexuals DO IN FACT REPRODUCE. It just isn't via homosexual sex.\n Since homosexuals DO IN FACT REPRODUCE, it seems logical that they have a reproductive drive. A drive that pushes them to reproduce, even if it isn't by sexual means.\n Fallacies? Contradictions?\n And for the record Jack, THIS is a significant point which I would like to see you address. It's central to your position/observations, and of primary importance since you have attempted to derive a lot from \"defect in reproductive drive\".\n \n Ergo, you need to address this.",

As such, another person raping that body against the wishes of that person or the person's family would be a violation of consent. Moreover, there are potential health risks we could go into, but I don't see the point in doing so while you continue to ignore the arguments.\n \n Bestiality: Also an issue of consent, and capability to consent. We don't allow people to have sex with coma victims, or to take advantage of people mentally retarded to the extent they do not understand sex. Bestiality is a similar issue.\n \n Pedophilia: Child rape?

Fallacies?\n Or you just ignoring what I'm saying?\n \n \n \nWhat could a misdirection of the reproductive drive be? What illustrative examples of a misdirected reproductive drive are acceptable?\n\n First, you have to DEFINE misdirected reproductive drive, and the definition is still under contention.\n A homosexual's SEXUAL drive pushes him towards sex in a way that does not result in reproduction, but that SEXUAL drive is something separate and distinguishable from the REPRODUCTIVE drive.\n \n Furthermore, when a homosexual has sex, the intent is not to reproduce.\n When homosexuals DO act upon their drive to reproduce, they use MEANS TO reproduce. There are means to reproduce, and your unstated assumption that the only way to satisfy the reproductive drive via heterosexual sexual intercourse is a fallacy.\n \n \n \nAs in the case of foundit66, you've given me a bit more than I can handle.

They are dealing with both a misdirected and/or a defective reproductive system. Or maybe no reproductive system at all. Then we have sex change after marriage, and what started out as a marriage between a man and a woman, evolves into two members of the same sex, legally married.

Thus, it is objectively obvious that procreation is not the only purpose of the sexual drive.\" \n \n The purpose of a drive can be evaluated by what effects the drive and what increases or decreases the drive. If a drive for sexual activity is not affected by procreation, then it seems fairly obvious that the drive is not primarily a \"reproductive\" drive. There is something more pressing at play in the \"drive\".\n \n I am questioning your assumption that the drive for sex is accurately labelled as a \"reproductive\" drive.\n \n \n \nIt would seem that way, but as you point out that is not so. \n On the other hand, I'm assuming that the woman in question did have a reproductive drive that was not misdirected. She did not have to consciously deny a misdirected reproductive drive to become pregnant, as would be the case with a lesbian, and will not have to deny it in the future for any further desired pregnancies. Apparently that drive still exists despite being pregnant and will continue to drive her to reproduce after her existing pregnancy.\n\n You're assuming your conclusion into the discussion again, and introducing irrelevant aspects. Lesbians will have to wait their turn...\n \n 1) You cannot logically label the sexual drive during pregnancy as potentially \"misdirected\" just because it doesn't not fit your paradigm. That would be an example of the \"pleasing/displeasing\" subjectivity, and by your own standards should be avoided.\n 2) If \"that drive still exists despite being pregnant\", then how can you logically continue to label it as a \"reproduction\" drive?\n The purpose of a drive (as discussed above) can be logically approached by examining the EFFECTS of that drive, AND what EFFECTS the drive itself.\n If being pregnant does not diminish the drive to have sex, then it seems fairly obvious that the drive is not based on procreation. At least not to the primary degree.\n Fallacies? Contradictions?\n \n \n \nAgain we can see the parallel with the gastrointestinal system. After a person has satisfied his nutritional needs he continues to eat. Why? Supposedly that would prove, paralleling what you infer regarding the reproductive system, that, \"It seems obvious that there is MORE than just the \"nutritional\" drive taking place here...\"\n\n 1) What qualifies as \"satisfies his nutritional needs\"?\n 2) There is obviously more to the drive to eat than JUST feeding nutritional needs. And that is part of my point with regards to sexual drive. The drive to have sex is based on MORE than just procreation.\n 3) You're mixing metaphors here. We're talking about the DRIVE to do something, like eat. Presumably, \"hunger\" would be the equivalent \"drive\" to eat.\n If somebody continues to eat after they have sated their hunger, then obviously some other mechanism is at work, BUT it should be pointed out that the hunger IS SATED.\n \n \n \nIn other words, the drive to eat and drink has a purpose beyond maintaining the body. I don't believe that. Do you?\n\n Why? Where is the fallacy or contradiction?\n Please elaborate.\n Are you dismissing that idea just because it is displeasing to you?

Reproduction is one aspect of our drive to have sex. The major reason for having sex is is because it feels good to do it. We can take our non-rational heritage to perpetuate ourselves genetically and use it accordingly. Since I have no desire or obligation to reproduce, my reason to have sex is because I like it.....alot! It is extremely satisfying, both physically and spiritually.\n \n \n \n Your theory up to this point has not shown why those who are in possession of a theoretical misdirected reproduction drive should be denied legal marriage.

Hunger, as the primitive drive to ingest, is sated when the person stops because to eat further is no longer pleasing sensorily. The point of satiety varies, of course, with the individual.

The latter cannot be given completely free rein. \n \n If you can point out a basis, other than some sort of deus ex machina \"mechanism\", for the contention that the drive to eat and drink has a purpose beyond maintaining the body, lay it out. \n \n What is that basis?\n \n Regards, \n \n Jack",

I don't believe that.\"\n I was simply ASKING A QUESTION about the basis for your non-belief.\n \n You \"didn't follow my reasoning\" in that question because I was just asking you ABOUT YOUR REASONING.\n Ergo, I provided no reasoning to follow, and your complaint is essentially moot.\n Would this classify as a contradiction on your part?\n \n \n \nI caught your point, \"If somebody continues to eat after they have sated their hunger, then obviously some other mechanism is at work, BUT it should be pointed out that the hunger IS SATED\", in your post #143, which brings up the idea of a mechanism and satiety. \n What mechanism?\n\n There are different reasons why people eat. Hunger. Greed. Desire. Even mental illness can cause one to eat.\n \n \n \nFirst, people don't continue to eat after sating their hunger. Satiety is the point at which they no longer continue to eat. Eating is pleasurable so, in an attempt to wring as much pleasure from the action as possible, we oten ingest more than the body needs. Hunger, as the primitive drive to ingest, is sated when the person stops because to eat further is no longer pleasing sensorily.\n\n What you say is not in keeping with observations with reality or logic.\n I am not hungry right now.\n I am now reaching over to open a bag of corn nuts.\n ...\n Okay. I just ate about 10 of the corn nuts. By your logic, the hunger (which I didn't have) was sated by me stopping eating.\n emoticon_confused \n Your statements provide a contradiction, and as such need to be rejected.\n \n People can eat when they aren't hungry, which your description does not account for. People can be hungry, start eating, and continue eating past the point where they are no longer hungry.\n People can be hungry, eat a \"small\" amount of food, and STILL BE HUNGRY even though they just ate.\n \n Hunger is not satisfied just because people stop eating.\n \n \n \nIf you can point out a basis, other than some sort of deus ex machina \"mechanism\", for the contention that the drive to eat and drink has a purpose beyond maintaining the body, lay it out.\n\n Pleasure.\n Take the \"sweet tooth\" for example. People eat candy typically not because they are hungry, but rather out of desire for something sweet.\n I have in my pocket a mint I was given from a restaurant I ate at recently. When I eat it, it will not be because I am interested in quenching hunger.\n It will be because I want to eat something sweet.",

It will be because I want to eat something sweet.\"\n \n \n Perhaps the question is, why do you want to eat something sweet and what would make you not have that want?\n \n Your assumption appears to be that a) the nutritional needs of the body and and b) the drive to ingest are conterminous, which is pretty obviously not the case, whether we wish it were so or not. I'm probably at least 5 lbs. overweight and would be considerably more if I gave in to the mechanism --\"have eating?--that you mention. That appears to mean that the mechanism beyond hunger that you mention, if it has a purpose, is to make us overweight. How much sense does that make to you? \n \n The bottom line here is that among our frailties we have desires 1) that are excessive, represented by the desire to over-eat that most of us have --and appears to be the mechanism you see-- and desires 2) that are simply misdirected, as in the case of the individual whom I pointed out to you and who has pica, leading him to devour coins. \n \n \n\"Hunger is not satisfied just because people stop eating.\"\n\n \n Agreed. Some people stop eating, because reason tells them that their nutritional needs are satisfied, and that to accede to their ongoing desire to ingest, although pleasurable, is going to mean that they will have to carry around more weight than necessary, have trouble with the fit of their attire and that the effects on their health and appearance will be negative.\n \n For my part I have two points on the table:\n \n 1. The nature of sexual perversions and examples of them,\n \n 2. The nature of hunger --the desire to ingest.\n \n If you continue to think I'm neglecting any two of your points, point them out.\n \n Regards,\n \n Jack",

   "No.\n To repeat, will you accept bestiality and necrophilia as sexual perversions?\n\n \"Will I accept\".\n The only standard I have seen for defining \"perversion\" so far is a subjective one.\n And as far as subjective classifications, I personally see both as \"perversions\".\n But that is based on my personal subjective criteria, and as such is irrelevant to our objective analysis.\n \n \n \nWe may be in disagreement here. To start: \n 1. Do you agree that some people find having sexual intercourse with animals pleasurable? And that, \n 2. If they follow that drive --whether called sex-drive or reproductive drive-- they, in contrast to heterosexuals, will never reproduce?\n\n Yes to the first.\n To the second, they will not reproduce BY THE ACTION of having sexual intercourse with animals. That does not mean they cannot reproduce via other means.\n For example, the vast majority of pedophiles are heterosexual in their adult inclination. Some of these heterosexual pedophiles have been found to molest their own sons or daughters. Ergo, the pedophile CAN and sometimes DOES reproduce.\n \n \n \nWhether you consider those points relevant or irrelevant, important or unimportant, can we agree that those are objective and true contentions?

There's no need to overload messages with all the points you're attempting to discuss and that I get dragged into.\n\n You are receiving \"too many\".\n We can try to limit how many we focus on, but you need to keep in mind that a lot of your arguments / observations have already been replied to, and if you repeat them without addressing the reply then you are going to be wasting more time...\n \n \n \nGive me the questions. Two.\n\n 1) Do you acknowledge that the boundaries of the definition you gave for \"perversion\" are subjective?\n 2) What is a good metric for determining what a \"drive\" correlates to?\n \n 3) As a statement, you have asked me MORE than just \"two\" questions in your post that I am replying to. Asking me more questions than you yourself are willing to answer is a means of controlling this conversation.\n \n \n \nPerhaps the question is, why do you want to eat something sweet and what would make you not have that want?\n\n 1) The \"sweet\" is intimately involved with pleasure. Chocolate, for example, has been linked with the release of serotonin in the brain.\n 2) The \"want\" could be satisfied by eating something sweet.\n \n \n \nYour assumption appears to be that a) the nutritional needs of the body and and b) the drive to ingest are conterminous, which is pretty obviously not the case, whether we wish it were so or not.\n\n My statement is that the drive to eat encompasses more than just the issue of providing sustenance to the body. There are other reasons why we eat. There are other reasons that we crave food beyond just \"nutritional needs of the body\".\n \"Comfort food\" would be another issue at hand...\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_food\n \n \n \nI'm probably at least 5 lbs. overweight and would be considerably more if I gave in to the mechanism --\"have eating?--that you mention. That appears to mean that the mechanism beyond hunger that you mention, if it has a purpose, is to make us overweight. How much sense does that make to you?\n\n To talk of \"sense\" without bringing evidence to the table to counter or bolster the \"sense\" does not make \"sense\". That's not objective, but rather seems to rely on subject pre-existing assumptions.\n \n You blindly and without any stated reason conclude that the mechanism beyond hunger has a \"purpose ... to make us overweight\".\n \n A mechanism MAY EXIST which has the BYPRODUCT of making us overweight, but to criticize the existence of the mechanism by saying the purpose is the byproduct is blind.\n \n That's like saying the purpose of the automobile is to produce carbon monoxide, and then to ask about the \"sense\" of the automobile based on such a classification.\n \n \n \nThe bottom line here is that among our frailties we have desires 1) that are excessive, represented by the desire to over-eat that most of us have --and appears to be the mechanism you see-- and desires 2) that are simply misdirected, as in the case of the individual whom I pointed out to you and who has pica, leading him to devour coins.\n\n I have never met anybody with the \"desire to over-eat\".\n People may over-eat due to carelessness, or greed, or indulgence. But I have yet to meet anybody who desires to eat just enough to make them full, and then consciously or unconsciously, has the desire to eat more than that JUST BECAUSE it is over-eating.\n \n Again, you classify things according to the effect (or side-effect) without even looking at the underlying mechanisms or other involved \"effects\".\n \n \n \nAgreed. Some people stop eating, because reason tells them that their nutritional needs are satisfied, and that to accede to their ongoing desire to ingest, although pleasurable, is going to mean that they will have to carry around more weight than necessary, have trouble with the fit of their attire and that the effects on their health and appearance will be negative.\n For my part I have two points on the table:\n 1. The nature of sexual perversions and examples of them,\n 2. The nature of hunger --the desire to ingest.\n If you continue to think I'm neglecting any two of your points, point them out.\n\n It's interesting how you have taken my example, and thusly proceeded to completely jump over its point.\n The point being that your classification of the urge to engage in sexual intercourse as \"reproductive drive\" is short-sighted. It fails to accurately assess the situation. It fails to accurately assess that the drive IS NOT to reproduce.\n Likewise, the drive to eat can be made up of different things and serve different purposes.\n \n Your \"two points\" have numerous detractions.\n 1a) The \"nature of sexual perversion\" includes false assumptions about the \"reproductive drive\" or \"sex drive\" (or whatever name is assigned to it.\n 1b) The \"nature of sexual perversion\" incorporates subjective definitions, and as such cannot be included in an objective analysis.\n 2a) The \"nature of hunger\" is only looking at PART of the picture, much like your issue with the \"nature of reproduction\". There are MORE REASONS WHY we eat besides just \"hunger\". Likewise, there are more reasons why we have sex other than just \"reproduction\".\n 2b) The \"desire to ingest\" is made up of MORE than just hunger.\n Likewise, the \"desire to have sex\" is made up of MORE than just procreation.\n \n (Yes. 2a and 2b are virtually identical)",

   "Dear foundit66,\n \n In reply to your post #155 of 8/13/06: \n \n In this post I brought up a number of questions that can be taken as rhetorical, but I have specifically indicated two (2) questions that I'd like an answer to. I recommend that you do the same.\n \n \n\"We can try to limit how many we focus on, but you need to keep in mind that a lot of your arguments / observations have already been replied to, and if you repeat them without addressing the reply then you are going to be wasting more time...\"\n\n \n \"Replied to\" doesn't cut it. We have to reduce rhetoric of that sort and bring out the test-criteria. I don't think your replies, including this one, have ever given me a contradiction --and I mean a genuine one wherein I affirm and deny the same thing-- that I'm involved in. If you have, point out where I am. This business of going on and on with your accusations of errors on my part without using our criteria to demonstrate it wastes too much time and leads nowhere.. \n \n \n\"But that is based on my personal subjective criteria, and as such is irrelevant to our objective analysis.\"\n\n \n Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. \n \n \n\"To the second, they will not reproduce BY THE ACTION of having sexual intercourse with animals. That does not mean they cannot reproduce via other means.\"\n\n \n A truism. What I'm getting at is that, in contrast to heterosexuals, they will not reproduce by following their reproductive drive. \n \n I consider bestiality to be a sexual perversion because the bestialist's reproductive drive is misdirected. They are driven to targets that make reproduction impossible.\n \n Why do you consider bestialism to be a sexual perversion? (Question #1) \n \n \n\"Sure, but we're truly getting nowhere as we concentrate solely on the issues you want to focus on. There are still huge obstacles awaiting us...\"\n\n \n We don't have to focus on the issues I want to focus on. As I have already pointed out to you, I'm not trying to control our discussion; bring out the issues that you want to focus on. \n \n \n\"1) Do you acknowledge that the boundaries of the definition you gave for 'perversion' are subjective?\"\n\n \n You may be right but I don't see it. My answer at this point is, no.\n \n \n\"2) What is a good metric for determining what a 'drive' correlates to?\"\n\n \n Drives correlate to the nature of Homo sapiens anatomically, the functioning of the physiological systems of his body, and the defects/disorders they are susceptible to.\n \n \n\"3) As a statement, you have asked me MORE than just 'two' questions in your post that I am replying to. Asking me more questions than you yourself are willing to answer is a means of controlling this conversation.\"\n\n \n Fair enough. I'll back off. If I slip up, ignore my third question.\n \n \n\"2) The 'want' could be satisfied by eating something sweet.\"\n\n \n No, the question is, what would make you not have that want. Pretty obviously satiety. But satiety of what? A \"mechanism\"? An \"encompassment\"? \n \n \n\"My statement is that the drive to eat encompasses more than just the issue of providing sustenance to the body.\"\n \n \n Of course. We started out with that as your contention. But, aside from bringing in the verbal hypostatizations of \"mechanism\" and \"encompassment\" , you haven't pointed out what is involved other than the simple pleasure that eating provides, extending from the point of starvation to the point of complete satiety --meaning after there is no further pleasure in ingesting the sweets and comfort foods you mention. The person has reached the end of the line.\n \n \n\"To talk of 'sense' without bringing evidence to the table to counter or bolster the \"sense\" does not make \"sense\". That's not objective, but rather seems to rely on subject pre-existing assumptions.\n\n \n \"Mechanisms\" and \"encompassments\" don't count. Right?\n \n \n\"A mechanism MAY EXIST which has the BYPRODUCT of making us overweight, but to criticize the existence of the mechanism by saying the purpose is the byproduct is blind.\"\n\n \n What I still do not follow is your use of the word \"mechanism\". What flaw do you find in discarding it and simply accepting the idea that sweets and comfort food are, along with everything else we ingest, simply an extention --over-extention, really-- of the fundamental drive, resting on the pleasure involved in nourishing the body?\n \n \n\"I have never met anybody with the 'desire to over-eat'.\"\n\n \n That's a puzzling statement and one that I don't understand. \n \n I'd say that the cause of being overweight is over-eating. And the cause of over-eating is the pleasure derived from the primitive desire to ingest that is rooted in the biological drive to sustain the body, and that, when there is an excess of food available, should be controlled by reason. I'm an example of a person who desires to over-eat. I just try to control it. \n \n Anything untrue there? (Question #2)\n \n \n\"People may over-eat due to carelessness, or greed, or indulgence.\"\n \n \n You're just using different words to express the pleasure resulting from satisfying the desire that continues from ingesting despite the body's needs having been satisfied. And the \"mechanism\"/\"encompassment\" that you see involved can be described, as you point out, as carelessness, greed and indulgence.\n \n I don't see any real disagreement between us on this unless a)you can tell me what \"mechanism\" and \"encompassment\" mean or b) you're going to say that we can't be judgemental or do any finger-pointing; carelessness, greed and indulgence may not be to our taste, but that doesn't mean that we should consider our preferences any better than those of us who are careless, greedy and indulgent.\n \n Regards\n \n Jack",

I don't really expect a real answer from you...\n \n \n \nYour movement has long sided with groups who want frank discussions about gay sexual activities in schools, for instance.\n\n Yeah.

And those variety of ways are fought on a variety of fronts.\n \n If it was illegal for black men to have sex with white women, and also illegal for black men to marry white women, does that mean that if a black man fights against miscegenation laws, it's sensible to assume that the school kids are going to be talking about how black men and white women have sex? Or that he wants them to?\n \n Your claim of \"it's not so far out for people to assume\" is just plain inane.\n It's downright foolish of them to \"assume\" that when one thing has nothing to do with the other IN THEIR RESPECTIVE VENUES.\n \n The issue of ALL types of sex being discussed in sex ed is TOTALLY SEPARATE from the gay marriage issue. Not a result from it.\n But I guess people who try to blame gay marriage for heterosexual marital woes aren't too big on understanding the concepts of \"cause and effect\" in the first place...\n \n You know, your \"logic\", or lack thereof, could easily be applied to the type of thinking that Matthew demonstrates from time to time.

He WANTED to talk about it on a \"family\" show.\n The other person HAD TO STOP the anti-gay person from talking about it on a family show.\n \n So maybe it is you who would like to show how that equates to \"an aversion to talking about these things\".\n \n And as for \"concern about them\"?\n People with phobias have \"concerns\" about snakes, open spaces, crowded areas, ...\n It's the DEGREE of their concern which demonstrates their fixation or preoccupation.\n And in this case, he is so crazed that he actually thinks that legalizing gay marriage will mean that school kids will be discussing anal sex because of it.",

I recommend that you do the same.\n\n 1) \"can be taken as rhetorical\"? How convenient for you...\n 2) Restricting Q & A to just two questions is yet another way of controlling our conversations, which you seem quite adept at.\n You make the rule of only two questions. You make the rule of only \"fallacies and contradictions\". You pick and choose what issues you want to respond to.\n In the end, your attempts to limit this conversation have essentially stuck it in the mud...\n \n \n \n\"Replied to\" doesn't cut it. We have to reduce rhetoric of that sort and bring out the test-criteria. I don't think your replies, including this one, have ever given me a contradiction --and I mean a genuine one wherein I affirm and deny the same thing-- that I'm involved in.\n\n If you never \"replied to\" the points, then it's obvious that you have not \"affirmed or denied the same thing\".\n \n I agree that just \"replying to\" doesn't cut anything. But the point is that if you NEVER \"replied to\" the statement, then you obviously have not done anything regarding my observation.\n \n And as far as \"given me a contradiction\", that's erroneous as well. I have offered up a conflicting definition of \"perversion\" which you have not touched on.\n \n If you insist on just \"contradiction\", then you are again dictating control of the conversation. Requiring just \"contradiction\" in a response is pointless, especially if you don't require the same thing of yourself in your replies...\n \n \n \nIf you have, point out where I am. This business of going on and on with your accusations of errors on my part without using our criteria to demonstrate it wastes too much time and leads nowhere..\n\n And on that note, have you pointed out any fallacies or contradictions based on YOUR criteria regarding the \"hunger\" discussion?\n Or have you just disagreed with me?\n Count this as Query #1.\n \n \n \nA truism. What I'm getting at is that, in contrast to heterosexuals, they will not reproduce by following their reproductive drive.\n\n 1) Where does \"truism\" fall in the \"fallacies or contradiction\" judgment criteria? Rhetorical question...\n 2) And this is part of what I was talking about.\n You just utilized YOUR definition of \"reproductive drive\", ignoring my comments about how SUBJECTIVE your definition and assessment of \"reproductive drive\" actually is.\n You have created a SUBJECTIVE standard by which you claim to reach an \"objective\" conclusion.\n 3) The answer is that they will not reproduce following their \"drive\" to engage in sex with non-adult-female humans. If they have a drive to reproduce, how they act upon that ACTUAL drive (and not what you mislabel as that drive) would be a different discussion. Classifying a \"paraphilia\" as a \"reproductive drive\" is quite a stretch that you have yet to justify.\n \n \n \nWhy do you consider bestialism to be a sexual perversion? (Question #1)\n \n As I stated, it's based on a subjective evaluation.\n I consider it a perversion because it involves molesting a non-sentient being that doesn't have the capacity to consent to sexual contact. Similarly, I would consider sex with a comatose woman as \"perverse\", even though it seems to avoid being \"perverse\" under your definition.\n I acknowledge that doesn't mean it's \"right\" by your evaluation, but pointing out a disjoint between our definitions.\n \n \n \nYou may be right but I don't see it. My answer at this point is, no.\n\n Fine. For my second question, I present the current situation's background.\n You have presented a definition of \"perversion\".\n I have presented a different definition of \"perversion\". You have presented no fallacies or contradiction in my definition.\n Query #2\n In an objective analysis, can there be two different competing standards of evaluation where neither have contradictions or fallacies?\n \n \n \nDrives correlate to the nature of Homo sapiens anatomically, the functioning of the physiological systems of his body, and the defects/disorders they are susceptible to.\n\n Unfortunately, I've spent my two magic questions, so I'll reserve just commentary...\n 1) The \"nature of homo sapiens\". A subjective evaluation. Different people will come to different conclusions as to what the \"nature of homo sapiens\" is and what the examples entail.\n 2) The \"functioning of the physiological systems of his body\". Our systems of our body are multi-functional, and the impact of their function are diverse. Which function to consider as primary and which will be assigned to the issue at hand is an incredibly subjective decision.\n 3) The \"defects/disorders they are susceptible to\". INCREDIBLY subjective. Take \"homosexuality\" for example. The vast majority of the scientific and medical community do not consider it a \"defect\" or \"disorder\".\n But evidently, you do judge it as such...\n \n \n \nNo, the question is, what would make you not have that want. Pretty obviously satiety. But satiety of what? A \"mechanism\"? An \"encompassment\"?\n\n \"satiety\" is such a vague term it isn't even funny.\n satiety n. The condition of being full or gratified beyond the point of satisfaction; surfeit. \n \n Here was your question: \"Perhaps the question is, why do you want to eat something sweet and what would make you not have that want?\"\n Your \"answer\" isn't an answer to the question at all. It's like asking \"What would make this empty glass no longer empty?\", and you answer \"The glass being full.\"\n Your response is a truism. Satiety is the state of not wanting (i.e. not being satisfied).\n \n And as to \"satiety of what? A \"mechanism\"? An \"encompassment\"?\", your rephrasal adds no substance to the question.\n \n And for the record, I again find it funny that you earlier commented on wanting contradictions and fallacies, and here YOUR response is completely devoid of any observation of where I have a fallacy or contradiction.\n You reject my response, but you don't satisfy your own criteria for rejecting an observation.\n \n \n \nOf course. We started out with that as your contention. But, aside from bringing in the verbal hypostatizations of \"mechanism\" and \"encompassment\" , you haven't pointed out what is involved other than the simple pleasure that eating provides, extending from the point of starvation to the point of complete satiety --meaning after there is no further pleasure in ingesting the sweets and comfort foods you mention. The person has reached the end of the line.\n\n 1) And again, your reply shows now fallacies or contradictions in my statements....\n \n 2) Your response on \"what is involved\" is too vague.\n Above and beyond recognizing that you have not pointed out a fallacy or contradiction in my statement, I do not understand what you think is missing from my statement.\n \n 3) And as an extension of #2, I do not understand your statements and what point you are driving to with those comments.\n \n \n \n\"Mechanisms\" and \"encompassments\" don't count. Right?\n\n I may be temporarily forgetting something.\n Is this referencing something I said?\n \n \n \nWhat I still do not follow is your use of the word \"mechanism\". What flaw do you find in discarding it and simply accepting the idea that sweets and comfort food are, along with everything else we ingest, simply an extention --over-extention, really-- of the fundamental drive, resting on the pleasure involved in nourishing the body?\n\n What flaw do you find in recognizing other reasons for why we eat, especially when their impact is so fundamentally different from the \"nourishing the body\".\n \"Comfort food\" revolves around a psychological impact of eating. Nutrition is secondary in this drive.\n \n By your evaluation, you would ignore the psychological impact underlying the purpose of \"comfort food eating\".\n \n Again, we have two competing goals. You are not pointing out any \"fallacies or contradictions\" in my observations, and I am not pointing out any \"fallacies or contradictions\" in your observations.\n \n Where does that leave us? (Not really rhetorical but rather an example of my query #2)\n \n \n \nThat's a puzzling statement and one that I don't understand. \n I'd say that the cause of being overweight is over-eating. And the cause of over-eating is the pleasure derived from the primitive desire to ingest that is rooted in the biological drive to sustain the body, and that, when there is an excess of food available, should be controlled by reason. I'm an example of a person who desires to over-eat. I just try to control it.\n Anything untrue there? (Question #2)\n \n Again, we come upon a situation where you have not presented ANYTHING \"untrue\" in what I said, yet you insist that I have to point out something \"untrue\" about what you said...\n \n You claim that the \"cause of over-eating is the pleasure derived from the primitive desire to ingest that is rooted in the biological drive to sustain the body\".\n \"Pleasure\" is not really an issue of \"biological drive to sustain the body\". \"Pleasure\" does not sustain the body.\n To assume that the psychological pleasure and psychological results in the mechanisms of \"over-eating\" is rooted just in the biological drive lacks substantiation for the claim.\n \n But of course, lacking substantiation for a statement is not a contradiction. It is possibly not an error either...\n Ergo, a claim that there is life on Pluto could be accepted as an \"objective observation\"...\n \n \n \nYou're just using different words to express the pleasure resulting from satisfying the desire that continues from ingesting despite the body's needs having been satisfied.\n\n I am using psychological terms to evaluate a psychological push. You are centering on the BIOLOGY to ignore the psychology of the phenomenon.\n If comfort food is denied, there is no detriment to the body's nutritional needs. The impact is purely psychological.\n \n \n \nAnd the \"mechanism\"/\"encompassment\" that you see involved can be described, as you point out, as carelessness, greed and indulgence.\n\n They can \"be described\" as such, but the underlying mechanism is psychological in nature. Not physiological as \"biological drive to sustain the body\" would dictate.",

In fact, you have COMPLETELY DROPPED the discussion on drive to eat, hunger, and physiological and psychological reasons for why we eat.\n I guess maybe I'll just take to answering your questions with \"I don't understand\" and leave it at that too...\n \n This is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and a further indicator to me that you aren't willing in an even-handed discussion. You just asked me a five part question, but in response to my question, you simply reply \"I don't understand your reasoning\", and then DROP THE ENTIRE ISSUE.\n \n How am I supposed to \"continue with it\" unless you explain what I need to \"continue with\" in the first place?\n I see no real effort from you to actually ANSWER the question. If you need more information to answer the question, then GET it with SPECIFIC elaboration.\n The preceding question has not been answered by you to any satisfaction.\n \n \n \nFirst, a live dog is a sentient being, unless your dictionary is different from mine.\n\n I knew I should have spent more time before giving that explanation. That should be \"self-aware\", also including a requirement for \"intelligence\".\n \n \n \nSecond, consent on the part of an animal cannot be verbal. A dog, for instance, doesn't give his consent to ingest the food you give it. You just commonsensically know that his consent can reasonably be inferred from his actions.\n\n Do we?\n A dog can be trained or coerced. It can be punished for not behaving a certain way.\n \"His actions\" can be a direct result of \"his training\", or the expectations he sees from his training from his master.\n \n \n \nThird, a dog that mounts a woman and participates in coitus with great enthusiasm can as reasonably be considered to have given its consent, even if non-verbal, as in the case of a dog eating the food you give it.\n\n As stated above, the issue of \"self-aware\" comes into play, as well as a capacity for intelligence.\n And in addition, I have never seen a dog ask for coitus with a woman, even in a non-verbal form. Such a thing would have to be free of coercion or training or implication of punishment, not to mention the other issues.\n \n \n \nFourth, are you a vegetarian?

Just because you claim \"reproductive drive\" encompasses something doesn't make it so. And while there may be no \"fallacies\" or \"contradictions\" to your claims, that doesn't mean it's the best model out there.\n \n \n \nYes. I'll take that as your question #2, since I see no other.

   "Dear Friends,\n \n Well, it looks like I may have finally hit on a/the key point: the reasoning involved in considering, as both foundit66 and I do, that bestialty is either a paraphilia or a sexual perversion. (How it's labeled doesn't seem to me to matter much.) \n \n I was waiting to see if some one would express some curiosity regarding foundit66's writing two messages of complaint without saying anything at all about the contradiction he was involved in, but not a peep from anyone. Despite foundit66's denial, that contradiction was quite specifically on topic, the twisted logic that Matthew originally complained of and is in the title of this thread. Since foundit66 understandably didn't answer the question regarding it, is there anyone willing to pick up the bestiality/sexual perversion (or paraphilia) question where he dropped it, showing that it isn't (or is) a contradiction on foundit66's part and what can be inferred from his error if it is one? \n \n We should have started out with that point; we could have saved a lot of time. The reason for his initial reluctance to get into it is now pretty clear.\n \n Regards to all,\n \n Jack",

   "Scholar Claims Heterosexual Attitudes Have Helped 'Gay' Activists Undermine Marriage\n \n (AgapePress) - A pro-family researcher feels heterosexuals must share the blame for the debate over same-sex \"marriage\" taking place in America today. Dr. Stephen Baskerville says heterosexuals need to look at the way they have treated marriage before blaming the same-sex marriage push on homosexual activists.\n \n Baskerville is a political science professor at Howard University in Washington, DC, and president of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children. The researcher is also a prolific author of articles and books and an outspoken pro-family activist.\n \n While known to many for his positions on fatherhood and fathers' rights, Baskerville also has strong opinions on the societal debate over how marriage and family should be defined -- that is, whether their definitions should be broadened to embrace such notions as same-sex marriage, homosexual adoption, and other non-traditional familial arrangements.\n \n According to the author and political science teacher, this highly-charged conflict between traditional marriage and family defenders on the one hand and homosexual activists and same-sex marriage proponents on the other crystallizes a controversy that has arisen not suddenly but gradually, over decades. \"The reason we are having this problem today,\" he declares, \"the reason it's come to this head, is because of changes that have been going on for the family for at least 40 years.\"\n \n And of these changes, Baskerville asserts, \"the most neglected of all ... is no-fault divorce.\" This legal term describes any divorce in which the spouse seeking the termination of the marriage does not have to prove the other spouse did anything wrong; he or she only has to state a reason recognized by the state. In some places, simply charging \"incompatibility\" or \"irreconcilable differences\" is enough.\n \n No-fault divorce and the family court are two huge influences in the debasement of the institution of marriage, the Howard University professor contends. And, he notes, heterosexuals have abused marriage in other ways over the last few decades.\n \n Several pro-family advocates have noted that heterosexuals' increasingly casual attitudes about unwed pregnancy, unmarried cohabitation, marital infidelity and other sex outside marriage have helped to undermine the integrity of the traditional marriage and family, even as divorce has done. Many acknowledge that same-sex marriage activists did not invent the trend of compromising the biblical meaning and significance of marriage.\n \n Pastor Larry Christenson, author of The Christian Family, states something similar in some of his statements on this issue, Baskerville recalls. \"Christenson ... says commentators miss the point when they oppose homosexual marriage on the grounds that it would undermine traditional understandings of marriage,\" the professor says.\n \n \"It is only because traditional understandings of marriage have already been severely undermined that homosexuals are now laying claim to it,\" Baskerville contends. He says many homosexual activists will admit that it is because marriage today is taken so lightly -- and because it appears to pose no barrier to promiscuity -- that the institution of marriage has become attractive to those who engage in the often promiscuous homosexual lifestyle.\n http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/212006g.asp\n ==================================================\n \n I place this in the \"twisted logic of gay-marriage opponents\" primarily because of the way they approach it...\n \"Scholar Claims Heterosexual Attitudes Have Helped 'Gay' Activists Undermine Marriage\" ???\n Gay marriage is legal in ONLY ONE state, and that state has one of the BEST STATISTICS when it comes to divorce rates.\n And it isn't *heterosexual attitudes HELPING gay activists undermine marriage*.\n It's an issue of heterosexual attitudes HAVE UNDERMINED STABLE MARRIAGE ALL ON THEIR OWN, and now they want to start pointing the finger at \"gay activists\" for a cause, and the heterosexuals have only \"helped\" the gay activists undermine marriage...\n \n emoticon_wow :xbanghead emoticon_xdonno \n \n Get this through your head religious right.\n 1) Gay marriage is legal in only ONE state. The state with gay marriage has one of the best marriage stats.\n 2) Straights haven't \"helped\" gay activists undermine marriage.\n Straights have MESSED UP their own marriages all on their own WITHOUT ANY HELP from \"gay activists\". \n \n And somehow THEY are the ones who are supposedly \"helping\" US GAYS undermine marriage???\n \n Unbe-:xcensored -lievable!",

   "Sixth Researcher in One-Year Says That Dobson Misrepresented Work, Establishing A Disturbing Pattern\n \n Miami Beach, FLA. - Truth Wins Out unveiled a new video today on YouTube featuring a Yale professor who claims Focus on the Family leader James Dobson \"cherry picked\" his research. Dr. Kyle Pruett's testimony represents a growing trend where leading scientists are speaking out against manipulation of their work by right wing political organizations. Pruett decided to respond after Dobson misused his research in a guest column Dobson wrote in TIME magazine debasing Mary Cheney's pregnancy.\n \n \"When people start spinning science you have to respond,\" said Dr. Kyle Pruett, professor of child psychiatry, the Yale University School of Medicine. \"Journalism used to handle this, but not anymore. So it's bounced back to become increasingly the responsibility of the people doing the research.\"\n \n Pruett is the second acclaimed professor to criticize Dobson's use of their work in TIME Magazine. New York University professor Dr. Carol Gilligan also appeared in a Truth Wins Out video saying she was \"mortified\" by the manner in which Dobson's cited her findings. Both Pruett and Gilligan wrote letters to Dobson to express their concerns. So far, Dobson has ignored personally responding to their letters and refused to engage in a direct dialogue with the professors.\n \n On Focus on the Family's website, Dobson even defended himself by insinuating that these professors were \"liberal\" and \"politically correct.\" If this is true, it begs the question why Dobson quoted these researchers in the first place?\n \n \"If 'Double-Talk Dobson' had been accused by only one professor of manipulating research, it might be a legitimate mistake,\" said Truth Wins Out's Executive Director Wayne Besen. \"However, when six researches in three countries have stepped forward in less than a year, I think it is fair to say that a disturbing pattern of deception has emerged.\"\n \n In the same week Pruett and Gilligan spoke out, Angela Phillips, author of \"The Trouble With Boys,\" and professor at Goldsmiths College in London, said she was \"incensed\" to find she was misquoted in another Dobson article. Additionally, in the past year Dobson has been taken to task for distorting the research of Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry, Columbia University; Dr. Elizabeth Saewyc, associate professor, school of nursing, University of British Columbia; and Dr. Judith Stacy, professor of sociology, New York University.\n \n http://truthwinsout.org/news/?p=63",

My blood pressure.\n \n You completely ate up what Dobson was saying. You were fooled by him as he intended. \n \n He most certainly did imply that the informtation in the Pruett book contended gay parents were bad for kids. That's why he referred to it in that article. Pruett didn't say anything of the kind.\n \n Pruett (if you had really listened to the video) makes no comment either way about the adequacy of same-sex parents. He is extolling the benefits of men in raising children but was making no comment on two women raising a child. like Cheney & Poe, the central point of the article. He specifically states it is dishonest to make any judgement about this topic (same-sex parenting) based upon information in his book, and he specifically claims Dobson distorted his conclusions for his own end. And you blame Pruett. \n \n In Dobson's article:\n \n \nthe majority of more than 30 years of social-science evidence indicates that children do best on every measure of well-being when raised by their married mother and father.\n\n \n A tired canard. A religious right classic. The evidence states that, on average, children do better with two parents rather than one. It is unrelated to the gender of the parents. In fact, as Pruett states in the interview, that the science clearly supports no difference in the welfare of children of opposite or same gender parents.\n \n \nour conviction is that birth and adoption are the purview of married heterosexual couples.\n\n \n This is his point. No science supports this. Look if he wants to state this opinion, claiming it is his opinion, even saying it is based upon his take of the Bible or God's will or whatever, that is fine. But he quotes the work of scientists in his article, which make the very clear assertion that there is science behind his warped point of view, when there very clearly is not. \n \n \nWe should not enter into yet another untested and far-reaching social experiment, this one driven by the desires of same-sex couples to bear and raise children\n\n \n Same sex parenting is no experiment and it had clearly been \"tested\" as being just fine. \n \n How can you say Dobson doesn't distort the facts?\n \n You lament his over concern about gays? Despite the title of his group, he doesn't give a damn about the family. He will use whatever catch-phrase he needs - pro-family, anti-gay - to further his political strength. That is, the strength of fundamentalist Christianity in order to make the US a Christian theocracy. Too bad saps like you just lap it up.",

You were fooled by him as he intended. .........\n \n How can you say Dobson doesn't distort the facts?\n\n \n I didn't say that at all. He is indeed misguided on some things regarding gays. I said that he wasn't subscribing to Pruett those beliefs, and he wasn't. he was using Pruett's statements in an incomplete way to try and back up his own. Read more more carefully please.\n \n And I still find it odd that no one seems to care that Pruett himself made the statements he did. Obviously Dobson is wrong, but why is Pruett getting off the hook here for basically asserting that a kid who doesn't have a father isn't going to get what he/she needs? Logically that goes in the direction that families without fathers don't measure up. It looks to me like you completely ate up what Pruett was saying inhis video. Simply disavowing himself from Dobson alone shouldn't let him off the hook for what he wrote.\n \n \nYou lament his over concern about gays? Despite the title of his group, he doesn't give a damn about the family.\n\n \n Ok, first, of course Dobson is wrong on many of his views re. gay people. I'm with you on that. But I'm sorry, but I will not irrationally let ONE issue color my entire judgment of someone or something when what they do touches on many, many issues. He will be judged in my thinking on the whole of his work (including his bad views on gay people). Most of Dobson's books don't even deal with homosexuality--he's spent most of his life dealing with basic parenting issues, conflict management, friendship-level relationships, etc. I've READ some of them, and they don't deal with homosexuality. I'm NOT defending his positions on gay-related issues; I disagree with him on a LOT of that. But to throw out the bulk of his life's work based on ONE area of disagreement seems pretty irrational to me. It's the same logic anti-gay people use when they let ONE area of disagreement keep them from hiring a gay person, or when they automatically write a gay person off in every way because they disagree with them. Look, this intolerance toward people over single controversial issues is poison to society; people on BOTH sides need to get back to the marketplace of ideas and be willing to respect people despite differences of opinion. You may think otherwise, and that's fine. But I'm not going to do that.",

What you call \"trying to play it down\" is not that at all; it is explaining why I will not take someone like Dobson or ANYONE and go beyond the areas of the context of the issue I disagree with him on to criticise other areas because of that issue. Thelmoose stated that he doens't give a damn about the family. I would be much more prone to agree if the statement was that he doesn't give a damn about gay families. He also asserted that it was all to increase his \"political strength\". I'm not going to go that far, because I don't know if that's the case or not. Why on earth should I agree to things I don't know is the case? But clearly, he's against gays having families, and this is very wrong. Now that's the stand I've taken, and if you think taking the stand against him opposing gay families is excusing that he's against gay families, then you are either blind or being intentionally belligerent.

(AP) - The widow of Martin Luther King Jr. called gay marriage a civil rights issue, denouncing a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban it.\n \n Constitutional amendments should be used to expand freedom, not restrict it, Coretta Scott King said Tuesday.\n \n \"Gay and lesbian people have families, and their families should have legal protection, whether by marriage or civil union,\" she said. \"A constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages is a form of gay bashing and it would do nothing at all to protect traditional marriages.\"\n \n Last month, President Bush said he backed an amendment that would ban same-sex unions, calling marriage \"the most fundamental institution of civilization.\"\n \n On Monday, more than two dozen black pastors rallied against gay marriage at a church in Atlanta, attempting to distance the civil rights struggle from the gay rights movement. They signed a declaration outlining their beliefs that marriage should remain a union between a man and a woman.\n \n \"To equate a lifestyle choice to racism demeans the work of the entire civil rights movement,\" the statement said. \"People are free in our nation to pursue relationships as they choose. To redefine marriage, however, to suit the preference of those choosing alternative lifestyles is wrong.\"\n \n King, the widow of the slain civil rights leader, made her comments Tuesday during a speech at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. \n \n \n \n Funny how she supports not only gay marriage but gay rights! Clearly she see's both as the same struggle and a measure of equality. And she's the widow of MLK. If that doesn't shout that gay rights are civil rights I don't know what else does.",

   "Oh. This one is a doozy...\n \n \nBreaking News...NH PUBLIC: 64% SUPPORT MARRIAGE TO ONLY BE\n ONE-MAN, ONE-WOMAN\n \n Over the last two days, CPR-Action surveyed EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN NH - that's right, 432,398 households - and asked a simple question:\n\n CPR Action: NH Family Issues and Legislation\n \n Okay. Let's put this into perspective...\n \n First, when PROFESSIONAL organizations do polls, they typically have to take three days to complete the poll. These guys claim to have done it in two.\n When PROFESSIONAL organizations do nation-wide poll they call 1,000+ people (to typically achieve +/- 3% margin of error). The CPR claims to have done FOUR TIMES that number of calls.\n So what the CPR is claiming is that they supposedly did it SIX TIMES FASTER than the professional organizations who DO THIS FOR A LIVING... emoticon_frazzled\n \n Second issue of perspective.\n Nation-wide polls show that opposition to gay marriage is at 54% (lowest I've seen it), with 44% for gay marriage. That's across ALL 50-states.\n CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive - CNN Poll: Generational gap on gay marriage - Blogs from CNN.com\n \n But these guys claim to have polled EVERY HOUSEHOLD in New Hampshire in two days, and in a LIBERAL state like New Hampshire, the numbers are supposedly HIGHER against gay marriage.\n Quite frankly, that's like going to Nebraska and finding out that the average number of vegetarians is +10% in the state... emoticon_frazzled\n \n Final issue of perspective...On the eve of the Senate vote, a University of New Hampshire Survey Center released a poll showing 55 percent of New Hampshire residents in favor of civil marriage for same-sex couples and 39 percent opposed.?Gay Marriage? Bandwagon Rolls Through New England\n \n This is more in keeping with perspective #2. In a more LIBERAL, you would expect the support for gay marriage to be higher...\n And that's what they found.\n Contradicting the claims of the CPR...\n \n \n Add-on Note:\n Show us the data! - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor\n The CPR claims to have called EVERY household in New Hampshire.\n Yet, on this web-site, there are repeated examples of people FROM New Hampshire saying \"We weren't called\". \"My friends in New Hampshire weren't called\". emoticon_frazzled\n In fact, NOBODY on the web-site has any knowledge of any such phone calls.\n Of course, as time goes by and more people chime in with their New Hampshire experience, it will be more telling.\n \n But I suspect the CPR is lying, for the above reasons...\n (And if anybody wants to quibble about \"lying\", I guess a possible alternative exists in \"willful ignorance\", but how can a group be ignorant that they did not do the action they claimed to have done...\n So, I guess almost terminal incompetence, or obvious lying is what we're left with...) emoticon_frazzled",

   "What I find most interesting, and heartening, about some of the recent arguments against same-sex marriage is that many of the people who voice opposition to same-sex marriage have ceded so much ground to the pro-equality movement by endorsing civil unions or domestic partner benefits. We have increasing numbers of people who now say they support equal rights and benefits for same-sex couples, but just don't label it marriage. 15 years ago, opponents of equality for gay people were passionately and resolutely opposed to any legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Remember the howling in Vermont over civil unions? Opponents of equality insisted that there should be no legal civil unions, no legal recognition whatsoever for same-sex couples. Then civil unions became reality, and people in Vermont went on with their lives. The sky did not fall. And recently the Vermont legislature made same-sex marriage legal in that state. Not just civil unions, but marriage. And this was not done by the courts; full marriage rights were put in place by the elected members of the state legislature. \n \n The ground has shifted under the debate.

The sales pitch was \"cmon, can't you survive for just two hours without a cigarette?\" Would it have been fallacious for anyone at that time to proclaim \"someday they'll be ticketing truck drivers for smoking in the workplace. (their own truck) The answer of course is no, because it is happening in some cases. \n \n \nThat difference is that 'snakes!' is a fallacious argument. There is an extra, separate factor that would need to be overcome for the 'snakes!' argument to work (notably: consent from animals) - because this, equal rights for all sexualities has no effect on 'snakes!', because of that extra factor. \n\n \n Why would we necessarily need consent from snakes? We don't need animals consent to OWN them. If, in 30 or 40 years, someone finds a way to save a dollar in taxes or something by marrying a snake, I wouldn't find its occurance any more surprising than ticketing a truck driver for smoking in the workplace. After all, the original smoking bans on airline flights of 2 hours or less were about nothing but non-smokers health. At that time, there was no extra factor of smoking restrictions in areas where there are no non-smokers. But that factor changed. \n \n \nHowever, equal rights has always been the stated end-goal of the same-sex marriage side - the 'slippery slope' is only valid as far as that goal, because after that point, other factors once again apply. \n\n \n But as I've shown, goals can change - other factors can change.

The younger voters will replace them.\n \n Bigotry will go the way of the dinosaur, as it has for bigotries in the past.\n You may have scored touchdowns, but the game isn't over yet.\n The ball is still in play.

   "Depends on your point of view. From the view of those who feel it could cause a delayed harm to society, it's been a downhill slide. \n \n \n \n I don't know about that - seems to me it's still going down to defeat whenever it's voted on in many states. It may end up being something that's okay for some states and not others. That may allow it's long term effects (be they harmful or beneficial) to be made clear for all to see. Could take a long time.\n\n \n Of course how one regards the change depends on the person's point of view. From my point of view, the change toward acceptance of same-sex marriage has been progress. It's progress that has come about because of hard work by proponents of equality. \n \n I agree with you that full legalization of same-sex marriage in all states of the United States may take a long time. It probably will take a long time. Most significant changes do take a long time. But, to be honest, I never expected to see same-sex marriage legalized in any states in my lifetime, and that has happened. \n \n If we compare the struggle for equal marriage rights to the struggle for women winning the right to vote nationwide, we see a similar process. In the mid-19th century, at the time of the first women's rights convention in 1848 in Seneca Falls, the idea that women should have the right to vote was widely regarded as radical and ridiculous. Even the participants at the women's rights convention feared that demanding the right to vote might be too radical, that it might be going too far for activists. Before the Civil War, no states granted women the right to vote. Then came the first breakthroughs, starting with partial women's suffrage in Kansas in 1861, in school board elections. After this came full suffrage for women in the Wyoming territory in 1869 and the Utah territory in 1870, followed several decades later by full suffrage for women in Colorado in 1893 and Idaho in 1896. By the turn of the century, there came a wave of suffrage victories in various states. The experience of women voting in the early states, coupled with renewed activism by women for the vote and the rise of a progressive reform movement, turned the tide of public opinion gradually in favor of votes for women. There was strong resistance throughout this era, notably from the liquor industry, which feared women would vote in prohibition. Ironically, the prohibition amendment was ratified before the women's suffrage amendment. Full women's suffrage eventually came with the ratification of the 19th amendment. Nearly all of the southern state legislatures opposed women's suffrage, as is the case today with same-sex marriage. It took ratification by one southern state, Tennessee, to grant women the vote nationwide. \n \n The experience of the women's suffrage movement shows that important changes like granting women the vote do take a long time, because people have entrenched beliefs that they do not shed easily. Opponents of women's suffrage argued that granting women the vote would destroy the family, because it would undermine the natural roles and relations between the two sexes. That argument now sounds silly to our ears, but it was the common belief for most of American history.",

On one hand, the federal DOMA law explicitly says that no state has to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state, which was probably the case even before the passage of this law. (The full faith and credit clause of the constitution has always been interpreted by the courts as allowing for exceptions.) The big problem with the federal DOMA law is that it excludes same-sex married couples from the important federal rights and benefits of marriage. Social Security survivors' benefits are a significant federal benefit from which same-sex married couples are excluded. \n \n If marriage were only a state matter, and the federal government granted no specific rights or benefits to married couples, then we could say, \"Let the states decide,\" and gay people in some states could get equal rights and benefits through marriage. But right now, married same-sex couples cannot get equal federal rights and benefits, because of the federal DOMA law enacted in 1996. Yes, it was the Democratic President Bill Clinton who signed this bill into law, and it was one of the worst decisions he made as President. We need to repeal this law. President Obama has said we should repeal it, and I agree with him.",

Others here have vehemently argued against that.) It would be good to repeal DOMA, but no doubt special interest groups would come along and try to get laws or cases enacted to force states to change their definition of marriage, so there would still be federal intervention.\n\n \n Special interest groups, specifically groups opposed to same-sex marriage, have been working to change the states' definitions of marriage to explicitly exclude same-sex couples from marrying. That's how we have ended up with the various state DOMA laws and the DOMA state constitutional amendments. They are the result of special interest groups, often from outside the states, pouring lots of money into campaigns to change state laws or state constitutions to exclude same-sex couples from marrying. This happened recently in California. \n \n Whether a federal lawsuit will in time overturn these state DOMA laws is not clear, since we cannot see the future. I don't think any federal lawsuit that seeks to overturn such laws should ever be based on the full faith and credit clause of the constitution. Such a lawsuit almost certainly won't succeed, because of the exceptions to the full faith and credit clause that the courts have long allowed. I think that any federal lawsuit that seeks to overturn state laws banning same-sex marriage will have to be based on the 14th amendment equal protection and due process clauses, like the lawsuit in Loving v. Virginia. \n \n In the case of women's suffrage, women did try to get the Supreme Court to overturn state laws limiting the vote to male citizens. In the case of Minor v. Happersett in 1874, a woman named Virginia Minor sought to overturn in court the Missouri law that limited suffrage to male citizens. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in this case that Minor was indeed a citizen, as women were citizens. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to vote was up to the states; it was not a right protected under the 14th amendment. They ruled, in effect, that the U.S. constitution does not guarantee to all citizens the right to vote, and that citizen and eligible voter were not the same thing. This was a significant defeat for women's suffrage activists, who then had to push state-by-state and simultaneously for a constitutional amendment to win for women the right to vote nationwide. \n \n A question that would arise in a same-sex marriage case, in any legal challenge to state DOMA laws under the 14th amendment, is whether marriage is a right protected by the constitution. The ruling in Loving v. Virginia suggests that it is, at least in the eyes of the old Warren Court. The other issue would be how the Supreme Court would look at laws that discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation, whether these would receive strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny or ordinary scrutiny. Since we don't know how the Supreme Court would rule in such a case, we really can't predict a legal outcome. We may end up for years with states in which same-sex marriage is legal and states in which same-sex marriage is not legal. I think this will actually harm states where same-sex marriage is not legal, as it will encourage educated and talented gay people to leave for states where same-sex marriage is legal. \n \n Probably for some time to come, the United States will have a variety of laws in different states. We will have states with legal marriage and states with forms of legal recognition that are less than legal marriage but more than nothing. We have that now. California still has its domestic partnership law, which provides legal protections for same-sex couples. This is likely to continue for some time, with the southern states most likely to continue offering no legal recognition for same-sex couples and families.",

   "If we think about the different positions of conservatives vs. liberals on individual civil rights issues generally, we see differences that emerge over how the two groups conceive of power. Conservatives tend to be most wary of the power of the federal government, of centralized state power. Liberals tend to be wary of forms of power that emerge from different sources, such as from private business corporations and from the states and from individual citizens who would engage in oppression. Liberals are more willing than conservatives, usually, to employ the federal government to protect individuals from these other sources of power. For example, if we go back 100years, the progressives of the early 20th century sought to win passage of a federal anti-lynching law, to protect individuals, mostly African Americans, from other individuals murdering them in lynch mobs. They sought to use the power of the federal government to stop the abuses by private individuals against other individuals. Conservatives questioned the constitutionality of such a proposed law, arguing that the federal government did not have the power under the constitution to intervene in murder cases, that this was up to the states. Supporters of the proposed law argued back that the states were clearly not doing their duty to prosecute the lynchers, and there was an obvious need for a federal law to do what the states refused to do. A federal anti-lynching law was not passed, ultimately. \n \n There are numerous historical examples of the use of federal power to prevent either individuals or states from denying the rights of individuals. Conservatives have tended to dislike this use of federal power, because of their fundamental wariness of centralized government power. Liberals have tended to applaud this use of federal power, because of their view that states and individuals are just as likely as the federal government to deny individual rights or freedoms. \n \n Conservatives tend to see decentralized power and state and local control as the most democratic and as the most protective of individual liberties, in the old Jeffersonian tradition. Liberals tend to see state and local control and the rise of private power, in the form of business corporations or organizations, as just as threatening to individual liberties as federal power can be. Liberals have pointed to numerous occasions when federal power has been used effectively to protect individuals from either state-sanctioned discrimination or from private abuses of individuals and their liberties. The use of federal power to protect the rights of African Americans is the most striking example of this, but it's not the only example. The use of federal power to protect workers, through the Wagner Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, are two imporant examples of the use of federal power to protect individuals from private abuse. \n \n If we look at the rights of gay people, the federal government has really not done anything to protect gay people from either state discrimination or private discrimination. There have been a few examples of the Supreme Court interpreting the constitution as requiring equal treatment under the law for gay people and striking down state discriminatory laws. The examples are Romer v. Evans and Lawrence v. Texas. In terms of federal legislation, the federal government has so far done nothing to prevent the states or private individuals from discriminating against or abusing gay people. The ENDA bill to ban employment discrimination has not yet become law, and neither has the proposed federal hate crimes bill that would cover crimes motivated by sexual orientation. The federal legislation we have, namely the federal DOMA law, explicitly permits states to discriminate legally against gay people and calls for federal discrimination against gay people. When it comes to equal rights to gay people, the federal government has done nothing legislatively to support equality. It has been been private business and the states that have spearheaded progress toward full equality. \n \n I still, as a liberal, hold out hope that the Congress will pass and the President will sign some significant laws to ban employment discrimination and to add federal protections against hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation. However, up to this point, the federal government has done nothing positive to protect the rights of gay people, beyond two rulings by the Supreme Court. Most states have done nothing positive for equal rights for gay people either, with their passage of state laws and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage.

I hope you've been well. \n \n I am not sure why you have chosen to be so attacking in your post, particularly of my honesty. I have been entirely honest in what I have written. I am explaining how I understand modern liberalism vs. conservatism, and how I view the federal government's historic role in countering other forms of power, specifically the power of states and the power of organized private interests, such as business corporations, to deny equal and fair treatment to all. I also pointed out that the federal government, specifically the Congress and President, have done nothing to counter state or private discrimination against gay people. The Supreme Court has done so in two cases, through its interpretation of the constitution, but the Congress and the President have not, at least not yet. \n \n I in no way would throw out the constitution; I probably interpret it differently from you, but that's not throwing it out. I have said nothing here about a \"living constitution\" argument. I have not said how I think the Supreme Court should interpret the constitution; I have said here a little bit about how the Supreme Court has interpreted it and how the Supreme Court may in the future interpret the constitution. But of course I don't know how tje Court will interpret the constitution, and so my points about the future are speculative. \n \n The debate over federal power has most certainly NOT been settled, which is why we debate this question today.

   "Hi, Steeeve. I hope you've been well. \n \n I am not sure why you have chosen to be so attacking in your post, particularly of my honesty.\nDon't take like an attack on trying to be honest but more saying you should \"tell it like it is\". Furthermore, it applied to whomever. I apologize if it came across the other way.\n \n \nI have been entirely honest in what I have written. I am explaining how I understand modern liberalism vs. conservatism, and how I view the federal government's historic role in countering other forms of power, specifically the power of states and the power of organized private interests, such as business corporations, to deny equal and fair treatment to all. I also pointed out that the federal government, specifically the Congress and President, have done nothing to counter state or private discrimination against gay people. The Supreme Court has done so in two cases, through its interpretation of the constitution, but the Congress and the President have not, at least not yet. \nAnd what I am saying is this is an \"ends justify the means\" type of thinking so just state it as such. \n \n \nI in no way would throw out the constitution; I probably interpret it differently from you, but that's not throwing it out. I have said nothing here about a \"living constitution\" argument. I have not said how I think the Supreme Court should interpret the constitution; I have said here a little bit about how the Supreme Court has interpreted it and how the Supreme Court may in the future interpret the constitution. But of course I don't know how tje Court will interpret the constitution, and so my points about the future are speculative.\nWell treating it as any other contract is how I treat it. I suggest you are throwing it out by assuming it has a general purpose and the courts should do whatever it takes to accomplish this. It is clear from every founding document that this is not an approach they wanted. In fact, it was debated in the federalist/anti-federalist papers so why there is any question is beyond me other than for people to assume we should throw it out and work on a different set of rules. \n \n \nThe debate over federal power has most certainly NOT been settled, which is why we debate this question today. You apparently do not like the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitution in regard to federal power, but that's the law, since the Supreme Court has the last word on this. As John Marshall observed, it's up to the Supreme Court to say what the law is. \nIt was settled and is brought back up. If we actually followed the constitution the question would be ended. Funny you bring up Marshall who pretty much founded originalism..without it being called that. He said the court could invalidate a law if and only if it was unconstitutional. Going further we realize Marshall viewed the law as it was...not how it should change. So now that we have a different idea of what the court is, we see no direction in what federal powers are or state powers are. In reality, they were there the entire time we just choose not to read it.",

The constitutional debates since then have been over what is and is not constitutional. I think most people agree that the Supreme Court's power of judicial review means that the Court can strike down a law only if it is unconstitutional. The question has been what is constitutional; what does the constitution mean? That's what Marshall said it is the role of the Supreme Court to determine. \n \n Marshall went on to infuriate the Jeffersonians by declaring that the constitution provides for a strong federal government, that the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause give the federal government extensive regulatory power. Many disagreed with Marshall's interpretation of the constitution. The issue of what the constitution says about the extent of federal power has never been firmly settled, because people of different viewpoints have long read the constitution differently on this question. Those differences, as I'm sure you know, produced the crisis over the New Deal in the 1930s and the Roosevelt court-packing scheme that went nowhere. And then, as I'm sure you know, there came the so-called \"switch in time that saved nine,\" meaning the switch by Justice Owen Roberts from limiting federal regulatory power to supporting enhanced federal regulatory power. This \"constitutional revolution of 1937\" produced a longstanding consensus over time that the federal government has extensive regulatory power. That consensus has recently come into question, as the Supreme Court grew more conservative in recent decades. We will see what direction the Court moves now that there is a Democratic president and a Democratic senate.\n \n Do I argue that the ends justify the means? No. I simply don't interpret the constitution the same way you do, nor do I understand the constitution in the same way that you do. I don't think there is a fixed correct or accurate interpretation; there are just different interpretations of the constitution. Interpretations change over time. I'm not arguing that this is what should be. I'm arguing that because of the nature of human beings, it's what happens. Not everyone sees things the same way. I don't see the constitution as fixed or absolute, because it's always subject to human understanding, and human understanding changes, and different human beings see the same document differently. That doesn't mean that I think the constitution is meaningless or that anything goes or that the constitution should be interpreted to justify a particular outcome. I do think that people of different viewpoints will always see the constitution differently, and that's unavoidable because of our human nature. It's up to the Supreme Court to interpret the meaning of the constitution, and that interpretation has changed, because Supreme Court justices are people, and different justices come to see the same document differently.

Justices did not suddenly, in the 1950s with the Warren Court, decide that the words in the constitution could mean whatever they wanted them to mean. Critics of the Warren Court have complained that this is what the justices did, but I don't think that is true.

For example, the constitution says, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion....\" What does that mean? Different constitutional scholars and jurists have interpreted these words differently. One group is not just \"making it up\" because of what they want the words to mean. People read and understand the same words differently. Likewise, the 14th amendment has been the subject of much debate among those of us in these forums.

I disagree with your interpretation of significant parts of the constitution, as we both know from our previous discussions. I don't regard you as having bad faith or of making things up simply because I disagree with you. I see you as viewing the world differently from me, and I see you as reading the constitution differently from me. The fact that I see it differently from you does not mean that either of us is making something up. It means that we understand it differently. And that is always going to be true; everyone is not going to agree about the meaning of the constitution, because people are different, and people see things differently.

And I will argue that this has always been the question at issue in the constitution: what do the words mean? \n\n \n \nJustices did not suddenly, in the 1950s with the Warren Court, decide that the words in the constitution could mean whatever they wanted them to mean.\nYes they did. We could get into details but it went from looking at the historical meaning to tweaking the meaning to assuming broad meaning to meaning changes with the times. The Warren Court took the \"broad meaning\" approach. They said what is the spirit of the constitution as a whole. This assumes many things and when you assume you admit you don't know and if one were honest (warren that is) than we would see it is just another form of making it up. IE having an answer and working backwards.\n \n \nCritics of the Warren Court have complained that this is what the justices did, but I don't think that is true. I think the justices read the constitution and understood its meaning differently from many of their predecessors. \nThis would be fine, if true, but they did not base it on any kind of evidence. There basis for understanding was literally themselves and when you do that you can't say it is a matter of \"interpretation\" anymore. This is just dishonest.\n \n \nIt's simply not true that in interpreting the constitution \"you either go by what it says or you make it up.\" The meaning of the constitution is not that clear, which is why people debate its meaning.\n It is clear on a number of issues we find controversial today. And what I say has to be true. If I have a rent contract saying I will pay you $600 a month than either you look at that and say I owe you $600 a month or you make up something else. The argument HAS to be what the meaning is and NOT what the meaning should be or what the spirit is or anything else that assumes things. \n \n\n For example, the constitution says, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion....\" What does that mean? Different constitutional scholars and jurists have interpreted these words differently. \nWhile this is a more difficult one, there are several documents supporting the meaning. This is never argued. What is argued is how it should mean in todays society. The current \"liberal\" (i hate that term) justices don't see historical meaning as the only means of meaning. They take into account their idea of the norms in society. This forces them to make up a new meaning. There is no other logical choice.\n \n \nOne group is not just \"making it up\" because of what they want the words to mean. People read and understand the same words differently. Likewise, the 14th amendment has been the subject of much debate among those of us in these forums. It's been debated not because some people read the words as they are and other people make up a meaning. It's been debated because different people understand the meaning of the words differently. \nWhich is frankly idiotic. The phrases in dispute are actually elsewhere in the constitution. It is clear reading the history what they mean. Again this is not in dispute. The judges assume meaning out of it that was never discussed or adopted by the people that wrote/voted on it. Substantive due process, for example, makes no sense and is an oxymoron. Due process existed in another amendment and never had a \"substantive\" component. Nothing in history supported the idea for this and yet we use the doctrine today. No judge even claims it to be part of the historical meaning.\n \n \nYou seem to be accusing people who disagree with your interpretation of the constitution of having bad faith, of intentionally trying to distort what you regard as plainly true.\nNo, I'm accusing them of not really interpreting because they seem to not know what they word means. Interpret is not a license to recreate meaning. The meaning is set. Interpret is to explain that meaning...or in the case of a judge to appeal that meaning to a case with circumstances. This can only happen if the meaning is concrete and that is where the argument lies. \n \n \nBut that's not the case. People legitimately disagree with your interpretation of the words\nIndeed they can but only once it is agreed upon that a concrete meaning exists to begin with. Otherwise you are really basing your \"interpretation\" on nothing which gets back to my point of either having a meaning or making it up.\n \n \nThe fact that I see it differently from you does not mean that either of us is making something up. It means that we understand it differently.\n It does mean either one of us or both of us is wrong.",

Not only is it currently seen as unacceptable to suggest that minorities or women are not entitled to liberty or equal protection as they were not at the time of the Constitutional ratification, but neither do advocates of the living Constitution believe that the framers intended, or certainly demanded, that their 18th century practices be regarded as the permanent standard for these ideals.\n \n Living Constitutionalists suggest that broad ideals such as \"liberty\" and \"equal protection\" were included in the Constitution precisely because they are timeless, due to their inherently dynamic nature. Liberty in 1791, it is argued, was never thought to be the same as liberty in 1591 or 1991, but rather was seen as a principle transcending the recognized rights of that day and age. Giving them a fixed and static meaning in the name of \"originalism,\" thus, is said to violate the very theory it purports to uphold.Living Constitution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The 14th amendment explicitly utilizes vague terminology.\n Instead of picking specific terminology for the amendment, it was very vague.\n It is generally accepted that \"race\" would be an \"equal protection\" issue, but you'll note that the amendment NEVER STATES that race is an equal protection issue.\n In fact, the amendment doesn't even have a mention of \"race\" in the equal protection section.\n \n \n \nIt's a frightening thought that--if the same logic were applied-- interpretations of 19th amendment (for instance) could \"evolve\" to where it doesn't really MEAN what it says.\n\n Some people just scare easily...\n \n \n \nThere's nothing to be proud of in evolving a constitution far beyond what it actually says due to contextual interpretation.\n\n There is something to be proud in applying the concepts of equal protection and liberty.\n There is nothing to be proud in RESTRICTING those concepts, just based on legal semantics... emoticon_rolleyes",

It's a frightening thought that--if the same logic were applied-- interpretations of 19th amendment (for instance) could \"evolve\" to where it doesn't really MEAN what it says. Or that we could use it to justify more than it was ever meant to do. There's nothing to be proud of in evolving a constitution far beyond what it actually says due to contextual interpretation.\n\n \n That's just silly.\n \n By just exactly what Urim and Thummim can you peer into the minds of 18th and 19th Century men and discern with any sense of validity what they meant when they wrote words such as due process, interstate commerce, equal protection of the laws, and all of the other points that Constitutional scholars have debated since they were written?\n \n Further, by what hubris do you claim that your particular interpretation OR translation is to be preferred above all others?",

   "Translation is a type of interpretation. They are basically the same thing for purposes we are talking about.\n \n \n \n Yes they did. We could get into details but it went from looking at the historical meaning to tweaking the meaning to assuming broad meaning to meaning changes with the times. The Warren Court took the \"broad meaning\" approach. They said what is the spirit of the constitution as a whole. This assumes many things and when you assume you admit you don't know and if one were honest (warren that is) than we would see it is just another form of making it up. IE having an answer and working backwards.\n \n This would be fine, if true, but they did not base it on any kind of evidence. There basis for understanding was literally themselves and when you do that you can't say it is a matter of \"interpretation\" anymore. This is just dishonest.\n \n It is clear on a number of issues we find controversial today. And what I say has to be true. If I have a rent contract saying I will pay you $600 a month than either you look at that and say I owe you $600 a month or you make up something else. The argument HAS to be what the meaning is and NOT what the meaning should be or what the spirit is or anything else that assumes things. \n While this is a more difficult one, there are several documents supporting the meaning. This is never argued. What is argued is how it should mean in todays society. The current \"liberal\" (i hate that term) justices don't see historical meaning as the only means of meaning. They take into account their idea of the norms in society. This forces them to make up a new meaning. There is no other logical choice.\n \n Which is frankly idiotic. The phrases in dispute are actually elsewhere in the constitution. It is clear reading the history what they mean. Again this is not in dispute. The judges assume meaning out of it that was never discussed or adopted by the people that wrote/voted on it. Substantive due process, for example, makes no sense and is an oxymoron. Due process existed in another amendment and never had a \"substantive\" component. Nothing in history supported the idea for this and yet we use the doctrine today. No judge even claims it to be part of the historical meaning.\n \n No, I'm accusing them of not really interpreting because they seem to not know what they word means. Interpret is not a license to recreate meaning. The meaning is set. Interpret is to explain that meaning...or in the case of a judge to appeal that meaning to a case with circumstances. This can only happen if the meaning is concrete and that is where the argument lies. \n \n Indeed they can but only once it is agreed upon that a concrete meaning exists to begin with. Otherwise you are really basing your \"interpretation\" on nothing which gets back to my point of either having a meaning or making it up.\n \n It does mean either one of us or both of us is wrong.\n\n \n Just quickly, the Warren Court did rely on evidence in arriving at its various rulings, both evidence in the constitution and evidence produced about the wider society. The latter kind of evidence has been controversial in some circles, because some folks argue that evidence from the society, what some have called \"sociological evidence\" should be irrelevant to Supreme Court decisions, as their job is to interpret the law, not to base interpretations on the effects of the law. \"Sociological evidence\" was introduced in the Brown v. Board of Education case, where the plaintiffs introduced the doll test evidence to try to show that segregated schools negatively affected African American children's perceptions of themselves. One can certainly argue that this is inappropriate evidence to present to the Supreme Court, and one can argue that it's up to elected leaders to wrestle with the social effects of the laws they pass, not up to the courts to consider this, since courts are not supposed to make laws; their job is to interpret the laws. But the Warren Court did consider evidence. They also considered how the laws actually affected the real lives of real people. They did not simply make up new laws on the basis of nothing. One could argue that the Supreme Court in the Plessy case also considered sociological arguments, from the state of Louisiana regarding their asserted need to preserve order by separating the races. \n \n As for whether the meaning of the constitution is \"set,\" I think this is impossible. It's impossible because different people can read the constitution and see different meanings in it. And the intent of the framers is not necessarily clear. We had, as I recall, a long argument about the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment in which you dismissed the expressed intent of the amendment's chief author John Bingham, saying that his view was not the original intent. If you think the intent of an amendment's author is not the original intent, then you end up making an interpretation of what the original intent was based on what you think the people who pushed through the amendment believed. That's often hard evidence to track down. You end up interpreting what you think the supporters of the amendment thought, on the basis of a little bit of evidence. To claim that your interpretation is therefore the true one and that the interpretation of others is just made up is simply labeling your own interpretation the right one, on the basis of only partial evidence. \n \n On the establishment clause, the supporters of both the separation of church and state interpretation and the non-preferentialist interpretation look to documents from the framers of the amendment, especially to Madison's comments. People from both camps look to the evidence from the framers. \n \n Anyhow, we have ended up going off into a discussion again about how the constitution should be interpreted, and that's not my point in my posts on same-sex marriage. I have been talking about how the constitution is likely to be interpreted, not how I think it should be interpreted. It doesn't matter whether we agree with how the Supreme Court interprets the constitution or not. In working to legalize same-sex marriage, we have to be pragmatic and pick battles we are likely to win. We have to consider how the Supreme Court is actually likely to rule, not how we think they should rule. The questions here are strategic. How do we win? Bringing lawsuits is just one avenue that we have pursued and may continue to pursue. We have also pursued legislative strategies, and these are starting to be successful. And we have for years pursued private sector strategies that have been quite successful, in winning partner benefits, for example.",

It's impossible because different people can read the constitution and see different meanings in it.

If I say \"the sky is blue\" who gets to set the meaning of this? The speaker. It would have been my thought and therefore i know exactly what it means. The same goes true with the constitution.

In any event, a disagreement on the original meaning is fine and I'm not saying those things happen. I argue against the idea that you change that meaning or add to it. Such is the case for substantive due process which was never argued as original meaning. When you talk about intent is when you get into the ideas of overall intent (like saying the purpose of the constitution is to gtive freedom) which is basically an assumption. Assumptions go against the exact meaning and you get into an area where a judge makes up ideas. This is the entire idea behind substantive due process. You seem to be arguing something that I am not. Take the homosexual sodomy case (lawerence). No original meaning anywhere in the constitution ever gave a right to homosexual sodomy. The arguments basically came to the idea that you need a compelling state interest to have a law. This idea comes from the due process clause which never had this meaning when adopted including when due process was just in the fourth amendment.\n \n In other words the court relies on made up tests and assumption about provisions in the constitution to obtain an outcome. I argue against this. \n \n \n We have to consider how the Supreme Court is actually likely to rule, not how we think they should rule. The questions here are strategic. How do we win? \nIn my opinion this is a dishonest way to do business and is a reflection of what I am saying.

While it is a reality that you can get what you want from the courts the method is still not legitimate and is dangerous to our country.",

   "and then they say with a straight face that _____ is unconstitutional. Seems to me if the constitution \"evolves\" that you really can't say for sure if something is or isn't constitutional.\n\n Honestly? I wish some people would apply the same logic TO THEIR RELIGION, but when it comes to their religion they often turn into \"evolving interpretation\".\n \n Take abortion for example. Nowhere in the bible does it say life begins at conception. In fact, some bible verses would logically point to life beginning when blood is flowing...\n Lev. 17:11-For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.\n Lev. 17:14 because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites, \"You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.\"\n \n Gay marriage is another example.\n I can recognize how your bible tells you to not be gay or get into a gay marriage.\n But in this day and age, Christians recognize the capability to allow other people to be of a different religion, which would conceivably violate the first commandment if one interpreted the bible sins as a means of espousing them on others.\n But by the same token, some Christians think that they are being called on to PREVENT gay equality. Nowhere in the bible does it say you have to prevent OTHERS from having their sodomy, but Christians take a \"liberal\" interpretation.\n \n The list goes on and on. There are numerous sins in the Old Testament which are never contravened. But modern Christianity ignores them.\n There are numerous commands in the New Testament which Christianity has \"evolved\" from. Commandments espousing misogyny.\n Interpretation of the bible has even \"evolved\" so that while it's perfectly okay to own a slave in the bible, suddenly modern Christianity thinks the bible is against it...\n \n But for a lot of Christians, their RELIGION can evolve, but protecting freedoms and liberty isn't supposed to?\n Wait! I get the difference.\n Cause recognizing an evolving freedoms and liberty reality would INHIBIT those same Christians from espousing their religion onto others...\n Makes perfect sense...\n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "My argument to you is that in most instances, Supreme Court justices have not simply made up their own meaning for the words in the constitution.\nIn some instances they don't. I argue more for the method and not the result. If every judge bases their decision on the original meaning of the provision than there will always be honest disagreement which was the case in the 1800s when you either had judges use the original meaning or lie about the original meaning. Today's standard is the meaning changes with the \"evolving standards of decency\" which has no basis in the constitution and on one really argued that it does. Substantive due process is the precursor to this which is also used and also doesn't rely on original meaning and in substance (hehe) is really creating law.\n \n \n There probably are instances where they did, or where they reached conclusions that went beyond the issues in the case at hand, such as when Justice Taney declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional in the Dred Scott case.\n Oddly enough this case was the first case that used substantive due process although not called that. \n \n \nBut in most cases, I think, the justices havefaithfully tried to discern the meaning of the constitution.\n Really? Right to Privacy being based on the prenumbras of many different amendments? That doesn't come across as a little bit of a stretch? The judges basically said that they think the meaning of these amendments about specific issues that sometimes relate to privacy was getting at an overall right to privacy but they were just not smart enough to write one into the constitution. \n \n Substantive Due Process is \"faithfully\" applying the meaning? The term doesn't even make sense.\n \n If these judges were being honest that would just say \"we think our job is to use our judgment to decide what the constitution should say\". In other words they are the most powerful lords in our government.",

   "I'm not arguing that people should bring lawsuits with no basis. That's not an effective way to win a suit. Plaintiffs do that all the time, and the courts throw the lawsuits out. But it's up to the courts to determine whether a suit has a legal or constitutional basis; that's what the courts are for. Different parties have different views of what is a legitimate lawsuit. The goal of plaintiffs is to win the suit, not to ensure that a particular interpretation of the constitution is preserved. The latter is the role of the justices, not the plaintiffs. \nYou suggest it is ok to be dishonest because it is someone elses job to figure out you're being dishonest. I'm saying it is not ok to be dishonest. \n \n So in the case of a constitutional question, if you know a judge will rule in your favor but also know he/she is wrong in doing so than you allowing that is also wrong.",

   "I do think the history of a provision guides the justices in determining what the constitution means. I have not disagreed with you on this. The problem, though, is that the evidence is often thin, or even contradictory. The duty of the Supreme Court, as John Marshall said, is to say what the law is. That's not simple. If it were simple, we probably would not need a Supreme Court. \nI didn't say it was simple but if you don't know than you don't know. Bork was right about the ink blot analogy.\n \n\n The Court has to make rulings all the time on questions on which the constitution is silent or ambiguous. You have suggested, if I understand you correctly, that if the wording of the constitution is not clear, and if what you call the \"set meaning\" of the constitution cannot be determined with certainty, then the Court should not act to strike down a law as unconstitutional. \nWhat would you be basing it on?\n \n \nBut different justices reach different conclusions about what the \"set meaning\" of the constitution is, and about whether they are certain of their understanding. That's the source of disagreements about Supreme Court rulings.\nNo it isn't and Breyer, for one, admits this. Breyer looks for how it evolves and what it should mean in terms of todays \"standards\". This is why he looks at current foreign law and current trends for coming up with a meaning of a constitutional provision.

It's a question of different parties having different views of what the law means. Plaintiffs sometimes do file lawsuits based on clearly silly legal arguments, and I don't advocate doing that. Such lawsuits are usually thrown out. \n \n When plaintiffs file lawsuits based on a particular view of what the law means, and the other party argues based on a different view of what the law means, this is just what happens in our legal system. It's how the system is set up. Each side advocates its position. There is nothing dishonest about that. \n \n Let's take the James Dale Boy Scout case, for example. James Dale argued that his being kicked out of the Boy Scouts violated the state law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accomodations. The Boy Scouts argued that they are a private, not a public accomodation, and so the law does not apply to them. Each side had a different view of the meaning of the law. The Supreme Court had to address whether the Boy Scouts provide a public accomodation or are private, and it was a difficult decision. They had previously ruled that the Jaycees and Rotary clubs do provide a public accomodation, because of their size and reach, and are required to comply with a state's laws barring discrimination on the basis of sex. The Boy Scouts were not discernably more private than the Jaycees, but the Supreme Court ruled in this case that the Boy Scouts are private and not subject to the anti-discrimination law. It was never clear what made the Boy Scouts private and the a Jaycees and Rotary clubs public accomodations. The Supreme Court has been inconsistent in rulings of this kind. Anyhow, neither party in the lawsuit was being dishonest. Both were trying to win their cases by advancing a particular interpretation of the law. In that case, James Dale lost, and the Boy Scouts won. The Supreme Court made the ruling.",

She never blamed GM for her husband's adultery.) \n \n It's bad enough that gay-marriage advocates engage in terrorism by sending white-powdered envelopes to California churches because they lost the fair-and-square Prop 8 vote.\n \n Now, a solid majority of Americans are \"twisted\" because they hold the \"wrong\" view on gay marriage.\n \n Pathetic.\n .\n\n \n Note the bolded; The answer to your question Jennifer, is absolutely YES! And homophobic, bigoted, prejudicial and hateful and other names which they feel serves their victim status which they work so hard to promote.

   "Is this the debate tactic used by \"gay marriage\" advocates? To label any opinion that differs from theirs as \"twisted\"?\n\n No.\n \n I invite you to review the many posts on this thread documenting a repeated pattern of outright and inexcusable deceit.\n For example, Professor A and Professor B do research, with conclusions including #1, #2, and #3.\n \n Along come the anti-gay crowd, who proclaim that their research concludes \"purple\".\n Professor A and Professor B explicitly speak out and proclaim that their research does NOT conclude \"purple\".\n \n I recommend you review the contents of the thread, rather than judging hastily from the title. There is much \"logic\" that is indeed \"twisted\" amongst the gay marriage opponents.\n That isn't to say that they don't have other arguments (that I feel is flawed in other ways)...",
