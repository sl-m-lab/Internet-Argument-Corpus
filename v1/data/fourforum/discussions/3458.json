   "Has anybody else absorbed what GWB is saying when he talks about his \"Health Care Plan\"?\n \n From GWB's website:\n \n \nExpand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) - President Bush will propose a tax credit for low-income families  and individuals to purchase health insurance, or to purchase a low-premium, high-deductible  health plan and an HSA. Families will receive up to $2,000 for their premiums and $1,000 cash to put in their HSAs to help meet the deductible. Individuals will receive up to $700 for their premiums and $300 for their HSAs. \n\n Does GWB actually think that an entire family can buy health insurance and pay high deductibles on $3000? Translation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself. We constantly hear that a major reason for the increase in health care costs is the cost of the uninsured. How does it help it tell low-income/unemployed/minimum wage workers to save their money? Once again, businesses will love this. Don't offer health insurance to employees - they're self insured. Or they can get it themselves through their church!?!?\n \n \nPromote a Health Savings Account Tax Credit to Help Small Business Employees - President Bush will propose a tax credit for HSA contributions to help individuals and families who work for small businesses fund their HSAs.  Small businesses and their employees who set up an HSA will get a tax rebate for contributions to the HSA of up to $500 per worker with family coverage and $200 per worker with individual coverage. \n\n Repeat of what I just said. Now, speaking of big government. The government gives money, although not near enough money, to every employee of a small business.\n \n \nProvide an Above-the-Line Deduction for Health Insurance Premiums - President Bush has proposed to allow individuals who purchase low-premium, high-deductible insurances policies to deduct the premiums they pay for these policies. It will reduce the net cost of these policies and encourage the use of HSAs for saving for health care needs and making wise, cost-effective health care choices. \n\n Yeah! Just don't go to the doctor so much - because their is no insurance for office visits.\n \n \nAllow Small Businesses to Establish Association Health Plans (AHPs) - While large businesses can use their purchasing power to get better deals from insurance companies, smaller firms often find that coverage is priced beyond their reach. To give small employers and their workers more purchasing power, the President has proposed allowing small businesses to band together and negotiate on behalf of their employees and their families. \n\n \n \nExpand Association Health Plans - President Bush supports AHP expansion so that people who purchase coverage on their own can buy health insurance from a group other than an employer. This would allow civic and charitable groups, churches, and other types of organizations to offer health insurance to their members. \n\n Faith based insurance now.\n \n \nAllow Shopping for Health Coverage Across State Lines - Today it's easy to use the Internet or toll-free numbers to shop for products. But different rules apply to health insurance. Consumers can only purchase health insurance in the state in which they live, and can't shop around for a better deal in another state. The President proposes giving people the freedom to shop across state lines to find the best rates for their health coverage. \n\n Speaking of states rights - insurance is STATE regulated. Anybody want to get into a states rights debate on this one?\n \n I don't really see any changes here - at least not for the good. We already have this system - pre-tax payroll deductions that can be used for deductibles. GWB just wants to expand it BIG TIME and give employers an out when they offer lousy or no coverage. GWB's entire plan to reduce costs - don't sue anybody. And GWB's best advice to the poor - save your money.",

However, if I were part of a large company, with thousands of employees, a much lower cost would be possible.\n \n So, by having a national \"group\", healthcare costs are kept lower.\n \n If you don't want basic healthcare for everyone in America, then you obviously don't want to fund healthcare for everyone in America that cannot afford it. Other people are a little more compasionate, and realize that all the captialistic cash comes directly from the effort of humans. Our free market economy can make a single person a billionaire over-night, but you're saying a portion of that should not be used to keep kids from dying because their parents are too poor?

That's GWB's idea. He's basically absorbing part of the cost of health care away from the employers.\n .\n \nSo, by having a national \"group\", healthcare costs are kept lower.\nAnd what's more, the huge numbers of uninsured are getting their health care for free - at least what they get. An uninsured person brought in to an emergency room with a heart attack is a total loss to the hospital and the doctor. Maybe it would have been cheaper to get that poor soul high blood pressure pills. Where do you think the money comes from for his hospital stay? Our pockets too in the form of higher costs to those who can pay. There's no free ride for any of us.",

Agreed it may take a bit of regulation - like people who are forced to buy high risk car insurance - and companies who are forced to sell it. But anything is insurable. Ask Lloyd of London. It takes thinking outside the box. Our view of health insurance is a box.

They played a nice numbers game concerning projected rates of growth during prosperous economic times to fool people into thinking that. The national debt was never paid off.

The human body heals itself, it's not like a car that needs it's oil changed. Good health is a LIFESTYLE, not doctor visits. Health care professional don't profit when a person in poor health simply dies before they are able to do that heart surgury for them. Health care professionals love to do check-ups and tests. \"Hey the tests all came up negative - you're fine - that'll be 4 grand, but not to worry, your insurance will pay for it!!!!\n \n They say in America you can be whatever you want to be, but you'd better be born with a silver spoon if you want to be a doctor, given all the hoops you have to jump through to be \"approved\".

Wonder if he's checked with the churches on this? Boy were they surprised.\n\n \n \n Paragraph 5 does not suggest that we buy health insurance from our church. It simply suggests that our church or charitable institutions should have the option of offering health care for its members. We have a huge number of charitable organisations in this country whcih controll billions of dollars. At one time, charity was not a government mandated function. For years, charity was voluntary and the churches in this country kind of led the way when it came to looking after the poor. Now, the govertnment has taken over such functions, and the price tag on them has gone from large (but voluntary) to huge and involuntary. Instead of being administered at a local level by a dozen volunteers working fro free, our big charity programs are nationwide, administered by a massive beuracracy, and eat up 80% of the funds allocated to them in administration costs (leaving only 20% to actually help those who need it).\n \n What bush is suggesting here is that we give these charitable organisations an opportunity to flex their muscles and help out some folks who don't have health insurance or whose insurance though their employer is so poor that it is cheaper to go another route. \n \n \nGWB's idea is all encompassing. It's not limited to low income. He verbally phrases it in a way to allow people to hear what they want to hear. You heard help for poor people and thought that sounded good. That's politics for 'ya. Actually, he suggests passing out seed money in Health Savings Accounts to the entire population and subsidizing insurance costs that are currently paid by small businesses. Although, I don't see why big businesses couldn't get in on this too.\n\n \n No, it is not limited to low income. It also encomapses small business and the self insured as well. It basically tries to cover everybody who does not have insurance now, or who is paying terribly high premiums. There is no \"passing out seed money in Health Savings Accounts to the entire population\". The two groups he is sugessting handing out seed money too are low income (though I would suggest they use their \"earned income tax credit\" for this) and small businesses. \n \n I own a small business, and every year I negotiate a new health care plan for my employees. I do the best I can for our folks, spend the time shopping around, etc.... but we still end up paying nearly 3 times what boeing does for their insurance. I pay for 95% of the cost of employee insurance and 75% of the cost of dependant coverage. A guy who lives up the road from me works for a construction company which pays 80% of the cost for insuring the employee, but pays none of the cost of insuring dependants. His family is not insured (wife, kids, etc...) because they simply cannot afford the high premiums. These are the kind of folks who would benifit from HSA seed money. I know of no other small business besides mine which pays such a large chunk of the eployees dependants health care coverage. Frankly, it is a problem.\n \n If he actually mnaged to push through the Associated health plans for small businesses, that wold be a huge step in the right direction. Frankly, it seems unlikely that it si going to happen, since the insurance industry has such a strong lobby, and as we know, our politicians are nothing but special interest whores.\n \n Neither canidate actually has a really good plan when it comes to health care. Bushs has some obvious flaws, as does Kerrys plan (Kerry actually DOES want to start out by handing out free money to everybody in the country).\n \n I think that when you look at the two plans side by side, the bush paln is the better one. \n \n You seem unhappy with the idea with bushes ideas in regard to tax rebates for small business ($500 per family, $200 per individual). Lets take a look atr what kerry is proposing for small business:\n \n \nTax Credits to Make Coverage More Affordable. Refundable tax credits for up to 50 percent of the cost of coverage will be offered to small businesses and their employees to make health care more affordable. In addition, the premium rebate pool for certain high cost health cases will help reduce costs for everybody. This protection is especially crucial for small businesses, as they have traditionally fared worse in the marketplace from an inability to sufficiently spread risk. The premium rebate pool and access to the Congressional Health Plan will save small businesses approximately 15 percent in health care costs on top of the tax credit - so health care will be two-thirds cheaper for small business employees than it is today. \n \n \n Refundable tax credits for up to 50% of coverage cost? That is a LOT more than $500/family or $200/individual per year. In addition, you see him talknig abou the \"premium rebate pool\". this is a kerry concept where a pool of money is created (though he never says where this money comes from, we all know it is a new tax) to help pay premiums. He also advocates opening up the Congressional Health plan to everybody, effectively creating a government run health insurance company for private citizens. Personally, I don't want the government to own my health insurance company. The govvernment screwing everything has become a cliche, I don;t wnat them screwing up my health insurance. \n \n I don't think either of these guys has a workable plan, but Bushes is certainly cheaper, which I think is important, since we can't really afford either plan. \n \n What I like abotu Bushes plan is that even if you take away the part that costs taxpayers (the tax rebates and such), you still have a workable plan. Merely by allowing small businesses to band together when negotiating for health insurance, or allowing churches and other charitable organisations to provide a plan if they desire, I think that a significant portion of the uninsured could obtain affordable insurance coverage. Can you even imagine the kind of negotiating power the catholic church would have at the table if they decided that they werew going to offer insurance coverage to their memebers? they would be able to write their own policy and insurace companies would still compete for the account.\n \n With kerrys plan, if you take away the parts that are going to cost the taxpayers money that they can't afford to spend, there is no plan. His entire mentality in all of this seems to be \"we will just have th government pay for it\". Kind of makes you wonder iuf he understands where the governments money comes from....",

   "Your post was so long that I just didn't have time to respond earlier. But now, here goes.\n \n \nHe is not making that choice for everyone. He is suggesting it as an alternative for those who are unable to get/afford  insurance on their own. While there are certainly questions about having poor people on a high deductible plan, it is still better than having no insurance at all. \nWhich is it get or afford? They're not even close to the same thing. I'll focus on afford. We are talking about poor people here. So, the logic escapes me. I'm not in favor of just giving away unlimited coverage, but follow my train of thought. The purpose of insurance is to limit loss. If a poor person has little/nothing to loose, why would they spend their few precious dollars on something that is only to the benefit of the health care provider? Ever heard the phrase, you can't get blood from a stone? This is a system by which a health care provider can. But the poor won't buy it for the same reason we don't put collision insurance on a $500 car. This is high-deductible insurance. Chances are excellent that the insured will never see a penny in benefits. They're poor. They're not stupid. And this is a CASH giveaway. The word CASH is in there.\n \n \nParagraph 5 does not suggest that we buy health insurance from our church.\nOf course it does. First, I don't see why churches would be interested in getting into this. But suppose they did. Carry that out a little ways. You don't have to go far. Will they offer it to all, or only their best customers. You can have insurance IF you tithe? I don't think salvation on this side and the other should quite that closely connected.\n \n \nIt simply suggests that our church or charitable institutions should have the option of offering health care for its members. We have a huge number of charitable organisations in this country whcih controll billions of dollars.\nSo what's your point? What does a charity's balance sheet have to do with health care? It's charity.\n \n \nAt one time, charity was not a government mandated function. For years, charity was voluntary and the churches in this country kind of led the way when it came to looking after the poor. Now, the govertnment has taken over such functions, and the price tag on them has gone from large (but voluntary) to huge and involuntary. Instead of being administered at a local level by a dozen volunteers working fro free, our big charity programs are nationwide, administered by a massive beuracracy, and eat up 80% of the funds allocated to them in administration costs (leaving only 20% to actually help those who need it).\nYou just said that charities have billions of dollars. Is charity alive and well or is it not.\n \n \nNo, it is not limited to low income. It also encomapses small business and the self insured as well. It basically tries to cover everybody who does not have insurance now, or who is paying terribly high premiums. There is no \"passing out seed money in Health Savings Accounts to the entire population\". The two groups he is sugessting handing out seed money too are low income (though I would suggest they use their \"earned income tax credit\" for this) and small businesses.\nI assume you're talking about paragraph 2. There's nothing in there about income level. This is money to EVERYone who works for a small business. Not it's not cash. It a tax credit/rebate. This difference is what? And I can't wait to see the wrangling over \"small business\". Accountants and lawyers will have a field day with their little corporate tricks to ensure that they make the cut.\n \n Then comes paragraph 3. Deductions for individuals. I'm ok with making it deductible. It probably should be. But just tell me why more and more and more people won't fit into this one as companies just stop giving health insurance. And that's also where he courages the wise, cost effective (low-cost high-deductible) system again. The over all feel of his plan sends up a domino effect is coming.\n \n \nIf he actually mnaged to push through the Associated health plans for small businesses, that wold be a huge step in the right direction. Frankly, it seems unlikely that it si going to happen, since the insurance industry has such a strong lobby, and as we know, our politicians are nothing but special interest whores.\nI already showed you where he doesn't have to \"push it through\". It already exists.\n \n \nRefundable tax credits for up to 50% of coverage cost?\nAgreed. It's too much. But I don't see it happening anyway so it doesn't concern me. See I think Kerry has good thoughts, some of which could actually materialize. This one won't. All of George's \"plan\" could actually make it. There's the risk.\n \n \nIn addition, you see him talknig abou the \"premium rebate pool\". this is a kerry concept where a pool of money is created (though he never says where this money comes from, we all know it is a new tax) to help pay premiums.\nThis is the best idea he has. It's a method of taking the kid out of your group who needs a kidney transplant. Why wouldn't you love that idea? One person in a small group is a big issue.\n \n \nHe also advocates opening up the Congressional Health plan to everybody, effectively creating a government run health insurance company for private citizens. Personally, I don't want the government to own my health insurance company. The govvernment screwing everything has become a cliche, I don;t wnat them screwing up my health insurance.\nEverybody who wants to. It's a choice. Another option. Not a mandate.\n \n And here's real help for the smallest of the small businesses:\n \n Self-Employed And Individual-Based Coverage\n Individuals Without Employment-Based Coverage Pay More for Health Insurance. About 16 million people, or 6.7 percent of those between the ages of 19 and 64, were covered by an individual health insurance policy in 1999. Many of these workers are independent contractors, on-call workers, or temporary workers. In all but five states, individuals or families buying health insurance on their own can be charged higher premiums, or denied coverage, if they have health problems.\n \n Take my sister for an example. She's 62. Her COBRA just ran out. GWB have any ideas for her? Not one. She does have assets to protect. The issue is, can she afford to. She's willing to pay. She's not looking for a hand out. Just a fair shake. Low-cost high-deductible would probably be a good option for her. GWB didn't give her an idea about where to buy it. Why does it have to be so difficult. Taking a chance starts to look like a viable option.\n \n \nI don't think either of these guys has a workable plan, but Bushes is certainly cheaper, which I think is important, since we can't really afford either plan.\nI disagree that he's cheaper. He has a record to run on, too. That no dealing with drug companies for prices is just unforgiveable. Lowering cost doesn't seem to be in his vocabulary.\n \n \nWhat I like abotu Bushes plan is that even if you take away the part that costs taxpayers (the tax rebates and such), you still have a workable plan.\nThe taxpayer costs is the only new stuff. That and churches.",
