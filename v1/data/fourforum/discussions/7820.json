   "[I am fully aware that this post is very long. However, I felt that presenting the whole thing in one dose was the only way I could articulate the argument sufficiently to express the important points without it being derailed on minor issues along the way.]\n \n It is difficult to get away with making moral statements in a discussion forum. This I think is largely due to the increasing formation of an international culture devoid of any authoritative voice; \"who,\" it is asked, \"can decide whether something is right or wrong?\" Yet even in this authority-lacking environment I have noticed a universal distaste for violence. No one on these forums is approving of heinous destructive violences like the holocaust. It remains an effective tool for promoting any number of causes, accusing the other side of having an ideology that leads to violence. Some examples recently have included gay rights activists blaming those who disapprove of them for being prepared to commit genocide and religion-bashers blaming the phenomenon of religion for the world's history of violence. Some have questioned the applicability of these arguments, but I have not seen anyone denying the moral authority of the denunciation of violence. The abhorrence of brutal murders, genocides, and even such more commonplace crimes as theft seems strangely universal in the face of a collapse of moral authority. I have no desire to change that universal agreement, I think it quite a good thing. What I wish to consider is what ethical/philosophical ideology is necessary to oppose violence in society?\n \n What is the cause of violence? I would like to assert, as I have previously, that it is selfishness that results in violence. If one person steals from another, they only do it because they consider their happiness more important than the other person's happiness. If someone murders another, it is because they valued their gratification over the life of that other individual. If a person kidnaps or rapes or abuses another they will not do it unless they consider themselves and their gratification in whatever way to be of more value than the other person's wellbeing. These situations can be intensely complicated, and I do not mean to treat them lightly. People who abuse others often do it because of the pain inside themselves and the abuse they have themselves endured; but the chain of violence has to begin somewhere, with someone's selfishness. Many people who steal do so because they have been trapped, perhaps for generations, in a societal structure of forced poverty. But in their case there remains a root selfishness on the part of those who created the poverty trap for their own profit, out of greed and bigotry and avarice-all of which have selfishness at their root. So even when we see situations where the starving man steals bread to eat and feel far more inclined to have compassion than to condemn, there is no escaping the root of selfishness behind that act of violence...perhaps selfishness on the part of many, and the theif's was certainly not the greatest. This statement about violence, that human selfishness is its cause, may seem trivial and obvious, but it is vitally important that we recognize it as we attempt to recommend any ethic to prevent violence.\n \n It is clear that the popular ethical systems at work in the mind of society are not terribly successful. Columbine and the BTK killer are more spectacular examples of atrocious violence that is not at all uncommon in US society in our time. Naming the fundamental ethical systems that were supposed to prevent such atrocities and establishing why they have failed so continuously is vital before we recommend any solution. We are not looking at the law here; law is an institution established by society. It stands on the ideological framework of that society's ethical principles-so it is in those principles that all inquiry lies.\n \n The most popular underpinning system seems to be an ethic of human rights. In theory, if it is universally established that every human being deserves certain things then we will all agree to ensure those things to everyone. But this is a flawed ideology. First of all, and most important to our immediate purpose, it is flawed pragmatically. Human rights is a self-focused ethical system; the attention is directed inward, on what things the self deserves and is entitled to. This is not a point that can be debated in our society; the whole issue of abortion is defended on the basis of the mother's right to choice or privacy. There is a clear common sentiment that an individual's obligation is to protect their own rights, that way everyone is protected. But there is no clear line of where an individual's rights end...so we have these strange claims of young people that they have a right to do whatever they want in a variety of odd ways. These things are no longer even sensational. Human rights ethics only lead you to look out for yourself, because they are inherently self-focused. The right to freedom is easily extended to a right to do whatever gives one pleasure or fulfillment; and when that intrudes upon the rights of others, people often feel completely justified. After all, in such a situation, someone's rights had to be violated; and in a self-focused ethic, the only reasonable choice is to violate the rights of the other.\n \n Some might say, \"wait a minute, there's no right to do whatever brings you fulfillment.\" It may not be in the constitution, but it seems that many people believe they have such a right; how else would they allow their selfish desires to overcome the rights of others? It may be subconscious, but they certainly hold that there is a deeper right invested in them, one geared towards their happiness. And who decides what rights an individual has? The law is only a statement of the rights that can be legislated and reinforced, it is not the source of them. This is the second criticism of human rights ethics. The first is that they fail because they are founded on the same self-centeredness that is the root of violence. The second criticism is that they are philosophically indefensible. On this forum I have experienced an overwhelming consensus that atheistic systems of human rights have no foundation. There is no reason, apart from a theistic moral framework, to assert that there exist real human rights of any sort, even the most basic. And while theistic systems may have more grounds for doing so, I argue that ultimately they do not support the idea of human rights but generally (I'm afraid I cannot speak for all religions) their teachings in fact point to all rights being deserved to the sovereign deity, who alone deserves to exist (which is attached to the claim of necessary or perpetual existence). For further reference on the non-existence of any real human rights I defer to Mach and Ubergeek and the already well-trodden discourse in the thread \"Whence Come Human Rights?\"\n \n Where then do these atheistic denouncers of human rights point us to for an ideological framework for orderly society? The social contract theory. This theory basically operates the same as human rights ethics, only it is less consciously moralistic. It states that everyone in society should agree to establish certain arbitrary rights for one another so that they will in turn be protected. But we cannot get very far along this theory without asking, \"what is the moral principle that undergirds this system?\" Social contract advocates would like to say there isn't one, but there is. This theory firmly rests upon the principle that one ought to behave out of self interest, to do what is best for the self. I have already attacked social contract theory before, and with no consequential rebuttal. I don't like to be repetitive, but I don't wish to be misrepresented and don't trust some readers to go out of the way following a link, so I'm going to reprint an excerpt from my earlier argument against the validity of social contract theory for halting violence:\n \n \n In response to these delineations of social contract theory I want to level this criticism; it lacks ultimate efficacy. Social contract rights are only effective within the ability of humans to force acquiescence. In some places that ability is severely limited, and nowhere is it near perfect. The fundamental principle of this theory is that humans are selfish, and that selfishness is applauded as what maintains order. But in making this move, to not only acknowledging the obvious selfishness of humanity but to reinforcing and praising it we give full reign to the impetus behind all violence even as we strive for a humanistic method to prevent it. What I'm saying is this; selfishness is the root of violence, putting one's own desires above the wellbeing of others. The selfishness of a man is what prompts him to rape a woman, even though the experience was thoroughly degrading to her, and it is what prompts him to steal from another. The social contract says \"it is in your best interest to agree to x rights\" and in doing so it says of the actions of rape and theft that they may not be done yet says of the reason for them that it is perfectly valid.\n \n Is the inconsistency clear yet? In a social contract society I am told that my selfishness should keep me from killing my neighbor, because if I do I will be thrown in jail. In telling me that, it acknowledges that I am centered upon my own desire to kill this neighbor who has offended me and turns that desire into the reason I shouldn't do it, making a greater selfish desire. But my ultimate devotion to myself has been reinforced all the more so that while guards have been put in place externally--that is, outside of myself--to prevent me from committing murder the same rationale that placed them has given full sway internally to my impetus to violence.\n \n That is where we see the intensely limited quality of these prohibitions. What if I am smarter than those who enforce the laws protecting human rights? Then I will commit whatever acts of violence I please, because the counterproductive logic that placed external safeguards on the rights of those I wished to harm removed the internal barracades that might have prevented me from it. That is why the social contract is powerless against all the violence in America today. The BTK killer did what he did because modern man has said there is nothing preventing you from doing violence except the force of society to stop you.\n \n ... every violence done in human history is a testimony to the failure of the social contract in practice and an adherence to its moral teaching of self-centeredness.\n So it seems that there is an objective moral authority at work, which all our relativism was powerless to stop from emerging. Here is my conclusion, that the selfish morality of the social contract propels people forward to violence, and the external guards it builds in reply to this malady are ultimately ineffective.\n \n \n Now that we have established that our current popular ethical ideologies are not only inept at preventing violence but, worse, are themselves a continual impetus to violence in the human heart, it is time to consider if there are any viable alternatives. I would like to posit one, the only one that I have yet come across that seems consistent at opposing violence both within the individual and by setting up safeguards on an external level. What we are looking at is a responsibility ethic. Responsibilities are the outward-direction parallels of rights; it is not a concern for what you deserve, nor is it a concern for what another deserves, but rather it is a concern for the manner in which you are obligated to treat them. Rights says \"I deserve life.\" Responsibility says \"I am obligated to protect and preserve the lives of others.\" Rights says \"I deserve freedom.\" Responsibility says \"I am obligated to protect and preserve the freedom of others.\" This provides an adequate basis for law. The murderer can be convicted, not because his murder violated another's right to life, but because he was responsible to at least passively preserve, if not actively protect, the life of the other and he violated his responsibility by doing the opposite. More importantly, however, responsibility ethics does not fall prey to the major failing of human rights and social contract systems-that they implicitly support the selfish impetus to violence. The person whose concern is their responsibility towards others can not by that ethic justify behaving violently toward the other (as some have been in the habit of doing under human rights ethics). If we are really concerned with stopping violence, we need to realize that our current ethical systems are counterproductive and instead support a responsibility ethic, the only one that is capable of justifying a concern for the other that negates violence.\n \n This is not so simple, however. A responsibility ethic, like a human rights ethic, does not stand on its own. There are two prerequisite components that must exist within a worldview to allow for the formation of a responsibility ethic. The first is absolute morality. If there is no absolute, objective moral standard on which to judge right and wrong, then responsibility ethics are impossible. It must first be established that there is a wrongness to murdering an innocent child before we can posit that people are responsible to not murder children. This dependency on absolute, objective morality is not a unique requirement of responsibility ethics but of ethical systems in general. The second requirement is that morality be others-centered. This may seem redundant, but it is an important distinction. Responsibility is the ethical outworking; others-centeredness is the general moral framework that lies even deeper. There must be something inherently wrong about murdering babies to postulate that we ought not do it, and that wrongness must lie not in the moral sanctity of the baby to not be murdered but in the moral reality of the action of murder being wrong in order for responsibility ethics to be the proper outworking. Natural law ethics are untenable for our needs, because they are centered upon the sanctity of the individual. Responsibility ethics must be centered upon the sanctity of the other, or of a supreme Other.\n \n That leads us to the final underlying necessity, where responsibility ethics becomes ultimately unacceptable for many. This absolute, others-centered morality too cannot stand on its own. It needs a foundation. Some have suggested applying a false foundation, a noble lie, asserting that such a framework does stand on itself when we know this to be untrue or postulating some fictive reason for why absolute morality exists. But this surely is a deplorable route to take. Shall we attempt to prohibit violence by a tremendous and sustained act of intellectual violence? It seems that this is what we have done all these past centuries, and perhaps that is in part responsible for the perennial failures of human rights and social contract ethics. If there is no foundation people will see it, they will realize it is vacuous, and they will rebel against it.\n \n The only alternative is to posit that there is a real absolute, necessary and supreme being who provides the foundation for absolute morality. Enter theism, the only adequate basis for absolute morality, in turn the basis for responsibility ethics, in turn the only workable system for opposing violence both without and within the human being. God is necessary, and without Him there is no foundation.\n \n Some may object, in frustration, but there is no God! If you believe that, you cannot believe there is absolute objective morality. Following back up the path of the discussion it becomes quite apparent that you cannot have responsibility ethics. You must either choose between self-contradictory and vacuous systems or be utterly at a loss. It gets worse, however. The atheistic need also jump from the realization that without God there can be no absolute objective morality to the point at the very beginning of this forum that there is something wrong about violence. There is only something wrong with violence if there is an absolute, objective moral standard by which to distinguish between right and wrong. God is required to oppose violence effectively in ethical ideology. God is also required to oppose violence even in theory, to judge it as bad or wrong. Without theism we not only give up the only adequate ethical theory for opposing violence, we also give up our justification for being morally opposed to violence...and this discussion becomes meaningless. But to even get so far in this lengthy essay testifies to a conviction that there is a wrongness to violence, to the holocaust and the brutal murders, rapes, and terrorist attacks and all the violence within the past century. There is something wrong about violence, but only because there is a God.",

If someone murders another, it is because they valued their gratification over the life of that other individual.\n\n \n All actions are selfish, it is the nature of a person that they act according to their own desires. While this includes murder, it also includes not-to-murder. It is the characteristic of action not of violence specifically that it is selfish.\n \n For example, while it is correct that \"If a person kidnaps or rapes or abuses another they will not do it unless they consider themselves and their gratification in whatever way to be of more value than the other person's wellbeing.\" It is also true that if a person prevents a kidnapping or a rape, they will not do it unless they prefer that option to the alternative.\n \n This is the basic flaw in your position, equivalent to \"All apples are food, therefore all food are apples.\"\n \n Any supposed \"ethic\" that demands people not be selfish is not an ethic of \"non-violence\", it is essentially an ethic of non-action, for non-people, and it can only be furthered by a system of governance which strips man of his humanity and treats him as an animal or a machine, not conscious of his own desires.\n \n If all man does is selfish, and selfishness must be abolished, what room is left for man?",

   "Some may object, in frustration, but there is no God! If you believe that, you cannot believe there is absolute objective morality.\n\n \n Indeed, because there isn't; morality has no existence in and of itself; there is only the morality of each individual, and the morality of each society throughout history. The fact that moral codes tend to be pretty much the same wherever and whenever you look suggests that they evolved as part of our social evolution, as a survival tactic. Evolution isn't all competition; co-operation is equally useful.\n \n Most societies throughout history did not apply the morality they used within their society to other societies; going further back you didn't break the code within your tribe because the code increased your tribe's survival prospects; other tribes were fair game. \n \n The prominent example from modern times is the supreme irony of US POWs (sorry, 'unlawful combatants') being subjected to state-approved psychological torture.\n \n \nThere is only something wrong with violence if there is an absolute, objective moral standard by which to distinguish between right and wrong.\n\n \n But the idea of there being something intrinsically \"wrong\" with violence has no meaning; concepts of \"right\" and \"wrong\" exist only within the human mind. I only have my own, subjective, morality, and my society's subjective morality. The two are broadly similar but differ in specifics. I don't need anyone to tell me what's right or wrong; my parents and my society did a good job of the basics when I was a child, and now I make my own mind up. \n \n I distinguish between what I think is right or wrong; what you or anyone else thinks is right or wrong is irrelevant to my morality, unless it is proven to me that a given moral standard that I hold is based on ignorance and/or prejudice, in which case I will review it. \n \n \nGod is required to oppose violence effectively in ethical ideology. God is also required to oppose violence even in theory, to judge it as bad or wrong.\n\n \n Nope. Again, I do not need God to know that I oppose violence in principle, and I do not need God to make judgements. I make my own judgements thank you very much, because I believe in myself enough to be confident to make such judgements.\n \n \nWithout theism we not only give up the only adequate ethical theory for opposing violence, we also give up our justification for being morally opposed to violence...\n\n \n Who says we need a \"theory\" or \"justification\" for opposing violence?

That comes from within ourselves, from our natural and nurtured humanity. I believe that, with a very few exceptions, violence is wrong in principle. I do not need there to exist a deity or an objective, supernatural code of morals for me to be 100% confident about my personal moral code. \n \n Even on those momentous occasions when I learn or experience something that forces me to review and even alter that code, at no point am I less than 100% confident about it, because it makes me who I am.

   "Obvious Child, you have beaten me to the punch. I will therefore abridge my intended reply to the assertion that all action must be selfish, since you have so well pointed out the flaws of that assertion.\n \n There is a good distinction that has been made by Symbiote, that not all selfishness is or leads to violence. However, ethical theory on violence is only concerned with the selfishness that does lead to violence, so I think this is a bit tangental.\n \n As to all action being selfish because the actor will in some way please himself (in that taking a bullet for a friend may be morally gratifying) I think what we are concerned with is primary motivations. The moral pleasure that may be gained by behaving in accordance with one's responsibilities is, to the extent that it can be labeled \"selfishness\", a secondary motivation. The primary motivation, the wellbeing of another, is focused on that other and thereby definitively unselfish. To assert that the actor is always selfish regardless of his motivation is to redefine selfishness in such a way that it no longer becomes a useful descriptive term; now \"I eat selfishly\" becomes \"I eat.\" This has no effect on our ethical discourse; all it serves to do is encumber the linguistics of our dialogue and force us to create new terminology for the behavioral motivations we had previously associated with selfishness.\n \n \nI distinguish between what I think is right or wrong; what you or anyone else thinks is right or wrong is irrelevant to my morality, unless it is proven to me that a given moral standard that I hold is based on ignorance and/or prejudice, in which case I will review it.\n\n \n Isn't there an inconsistency operating here? You seem to believe that people should not hold moral standards based on ignorance or prejudice; why? Is there something wrong with having a prejudice-driven standard, or is that just a preference that you have decided upon for yourself but wouldn't impose upon others?\n \n Tell me, do you care if I murder people? Why? \"What you or anyone else thinks is right or wrong is irrelevant to my morality,\" isn't that right? So if I think it's okay to murder those I don't like, will you tell me I'm wrong? Maybe it would be wrong for you, if you decide it is, but it's only wrong for me if I decide. You can try to force me to obey your moral code, if you're a bigot (by this rationale). Doesn't it frighten you to think that people might think like this, might carry it to their logical conclusion? Does this not justify all the most brutal tyrants of the world?\n \n \nWho says we need a \"theory\" or \"justification\" for opposing violence? We are each individually imbued with morality at an early age by our parents and our society, then as we mature into self-confident adults we review those morals and make changes if necessary, based on knowledge and experience.\n\n \n Why do we need to justify what we think and do and the way we behave? It's strange that such a question should emerge on an intellectual forum where most people seem to live as though their opinions require rational justification. Why are you trying to justify intellectually your belief that there is no objective morality? I think you're doing it because you see something superior to reasoned ideas over pure capriciousness. Reasoning requires that we have intelligent justifications for why we do what we do.\n \n \nNo. Violence in and of itself has no morality or ethics attached to it. That comes from within ourselves, from our natural and nurtured humanity. I believe that, with a very few exceptions, violence is wrong in principle. I do not need there to exist a deity or an objective, supernatural code of morals for me to be 100% confident about my personal moral code.\n\n \n Unfortunately, your personal code has no pragmatic power for preventing violence beyond yourself. If you decide the morals for you and I decide the morals for me, any authority that attempts to impose a uniform law will be doing violence to the legitimate morals of any number of people. Because without authority, we have lost the ability to meaningfully critique the moral decisions of others. If I murder someone you cannot accuse me of wrongdoing; I did wrong to you, but not to me, so it's simultaneously both and absolutely neither.\n \n What happens then when we witness the great violences of history? Years ago I journeyed to Auschwitz/Birkenau, the concentration camp and death camp in Poland. Many, many people died there. I can stand there and say, \"this was wrong. There was something bad about the massacre of so many.\" You cannot. The best you can do is say, \"I think this was wrong, so it is to me. Hitler and Eichmann thought this was right, so it is to them.\" Does that not bother you?\n \n \nViolence in and of itself has no morality or ethics attached to it.

I do not need there to exist a deity or an objective, supernatural code of morals for me to be 100% confident about my personal moral code.\n\n \n It is clear that you have no need of God to hold a moral code that could be used by anyone to justify any act of violence. On the one hand you wish for reason, citing changing your views in accordance with acquired knowledge and experience, avoiding prejudice and ignorance in an admirable fashion. On the other hand you discard rational justification, hailing capricious human opinion as the defining factor of morality--\"a personal moral code\".

   "Ugggh...I had written such a thorough post...and my viscious computer devoured it...you shall have to settle for the abridged version; I'm too tired to type it all again.\n \n *the peasants rejoice*\n \n I felt that violence had a fairly evident context in the original post. But I have creeping fears that some may be inclined to ignore that and take it arbitrarily to mean \"all acts of one human harmful to another\". So now I will state plainly, remaining within the original context but drawing it out directly, the working parameters of violence under examination. We are not considering all forceful acts. Violence of the type considered is criminal violences such as theft, rape, and murder, and state-scale violences of large type such as genocide, segregation, and most wars. This does not include active resistance, executions sanctioned by the state justice system (those these may be violent of our type we cannot establish them as categorically so) or wars fought for preventitive or deterrent reasons (whether any such exist in practice, they are at least theoretically possible). The reasons for the separation are obvious; those in the latter category only exist as responses to the former.\n \n \nAnd so if I murder someone to promote the wellbeing of someone else, this action is focused on that other and thereby definitively \"unselfish\".\n \n So we have selfish acts which are non-violent, and non-selfish acts which are violent - so then what does selfishness, in the narrower sense, have to do with violence? Absolutely nothing.\n\n \n Let us explore the rationale at work here. So, if we can contemplate a possible exception, however obscure, it negates the overwhelmingly accurate causation observed? I'm going to make another argument along these lines; it is not meant to be a perfect parallel to the previous, but rather to demonstrate how ridiculous it is to try to nullify the normative by a rare, if concievable, exception:\n \n Given: All over the world people live in poverty because they do not have resources available.\n \n Contention: Sometimes a person has resources available yet lives in poverty by choice.\n \n Conclusion: If someone who does have resources lives in poverty, in what way does the lack of resources cause poverty? Absolutely none.\n \n Again, it is not an exact parallel of your statement, it only demonstrates the silliness of declaring that an exception must negate the normative. And I would assert that people who live in voluntary poverty far outnumber those who commit truly altruistic violences of our category where there is no root selfishness--that is to say, this is a very generous comparison of an exception, rare though it might seem.\n \n Why do I say \"those who commit truly altruistic violences of our category where there is no root selfishness\"? Because that is the requirement for a violent crime to perform the function of \"incriminating exception\" that you seek. The example you gave\n \n \nAnd so if I murder someone to promote the wellbeing of someone else, this action is focused on that other and thereby definitively \"unselfish\".\n\n \n can be understood in three ways (by me, perhaps you can think of more) only one of which meets this description.\n \n 1) It could be that the murder is commited to protect someone who is threatened by the other. That would be unselfish on your part, but for the situation to arise there needs to be selfishly motivated potential violence on the part of your victim, otherwise you would not have the exigency for commiting the murder (and I am in no way attempting to justify a murder commited to protect someone--only in the most extreme cases, where all other possibilities had been exhausted would the act become active resistance and thereby justifiable).\n \n 2) It could be that the murder will profit the other you care about in a way that you will benefit from, perhaps by sharing the profit, perhaps by association with the other in their new status, or perhaps by in some twisted way earning you their love and affection. This is obviously driven by a selfish motivation on your part that underlies your supposed altruism and must be rejected.\n \n 3) It is concievable that a person could be so wrapped up in another that they would commit a violence where there was no exigency for defense or personal profit to be gained by the promotion of the other, a truly altruistic violence of our category, for which there is no root selfishness. This alone satisfies the criteria required to make it an exception to the normative condition of criminally violent acts being rooted in selfishness on someone's part (and recall, this is not always the perpetrator of the crime, as in structurally impoverished communities that may see a high rate of crime). But if we were to quantify the occurence of this type of violence it would be undeniably negative next to the scope of human experience of atrocity. Such a negligable exigence, even if theoretically possible as an exception, can no more negate the causation between selfishness and violence than the comparatively abundant history of self-renouncing hermits negates the causation between not having wealth and living in poverty.",

This is not saying that selfishness will be the immediate and most evident motivation in every crime (rage, say, may take precedence at times) but rather that it is the controlling factor which dictates whether or not commiting the violence is feasible to the person. Having, by the very nature of the violence we are observing, ruled out altruistic motivations for why \"they must have considered the benefits of that person's death worth more than their life\" the only thing that remains is selfish motivations, barring a concievable (if negligible in real occurance) exception.

There is only vacuousness if, as you originally stated, it is impossible to have anything but selfishness as motivating human action. However, your own counter-example defied that assertion by positing the altruistic violence; not only is it possible to have another motivation for general action, but you yourself posited the possibility (however immensely unlikely, per the definitive analysis of the nature of violence) of altruistic violence. The non-action critique, while otherwise promising, fails upon that.\n \n The point of this thread, moreover (in answer to ubergeek) is to establish whether responsibility is a superior ethical theory for dealing with violence.",

   "I think we should recover the true question posed at the beginning of this debate: is responsibility ethics, as defined by Quardon7, the most appropriate theory of ethics that can prevent violence in the social context?\n \n First of all, I think it is important to clarify what the discipline of ethics studies. Ethics, as a branch of philosophical thought, is not concerned primarily, as is deduced from the argumentations of Quardon7, with the search for formulae of social peace and prevention of violence between people. Ethics has a much more profound, personalistic object: the pursue of personal happiness. All the theories of ethics that have been presented across the history of Western thought, beginning with Aristotle, claim that ethical perfection (as each thinker sees it) leads to true happiness, which is a state of supreme fulfilment of the human person. Therefore, what Quardon7 has presented as \"responsibility ethics\" is really a combination of two disciplines: law and ethics. The question about responsibility replacing rights is an issue that falls within the competence of law, and not of ethics, because it refers to the relations between people, involving the exchange of goods and rights (including intangible goods, like life or freedom). However, the much more profound proposition of an \"others-centred\" foundation for human action is a very philosophical proposal, that falls entirely within the question of what ethics are for the human action, but even further down into the realm of the human action itself, which is a philosophical question debated from Socrates to the present. Therefore, an analysis of this idea of \"responsibility ethics\" must fall within the categories of both law and ethics.\n \n Now, before speaking of this theory, I will refer to the debate about the nature of the human action, and if it is necessarily founded on self-interest, because it is the base of the \"responsibility ethics\" proposal. This is a very debated philosophical issue. Hobbes was the first philosopher to first provide us with a complete theory that all action is founded on a \"love of the self\", and is therefore selfish. Selfishness is here understood as a direction of the mind: the person thinks only (or primarily) of himself when deciding to act, and ponders the situation based on the benefits each situation and circumstance can give him. I think, first of all, that this idea, which is at the base of Quardon7's idea that all violence is selfish, is a very gross simplification of what the human action is, how it is designed by the free will, and where it comes from. All human action is based on two prerequisites: a free will and a desire, the desire being a tendency of the will. A desire cannot be called a selfish canon, because there can be, as has been pointed above in several posts, a desire for another's wellbeing, just as easily as the desire can be self-centred. So, as we can see, there is absolutely no necessity for a human action to be selfish, be it violent or not. The question of whether selfishness is a determining factor is internal, it is located in the mind of the person, when he is designing his action, and so it is irrelevant if that action is externally violent or not. So, saying selfishness is always present (and more, it is a determining factor) in all human action (or all violent action) is a misunderstanding of the true complexity of the human action. The desire behind each action, that direction of the person's will, will of course be different for each person, each action, each circumstance, each concrete situation. Secondly, and on more political terms, I think that stating that a person's action (be it or not violent) is ALWAYS inherently selfish is contradictory with the entire notion of ethics. Ethics is a discipline which is based on the dignity of the human person (dignity as understood in philosophy by Aristotle, the Roman jurists, St. Thomas Aquinas, Kant, etc,), individually considered. That dignity is founded, among other things, on the idea that the person is innately good, that each person's will has a natural tendency to goodness, and to do good. Stating that all acts are selfish is a negation of this fact, and therefore a negation that the person has a fundamental dignity, thus destroying the entire edifice on which ethics stand. How can there be an obligation to respect others if those others are inherently evil? Evil is of course what we are fleeing from, what we want to avoid, and saying that to be good we must first overcome an innate tendency of our will to do evil is fundamentally contradictory with the entire idea of ethics, of morality, and even of law.\n \n With respect to the idea of \"responsibility ethics\", I believe that, despite what I have stated above, the possibility that people base their actions on altruistic motives can be considered a generally good thing (although we must always consider each individual case to make such a judgement). However, this is absolutely irrelevant if we want to eliminate violence, because a person's desire to be violent to others comes not from an innate selfishness of violent acts, as suggested by Quardon7, but from a conscious decision of the person to obviate the moral knowledge they possess naturally. So, when we want people to stop being violent, it has nothing to do with their selfishness, but rather their internal capability to follow the dictates of their reason in their decisions and actions, in other words, virtue. This is something that has been argued and pursued for ages, so it's nothing new, but it is the most complete, true and correct explanation. \n \n With respect to the idea of replacing rights with responsibilities, as I said earlier, it is a legal question, so we must consider it under the canons of legal reason. In law, there is always an inherent and natural correlation between a right and a duty, my right to life necessarily implies everybody else's duty to respect and protect my life. This is why, for example, we have in Europe what are called crimes of omission, in which you are incarcerated for not helping someone who is in manifest and grave danger. Why? Because there is a general duty of intersubjective solidarity, that is, we all have a DUTY to respect the rights of others to life and health (for example). This is a legal structure which is of fundamental importance in the theory of law. Therefore, replacing a right with a responsibility makes no sense, because in law there can be no responsibilities if they are not referred to the protection or fulfilment of another's right. This is not only true of the great fundamental rights like life or physical integrity, but also in the most trivial relations between persons. When I buy a TV, the store that sells it to me has the duty to give me the TV in good shape, which corresponds with my right to receive that which I have bought. Also, vice versa, they have the right to receive the price agreed upon, which corresponds with the duty I have of paying it in due course.",

Ethics has a much more profound, personalistic object: the pursue of personal happiness.\n\n \n Now that is an interesting observation. If it is true that the object of ethics is the pursuit of personal happiness, then we have indeed been working at cross purposes here; for my post took as its beginning not a question of what would bring about my happiness but instead what might satisfy a more utilitarian desire for peace that would bring overall happiness. Of course, this requires sacrifice; the pursuit of personal happiness would have to be lowered in favor of the wellbeing of others...and to work, it would have to truly be that way, not merely looking out for others as a means to the end of your own happiness (if we allow that, the smart and strong can take the shortcut and secure their own happiness through whatever violence they feel necessary). So if that statement is true, and ethics is about personal happiness, then certainly there can be no grounds for dismissing selfishness. Of course, I will have to disagree and assert that ethics is applying moral principles in life; but that is contingent upon the existence of absolute morality, a different (if related) debate.\n \n \nHowever, this is absolutely irrelevant if we want to eliminate violence, because a person's desire to be violent to others comes not from an innate selfishness of violent acts, as suggested by Quardon7, but from a conscious decision of the person to obviate the moral knowledge they possess naturally.

On what basis can a person \"obviate the moral knowledge they posses naturally\"? When they abide by their moral knowledge they are being responsible, or virtuous as you say. When they do not, they are being selfish and allowing some unvirtuous motivation to overthrow their \"moral knowledge,\" putting their own personal desires for profit, revenge, pleasure, acceptance, glory, challenge, excitement, or what have you above their commitment to moral knowledge that is centered upon the wellbeing of others. It may not be conscious, but the selfishness of the act (and its contrast to others-centeredness) must be there, otherwise they would be incapable of doing it. It is not always palpable, but like a gate it is the deciding factor in whether an immoral act will or will not be enacted--in our context, an act of violence. What you call \"obviating moral knowledge\" is equitable with the selfishness involved in ethical decisions.\n \n \nIn law, there is always an inherent and natural correlation between a right and a duty, my right to life necessarily implies everybody else's duty to respect and protect my life. This is why, for example, we have in Europe what are called crimes of omission, in which you are incarcerated for not helping someone who is in manifest and grave danger. Why? Because there is a general duty of intersubjective solidarity, that is, we all have a DUTY to respect the rights of others to life and health (for example). This is a legal structure which is of fundamental importance in the theory of law. Therefore, replacing a right with a responsibility makes no sense, because in law there can be no responsibilities if they are not referred to the protection or fulfilment of another's right.\n\n \n It is true that they are closely correlated; differentiating between them is a matter of perspective. But that does not mean that having one necessitates the presence of the other in a direct relationship. Let me clarify what that means. It is true that responsibilities require rights to exist somewhere--but they do not have to pertain to the party directly injured by the violation of the responsibilities. If I steal kill dog, my responsibility was not violated primarily as concerns the dog (who was most directly affected) but as concerns you, the owner of the dog. So it is entirely possible for me to have responsibilities whose violation would not correspond to any rights of yours, but rather to the rights of some higher authority who has a claim on your wellbeing. By saying this I am of course bringing the argument once again into the theistic worldview. But outside the theistic worldview human rights are nonsensical and arbitrary--they don't exist outside of law, and the capacity of law to reinforce them.\n \n But only a theist can even entertain the suggestion that it is God's rights, and not human rights, that are the corresponding reality to human responsibility. Apart from the belief in God, demonstrating how responsibilities can be separated from any supposed rights of the injured and deferred elsewhere serves only to emphasize how frail the notion of absolute rights is for atheistic systems.\n \n So perhaps the entire embattled question need be put off. There are other, more fundamental differences which control what we can affirm about human rights, the connection with morality, and even the purpose of ethics. The feasibility of theism and the existence of objective morality may be necessary precursers to this debate.",

   "Your arguments are compelling, I must say. However, if we are to propose a new theory of ethics, it is important that we comprehend, to some extent however minimal, the history of this branch of human thought. Ethics is a discipline that searches for the formula to achieve the perfection and fulfilment of the human person. This fulfilment is achieved through virtue. Now the concept of virtue is of course (like most philosophical definitions) equivocal, though not relative nor undetermined. A virtue is a habit of action; it is the \"training\" of our lower potencies (passions). This training makes them inclined to do what reason commands. A person who lives their life like this is a virtuous one, and probably a saint. Now, the fulfilment of this ideal is what we call happiness. Thus, the concept of happiness is more complete and complex than mere selfish pleasure. It is a state of complete realisation and, ultimately, of wilful sacrifice. You see, the happiness is found in that virtuous sacrifice, which consists in the power to dominate one's self and be able to thus give what one is in entirety to others. In the end, ethical fulfilment lies in a state of natural satisfaction that derives from our capability of acting rationally and in so doing perform nothing but goodness. This is of course an ideal. \n \n However, you say that our inability to achieve that level of virtue stems from selfishness. I would not go so far. To say that evil behaviour is a consequence of selfish pondering means that the notion and measure of one's self is constantly and consciously in the scheme of our acting, as its object and purpose. However, many evil deeds are committed without the conscious presence of such deliberation. This means that the source of evil, rather than selfishness (which can be seen as a strength of character -however distorted it may be), is the weakness of our will in the face of our most basic and immature tendencies. It means that the government of our actions is given not to our rationality, but to the lower potencies, our passions and desires. Now, you might say that therein lies the selfishness, but I disagree. To follow one's passions and desires is not a trait of our will; it is rather a deficiency thereof. In other words, when we do evil (unless the person is utterly disturbed even in their intelligence -psychotics) we act against our better judgement, against ourselves, we attack our own reason. Thus, despite the possibility that selfishness might be a motive behind wrongdoing, it is not its ultimate cause. It is the weakness of the will in the face that very selfishness which brings us to evil. So, with some misgivings, I must agree with Hobbes here: selfishness is innate in us, it exists in all persons, and however, it is in our ability to overcome that potential evil line of action that we find goodness. \n \n What I'm trying to say is that we must educate the strength of the will, its strength in the battle against the lower tendencies (like selfishness), for we cannot battle against what we are: rational creatures with free will but also burdened with passions and desires that, although not inherently evil, can lead, if uneducated (without virtue), to evil.",
