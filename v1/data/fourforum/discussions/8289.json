   "\"Here is a small sample of the side of the debate we almost never hear:\n \n Appearing before the Commons Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development last year, Carleton University paleoclimatologist Professor Tim Patterson testified, \"There is no meaningful correlation between CO2 levels and Earth's temperature over this [geologic] time frame. In fact, when CO2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now, about 450 million years ago, the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years.\" Patterson asked the committee, \"On the basis of this evidence, how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in CO2 levels would be the major cause of the past century's modest warming?\"\n \n Patterson concluded his testimony by explaining what his research and \"hundreds of other studies\" reveal: on all time scales, there is very good correlation between Earth's temperature and natural celestial phenomena such changes in the brightness of the Sun. \n \n Karl\u00e9n clarifies that the 'mass balance' of Antarctica is positive - more snow is accumulating than melting off. As a result, Ball explains, there is an increase in the 'calving' of icebergs as the ice dome of Antarctica is growing and flowing to the oceans. When Greenland and Antarctica are assessed together, \"their mass balance is considered to possibly increase the sea level by 0.03 mm/year - not much of an effect,\" Karl\u00e9n concludes\n \n Carter does not pull his punches about Gore's activism, \"The man is an embarrassment to US science and its many fine practitioners, a lot of whom know (but feel unable to state publicly) that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science.\"\n \n http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm",

Form hypothesis, test in the lab, refine theory, lather, rinse, repeat. But there's a problem with doing that here. First off, we can't run a conclusive test. The only lab big enough is the entire world. To conclusively prove or debunk global warming you need to lower or raise greenhouse gas emmisions on a global scale in a controlled manner. Kinda tough to pull off for your average scientist. The second issue is a simply cost/risk analysis. If the evidence is correct but we ignore it, then we risk dooming millions and causing a global catastophe. If the evidence is wrong but we act anyway, then we put a light strain on the economy.

With the lack of promising Democrats to run for president in 2008, it is not unlikely that Al Gore will make another run. I don't think the Democratic party will risk losing another election by nominating Hillary Clinton. Right now, she is just too risky. So I can't think of anybody better than Al Gore for the Democrats. So, with that in mind, what would be the best way to get America to vote for Gore in 2008? Simple. Create a Michael Moore-esque mockumentary about the horrible doom we all face because of global warming. Unfortunately, most of the general public are XXXXXX and will accept this movie at face value without actually doing any research. Once the general public is properly convinced that they face a horrible crisis and Al Gore is the hero who brought it all to light (through Hollywood, no less), they will turn to him for the solution. Naturally, he won't have a solution, but he will promise one until he gets elected. Mark my words: AL Gore will be the Democratic candidate in 2008.",

Why? Because what Gore's \"majority of scientists\" think is immaterial when only a very small fraction of them actually work in the climate field. \n \n Even among that fraction, many focus their studies on the impacts of climate change; biologists, for example, who study everything from insects to polar bears to poison ivy. \"While many are highly skilled researchers, they generally do not have special knowledge about the causes of global climate change,\" explains former University of Winnipeg climatology professor Dr. Tim Ball. \"They usually can tell us only about the effects of changes in the local environment where they conduct their studies.\"",
