World War II, on the other hand, is considered a \"good\" war, and I agree that it did much more good than harm, but there were moral complications - from the moral question of whether it was right to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the resentment of local French villagers around Normandy for the bombing of their towns that happened as part of the D-day invasion. \n \n Wars are rarely purely \"good\" or \"bad\".

   "GRINGO\n \n The word originated in Mexico, when the United States of America invaded Mexico in order to appropiate half of its territory, back on mid 19th century. Of course this action against \"peace and freedom\" is not in elementary school textbooks in USA, but it is in any other serious document about USA history. \n \n American soldiers entered the country through the Gulf of Mexico, taking down the main port of Veracruz and then heading towards Mexico City. The troops were wearing GREEN COATS. \n \n Mexican people along the way from Veracruz to Mexico suffered the advance of the enemy and many battles were fought. However, the American army finally reached Mexico City and took the city down in an epic battle still remembered by all the Mexicans: The battle of Chapultepec Castle. This palace, in the top of a hill, is the highest point over Mexico City: there was the Mexican flag, so it was a symbolic target. \n \n The headquarters of the Military College were in Chapultepec castle too, and when the \"green coats\" were climbing the hill, a few young cadets refused to leave and decided to defend the castle to death. Then, when the battle was helplessly lost, one of the cadets took the Mexican flag, wrapped himself on it and jumped off the cliff were the castle is set, dying in the rocks below, thus avoiding the American army to take the flag. When the American commander saw the corpses of the cadets, he said in amazement \"They are only children!\". So they became in death Los Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes, the symbol in Mexico of the resistance against invaders: the American army... the green coats. \n \n The war was over and USA claimed half of Mexico's territory... then the green coats went home, having gained possesion of Texas and other territories -and their resources- (the same old motif than nowadys, but the speech has changed). \n \n Ever since, the relationtship USA-Mexico has developed into a very complex love-hate relationtship and the destiny of both nations is linked together, but back then, a new term was born in popular language: gringo (green coat) \n \n Now, let's make clear that the term is used nowadays the same as affectionate as pejorative and as none of the above too. As complex as it seems, Mexican people can use the word with different intentions but in any case with just one meaning: it refers in a common way to USA citizens, who are distinctive not because of the colour of their skin, but because of their culture and behavior (anyone outside USA knows exactly what behavior is it!) \n \n Other derivatives of the word include: \n \n gringa: female for gringo, as substantive. \n \n gringo/gringa: as adjectives. \n \n agringado: something/someone that resembles USA culture or the American way of life. \n \n Gringolandia: U.S.A. \n \n As a final note i must say that the word spread to other countries over Latin America (even to Spain) where it is used to refer to foreigners and/or white people: but that's just the way some people outside Mexico understand the word! \n \n Nevertheless, in Mexico, a \"gringo\" is just an American citizen. And it implies nothing else.\n \n http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gringo\n \n _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

   "Walter Cronkite has died. Given his recent mention on this thread, I thought I'd mention it. Here is an excerpt from an article about him, including the impact of his both personal and professional journey to Vietnam, the journey he brought so many others along on, including myself, as a child:\n \n -----------------\n \n President Obama praised Mr. Cronkite as the \"voice of certainty in an uncertain world.\"\n \n Mr. Cronkite came to define the term \"news anchor\" during 31 years at CBS News. In Sweden, TV anchors are called Kronkiters; in the Netherlands, Cronkiters.\n \n For two generations of Americans, Mr. Cronkite was a witness to history who also helped shape perceptions of it. Although he rarely displayed emotion on camera, those moments are seared into the nation's collective consciousness - Mr. Cronkite tearing up while announcing the assassination of John F. Kennedy, decrying the \"thugs\" at the 1968 Democratic presidential convention or exclaiming \"Go, baby, go!\" as Apollo 11 lifted off for the moon 40 years ago this week.\n \n \"Uncle Walter\"\n \n Raised in Missouri and Texas, Mr. Cronkite had a comforting Midwestern accent and an everyman likability. He came off as everyone's \"Uncle Walter,\" an image he fostered by leaning back in his chair and fiddling with a pipe at the end of nightly broadcasts. When he signed off with \"And that's the way it is,\" Americans believed him.\n \n President Lyndon B. Johnson was watching CBS in 1968 when Mr. Cronkite followed a report critical of the Vietnam War with rare commentary - the anchor declared the war unwinnable and said the United States should pull out.\n \n \"He's remembered for the one moment when he stepped out of character and decided, to his great credit, to go see (Vietnam) for himself,\" said Todd Gitlin, a Columbia University journalism professor and sociologist.\n \n Johnson reportedly turned to an aide and said, \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.\" It's speculated that this was a major reason Johnson decided not to run for a second full term.\n \n Walter Cronkite, longtime CBS anchorman, dies at 92 - Los Angeles Times\n \n -----------\n \n As I sat there in front of the black and white television -- all channels for free with limited commercial interruption -- listening to Walter Cronkite, night after night, my world morphing with his chaptered decisions to increasingly bring us the Vietnam War, around dinnertime, and then, bring himself, the pronouncer, there, too, I would wonder, even in suspense, at times, as the 1/2 hour (though significantly greater 1 hour with that) came to a close: \n \n How will he be able to say it tonight? How will he be able to say: \"And that's the way it is\"?\n \n The concept he was presenting intrigued me. The very structure of the statement. Is that the way it is? What does that mean? How does he know? Can he now keep saying this to us? After what he's just shown us? For \"that's the way it is,\" already a questionable notion, also started out as a somewhat lovelier thing this certain and reassuring newsman impressed upon my young mind during a very serious adult matter, the ritual, known as, \"The Seven O'Clock Evening News.\" \n \n Mysteries Shall Be Revealed.\n \n Somehow Walter would pull it off every time; he would surprise, and yet meet my expectation, as the nation's news began to make more sense by the year, even with the broadcasts getting uglier and more graphically horrifying, by the day. As it was, clearly, horrifying too, for the adults, stepping together quietly, before their televisions, also turning into color, across the country. \n \n Wasn't it?\n \n \"And that's the way it is,\" his tone ever-so-so-slightly changing one evening, his expression ever-ever-ever subtle yet much more serious, another way, the next. \n \n Night after night, Walter, there. Showing us the news. But now, increasingly wrestling with Vietnam. While relentlessly asserting what he had always insisted upon.\n \n And that's the way it is.\n \n It Sounded Different.\n \n One day I concluded. Studying the many minutiae, the nuances of Walter's expression during this simple, nightly, yet often highly anticipated, closing statement. It was, indeed, possible, the experiment likely reached its finale with Walter's measured moments about the war:\n \n The war being wrong.\n \n So, thank you for sharing your journalism, Walter Cronkite, but most importantly, for sharing your conscience, during that period, as an American.\n \n Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- \n I took the one less traveled by, \n And that has made all the difference\n \n Without that conscience (I only felt certain, watching, you had deep down inside), our children have absolutely, nothing.\n \n It was just a matter of time.  \n \n As usual, you somehow pulled it off.",

   "Obama didn't even serve in the National Guard, did he? Did he even have the family jewels to be a crossing guard? LOL!\n\n \n Obama was too young to have been drafted for the Vietnam War. Gee! the US is a country always at war with the world. Something wrong with you guys? \n \n Anyway let's examine Dubya's record (apart from starring in the Oscar nominated movie \"We were not soldiers\") \n \n Read below:\n \n \n \nPresident George W. Bush evaded the draft by using his father's connections to unethically gain advantage over other people. Then he disobeyed orders and went absent without official leave (AWOL), but used his father's connections to escape criminal prosecution. His main opponents for the presidency volunteered to serve in Vietnam and had exemplary military records. Bush didn't have the courage to fight in the war fought by his generation, but doesn't hesitate to send American troops to serve multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, even when their commitments are over. Also, Bush's evasion of service has significant ramifications in his execution of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Americans should demand more in their president. \n \n After finishing college, Bush used his father's connections to evade service in the Vietnam War by jumping over a huge waiting list to get a pilot slot in the National Guard after numerous other applicants who were much more qualified and who had much higher aptitude test scores were rejected. Then Bush refused an order from a superior officer to take a physical exam, but used his father's connections to avoid criminal prosecution by court-martial for disobeying a lawful order. Bush obviously refused to take the physical exam because it tested for illegal drug abuse and he would have failed it due to heavy drug abuse for which he was never caught by the police as far as we know. Finally, after failing to take the physical, Bush went AWOL in the National Guard, but again used his father's connections to avoid criminal prosecution for being a deserter. \n \n As a former infantry officer, I know that in the military, we believe in leadership by example. What kind of example does Bush set for American troops as commander in chief? \n \n Compare Bush's disgraceful military record to the military record of his Democratic opponent for the presidency in 2004. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) could have used his privileged background to evade service in Vietnam like Bush or like Vice President Dick Cheney, who finagled five draft deferments, but Kerry volunteered to serve in the U.S. Navy and then requested duty in Vietnam as a swift boat officer, which was one of the most dangerous combat duties there. During his tour of duty in Vietnam, Kerry demonstrated exceptional valor while leading combat troops into battle. He won a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Then when Kerry came back home after two tours of duty, he fought to end the war as the most prominent spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Kerry served America with tremendous courage, honor, and distinction during two tours of duty, and to this day, he still has shrapnel left in a leg from his battle wounds. \n \n Bush was supportive of the Vietnam War, but used every dirty trick he could find to avoid serving in it. On the other hand, Kerry opposed the Vietnam War, but volunteered for two tours of duty, requested duty in Vietnam, and dodged enemy fire aboard a swift boat in the Mekong Delta. Then Bush had the gall to criticize Kerry's commitment to national defense. Moreover, Bush stood by while his surrogates distorted and skewered Kerry's honorable and courageous service in Vietnam. \n \n One of the key differences between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats overwhelmingly won't try to unjustly tarnish the military record of a Republican war hero as draft evading Republicans shamelessly do to Democratic war heroes. Whereas numerous Republicans invested enormous resources into impugning the heroic military service of Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign, extremely few Democrats tried to do the same to Senator John McCain (R-AZ) in the 2008 presidential campaign. \n \n Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), a World War II veteran, defines a chickenhawk as \"having the shriek of a hawk but the backbone of a chicken.\" Lautenberg spoke on the Senate floor about chickenhawks criticizing Kerry's commitment to national defense: \"They talk tough on national defense and military issues and cast aspersions on others, but when it was their turn to serve, they were AWOL from courage. Shame on those who impugn the patriotism of those who supported their country's call to duty and paid for it with injuries resulting from their obedience to that call. In my view, that's the cry of the chickenhawk, who has no idea what it means to have the courage to put your life at risk to defend this nation. How dare they challenge his commitment to our defense?\" \n \n Compare Bush's shameful military record to the military record of his Democratic opponent for the presidency in 2000. Although he opposed the war, Vice President Al Gore volunteered to serve in Vietnam because he didn't want somebody else to be required to serve in his place. Gore volunteered for the U.S. Army and served for five months as a military journalist in Vietnam before receiving an honorable discharge. \n \n Compare Bush's ignominious military record to the military record of his main Republican opponent for the presidency in 2000. After graduating from the Naval Academy, McCain requested combat duty in Vietnam and served as a naval aviator. He nearly lost his life when his plane was accidentally struck by a rocket from another plane on the same aircraft carrier, which caused a series of explosions and a conflagration resulting in 134 sailors dying and 161 more sailors being injured. Two days after the accident, McCain turned down an offer to go home and volunteered for combat duty from another aircraft carrier. While flying his 23rd mission over North Vietnam, his plane was shot down by a missile over Hanoi. McCain was badly wounded and taken to the infamous Hanoi Hilton where he spent five-and-a-half years including two years in solitary confinement. McCain received marginal medical care for his wounds and was often severely tortured. McCain was offered early release by his captors less than a year into his imprisonment, but turned down the offer unless everyone captured before him was also released. The courage, honor, and integrity that McCain demonstrated as a pilot and a prisoner of war were incredible. \n \n While Kerry, Gore, and McCain volunteered to serve in Vietnam, Bush spent the war, by all accounts, boozing it up and getting stoned too. Many brave men from Bush's hometown of Midland, Texas, such as Private First Class Paulino Lopez, Staff Sergeant Kendell Cutbirth, and Captain Robert Zonne, served instead of Bush and died in Vietnam. Bush stayed home, supportive of the Vietnam War, but too afraid to fight for his country. Instead he decided to spend the war in a drug and alcohol induced haze. \n \n Although too young to have served in the Vietnam War, President-elect Barack Obama (D-IL) can similarly be faulted for never having served in the military, but being a strong proponent of the war in Afghanistan and increasing American troops there. Because he never served in the military, Obama can't understand how it works well enough to be an effective commander in chief, particularly while the military is fighting two wars. \n \n \"Our problem with this current war in Iraq is that we're being governed by the chickenhawks,\" said former Governor Jesse Ventura (I-MN), a Vietnam veteran. \"You know what a chickenhawk is? That's somebody when it was their time to serve, they were chicken. But now they come back when they're 50 years old and they're hawks. I laugh when President Bush says--he come out a few months ago and said the problem with Vietnam was we left too soon. Well, why didn't he come over and help out?\" \n \n The hypocrisy is without bounds. Bush unethically used his father's connections to get a prized slot in the National Guard and evade service in Vietnam. Then he went AWOL and failed to even complete his military commitment in the National Guard. Now Bush is ordering the same National Guard to combat duty in Iraq and forcing military personnel to serve even after they've completed their commitments. \n With reckless abandon, Bush taunted the Iraqi insurgents by saying, \"Bring it on!\" It's very easy for him to say this when he has never had to face hostile fire and when he unethically evaded service in the war fought by his generation. \n \n Bush says that Democrats favoring a timetable for withdrawal of American troops believe in \"cut and run,\" as if he is the courageous one for staying the course, but he isn't among the troops facing the prospect of death every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bush cut and run when his country needed him in Vietnam. \n\n \n OpEdNews >> George W. Bush, Chickenhawk in Chief",

   "I don't know that Cronkite was any great trailblazer on the personal level. After all, he bought the status quo view on Vietnam, hook, line and sinker, and didn't unequivocally come out against the war -- at least, as I recall -- even when he publicized it, in a way that helped turn the tide. His statements, as far I'm aware, were along the lines of this kind of one-dimensional thinking as to whether or not we \"could win\"; the moral questions, seemingly absent, but for the fact that his broadcasting this material indirectly reflected a position he had to be taking on the issues. And that he could no longer turn his head, either.\n \n I think he did help change public views, in a significant way, though, through his broadcasts. Remembering the atmosphere in the American public before it was popular to be against the Vietnam War, and then, as the tide shifted and Americans became increasingly angry about what was happening. Don't forget, too, this was a period when American television did not show violence. Then, all of a sudden, there was this awful violence, and it was real. Right in people's faces.\n \n So I think he deserves credit, though he was certainly not, among others, a Daniel Berrigan or Mohammed Ali, going off to prison on principle. Or Martin Luther King, Jr., who I remember as coming out against the Vietnam War as wrong, and unlike Cronkite, at much greater risk to how he might be perceived, by doing so. He was risking the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, when he made his statements.",

   "Btw, new information out on Agent Orange, \n \n -------------\n \n Agent Orange Causes Blindness\n by Dave Lindorff\n \n Agent Orange, the herbicide used as a weapon by US military forces in Vietnam for nearly a decade to defoliate vast stretches of inhabited forest and jungle in an effort to deprive the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces of both cover and a supportive populace, has long been known to have caused a large number of serious and debilitating diseases, many of them passed on to children of those exposed. But now it also appears to cause a peculiar blindness among American journalists.\n \n This is demonstrably the case at the New York Times, where a report in Saturday's edition on new Agent Orange links being found to Parkinson's Disease and ischemic heart disease noted that it could lead to many more Vietnam War Era veterans being eligible for disability benefits and treatment, but completely failed to mention the significance of the discovery for the millions of Vietnamese who were also exposed to the chemical-and for their descendants.\n \n The new link was announced in a report by a 14-member committee of the Institute of Medicine, which had been asked to determine what conditions might be traced to exposure to the chemical that had been \"used to clear stretches of the jungle\" in Vietnam. As the article noted, since 1994, the Institute of Medicine has to date found 17 medical conditions that can be traced to exposure to Agent Orange, \"13 of which qualify veterans for service-connected disability benefits.\"\n \n There's a lot wrong with this article, as written by Times, reporter Janie Lorber (though admittedly we can't know what is her responsibility and what is the handiwork of the newspaper's editors).\n \n For starters, the benign-sounding description of how Agent Orange was used-\"to clear stretches of the jungle\"-makes it sound like the kind of thing President George W. Bush used to do when he was down at his \"ranch\" in Crawford, TX \"clearing brush,\" or like grounds-keeping work at the local golf course. In fact, what the US military was doing was defoliating vast tracts of inhabited forest in South Vietnam, in an effort both to make it hard for enemy troops to hide, and to drive peasants into strategic hamlets where they could be controlled, and prevented from providing assistance to Vietnamese fighters. There was no effort made to keep the defoliant away from people-civilians or enemy fighters-indeed, people were, at least indirectly, the targets. It would, indeed, have made no sense to defoliate areas where there were no people.\n \n It is certainly true that the Defense Department showed absolutely no concern about sending American troops out into the sprayed areas, where hundreds of thousands or soldiers and marines were exposed to the residue of the spraying, and it is true that the Defense Department and the US government spent millions of dollars after the war battling efforts by desperately ill veterans in a futile effort to deny legal responsibility for their ailments, and to deny any link between those ailments and Agent Orange. (A friend, the late Dorothy Thompson, was one of the lead attorneys in the successful fight to win compensation from the government for veterans who suffered from Agent Orange-related disease.)\n \n But how can any honest journalist or news organization write about this sordid chapter in America's criminal use of chemical weapons without even mentioning its impact on the enemy, or on huge numbers of wholly innocent civilians?\n \n To this day, the US has refused to accept any responsibility for the victims in Vietnam of its chemical warfare in that country, despite the fact that millions have suffered and continue to suffer from the results, including innocent children born long after the war was over, and of course many older people who have long since died of their diseases.\n \n It is no surprise, of course, that the US government would decline to accept responsibility for its actions, or even to discuss the issue. The Vietnam War was the first war in which the US clearly was defeated, and there is no desire to even think about it, much less about the evils which were done by America in the fighting of it. And as a federal agency, it's perhaps understandable, though still inexcusable, that the Institute of Medicine panel examining Agent Orange's impacts would fail to note its impact on the people of Vietnam, and focus instead only on veterans.\n \n But the media, and particularly the New York Times, have no excuse whatsoever -even if the Institute of Medicine report is incomplete--for failing to mention the obvious point that, as bad as Agent Orange was for the troops who dispensed it, and who had to fight in areas where it had been used, it was far, far worse for the people upon whom it was actually dispensed.\n \n Unless, of course, the problem is that the Times and its reporters and editors are also victims of the chemical, and it is also causing journalistic blind spots.\n \n Agent Orange Causes Blindness | CommonDreams.org\n \n ---------------------",
