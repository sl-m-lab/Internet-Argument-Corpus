   "Should the UK have seperation of Church and State and become a secular nation?\n Only 10% of the population still attend church, the baptism of infants is put at the same 10% level.\n The Heir proposes to alter his title from \"Defender of The Faith\" to \"Defender of Faith\". \n Anglicanism itself is divided between traditional elements and more radical groups. There is the question of Bishops sitting in the House of Lords.\n \n At least one Anglican vicar has put forward the argument that \"The established church acts as a defence against fundamentalism and ensures that Britain is not too religious\". That certainly carries some weight with the Agnostic/Athiest/Other religous people in the country, but is it enough to safeguard Anglicanism's future?\n Others have argued that it's part of our heritage/tradition. Against which it is easy to level an argument of \"Keeping up with the times\" Is the country going to be turned into some sort of 'living history' museum?\n Then of course there's the argument of \"Ain't broke - don't fix it.\" Why has this come up? Does the government have nothing better to do than meddle in religion, or are they trying to distract attention from something else?",

   "I'm in two minds about it. I think many people who don't consider themselves believers or attend church still benefit from the work the church does at key times in their lives, and the establishment of the Church of England cuts both ways, the Church gets official sanction but it also takes on a responsibility for the care of all citizens of the country (the cure of souls as it is called). A lot of people have gained comfort from a CofE vicar visiting them when they are bereived and conducting a funeral for a loved one. I think this automatic accessiblity to the whole population would suffer from disestablishment, but I'd be interested to hear other views.\n \n I do also think that both the church and society in general has benefited from the tendency towards ecumenism and compromise that establishment has engendered in the church. Schism becomes less appealing when the schismatics will very clearly become the breakaway sect - there can be no break down the middle in an established church, establishment sticks with one side only. It is hard to claim to be the group continuing the apostolic succession when the ancient see of canterbury is carrying on ordaining its bishops and priests without you. Society has benefited from the dampening of US style protestant extremism.",

   "Indeed; from an agnostic point of view in an ideal world we could have a secular state and not worry about religious extremes taking over, but in the real world the US was set up as a secular state and has become subject to virtually every conceivable variation of christianity going.\n I can't see Elizabeth going in for a evangelical service and the thought of Charles being crowned in an evangelical style is blatently ridiculous.\n \n I've been to 2 funerals in the past decade, one with a church service, one without. The one without was family only, I don't remember talking to the vicar at the church service one though I did meet a number of my deceased relative's friends. That has stuck with me more than the non-church funeral.\n \n Mainly though I'm just suspicious as to why the government would waste time on the matter.",
