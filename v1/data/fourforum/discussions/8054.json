My parents are 5 years apart. Now granted the difference between 45 and 50 is a bit more than from 12 and 15. But in 30 years they'll be 42 and 45.\n \n About sex, what do you have a problem with? If the both consent, use protection, love each other, what's the problem?\n \n To drinking and drugs. I know for a fact that a few kids on my baseball team at least used to drink and/or do drugs. But our baseball coach apparently helped write a new code for that stuff making extreme punishments (out for a year for first offense, next offense your whole HS career). At the beginning of the year he gave a huge lecture saying he wrote the thing so he didn't want to be embarrassed by having a baseball kid get in trouble for that. He said if he even heard a rumor of a kid drinking or doing drugs (not just a random accusation, but reasonable suspicion) they'd be off the team. I think everyone has stopped, but obviously I can't be sure, and I'm sure some will continue after baseball season.\n \n Honestly I don't know how big the alcohol/drugs problem is in high schools (and middle schools? 12 years old alcohol and drugs?). I just know I really don't care if other people do it. I won't do it so that's all I need to worry about. Also note that Myspace was originally intended for music and it is still used sometimes for that purpose. btw I don't have a myspace account.\n \n Also just curious, how old are you? Are you also a teenager?",

I guess she has to wrap that act up now that she's preggers for the second time by her slutty husband.\n \n\n Unfortunately, you're right. Of course unfortunately adults sometimes act this way as well. Ever hear people talk about American Idle? I have only watched MTV once at a friends' house. There was some stupid show with people trying to imitate some rapper, from clothes to voice to attitude. It was total XXXX and I really hope that that was one of the worse shows (but from what I've heard, it isn't).\n \n \n\n Additionally, our culture continuously emphasizes the myth that women have to be whorishly sexy in ads, media, movies, TV, almost every where.

Because I know there is a large degree of truth to it. the saddest thing is seeing twenty and even thirty something people act like this, like when I walk down the street and see a big black guy (not being racist here, just descriptive) is walking with his daughter. The daughter starts crying and he slaps her and says \"quit f***ing crying, shut up\". You see adults obsessed with shows like American Idle, not even liking most of the music, but enjoying seeing other people have their dreams crushed. So yes teenage society is pretty messed up, but unfortunately so is the rest of the country. People care about all the gossip and such yet don't care enough about the government to vote.

That's pretty damn sad.\n \n \n\n they don't teach their children how to drive safely (as evidenced by the multitudes who die from auto accidents, \n \n\n Many people don't even take it seriously. The other day there was a minivan that pulled into the parking lot at easily 30 MPH without slowing down, whipped around a sharp corner and slammed on the brakes as the van slid into the parking spot. We saw a kid behind the wheel and the mother in the passenger's seat. They got out of the car, and rather than telling the kid that's no way to park, they were all laughing, that's right laughing. The mom, the kid, and the 2 younger siblings in the back. Pretty rediculous, they are risking their own safety as well as those around them and all they can do is laugh?\n \n \n\n but...most of all, parents don't teach their children how to do without (as evidenced by the whining of multitudes of the little bastards).\n \n\n please explain.

   "When you look at teenage society today as compared to 50 years ago, I see pretty much the same level of acting out and rebelling against adults. Yes, teens today are a lot more open about their sexuality, but why is that a bad thing? If we teach safe sex in schools, as well as alternatives to genital-to-genital contact, then it's really not that big a deal. Of course the fundies will make a big hullabaloo over it, but then when do they ever not fuss over things like this? \n \n That said, the 12 and 15 year old thing, thats a little strange, thats a middle schooler dating a high schooler. I'd keep an eye on that.\nHah! I was a teenager 50 years ago and I was such a sweet, pure, innocent thing, utterly loveable and polite to my elders.\n \n As opposed to the icky teenagers of today.\n \n And, I was also a virgin.

People disclose too much information as they feel safe on a site where you have no commitment in a relationship yet the dangers on a site like this really outweigh any benefit.
