   "Leonard Cohen, doesn't make me sad, \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" maybe .... yeah, it does a bit. \n In general I don't like all of his songs, only a few, but the ones I like such as \"Everybody Knows\" are kind of end of days songs, they have this Biblical undertone of a prophet preaching the end of the world.\n \n He lived in a Zen monastery in the 70's for several years, but can't say it had any effect on his songs.\n \n \"Country Death Song\" is a true 'country' song. A \"Deliverance\" kinda country, that is. It is a more than a song, it is rather a relentless march to murder and suicide. The animation was great. Nothing fancy, very little movement, mostly black and white. But it presented well the song visually in all its darkness and madness.

   "I don't mind a dull country, such as Switzerland but, a dull country such as Canada, no way Jose. Why not Canada? let me explain why:\n \n I have in front of me one of those Canadian government ads that appeared in The New Yorker in time for the G8 meeting. (Even the Queen made an appearance dressed in Canadian red).\n This ad below I will save for it is a beauty:\n \n \"A good neighbour lends you a cup of sugar.\n A great neighbour supplies you with 1.4 million barrels of oil per day\"And this is the best lying part:\n \"And does it responsibly&#8213;with respect for the environment and a commitment to leadership in energy production through innovation ... blah blah...\"\n \n What a bunch of unctuous, servile, subservient, sycophants Canadians are.\n \n Jesus H Christ!! the Canadians see an American butt and drop to their knees immediately. They are ideal neighbours, indeed,\n And when it comes to respect for the environment? Read this:\n \n The process of extracting oil from the vast Canadian sands is a messy one, and with enormous profits at stake, what chance does the environment have?\n TO MOST environmentalists, the oil sands of Alberta are \"Canada's dirty secret\". Described by Tar Sands 101 as \"the largest industrial project in human history\", the extraction of oil from bitumen (tar, in plain language) buried in the ground is blamed by them for causing air pollution, widespread deforestation and prodigious carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as well as alcoholism, drug abuse and prostitution.\n The scale of what's going on around Fort McMurray in northeast Alberta is staggering. Vast areas of once heavily-wooded land have been taken over by the oil companies and either strip-mined by gigantic machinery - so large that it would crush an SUV without its operator even noticing - or deep-mined in situ with the use of steam to draw the bitumen from several hundred metres below ground.\n The Green Party's chairman, Senator Dan Boyle, recently called on our National Pensions Reserve Fund to support motions tabled by faith-based shareholder groups in Shell and BP on the issue. He said the extraction of oil from tar sands was \"a particularly harmful, inefficient and greenhouse-gas-intensive method of producing fuel\" and was \"devastating for the local environment and indigenous communities\".\n Neither Shell nor the other oil companies involved are making any apologies - because what they're doing is so profitable. \"Over the period 2005-2009 average earnings for oil sands mining were around US$20 (\u008015) per barrel, compared to . . . averages of around US$12 (\u00809) per barrel,\" Shell said, adding that the oil sands contributed no less than US$31 billion (\u008023.3billion) to its earnings over the same five-year period.\n \n Black gold in Alberta sands - The Irish Times - Sat, Apr 10, 2010",
