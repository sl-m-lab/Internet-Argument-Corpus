From his bio, I can't understand why anyone would consider him 'an expert in judging these situations', much less spend time watching him on TV unless they have hero worship for ex-military types.\n\n \n Never heard of him? Let me help you. But based on your posts I am not surprised.\n \n http://www.homeofheroes.com/photos/7_rvn/jacobs.html\n \n Presented by the President in the Name of the Congress, it is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon any American.  The men who wear it call themselves \"recipients\" (not winners), for what they received it for was not a contest...it was a time of terror and death where their valor was tested, then recognized by a grateful Nation. All of them feel that they didn't win The Medal...they RECEIVED it. Frequently called \"The Congressional Medal of Honor\", its true title is simply:\n \n MEDAL OF HONOR\n ============================\n Jack Jacobs\n \n Born: August 2, 1945\n Brooklyn, New York\n \n War: Vietnam\n \n Rank: Captain, U.S. Army, U.S. Army Element, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Republic of Vietnam\n \n Location of action: Kien Phong Province\n \n Date of action: March 9, 1968\n \n Medal Received from: President Richard Nixon, October 9, 1969\n \n Official Citation:\n For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Capt. Jacobs (then 1st Lt.), Infantry, distinguished himself while serving as assistant battalion adviser, 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The 2nd Battalion was advancing to contact when it came under intense heavy machine gun and mortar fire from a Viet Cong battalion positioned in well-fortified bunkers. As the 2nd Battalion deployed into attack formation its advance was halted by devastating fire. Capt. Jacobs, with the command element of the lead company, called for and directed air strikes on the enemy positions to facilitate a renewed attack. Due to the intensity of the enemy fire and heavy casualties to the command group, including the company commander, the attack stopped and the friendly troops became disorganized.\n \n Although wounded by mortar fragments, Capt. Jacobs assumed command of the allied company, ordered a withdrawal from the exposed position and established a defensive perimeter. Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Capt. Jacobs, with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded adviser to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. Capt. Jacobs made repeated trips across the fire-swept open rice paddies evacuating wounded and their weapons. On three separate occasions, Capt. Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing three and wounding several others.\n \n His gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of one U.S. adviser and 13 allied soldiers. Through his effort the allied company was restored to an effective fighting unit and prevented defeat of the friendly forces by a strong and determined enemy. Capt. Jacobs, by his gallantry and bravery in action in the highest traditions of the military service, has reflected great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\n \n Bio:\n Colonel Jack Jacobs, who entered military service through Rutgers ROTC, earned the Medal of Honor for exceptional heroism on the battlefields of Vietnam. He also holds three Bronze Stars and two Silver Stars.\n \n Jacobs was an adviser to a Vietnamese infantry battalion when it came under a devastating fire that disabled the commander. Although bleeding from severe head wounds, then-First Lieutenant Jacobs took command, withdrew the unit to safety, and returned again and again under intense fire to rescue the wounded and perform life-saving first aid. He saved the lives of a U.S. adviser and 13 allied soldiers.\n \n Jacobs served on the faculty of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the National War College in Washington, D.C. After retirement, he founded and was chief operating officer of Auto Finance Group. As a managing director of Bankers Trust Co., he led Global Investment Management to $2.2 billion in assets and later co-founded a similar business for Lehman Brothers. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and is a director of the Medal of Honor Foundation. He is also a military analyst for NBC/MSNBC.\n \n http://www.pbs.org/weta/americanvalor/stories/jacobs.html",
