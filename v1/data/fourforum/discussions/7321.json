   "Everyone knows Iran wants nuclear weapons. There is no more hiding it anymore. Today, people met in Berlin to discuss the matter. Now, I wil skip this part. Now, there is talk going that if the European Union votes Iran to the security council, Russia and China will veto it. Well, a reporter asked Donald Rumsfeld if the United States would take military action if Iran failed to comply by destroying it's nuclear facilities.\n Donald Rumsfeld declined to say. But, lets say we did. China and Russia and Iran are allies. You could say they are the axis of evil. Now, would China and Russia get involved if we attacked Iran? \n Iran and many anti-bush people ask, why can't they have their own nuclear warheads. Well, let me answer that. Cause their government is run by thugs, Iranian students, and chaos. Besides, they don't need weapons, and they are just trying to get attention. But, if I had to answer that to the common people, I would say, \"Because their government is run by thugs, they make threats of wiping jews of the map, and make other threatening statements. Besides, this does endanger our national security, along with Israels.\"\n Iran and America have not been allies since 1979. We hate each other. Now, a nuclear Iran is not a good Iran. Especially being as most of their country is either run by terrorists, or just supports them. Maybe both. I think the Iranian government are terrorists themselves because they support it. \n But, if it came to war, I would give it a thumbs up. Mainly because they are making threats, and are lieing to the world about weapons. Plus, you got Russia and China supplying them defense technology. I think if we took Iran, there would be more casualties than Iraq, but, we would kick their flat butts in three years and be out of there in four. \n Now, back to my question. If we took Iran, would Russia and China step in? I think so. Russia might, I am not sure about China. But, do you guys feel that this is similar to the cold war? I feel like it.\n Diffrences are:\n 1. We are not trying to get more weapons or better war machines than them. We already are better than them.\n 2. They have no weapons yet, and so, warheads are not targeted at each other yet.\n But this is the same thing almost.\n I think we should attack Iran. Mainly cause they are threatening Israel. Now, we would launch back, but, Israel would probably be gone. Now, it also endangers our security, cause the Iranians probably have the courage to launch against us. Hell, the taliban knew they would lose the war, but they still attacked us.\n What do you think? Let me know.\n -John Milosevic",

   "I think you are prone to believing every bit of propoganda anybody tosses out, and it makes you look foolish.\n \n \nEveryone knows Iran wants nuclear weapons. There is no more hiding it anymore. Today, people met in Berlin to discuss the matter. Now, I wil skip this part. Now, there is talk going that if the European Union votes Iran to the security council, Russia and China will veto it. \n\n \n Lets look at the FACTS of the case instead of what \"everybody knows\".\n \n FACT 1- We do not have one, single shred of evidence that Iran is working on any kind of weapons program\n \n FACT 2- We KNOW that they do not have the centrifuges needed, or the parts to build the centrifuges needed, to produce weapons grade Uranium\n \n FACT 3- We have absolutly no evidence that they have sought to obtain, build, or purchase, the parts needed to consrtruct the centrifuges they would need to refine weapons grade Uranium.\n \n FACT 4- IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei repeatedly has said his agency's nearly three-year investigation of Iran's nuclear activities has turned up no conclusive evidence of nuclear weapons activities. (http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/01/11/news/world/a5d9da82fc812fda872570f2006da97f.txt)\n \n FACT 5- Iran has a clear and unquesitonable right under the NPT to produce nuclear fuel ON THEIR OWN SOIL as long as their intent is peaceful.\n \n FACT 6- The people of the world are so freaking STUPID that they have apparently forgotten about the WMD's that Iraq was supposed to have. The WMDs that OUR OWN INSPECTORS told us for 10 years that Iraq did not posess. The WMDs that led us to impose strict sanctions on Iraq which resulted in the deaths of literally millions of Iraqis. The very same imaginary WMDs that we wwent to war over and killed tens if not hundreds of thousands fo Iraqis for. The WMDs that EVERYBODY KNEW they had, because somebody TOLD them, and they did not bother to look at the FACTS.\n \n \nIran and many anti-bush people ask, why can't they have their own nuclear warheads. Well, let me answer that. Cause their government is run by thugs, Iranian students, and chaos. Besides, they don't need weapons, and they are just trying to get attention.

Especially being as most of their country is either run by terrorists, or just supports them. Maybe both. I think the Iranian government are terrorists themselves because they support it. \n\n \n Nobody is asking that. Not even Iran. If any country DOES need nukes, though, it would be Iran. Israel, with its strong history of runnign illegal cross border strikes, is close, and carries a nuclear arsenal. \n \n \nBut, if it came to war, I would give it a thumbs up. Mainly because they are making threats, and are lieing to the world about weapons. Plus, you got Russia and China supplying them defense technology. I think if we took Iran, there would be more casualties than Iraq, but, we would kick their flat butts in three years and be out of there in four. \n\n \n This is just stupid. We are not going to be out of Iraq in 3 or 4 years, and Iraq is NOTHING compared to Iran. Iran can have 200 ballistic missiles in the air in less than 20 minutes. Even if HALF of them fail to make it to their target, that is still more than enough to wipe out EVERY US base in IRaq and EVERY military base in israel, with enough left over to take out EVERY US base in Kuwait. \n \n Since that would wipe out the majority of our combat troops, who is going to administer the Iranian butt kicking? While we certainly have the ability to lay waste to Iran, the cost would be so high that we would not be able to pursue the war anyway.\n \n Additionally, Iran has the ability to #### down the persian gulf for shipping. They do not even have maintain constant guard on the strait, sinking 2 oil tankers would take care of it, and Iran has the means and ability to sink oil tankers all day long. \n \n Nearly every drop of oil that does nto go through the persian gulf on tanker ships is passed through the IRANIAN PIPELINE. By shutting down oil shipment ins the gulf, and shutting down their own pipeline, Iran can take 35% of the world oil supply off the market overnight. Can you say $200 per barrel oil?? \n \n \n Overall, your plan is complete garbage. You show a complete ignorance of the facts, and your take on the entire situation is just rediculous.",

   "Everyone knows Iran wants nuclear weapons. There is no more hiding it anymore.\n\n Every government in the world would like nuclear weapons as it's the only thing that gives you real weight in international relations.\n \n \nChina and Russia and Iran are allies.\n\n No they aren't. China and Russia have never been allied, in fact there have been endless border disputes between them. As for the two countries' relationship with Iran, it's the same as our relationships with ME countries, they have lots of oil so we try to control them while keeping ther government sweet to ensure a steady supply of oil.\n \nYou could say they are the axis of evil.\n\n You can call anything and anyone 'evil', it doesn't mean anything.\n \nNow, would China and Russia get involved if we attacked Iran?\n\n I doubt it as they could just sit back and watch the US bankrupt itself twice as fast as it's doing in Iraq. \n \n \nIran and many anti-bush people ask, why can't they have their own nuclear warheads. Well, let me answer that. Cause their government is run by thugs, Iranian students, and chaos. Besides, they don't need weapons, and they are just trying to get attention. But, if I had to answer that to the common people, I would say, \"Because their government is run by thugs, they make threats of wiping jews of the map, and make other threatening statements. Besides, this does endanger our national security, along with Israels.\"\n\n I am lost for words. What has being anti-Bush got to do with it? Who are these 'thugs'? Which part of the Iranian government is run by 'chaos'? Why don't they need weapons when the US is being so threatening? What on earth do you mean about 'trying to get attention'? You do know that Isreal already has nukes and a history of pre-emptive strikes? \n It in no way endangers the US' national security! I don't understand how you can imagine a scenario in which it would. What, do you think that as soon as they develop a nuke they're going to send missiles over to the West? How exactly would they do that with no ICBMs and WHY would they do it when it is obvious that if they launched even one, Iran would be wiped off the map.\n The main threat to Israeli national security is the Israeli government's Palestine policy.\n \nIran and America have not been allies since 1979. We hate each other.\n\n Maybe Iranians hate the US because in 1953 the CIA organised a coup to overthrow the popular Iranian leader Mossadeq who had nationalised the country's oil supplies, previously owned by the West, instigated 25 years of oppression under their hand-picked dictator, the Shah, and then after he was overthrown in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, funded Iraq to wage war with Iran for eight years. Conversely, the American people have not one reason to hate Iran.\n \n \nBut, if it came to war, I would give it a thumbs up. Mainly because they are making threats, and are lieing to the world about weapons. Plus, you got Russia and China supplying them defense technology. I think if we took Iran, there would be more casualties than Iraq, but, we would kick their flat butts in three years and be out of there in four.\n\n Total ignorance, uniformed speculation based on propaganda and blinkered patriotism. \n \nNow, back to my question. If we took Iran, would Russia and China step in? I think so. Russia might, I am not sure about China. But, do you guys feel that this is similar to the cold war? I feel like it.\n\n You talk about this in such simple, relaxed terms. Would China and Russia 'step in'? Can you imagine the reality of such a conflict, even if it stayed conventional? \n \n \nI think we should attack Iran.\n\n Then you are a madman.\n \n Mainly cause they are threatening Israel.\n\n And Israel is blameless, is it? Totally innocent? Not a provocative Western military/economic outpost in the heart of the fiercly proud Muslim world?\n \nNow, we would launch back, but, Israel would probably be gone.\n\n As would any vestige of global stability as oil production dramatically falls and most remaining non-radical Muslims go absolutely mental.\n \nNow, it also endangers our security, cause the Iranians probably have the courage to launch against us.\n\n Total ignorance of facts and reality. They would never do this. The reason they want nukes is the same reason everybody does, because it's the closest thing to being on equal terms with the US and almost guarantees freedom from attack by the West.\n \nHell, the taliban knew they would lose the war, but they still attacked us.\n\n \n No they didn't! Do you just ignore facts which are repeated over and over to you because they don't fit your black and white, us and them view of the world? The 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and Yemen, not Afghanistan, and if they had links with anyone in Afghanistan it was OBL and Al Qaeda, not the Taliban, who couldn't have organised a booze up in a brewery let alone 9/11.",

If Iran isn't working towards getting nukes than they're fools.\n\n \n I know if I was the leader of a second tier nation, I would have my people working around the clocks to whip up a batch of nuclear weapons. \n \n The thing about Iran, though, is that they do not need uranium refining ability to produce nukes. They already have a contract with the Russians to provide them with reactor fuel for their reactor. Under the terms of that contract, the Iranians keep the spet fuel rods in Iran for 10 years then they MIGHT be returned to Russia. It is a LOT easier to extract plutonium from those spent rods to build a weapon than to enrich uranium to weapons grade.\n \n I simply don't see this as being about weapons production. There are too many holes in the story. The Iranians are running more than 1 heavy water reactor. they can crank out 15-20 KG of plutonium per year. The only reason they are being forced to enrich uranium at all is that we threw a fit about their heavy water reactors and essentailly forced them to build a litgh water reactor, which requires refined uranium.\n \n On the Iranian side, I think this is a matter of national pride and established pecking order. They are tired of having what they can and can not do dictated to them, especilly when they have specific treaty rights that are being ignored. We shut down their chemical industry, citing fears of chemical weapons. We shut down the pharmaceutical industry citing the same. \n \n To the west, I think this is a matter of maintaining their pecking order. Iran has a LOT of money to spend to build a viable infrastructure. The problem is that they lack natural resources, and their location makes shipping relatively expensive for raw materials. To make up for this, Iran MUST focus on high value, low bulk goods. That pretty much limites them to chemicals, drugs, or high density fuels (oil uranium). They have already announced that they plan to be a major player in the nuclear fuel field within 15 years because they estimate that there will be a severe world energy shortage. \n \n To me the focus on killing off their URanium enrichment looks a lot more like wiping out the competition than addressing verifiable security concerns. The IAEA has go anywhere authority in Iran. If they were using ther enrichment capabilities to produce weapons grade uranium we would know because we would see it on the REAL TIME VIDEO CAMERAS that the IAEA has all over Iranian nuclear facilities.\n \n Uranium enrichment is, IMO a red herring when it comes to Irans nuclear program. It simply does not make sense for the iranians to be working towards weapons grade uranium when they already have several pounds fo plutonium in storage and the capability to create more at a high rate.",
