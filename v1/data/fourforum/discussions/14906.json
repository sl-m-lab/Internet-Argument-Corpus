   "The same message in two separate threads started by you yourself Brady? You're reported for violating board rules.\n \n \nViolence Policy Center Details Use of High-Capacity Ammunition Magazines in 10 Prior Mass Shootings; VPC Calls on Congress to Ban High-Capacity Magazines, Save Lives\n\n \n You mean just like in 1994, with the law that left countless \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" perfectly legal to own, sell and trade?\n \n \nWASHINGTON, DC -- High-capacity ammunition magazines are the common thread that run through most mass shootings, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) stated today in profiling the guns and ammunition magazines used in 10 of America's most notorious mass shootings (http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/VPCshootinglist.pdf).\n\n \n Is this true? I could have sworn that dangerous individuals with murderous intentions were the common thread that run through most mass shootings. All the reports you cite have somebody with obvious behavioral problems that supposed raised red flags that would alert somebody. But nothing was done about them. These people were ignored. They never got any help or notice until after they started their killing. Why is that?\n \n Why didn't you help them Brady? Why didn't you and others take notice of the displayed warning signs before it was too late? Why didn't you care enough about them to do something?\n \n \n\"The Arizona attack joins a long list of mass shootings made possible by the easy availability of ammunition magazines that can hold up to 100 rounds: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Luby's, Wedgewood Baptist Church, Stockton, and all too many others,\" said VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand.\n\n \n Fist and foremost, none of the shootings you mentioned involved magazines that could hold up to 100 rounds of ammunition.\n \n Secondly, you cite Columbine as being one of the mass shootings that took place. The Columbine High School Massacre, carried out by students Eric Harris and Dylan Kleboid, was carried out in 1999, five years after the enactment of the ban on so-called \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity ammunition magazines\". And yet you cite Columbine as an example of mass shootings that involve these supposedly prohibited items. Isn't that a contradictory statement you're making? How would Columbine take place if supposedly these \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" were banned during this time?\n \n I think you've just shot yourself in the foot with this one. I see no option other than admitting the law you cite as effective simply wasn't effective at preventing one of the most famous acts of mass murder ever to take place on school grounds. That means a rebuttal from you is going to need to include the fact that you and the VPC lied.\n \n And since we're on the subject of Columbine, let's look at what other weapons were used by Eric Harris and Dylan Kleboid during their killing spree, just so we're comprehensive.\n \n http://www.acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html\n \n Dylan -- Intratec TEC-DC9 (9-mm semi-automatic handgun) attached to a strap slung over his shoulder (under coat), Savage 311-D 12-gauge double-barrel shotgun (barrel sawed down to approximately 23 inches, initially half-hidden in Dylan's cargos).\n \n Eric -- 10-shot Hi-Point model 995 carbine rifle on a strap (under coat), Savage-Springfield 67H 12-gauge pump shotgun he called 'Arlene' (named after a Doom character - initially in one of the duffels carried to the top of the grassy knoll -- stock and barrel sawed off, reducing the entire gun to 26 inches).\n \n Bomb tally:\n 48 -- Carbon Dioxide bombs\n 27 -- Pipe bombs\n 11 -- 1.5 gallon propane bombs\n 7 -- gas or napalm bombs\n 2 -- 20 pound propane bombs\n \n So in addition to Dylan having a weapon and magazines that were supposedly banned and made unavailable, both individuals had sawed off shotguns, a total of 95 bombs between them, and one ten shot rifle that supposedly is unsuitable for instances of what you refer to as mass shootings.\n \n Now with all of this information one has to ask some obvious questions. If the 1994 law was so effective at outlawing \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" how is it that it wasn't effective enough to keep Dylan from acquiring an Intratec TEC-DC9 pistol? And why exactly did Eric go with a Hi-Point carbine that can only hold 10 round at a time before it has to be reloaded? If Eric Harris felt that such a gun was suitable for their acts of mass killing, what would prevent somebody else from deciding the same? After all 12 people were killed, twice as many dead bodies when compared to the Tuscon shooting.\n \n Furthermore, why was Dylan in possession of a double barreled shotgun? The way the message is sold to us it makes it sound like anything holding ten rounds or less wouldn't be suitable for mass shootings and killings, but he went ahead and used it anyway. Apparently two shots wasn't a hindrance for him in his mission of killing as many classmates as he could.\n \n \nThe Violence Policy Center is calling on Congress to pass a new law banning the manufacture and sale of high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Earlier this week, Representative Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) announced plans to introduce legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines. A similar ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines was in place for 10 years as part of the now-expired federal assault weapons ban.\n\n \n The liberal crowd is quite bloodthirsty in nature. They're exploiting this tragedy for the purpose of trying to push through their own legislation. If one enjoyed conspiracies they could try and make the case that they paid Loughner to try and kill Giffords.\n \n \nAdds Rand, \"High-capacity ammunition magazines facilitate mass shootings by giving attackers the ability to fire numerous rounds without reloading. An effective ban on high-capacity magazines will help prevent tragedies like the one that claimed six lives and wounded numerous others last Saturday. We can save lives in the future with this simple, effective proposal.\"\n\n \n If \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" facilitate mass shootings, why do the proposed bills have exemptions for the police? Why do police needs magazines that facilitate mass shootings? Do they lose this supposedly criminal use when in the hands of law enforcement, thus showing that they have a legitimate purpose for being available? If they do for police who come to our rescue, why not for the people who need to be rescued in the first place? Why are we so unimportant?\n \n \nThe VPC yesterday released a backgrounder on the Glock 19 pistol and ammunition magazine used in the Arizona attack (see http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/AZbackgrounder.pdf for backgrounder). VPC - Press Release - (01/11/2011) - High-Capacity Ammunition Magazines: The Common Thread That Runs Through Mass Shootings\n\n \n So why is it that neither you nor anyone else is using Saturday's incident as grounds to try and ban the Glock model 19 from civilian ownership?",

   "  Some gun shops see more interest in accessories \n Since Saturday's deadly shooting in Tucson, Don's Guns in Indianapolis has run out of a magazine that enables Glock pistols to fire extra rounds.\n \n \"We sold out, just since that happened,\" says owner Don Davis. He has ordered more and expects the resupply to sell quickly. The rush to buy the accessories, he says, probably is motivated by fears that lawmakers will try to limit magazine capacity in the wake of the shooting.\n \n A random check of dozens of gun stores across the nation by USA TODAY reporters found no indication that sales of Glock guns are surging, but some reported increased customer interest in the extended magazines.\n \n \"We have seen an uptick in high-capacity magazine purchases, but not specifically Glocks,\" says Jonathan Pirkle of Coal Creek Armory in Knoxville, Tenn. He says that if talk of a ban \"lasts a month, then you will see them going quickly.\"\n \n Gregg Wolff, owner of two Glockmeister stores in Arizona and a website that specializes in Glock pistols and accessories, also says customers are stocking up on the extended magazines. \n\n We the People are adults. We don't want your Nanny State Solutions!! Go after the Criminals. Punish them. Not the law-abiding who are NOT the Problem! \n \n Mr. and Mrs. America!

   "So we know the message of this thread that Brady started, going off about what he and the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center choose to dub as \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" and talking about how an effective ban on them would help save lives. The same stuff that we've all heard before.\n \n Well I have something to show everyone that might surprise a few.\n \n Prohibit high-capacity magazines (Rep. Carolyn McCarthy) - The Hill's Congress Blog\n \n \nThe legislation that I will be introducing will prohibit the transfer, importation, or possession of high capacity magazines manufactured after the bill is enacted. Many of these devices exist currently and it would be impractical and unwise to attempt to ban their possession - criminalizing individuals who purchased the device legally. Instead, the bill will prohibit the transfer of those devices currently in existence. This allows individuals who currently own the devices to legally retain possession but works to prevent the spread of the devices by making it illegal to transfer them to another individual.\n \n It is a sad fact of reality that we will never be able to prevent every instance of gun violence. We also will not be able to keep these large capacity magazines out of the hands of every criminal who would use them.\n\n \n This is by Carolyn McCarthy, the one introducing this bill. In her article she is freely and readily admitting that her legislation will leave a countless and indeterminable number of these specific magazines available to the general public and do absolutely nothing to prevent their ownership or possession by anyone. She even admits that her legislation won't be able to prevent criminals from getting their hands on these magazines and using them for violent and illegal purposes.\n \n As we know, in the time leading up to the 1994 ban on \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" the various gun manufacturing companies in the country increased production to basically flood the market with more pre-ban examples than they ever normally produced. Since the end of the law in 2004 regular production has resumed and the market has become even more saturated with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And if McCarthy's bill is voted into law then production will just be revved up and the market flooded all over again. By the time the new law goes into effect there could very easily be tens of millions, if not potentially billions, of these magazines held in private hands, and there's not a thing you or McCarthy or law enforcement can do about it.\n \n Add to the fact that magazines, unlike the receiver of a gun, includes no traceable serial number for registration purposes, making it impossible to tell who legally owned any such magazine before the new ban, and who didn't, so there will be no way to prosecute someone for selling such a magazine to another individual. Criminal entrepreneurs and gun traffickers could easily stock up and sell them to the average clientele just like they do the guns they legally can't own.\n \n And now I have a question for Brady, and anyone else that chooses to adopt his position as their own and support his message. Is McCarthy's bill (a bill being authored by a so-called \"champion of gun control\") what you would readily refer to as an \"effective ban\" on so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" that would supposedly have been effective at stopping Loughner from shooting all those people?",

But I feel a few parallels can be drawn with previous topics of discussion that have already been voiced.\n \n Police link Detroit police station shooter to man set to be sentenced - CNN.com\n \n We have a gunman who actually had the nerve to go into a police precinct, a veritable storming of the castle if you will, right into the belly of the beast, and opening fire on the police officers inside.\n \n A few points instantly come to mind.\n \n First, the shooters name is Lamar Deshea Moore. To begin with that doesn't sound like the name of a white man, so if anybody wishes to claim that this was an attack perpetrated by either the Tea Party or a white racist individual (because the officers were black) I'm afraid that line of discussion has been quickly shut down.\n \n Second, according to the story being put forth by the Violence Policy Center, found here http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24detroit.html the gun used was a shotgun. Not an AR-15 or an AK-47 rifle, not a Glock model 19 handgun equipped with a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" but a run of the mill shotgun. A gun that tends to hold between 5 and 8 rounds of ammunition and can only be reloaded one round at a time through a permanently attached tubular magazine. A gun that isn't known for \"rapid fire capabilities\" but rather brute strength from the number of pellets discharged into a target. Not exactly the \"weapon of choice\" for somebody bent on killing police officers now is it?\n \n Third, unless this particular precinct was operating under some sort of local regulation that dictated all officers present must have their sidearms in a closed desk drawer while on the premises, I feel it's safe to assume that all officers present and accounted for were visibly armed and Moore was well aware of that fact when he started shooting.\n \n All the officers survived the shooting, either due to them wearing their duty issued kevlar vests (which can easily stop handgun and shotgun rounds) or the use of low penetration rounds, or both.

He instead went with a gun platform that's slow to reload and holds considerably fewer rounds than gun control proponents would tell us should be the maximum allowed amount available to civilians. They say we should only be allowed 10 rounds to a magazine, Moore went with between 5 and 8.

   "Oh boy where to begin with this one Brady? The amount of nonsense you shovel has always been above average but you seem to be attempting to break your previous records.\n \n \n\"There is no reason that a peaceful society based on rule of law needs its citizenry armed with 30-round magazines,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference, adding that the clips transform a gun \"into a weapon of mass death rather than a home-protection-type device.\"\n\n \n Switzerland has a peaceful society based on rule of law. They also have a defense force made up of private citizens who are issued standard military firearms capable of full-auto capabilities. These weapons are stored at their private residences and kept handy in case the need should ever arise that they need to be deployed for protecting the homefront.\n \n What do you have to say regarding that Brady?\n \n \n\"Large-capacity ammunition magazines carry far more bullets than any civilian could possibly ever use,\" Richard M. Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said in a statement. \"Common sense restrictions provide law enforcement with a tactical advantage over criminals, making us all safer.\"\n\n \n You are fully aware of the fact that a magazine capable of carrying 11 rounds instead of 10 is legally recognized as a so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" aren't you? Are you really going to claim that one extra bullet is far more than any person could possibly ever used for legitimate purposes?\n \n There's nothing common sense about restrictions on magazine capacity nor is there any common sense in believing that the countless thousands to millions of magazines currently circulating will somehow become inaccessible to criminals should another prohibition be enacted into enforceable law.\n \n Furthermore what about the tactical advantage of the private citizenry against the criminals? The police can never be right where they're needed in order to prevent a violent crime from occurring. We have a legitimate need and obligation to protect ourselves from harm when the police aren't there.\n \n I also object to the notion that any person is qualified to determine that those of us without private body guards has no need for specific tools just because that's their personal opinion.\n \n \nThe National Rifle Association would do everything in its power to stop the law, the group's spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said.\n\n \n The National Rifle Association would do everything in its power to stop any infringement on gun ownership. You could try and enact a ban on hunting rifles because they're capable of killing a man sized target out to 600 yards away under the guise of banning sniper rifles, and the National Rifle Association would fight it. You could try and mandate that black powder muskets be regulated like modern firearms and the National Rifle Association would fight that too.\n \n \"High-capacity ammunition magazines\" aren't a special cause for the National Rifle Association. It's just par for the course in the name of protecting our constitutional freedoms.\n \n Magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition are nothing new or revolutionary. Nor are they unique or exclusive to the military. The first widespread magazines capable of holding over 10 rounds were found on the Browning Hi-Power pistol, designed back in 1914 and made available in 1935. We're talking about the era of the Great Depression, showing that the roots for such accessories and components go back a very long time. There's even information to suggest that such magazines weren't used by the military until near the end of World War Two, which means they were on the civilian market long before they were seen as viable by the military.\n \n So we have a long history of availability of \"high capacity ammunition magazines\", and the fact that the term is very broad in nature and arbitrarily sets the cut off point at an amount of 10 rounds of ammunition. We have no explanation for how such an amount was deemed acceptable when it's far lower than the capacity of standard issue magazines that were made at the same time of the guns they were made to work with. 13 and up have been standard for magazine capacity since the 9mm caliber caught on as a viable cartridge for both official duty and personal defense. Go back as far as the double stack magazine and you'll see amounts greater than 10 have been the norm since almost the beginning. To claim they're somehow unsuitable now is disregarding decades of history.\n \n And now I have questions for you Brady. And I ask you since you've adopted these positions as your own.\n \n The first question is perhaps the most obvious. Why is is that these magazines, which have been available to the public since the Great Depression, have somehow been determined to be unsuitable for sale and possession by the general public in the late 20th and early 21st century? What changed?\n \n The second question is more in depth and I'm sure it'll be ignored because it's too hard to explain. Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a person was breaking the law if they attempted to sell or buy a newly manufactured magazine capable of holding 11 rounds. How exactly do you justify criminal prosecution of a person when their offense amounts to one round of ammunition? Or how about two rounds of ammunition?\n \n \nHigh-capacity magazines were banned in 1994, but Congress refused to renew the law and it expired in 2004.\n\n \n Incorrect again. And here's why.\n \n Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n (a) PROHIBITION- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 110102(a), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n \n `(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n `(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n It says right there in black and white terms that the ban shall NOT apply to magazines that are owned prior to the enactment date of the legislation. Meaning that a countless number of magazines capable of holding more than 10 round of ammunition had immunity and couldn't be touched by the bill. So all a criminal had to do, if they wanted such magazines, was shop the second hand market, and there wasn't a thing you could do to stop them.\n \n How many times do I have to repeat myself with you and everyone else?\n \n \nSince then, large-capacity magazines have been used in several mass shootings, including the Virginia Tech slayings in 2007 that left 33 dead, and the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, that killed 13.\n L.A. police chief backs ban on big ammo clips - U.S. news - Crime & courts - msnbc.com\n\n \n Don't mess with me Brady. My posts are loaded with and linked to relevant information to rebuke whatever claim you may have to make.\n \n Josh Sugarmann: 10 U.S. Mass Shootings Involving High-Capacity Ammunition Magazines (Slide Show)\n \n The list cites 10 examples from 2010 all the was back to 1989. With three of the shootings taking place when a ban on so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" was supposedly in place and designed to stop them from occurring.\n \n That's a time frame of 21 years, and only 10 shooting examples. That means these \"major mass shootings\" are exceedingly rare, with only one seeming to occur every two years.\n \n This fact doesn't seem to coincide with the sense of urgency that Brady seems to be trying to administer. So one must ask a very obvious question. If \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" are so prevalent, why are the number of \"major mass shootings\" that the Violence Policy Center cite so few and far between?\n \n Wouldn't that suggest that the number of lawfully possessed and used \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" far outweigh the number of incidents in which criminals make use of them?\n \n \nHigh capacity magazines transform guns into weapons of mass destruction and allow criminals to outgun the police so that were all in danger.\n\n \n Previously we had you going on record and stating you believe private gun ownership actually causes violent crime to happen. Then we had you show disrespect to the Supreme Court and take a stance suggestive of doing away with them because they didn't agree with you. And now we have you actually stating that a gun with a magazine capable of holding 11 rounds is no different than the nuclear weapon we dropped on Japan in World War Two?\n \n And in case you were unaware of history the police already have easy access to \"high-capacity ammunition magazines\" just like anyone else in America. They can't be outgunned unless department restrictions forbid them from carrying specific equipment. So if you have a problem take it up with the chief of police.\n \n Semiautomatic firearms with what you define as \"high capacity magazines\" have been available to the police since the 1970s, and have been used by countless honest law-abiding citizens for their own personal defense. The number of legal owners greatly outweighs the number of supposed \"mass shooters\" we keep hearing you talk about.",

   "Oh for the love of God...\n \n \nCongress: No Assault Clips!\n\n \n \"Assault clips\" now? The misleading term of \"assault weapons\" wasn't bad enough now you've gotta invent the term \"assault clips\" to try and scare people into compliance? You couldn't sway anyone in any other manner?\n \n \nOn January 8, nineteen people, including U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and U.S. District Court Judge John Roll, were shot outside a Tucson, Arizona grocery store with a handgun equipped with a large capacity ammunition magazine.\n\n \n You seem to be capitalizing on the Giffords shooting. You seem to have absolutely no problem exploiting the tragedy for your own purposes. Why exactly were you mounting an assault just minutes to hours after the shooting came over the airwaves? Why didn't you and others have the common decency to wait until at least Monday before launching an all out campaign as a result?\n \n \nU.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy has introduced H.R. 308, Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act to prohibit civilian possession of these military style magazines. Senator Frank Lautenberg has introduced S.32 in the Senate.\n\n \n First you claimed so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" were outlawed under the 1994 law. I pointed out how you were wrong. Now I'll point out how you're wrong again.\n \n Read The Bill: H.R. 308 - GovTrack.us\n \n '(v)(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n '(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply to the possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed within the United States on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n \n It says right there that civilian possession won't be prohibited. So again you're caught lying. And then there's this part.\n \n '(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--\n \n '(A) a manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);\n \n '(B) a transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such a licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;\n \n '(C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon that retirement; or\n \n '(D) a manufacture, transfer, or possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Attorney General.'.\n \n Exactly why are retired law enforcement officers allowed to own such magazines if they truly have no purpose other than facilitating high volume murder? Retired police officers no longer serve the public, they're just regular citizens again.\n \n And then there's the words of Carolyn McCarthy herself when it comes to this issue.\n \n Prohibit high-capacity magazines (Rep. Carolyn McCarthy) - The Hill's Congress Blog\n \n \nThe legislation that I will be introducing will prohibit the transfer, importation, or possession of high capacity magazines manufactured after the bill is enacted. Many of these devices exist currently and it would be impractical and unwise to attempt to ban their possession - criminalizing individuals who purchased the device legally. Instead, the bill will prohibit the transfer of those devices currently in existence. This allows individuals who currently own the devices to legally retain possession but works to prevent the spread of the devices by making it illegal to transfer them to another individual.\n \n It is a sad fact of reality that we will never be able to prevent every instance of gun violence. We also will not be able to keep these large capacity magazines out of the hands of every criminal who would use them.\n\n \n I pointed this fact out back in January but you never responded Brady. Why is that exactly? Why are you choosing to ignore those you support when they say what you want is impractical or impossible?\n \n \nLarge capacity ammunition magazines are designed to enable shooting mass numbers of people quickly and efficiently without reloading. They are not useful for hunting or self-defense.\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Home\n\n \n And yet Carolyn McCarthy's bill would continue to allow retired police officers to own and use them despite the fact that they no longer serve a public good in their retirement and are indistinguishable from regular citizens.\n \n We've been over this before Brady and yet you continue to ignore everything. Just give up already.\n \n \nAssault clips make guns alot more deadly.\n\n \n We've been over this too. And as usual Brady you're wrong. A gun is a deadly weapon. It's designed from the very beginning to be deadly in nature. There's no way one can successfully make it into anything else. It's not a non-lethal option. It's not politically correct in nature. The magazine itself plays absolutely no part in affecting this simple fact. It always has been such and that fact is recognized by law. The position you're arguing and putting forth as your own position, is that a deadly weapon is somehow capable of being made either less deadly or more deadly, depending on what accessories might be used at any given time. And this is simply not the truth. It doesn't matter how fast a gun can be fired, it doesn't matter what attachments it has, it doesn't matter if it can be reloaded in an instant, none of that is important. What really is important is the fact that a gun is a deadly weapon regardless, and nothing will change that.\n \n Loughner assaulted 20 people with a deadly weapon and murdered six of them. And you want to quibble about what accessories he used as if they somehow change this fact.",

   "Congress: No Assault Clips!\n \n On January 8, nineteen people, including U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and U.S. District Court Judge John Roll, were shot outside a Tucson, Arizona grocery store with a handgun equipped with a large capacity ammunition magazine.\n \n U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy has introduced H.R. 308, Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act to prohibit civilian possession of these military style magazines. Senator Frank Lautenberg has introduced S.32 in the Senate.\n \n Large capacity ammunition magazines are designed to enable shooting mass numbers of people quickly and efficiently without reloading. They are not useful for hunting or self-defense.\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence : Home\n \n Assault clips make guns alot more deadly.\n\n \n Poppycock! Do tell the amount of ammo it takes to create a kill by the armed forces or the police. Also look at the table of military shots fired from the 'civil war' to today and how much ammo it took to secure a hit, much less a fatality.\n \n Exactly is it, what property, disables a full capacity magazine that renders it useless for hunting or self-defense other than propaganda by liberals. Show me in the Constitution where such is found that disqualifies such a practice.",

   "VPC and the brady bunch could only produce 10 incidents over about as many years trying to prove their point on \"lethality\" which is pure propaganda.\n \n In times of actual recorded and documented use by many troops the rate PER casualty per number of shots fired incresed expotentially thus forever proving that their claim has any merit at all.\n \n The continued cry for unsubstantiated claims fall impotently to the ground.\n \n Last I checked, the police probability of scoring a HIT was only 87% so no gain in lethality for them either. These are the \"only ones\" these two farce .orgs contend are suitable to carry these full capacity magazines and rings hollow to contend that citizens are somehow more qualified to shoot accurately than the police or military.\n \n I would love to make the anti Constitutionalists post the number of rounds fired by the military as both arms quality and full capacity magazines came more into vogue. I want to see an in depth explanation as to the \"well trained\" police having about a 13% hit probability and explanations of why they are ABOVE THE LAW when their duty requires strict compliance with the law.\n \n No sidetrack or avoidance of the questions allowed. They will be considered avoidance and concession that their propaganda is nothing but a poor LIE.",

   "Congress is considering a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, such as the one used in the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona. Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, author of the legislation, needs your help today to ensure that it gets passed.\n\n \n They've been considering similar proposals since 2004 when the previous law expired. They were still considering them in 2007 after the Virginia Tech shooting when 32 people were murdered. What gives you any confidence that this will come to fruition this time?\n \n The democrats possessed a House and Senate super majority in 2008 and could run roughshod and act without objection from the republican side. They had the perfect opportunity to enact just such a law with little to no debate. So why didn't they strike while the iron was hot?\n \n \nH.R. 308 would apply nationally a 10-round-maximum standard that is already used in four states today, as well as nationwide while the previous federal assault weapons ban was in effect. The bill also closes a gaping loophole that allowed magazines manufactured before the ban to still be sold or transferred.\n\n \n Quick question time Brady. Exactly how would this legislation close this so-called \"gaping loophole\" as you refer to it? The current number of so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" in circulation must be in the hundreds of thousands if not the millions. To the best of my knowledge none of them have specific identifying serial numbers that link them to any specific individual, nor can they be registered to anybody due to a lack of said identifying marks. How exactly will you be able to prosecute someone for selling or transferring a so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" to another person since you can't tell who owned them to begin with?\n \n Do you intend to have Carolyn McCarthy go back and propose another bill that would require all currently owned magazines to be stamped or engraved with unique and identifying numbers so they can be registered to a specific owner or owners so you can register them and outlaw their transfer? How will your force compliance and how will you punish disobedience? If the serial number can be removed from a gun then surely it can be obliterated from a magazine as well since the steel is much thinner and softer to work with. How will you track them then?\n \n If you aren't prepared to address these shortcomings Brady then you have no business being here and parroting this position as your own.\n \n \nCongresswoman McCarthy wrote this bill because she understands the dangers of high-capacity weapons &#8211; her husband was killed and her son seriously wounded by a gunman wielding a 15-round magazine on the Long Island Railroad in 1993. This bill has the support of the 1,200-member Conference of Mayors, and over 100 lawmakers in Congress.\n\n \n So Carolyn McCarthy's husband and son were shot with the 11-15th rounds rather than the first 10? Preventing the gunman from having a longer firing time before reloading would have prevented them from getting shot somehow?\n \n McCarthy seems to be grandstanding this tragedy that befell her family. She seems to be exploiting it and using it as an excuse to launch an attack on America with no compassion for anyone.\n \n \nNow Congress needs to hear from you. Sign the petition today and let Congress know that you stand with Congresswoman McCarthy and support the ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n Friends of Carolyn McCarthy\n \n Help save lives! Sign the petition!\n\n \n I'll make a deal with you Brady. I'll sign your precious petition if you can answer my proposed question with absolutely no hyperbole and without referencing the Brady Campaign, Violence Policy Center or anyone else in formulating a paragraph long answer.\n \n Here's the question for you to answer: \n \n Under the 1994 law, and even under McCarthy's proposed bill, a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" is defined as any magazine capable or made capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Possession of such a device seemed to carry a felony offense and 10 years in prion. According to the proposed legal definition of a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" is any magazine capable of holding 11 rounds. Are you really going to sit there and tell us in all honesty that a person deserves to go to prison for a decade or more and lose their constitutional rights over a matter of one extra round of ammunition?\n \n If you can successfully make the case then I'll sign that petition. If you can argue conclusively that somebody deserves to be locked up in a federal prison alongside rapists, arsonists, human traffickers, mass murderers and child rapists, when the person you wish to see locked up did nothing more than have one spare round of ammunition in their magazine and that is sufficient grounds for criminalizing them and revoking their rights through due process, then you've proven that you're intelligible enough to win an argument and get others to agree with you and what you present.",

   "  High Capacity Gun Magazines - Life Is Too Precious To Risk Running Out Of Bullets \n ..... So with this in mind, here are five good reasons that you should WANT a high capacity magazine.\n \n 1. Multiple assailants. Whether on the street or during a home invasion, violent criminals often move in pairs or packs. Realize that you will never shoot as well as your score at the range when you are under the unbelievable stress of a life-or-death encounter. Which would you prefer to have in your magazine in such an event? Ten rounds? Or fifteen or seventeen? Or perhaps even 30?\n \n 2. Private citizens always face the threat before the police arrive. Private citizens were on the front line at Tucson, Columbine, and Virginia Tech. Why limit our effectiveness?\n \n \n You should logically want whatever cops choose to carry. How many cops choose a ten round magazine? If politicians want to hinder us \"little people\" with a ten round limit, they should also hamper the police with the same limit. Let's see how far that flies.\n \n In nearly every instance it is not a cop on the \"front line\" of a violent situation. It is private citizens who must face the \"lone gunman\" until (and sometimes even after) the police arrive. See Dial 911 and Die. Is the life of a policeman more important than yours?\n \n 3. Civil disturbances. Watch the Reginald Denny beating video some time. Review the looting insanity of Hurricane Katrina. You've got a crazed mob of ten, twenty, or fifty people headed in your direction. Are ten rounds enough? Might you want fifteen, or seventeen, or even thirty?\n \n Oh, and while you're at it, perhaps bring from memory those Los Angeles Korean store owners standing guard on the roofs of their businesses with semi-auto AKs during the Rodney King riots. No one messed with those stores, did they?\n \n 4. Because it is your most fundamental right as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and, more importantly, as given by G-d A-lmighty: the right to the righteous defense of yourself and the innocent. \"Shall not be infringed\" simply means what it says. When politicians infringe on magazine capacity, they infringe on the Second Amendment. You should want a high cap mag because you can have one!\n \n This is America, not a socialist nanny state or tin pot Third World dictatorship. The saying \"use it or lose it\" is never so relevant as when applied to our Bill of Rights. See \"2A Today for the USA\"\n \n 5. Your assailants may well be armed with high cap magazines themselves. No ban will affect these criminals; it will actually encourage them. Do you really think the gang bangers care about federal laws? Again, ask the local cop why he or she won't \"downgrade\" to a ten round mag to go along with this feel-good idiocy. Ask the pols why they don't think the cops should do so.\n \n These are just a few of the reasons for WANTING (not \"needing\") a high cap magazine. In the spirit of JPFO's recently launched \"High Cap Freedom\" campaign, go out and buy one or more high capacity mags for your pistol or rifle today.\n \n Always remember, the present drive towards a ban might fail, but all it will take is \"Loughner II\" (another convenient \"crazed lone gunman\") to drive the hysteria machine to victory for the gun grabbers. Get your high cap magazines before any ban can take place.\n \"Because your life is too precious to risk running out of bullets.\"\n Rabbi Dovid Bendory\n Rabbinic Director\n Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership \n\n I have one more reason. Brady and Galileo don't want me to have them! Think I will go to Midway USA and buy a few more and hit the NRA round up jar on the way out! emoticon_smile",

This borders on high crimes and misdomeanors.\n \n It is her fault for voting to allow her district where her husband and son got shot by an illegal alien who broke NY BAN on guns then in effect and prevented anyone else from having a gun to stop the madman...just like Norway. Gun free zones kill people. I lay this squarely on the backs of people just like you, your parents and congressmen like McCarthy who looked foolish debating Congresswoman, Dr. Suzzana Gratia Hupp who lost her parents in Killeen at Luby's Cafeteria for not having the ability to have her gun on her when her parents were shot and she narrowly escaped WHILE A LEO CONVENTION WAS GOING ON RIGHT NEXT DOOR.\n \n How does a multiple round magazine increase the lethality of any gun? The hit probability for LEO and our Servicemen overseas has gone DOWN since our war for independence. IF, if full capacity magazines were so \"lethal\", it would be the opposite. Your whole screed is built on lies and gun free zones slaughter areas. Colin Ferguson could have killed her husband and son on the Long Island subway with a sharp fork while they lay cowering with no means of protection. Her protection of criminals in gun free zones and protecting illegal aliens through sanctuary cities is the main cause for her personal loss.\n \n MORE GUNS = LESS CRIME ....

   "Let's see, according to the article,   Norway forbids the sale of clips for hunting rifles that hold more than three bullets  so he already broke that law, but if he had the Anti-gunners politically correct 10 round magazines, would it have made any difference? The guy in Norway had 90 minutes to pull off his carnage at that camp. If the guy had to have had a ammunition reloading press and make the bullets one by one, and even load them into a single shot rifle, he would have had plenty of time to do it. \n \n If firearms were never invented, he also broke the law and made one heck of a huge car bomb. If he had to, he would have also broken even more laws and made smaller bombs that he could have thrown into buildings to pull of his carnage. \n \n All of that gun control in Norway and this happened. \n \n England, which has the strictest gun control in the Western world, enough to make a Rabid Anti-gunner dance for joy, and this still happens.   gunman Derrick Bird killed at least 12 people in a shooting spree in Cumbria and injured another 25 before taking his own life.  \n Armed with two weapons - a .22 rifle and a shotgun \n \n No semi autos, no pumps, no handguns allowed. Period. Strict cradle to grave registration, and all guns are locked up. Everything that the gun banners say we need in order to stop all of this. But it doesn&#8217;t. \n \n All of that gun control in Germany and all of these happen.   Motives Remain a Mystery After Slaughter in Germany \n 2009. killing 15 people before taking his own life. \n Firearms are tightly regulated in Germany, but the country has been afflicted by other mass school shootings in the past several years.\n \n In 2006, an 18-year-old student carrying explosives and rifles injured dozens of people in the northwestern German town of Emsdetten before killing himself. \n \n In 2002, a 19-year-old former student fatally shot 16 people at a high school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany, before killing himself. \n\n Just about every week we here of more mass bombings, but magazine ban is the magic answer? \n \n There are plenty of other countries that this happens in too, but I am sure everyone gets the picture.

Are they without a customs service that inspects for the purpose of intercepting contraband?\n \n It would also seem that the export of the magazines in question was already an illegal act, even without Carolyn McCarthy's bill and its provisions. http://www.exportlawblog.com/archives/3315\n \n \nAlthough this revelation has led some politicians and others to wonder why such exports are legal, these exports might well have been illegal. The magazines in question would clearly have been Category I(h) items on the United States Munitions List and would have required a State Department license unless one of the export exemptions in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations was applicable. The only one arguably applicable would be the one found in section 123.17(a) which permits unlicensed exports of certain parts and components, including magazines, of &#8220;semi-automatic firearms to caliber .50 inclusive&#8221; provided the value does not exceed $100 wholesale in any transaction.\n\n \n It seems rather interesting that this shooter is being regarded as something of a genius in getting around various laws for carrying out this rampage, and yet he wasn't aware of this fact of law regarding US exports.\n \n \nI told you so.\n\n \n Beyond ignoring the fact that Breivik was in possession of 12,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, an amount that greatly exceeded what Timothy McVeigh possessed, there is also the fact that Breivik deliberately chose a remote and isolated location 90 minutes away from the nearest armed police officer who could come to the rescue. 68 dead in 90 minutes is hardly a feat that requires what you term high-capacity magazines. That works out to about 79 seconds to carry out each murder. Ample time for reloading what would be termed low-capacity magazines. And since there were children present there was little possibility of anybody trying to rush him when he stopped to reload in the manner Jared Loughner was taken down.\n \n What you have told us Brady is truly nothing.",
