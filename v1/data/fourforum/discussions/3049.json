   "I suppose you could argue that everything you do in life goes to making you who you are today. That said, the things we do when we're young don't always represent who we turn out to be. That doesn't excuse our actions as young adults, it simply illustrates the fact that age usually brings maturity and wisdom. As I pointed out in another thread, the criticism of George Bush has been primarilly directed at his performance as President. Since he wants 4 more years, I feel discussion of his actions while President are perfectly valid in determining his worthiness. Most of the criticism of Kerry, however, has centered on his military record 30 years ago in Viet Nam. As a Senator, the Republican's only criticism has been that he's \"Liberal\", and it appears that they have a hard time finding a Conservative in their own ranks. I wonder what sort of information would surface on George Bush if we went back and started digging into his past to when he was 18-22 years old???",

You know, you keep saying that, but no one really cares. Most of the senators and reps of both parties are liberal, as well as Bush himself. Bush won't run on his record of the past 3 years, because he knows he has do nothing good. \n \n \n\n Kerry brought out the Vietnam War chronicle as a running tool. He reported for duty.

At least he doesn't have known liars doing the work for him. \n \n \n\n This brings out a similar but larger group of veterans who claim Kerry is unfit to command. Granted, they likely would have come out anyway, no matter what his claim to fame happened to be, but they did respond to Kerry's own claims of valor and bravery.\n\n \n And they are being challenged across the board, even by people who don't support Kerry. Newsweek, time and Snopes, along with a bunch of other organizations are blowing holes every week in the SVBT's claims. \n \n \n\n They likely remembered Kerry's anti-American activities after his early withdrawal from leadership training in Vietnam. They likely remember the same John Kerry I saw shaking hands with the communist leaders...our sworn enemy.

Also, O'Neill has lied about that as well. \n \n \n\n They remember that John won't release his medical records from the first purple heart incident.\n\n \n Granted, that is sketchy, but still, is what happened 35 years ago, more important then the past 3? \n \n \n\n By scrutinizing John's claim to great things while in Vietnam, we find that he is a liar.\n\n \n By scrutinizing Bush's claim to great things in the past three years, we find that he is a liar. Besides, many of the kerry attackers are liars themselves. \n \n \nHe even proves it himself when he writes in his diary, nine days AFTER the first purple heart, that he hasn't been under enemy fire yet.\n\n \n Which is contridicted by military reports and eye wtiness accounts. \n \n \n\n You asked if these things are important.
