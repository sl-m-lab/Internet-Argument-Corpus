I do not support limits on how many guns you can own. I do not support limits on clips. I do not support a ban on certain types of guns. I do not support the idea of anyone other than law enforcement to have a gun in schools or on airplanes. \n \n Reasons. I was granted the right to carry a gun by the constitution. I have the right to defend myself by any neccesary actions. I have the right to hunt, to shoot as a hobby, or just collect guns if I so desire. A gun is a gun. I can shoot someone dead with a single fire .22 just as quick as I can with an M16, so what is the point of banning certain types? If a criminal wants to kill a group of people, he will do so with or without high capacity magazines. Guns is schools or on airplanes are a bad idea. Although the constitution grants us the right to bear arms, I don't think the writers ever entertained the possibility of kids going to school and killing their classmates and teachers. I don't think our founding fathers ever imagined terrorists on airplanes, and using them as weapons after they have taken them over (come to think of it, they did not even know what airplanes were)! The constitution is a great and noble document that was written a long time ago, and as times have changed, it makes sense that the laws must change as well. Gun laws are far from perfect, but they are the laws. I don't have to like them, I just have to follow them. Many of them make no sense, some simply need to be enforced to be effective, and some need to be stricken from record.

Sure, I understand it is the right to keep and bear arms, I support that. But we need laws to regulate a right. You have the right to free speech, but you cannot scream fire in a crowded theater without being arrested. Does this not limit free speech?\n\n \n A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. \n There are 27 words in the 2nd amend. It is a very simple clear right. The only people that have problems with it are people like gun haters.\n Here is the definition of militia: \n Function: noun\n Etymology: Latin, military service, from milit-, miles\n Date: circa 1660\n 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country \n liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens \n organized for military service \n 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by \n law as being subject to call to military service \n \n Makes it very clear what a militia is. Gun hater pilot cannot claim this as a personal interpretation of militia. Now the gun hater pilot will claim something about being in a militia. No where in the 2nd amend is there a requirement to be in a militia to bear arms. The gun haters cannot produce one law, edit, or regulation defending their claim of this.\n \n Gun hater pilot is tying to use this old lie \"You have the right to free speech, but you cannot scream fire in a crowded theater without being arrested.\" Does this not limit free speech?\" \n Why is this a lie? Simple because you can yell fire in a crowded theater if there is a fire. Now if there is no fire you will be punished for starting a panic. Gun hater pilot is trying to say punishing a person for the abuse of a right is a limit! \n \n The very same wording is used to describe the 1st amend and 2nd amend \" the right of the people\". There are no infringements on the 1st amend like there are on the 2nd amend!\n There are no pre ban or post ban words, you know like the pre ban and post ban guns! \n There is no requirement for background check before a person exercises their 1st amend right to free speech!\n There are no word free zones!\n \n The fact is laws pertaining to the 1st amend will punish you for the abuse of this right. Example of this is when a person uses the 1st amend right to threaten to harm another person, that person will be punished.\n \n Hey gun hater pilot here is the definition of infringement \n 1. 1 : the act of infringing \n 2 : an encroachment or trespass on a right or privilege \n So tell us gun hater pilot how you are pro right to bear arms if you want \n limits on that right?",
