Bush's military record, ending 44 years as reporter, anchor and face of the network. \n \n His career spanned such U.S. historical landmarks as President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974 and the attacks by suicide hijackers who seized airliners and flew them into the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001.\n \n So, here lies one of the biggest names in the business today. And he goes down in flames because he hated someone so much that he could not help but lie about him. Sometimes the far left MSM just can't help itself. Most of them get away with the lies they tell about the right. But he got hammered on this one.",
