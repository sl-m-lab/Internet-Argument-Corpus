   "I just report. You decide.\n =========================\n Moslem Cleric Calls for Revenge Against Britain on PA TV\n 18:15 May 24, '05 \n \n In a sermon broadcast live on TV supervised by the Palestinian Authority, a cleric affiliated with Hamas, says Islam must rule over the U.S. and Great Britain, and exact revenge against the British. A Moslem cleric called for exacting revenge against Great Britain in a virulent sermon broadcast live on Palestinian television on Friday, May 13...\n \n (Snip)\n \n A Moslem cleric called for exacting revenge against Great Britain in a virulent sermon broadcast live on Palestinian television on Friday, May 13. The cleric, Sheikh Ibrahim Mudeiras, who has become a symbol of Palestinian hatred of Israel and the Western world, said the day will come when Islam \"will rule Britain\".\n \n \"We hold this opportunity to hold Britain accountable and say there is revenge we can never forget. We cannot forego the revenge we want to exact from Britain. We hold Britain responsible for what happened in Palestine. Britain is the cause, till this very minute, of every drop of blood dripping in this land,\" Mudeiras told Arab viewers in the Palestinian Authority.\n \n Mudeiras set forth an Islamic program for world domination, claiming that Islam will ultimately prevail and rule both Britain and the United States...\n \n (Snip)\n \n British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom that Israel need not worry, explaining his government will not open relations with terrorists, but is considering some level of contact with persons who recognize the State of Israel's right to exist, and have turned to a life which shuns terrorism...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=82560",
