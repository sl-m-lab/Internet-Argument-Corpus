He asserts that the national baseball league is spying on everyone and goes out to prove it (by stealing a tank and blowing up the satelite doing the spying for the national baseball league).\n \n Oh, and me thinks this is one of those hits-and-runs. My suggestion is to either ignore or ridicule (and possibly appologize if the poster returns :p )",

Leno's chin has nothing to do with the Great Baseball Conspiracy. It's actually a result of a secret plastic surgery pact between him and Michael Jackson.
