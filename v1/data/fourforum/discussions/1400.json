   "Britain has been a staging area for terrorists wanting to strike the US. Now things have changed. Now Britain is a target too. According to Al Quaeda, Britain is a target because of their support in the Iraqi invasion. There have been 499 Terror arrests since 9-11 but only two convictions. \n \n Many in Britain are angry with Blair. They are now targets too. Do you think Germany and France should have involved themselves in this battle with Muslims?\n \n Britain is under a terror alert, similar to what we have here in the US. \n \n \n http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=420718&section=news\n \n \n Police say foil al Qaeda attacks in UK\n Thu 11 December, 2003 19:28 \n \n By Michael Holden \n \n LONDON (Reuters) - Security services have \"undoubtedly\" foiled planned terror attacks by al Qaeda followers in Britain and also probably across Europe, according to the head of the country's anti-terrorist force. \n \n Peter Clarke warned, however, there was no room for complacency in the race to stop extremists using skills and links forged in war zones such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Georgia from carrying out attacks around the world. \n \n \"We are absolutely confident we have stopped a lot of terrorist activity. There would have been attacks,\" Clarke, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, told Reuters in an interview. \n \n But \"there is still a huge task ahead of us,\" he added.",
