It doesn't discredit Christianity does it?\n\n It is true about the crusades , the inquisition etc, Those crimes were committed in the name of Christianity.\n Hitler was going by the book.\n There are wondeful social effects of Christianity. Evolution has none.\n Darwin warned against allowing \"the weak members of civilised societies [to] propagate their kind\"\n \"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\" (Darwin, Charles R. [English naturalist and founder of the modern theory of evolution], \"The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,\" [1871], John Murray: London, Second Edition, 1922, reprint, pp.205-206) [top]\n \n \"Haeckel was the chief apostle of evolution in Germany. Nordenskiold (1929) argues that he was even more influential than Darwin in convincing the world of the truth of evolution. ... But, as Gasman argues, Haeckel's greatest influence was, ultimately, in another, tragic direction-national socialism. His evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a \"just\" state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others; the irrational mysticism that had always stood in strange communion with his brave words about objective science-all contributed to the rise of Nazism. The Monist League that he had founded and led, though it included a wing of pacifists and leftists, made a comfortable transition to active support for Hitler.\" (Gould, Stephen J.

Some people I can accept that with but your interest in the Bible indicates loudly to me you would like to believe it is true.\n Your comment about using physical evidence makes no sense to me. To interpret the evidence as a miracle of the pagan god chaos [chance] and cronos [time] is what you are doing and at the same time saying there is no physical evidence of God's existence. You do believe however in the existence of god's . That makes no sense to me. \n \n The New Testament refutes evolution every bit as much as Genesis because of the words of Jesus Christ and all of the apostles.\n \n The patent argument of evolutionist is that the Old Testament is a myth because it contradicts the work of chaos and cronos. My point of my post was the whole Bible does so and it must be completely disregarded or rewritten to fit evolution. The atheist ever since Darwin's prime political example knew they must destroy Christianity to sell evolution. It has to be done slowly. Darwin knew this and was careful how far he pushed. His own words were his faith disappeared slowly and painlessly.\n \n You are helping that cause. \n If you find out to late that you are wrong remember that Jesus said you are with me or against me , you gather souls to me or you scatter them.\n I will pray for you.

Nor do I worship evolution, gravity, or the pythagorean theory. They don't provide spiritual fulfillment; I don't expect or want them to. They do provide a rational and disinterested explanation of the world as it is. I don't look to them for spiritual subtext or guidance because they don't offer it, regardless of what you attempt to say. There is no widespread Machiavellian (you would say Darwinian) attempt by people who believe in evolution to subvert Christianity. \n \n I believe that man is meant to trust his rational abilities, while at the same time contemplating his spiritual existence. The Bible cultivates this contemplative spiritual investigation, while science cultivates the rational abilities of man. Insinuating a fundamental conflict between the two only leaves us in danger of being less than whole human beings.\n\n \n Excellent post and welcome. emoticon_xhoho",
