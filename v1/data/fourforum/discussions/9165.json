   "\n What will they turn to next to oppose democracy (in favor of judicial oligarchy) since no longer can they claim voting for ballot initiatives works against them?\n \n\n \n Now there's a bizzare look at reality. One state in eight actually does the right thing, and that's supposed to mean that gays should welcome having their rights determined by popular vote. The reality is of course the exact opposite of what Jyoshu is claiming. All states except Arizona that had ballot measures on the subject voted to make gays second class citizens, proving that if you let mob rule determine things, you're most likely to get an emotional result, not the correct one. If a group's civil rights are threatened, then they're threatened by the people, the same people who vote. Holding a popular vote to determine civil rights is like allowing a bully to be the one who decides if anyone in the schoolyard should be beaten up. But still, you have to admire Jyoshu's chutzpa.

You dishonestly say I'm claiming this is proof of voting as \"will always do the right thing\", but that's not at all what I said. I'm saying this is better than using the courts to change marriage. It's not like the courts have been the traditional means get civil rights in this country down through history. The point I was making was not that voting will always go your way, but that this vote was proof that it CAN go your way. It actually IS possible for something besides the courts to work out for you! Imagine that! Nice attempt of dishonest misrepresentation, but I'm not going to let you get away with it.\n \n But of course, the real issue is whether or not changing marriage is a civil right to begin with, because these ballot initiatives are generally about whether marriage should be protected from being redefined. \n \n The actual ballot initiative was known as Prop. 107, and read as follows:\n \n 1. Only a union between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage by the State of Arizona or its cities, towns, counties or districts.\n \n 2. The State of Arizona and its cities, towns, counties or districts shall not create or recognize a legal status for unmarried persons that is similar to marriage.\n \n See, the intiative didn't say \"gay marriage is banned.\" That's actually a misrepresentation of the language of the initiative. (yes, I know I'm the one that made the thread title, but it was based on the wording in some of the news reports.) The focus of the initiative is keeping marriage from being redefined and changed. So the real issue of the vote was, do gays have special rights to have the institution of marriage changed? I would say they should not, but since the will of the people have spoken, I will go along with it.\n \n Also, on what basis do you assume any vote against allowing marriage to be redefinable is an \"emotional result\" (as you put it)? I see no reason to assume that voters didn't think through it in both cases, and for you to claim any position other than yours in this case is merely \"emotional\" is pretty ... well, condescending.",

Nice attempt of dishonest misrepresentation, but I'm not going to let you get away with it.\n\n Yeah.

   "Once again, that assumes it wouldn't have happened via the democratic process.\n\n \"Once again\", NO. It DOES NOT assume that.\n In fact, I whole-heartedly acknowledge that some, if not all, of those reforms would have eventually happened on their own.\n \n The point is that it SHOULD NOT REQUIRE legislation to overturn it when the law or legal process is inherently UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n \n \nBut even so, if they system does not do things in a legitimate way then why even have the system in the first place? Result oriented thinking goes both ways and does backfire.\n\n Again with this XXXX?\n It IS NOT RESULT ORIENTED.\n I am not arguing from the goal and working backwards here.\n That's a lame accusation that does nothing but avoid the ACTUAL ARGUMENT proposed.\n \n Do you really want to argue the constitutionality of those issues in the court cases Steeeve? Because I don't think you do.\n I think you just want to throw out meaningless negative comments which avoid my point.\n \n \n \nUnder your thinking, we could have 5 whacko republicans on the bench who say being gay is unconstitutional and what would you say? Its not in the constitution? Hmm, you don't have any backbone to say that anymore once you make our system of government result oriented.\n\n Strawman at its worst.\n I am not arguing \"result oriented\". NOTHING I have done is about \"result oriented\".\n I think you may have confused me with Matthew. Either that, or there is no excuse for this obfuscation ploy of yours.",

The sky is falling...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Marriage WAS changed when interracial marriage laws were overturned.\n Deny it all you want, and stick to your modern perception all you want, but it WAS CHANGED.\n \n It was changed away from what the VAST MAJORITY of the public wanted, to something else. An overwhelming majority, over 70%, didn't like interracial marriage when it was overturned. (Numbers today against gay marriage are a little above 50%)\n It WAS changed. Changed away from a concept that had existed in our American thinking dating WAYYYY back to the founding of America.\n \n Does your analysis hold true for this \"change\" as well?\n Or am I about to here the typical response whereby from your perception it hasn't \"changed\" at all, and you ignore the fact that from the perception of the people at the time of the change, it most certainly did....\n \n \n \nIt basically IS abolishing it in a cultural sense, from what it's been defined as. That \"one iota\" we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.\n\n I love how it's an \"abolishment\", but the truth is that no existing marriage will be abolished.\n Traditional marriage will continue to exist. People's individual definitions of marriage, and what they recognize as marriage, will not really change.\n \n But we are \"abolishing\" marriage.\n You do such funny things with semantics, but you don't seem to realize that everybody can see the man behind the curtain...",
