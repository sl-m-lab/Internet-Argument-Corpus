   "This has been a debate going on for quite some time. The question is whether the Aryan Invasion Theory is fact of fiction.\n \n The Aryan Invasion Theory was first propagated by Max Mueller, a German Indologist. His theory was based upon the fact that Sanskrit, a language once prevalent in India, is very similar to numerous European languages. Therefore, it was thought that a common proto-indo-european language (PIE) existed, and from that stemmed the languages we know today. Mueller's most controversial assumption, though, was that this language came from south-eastern Europe. He then expanded this idea to claim that a Nomadic warrior race (Mueller originally said agricultural race, but changed it to fit his theory) called the Aryans invaded India, bringing the higly developed Vedic religion and culture to India. He made this assumption based on obscure passages from the Rig Veda which stated that a light force defeated a dark force. Mueller assumed that the light force was an indication of light skinned Aryans, and the dark force was the description of dark skinned \"dravidians.\" When confronted with counter-evidence, Mueller rebuked his statement partially, stating that he does not mean that the Aryans are light-skinned or came from Europe. (\"I have declared again and again that if I say Aryas, I mean neither blood nor bones, nor hair, nor skull; I mean simply those who speak an Aryan language...to me an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar.\")\n \n However, the damage had been done. The British used this concept to justify their invasion of India, and the German Nazis used this concept to justify their discrimination. And though the theory is based on little evidence, it remains in historical textbooks even today, and people across the globe are taught this theory.\n \n What is your belief? It is probably clear by my post that i disagree with the Aryan Inviasion Theory. I would like to know what other's think.",

   "The British used this concept to justify their invasion of India, ...\nCirca 1500? The European \"invasion\" (such as it was) was an attempt to secure trading posts to bypass the middlemen of the Middle East, and the British and French fought each other over the spoils.\n \n That said, I agree with you that the prehistoric wanderings of various tribal groups are of little significance today and are certainly no basis for prejudice or feelings of superiority.",

   "India in the 1500' was dominated by the Mughals, who came from central Asia, and were generally Islamic. Europeans during this time were limited to the coasts and trading piracy ( Portugese mostly). The Mughal Empire collapsed due to internal pressures, like the Marathas(sp) a group whose raiding caused alot of the internal economic collapse.\n \n The British came along in the late 1700's I believe as a major force. Who unlike the Mughals before them who kept most of the wealth in \"India\" took quite a bit back to Britain. India was the Crown Jewel in the British Empire and the source of much of its wealth during the time period",

   "Re: the original question\n \n I`m not really sure what to believe. While the Arians certainly did speak a form of indo-european language, judging from the texts historians have been able to uncover. However, that does not mean that they invaded or even migrated. As we haven`t been able to break the Harappan language, there is a distinct possibility that they also spoke an indo-european language. If they did, it is certainly possible that the Arians where an off-shot from the far more advanced and early Harappan civilisation. \n \n Did the Harpappans come from europe though? I really, really don`t think so. Perhaps the indo-europeans originally came from india though...",

   "\n However, the damage had been done. The British used this concept to justify their invasion of India, and the German Nazis used this concept to justify their discrimination. \n \n\n \n No such unmodified concept of Aryan superiority was used to justify the British \"invasion\" of India. What began as a commercial enterprise by \"merchant adventurers\" seeking to exploit, among other commodities, the spice crops of India, ended in its eventual absorption into the British Empire. This was achieved both by diplomacy and military conquest: motives of economic exploitation and political prestige were much more important than the \"poetic\" task of \"taking up the white man's burden\".\n \n British attitudes towards the Indian population may have been deplorable, but they should not be glibly coupled with Nazi forms of discrimination.",
