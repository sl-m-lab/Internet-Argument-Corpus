   "Darwinists are the authors of deceit and have pulled a masterful bait-and-switch on society. They have suckered a segment of the population into believing that evolution is true based on the simple fact that organisms have within their genome the ability to adapt to changing environments. \n \n For example, the artic fox's fur can change from a mid-summer brown to a pure winter white in just a matter of months. The Jamaican beetle's phenotype changes from yellow-green to orange depending on circumstance. Many spiders also have this morphological ability to show versatility and change colors. Likewise, lizard legs are adjustable on-the-fly according to the length of grass and type of terrain they're in. This stuff happens all over creation: fish can change colors, snakes have plastic/changeable jaw sizes that are dictated by diet. Mice teeth are quickly shaped and molded by diet. Guppies and tadpoles both have the ability to grow larger in the presence of predators. Some lizards, when dietary needs are scarce, can shrink up to 20% of their body size, including the elimination of bone. \n \n Each of these changes simply represents a genome's adaptability. Yet, evolutionists over the decades have mis-characterized many of these adaptive qualities as examples of Darwinian evolution, more specifically selectionist evolution: guppies, cichlids, peppered moths, flies, lizards. The reality is, this is just a wet fantasy of make-believe, compliments of the tooth fairy. But evolutionists have successfully extrapolated an organism's inherent genetic capabilities as evidence of radical, across-the-board changes that confirm Darwin's nutball hypothesis.\n \n The reality is, selection is a real entity, but it can only consolidate a population -- it cannot create one....it merely weeds out the rogue dysfunctional weeds amongst the flowers. And the reason for this is because variation inherently resides in the individual. Life is not selectionist, it does not rely on death of the unfit to change with the environment. Life was created miraculously to adapt to a changing environment.\n \n When God created the world, he could have made animals highly adapted to specific environments....but this would have disallowed them from being flexible at all. But instead, in His wisdom, He designed animals less specific to any one environment, yet highly adaptive to a wide-range of environments. Of course this is beautifully logical -- and indeed what we see around us.\n \n A quick glance at nature will tell you that animals live in harmony with their environment. They each evolve with each other: as the environment adjusts and changes, all the animals within that environment adjust and change right along with it. Likewise, simply by existing, animals help mold the environment that cradles them. There's a beautiful symbiotic relationship between the two and the environment works in concert with the genome, turning genes on or off so the organism can continue to survive and flourish.\n \n My premise is If the environment sticks around long enough, the changes will be heritable via an epigenetic, neo-lamarkian mechanism. \n \n Epigenetics has been hidden in the closet. Donald F. Corcoran, president and chief executive officer of MethylGene\n \n In the model of the heritable switch, a change in the environment sends a signal to each member of the population. This signal activates a genetic command in each individual to call up a preprogrammed subroutine, If the new environment does not last long, the population will revert to its previous state. But if the new environment persists for a long enough time, then even after the environment changes, the population will remain in its new state. The new state is carried into future generations, and to this extent is heritable. The heritability is, however not absolute. A different cue can make the population change again. But the longer the environmental cue lasts, the more nearly heritable the effect appears. Lee Spetner. Not By Chance\n \n But ultimately, there are limits to biological change, proven not only by the fossil record, but by molecular evidence as well:\n \n \n It is now well established that the pattern of diversity at a molecular level conforms to a highly ordered hierarchic system. Each class at a molecular level is unique, isolated and unlinked by intermediates. Thus molecules, like fossils have failed to provide the elusive intermediates so long sought by evolutionary biology. Again, the only relationships identified by this new technique are sisterly. At a molecular level, no organism is \"ancestral\" or \"primitive\" or \"advanced\" compared with its relatives. Nature seems to conform to the same non-evolutionary and intensely circumferential pattern that was long ago perceived by the great comparative anatomists of the nineteenth century. Michael Denton Evolution: A Theory in Crisis. Pg. 290\n \n But you evolutionists have brainwashed yourselves and others into believing that cats evolved from non-cats...that dogs evolved from non-dogs...that birds evolved from non-birds...that mammals evolved from non-mammals....that humans evolved from non-humans. And you've done it with the help of your atheist heros' chronic deception and distortion of facts and evidence. \n \n If you care to elevate your theory to something above the level of downright circus-clown laughable, I suggest you start providing some sort of proof to back up your ridiculous, outrageous claims. please answer me:\n \n \n 1) What did the bear replace?\n 2) What did the bat replace?\n 3) What did the elephant replace?\n 4) What did the human replace?\n 5) What did lions replace?\n 6) What did Hippopotami replace?\n 7) What did the ape replace?\n \n You may also present any of these animals' common ancestor bones as proof.\n .\n Please use this opportunity to present all these \"mountains\" of evidence that you supposedly have. I'll be waiting.",

   "Darwinists are the authors of deceit and have pulled a masterful bait-and-switch on society. [bold added for later]\n\n Yet rather than support his extraordinary claims with any defense that stands up to the slightest scrutiny, supersport once again spams us with another brand new thread saying the same thing that he's had refuted time and time again on countless forums...\n (No, seriously; do a search, both on this site and on others. I'm not kidding.)\n \n \nGuppies and tadpoles both have the ability to grow larger in the presence of predators.\n\n To show you how completely full of XXXX supersport is, here is a link to another board where supersport yakked on about plasticity in tadpoles while referencing a paper for \"support\" of his anti-Darwinian views. Turns out he got busted: the post was made by the author of the paper, who told supersport to stop mischaracterizing the paper. Yet, here he clearly talks about tadpoles again...\n Please, supersport, tell us more about deceit and bait-and-switch, would you?

All supersport has to do is tag some Biston betularia such that they can be identified individually, and move typica morphs to polluted areas and carbonaria to cleaner areas. If any individual changes form, supersport would be vindicated.\n supersport has been ignoring this proposal since its introduction.\n \n \nAnd you've done it with the help of your atheist heros' chronic deception and distortion of facts and evidence. \n\n Yes, those \"atheist\" Catholics sure are evil little anti-God hellions, aren't they?

Please show me an example of a peppered moth that changes from dark to light or light to dark. Peppered moths have been studied enough to know that individual moths do not change color when placed in a different environment.

Are you sick in the head, or can you just not read? Here is what I said:\n \n \n For example, the artic fox's fur can change from a mid-summer brown to a pure winter white in just a matter of months\n \n Here is what my link said:\n \n As summer begins, the arctic fox sheds its white coat for a brown one, perfect cover for summer. The change back to a winter coat occurs in September and October. By November the white winter coat is complete. Foxes of the blue coloring remain dark or charcoal colored all year but become a little lighter in winter\n \n here is what Pandion said:\n \n You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the \"blue morph\"\n \n Where exactly did I say a brown MORPH becomes pure white? Look at my quote again....it says \"the artic fox's fur can change from a mid-summer brown to a pure winter white in just a matter of months.\" I said nothing about a morph or a variety. I simply stated it could turn brown to white. And when it says this, \" By November the white winter coat is complete.\"....it implies that this process takes at least a couple months, at least from september.\n \n Get over it -- you lose.",

Doesn't help your case any.\n \nWho said \"ALL\" foxes turn white? Not me.....look at my quote, I said \"can.\" What's wrong with you?\nI am amazed at the speed at which you can back peddle. Rather than admit your ignorance, you now obfuscate by pretending that you knew about the two genotypes but chose to talk about only one by pretending that some arctic foxes \"can\" turn white. Actually, that's dismal ignorance. Some arctic foxes have no choice. It isn't that they \"can\" turn white, they are required by their genetic makeup to do so. Others can't because their genetic makeup prevents it. Still, even the blue morph molts the dark brown fur for a very light coat.\n \nAnd it doesn't take a matter of months for them to change from dark to light. I spent a year where I saw lots of these animals every day. Remind me to tell you about Archie, who lived under the C Battery mess hall.\nit takes months to get from July to december. besides, \"months\" can be 2 months.\nAs I remember, it didn't take two months. Maybe the year that I lived above the arctic circle was especially severe, but the molt didn't last even 2 months as I recall. We were amazed at how quickly the brown foxes disappeared and the white ones replaced them. But the amazing speed of your back peddling is noted.\n \nHow do you know? How do you know what causes the color change?\ntemperature, cold. do you doubt me?\nI doubt that you know. I think you are blowing it out your sphincter (yet again). I mentioned several possibilities. To be honest, I don't know which is the trigger. Moreover, I don't know of any studies that have shown a specific trigger. Maybe it is a combination.\n \nOn what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter if brought to Arizona?\ntemperature, cold. Tell me, if you took your dog to the arizona desert, do you think it would it would put on a winter's coat? If it had a winter's coat do you think it would keep it?\nThat's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?\n \nI suspect that the arctic fox wouldn't change in Arizona because it would die fairly quickly.\nIt might die simply because it may not know how to feed itself.\nRight. You mean that it would die because it wasn't adapted to the environment. Good call.\n \nIf that fox was kept in a zoo or other area in the desert so that it could be cared for, I'd bet you a million bucks the fur would turn brown/dark and never turn white again.\nAnd??? What is the question? So none of the conditions that I mentioned and maybe some that I didn't even have the knowledge to consider don't exist in a zoo. And yet, I have some doubts about the survival of an animal in +100 degree temperatures when it is adapted to an environment where 50 degrees is hot, and -30 is common.\n \nbut too bad science is too chicken to try such an experiment...we might know the answers to those things.\nAnd what would that prove? It would certainly show that an animal adapted to survival above the Arctic circle was not adapted to the Arizona desert. Maybe it would indicate that the environmental conditions necessary for the change aren't present in Arizona. How is that relevant to evolutionary theory?\n \nThat's why you don't find them much below the Arctic circle. Anyway, the change still isn't evolution.\nThat's my claim\nWhat's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.\n \n.....and my claim is that you guys use similar examples of similar phenomenon in different animals to claim evolution. see: lizards, cichlids, guppies.\nAlready debunked. I do notice that you have finally left off the peppered moth.\n \nDo you really doubt me when I tell you that all these show to evolve via phenotypic plasticity?\nYes.\n \nMust I prove myself again by digging up the links?\nYes. Hopefully they won't be the same links that have already been debunked.\n \nThen you expressed it very badly. You expressed as if the color change took months. It doesn't.\nnot important...trivial in fact. It probably depends how fast and how severe the weather changes.\nExactly. When I saw it, it happened quickly, as I recall, in less than a month.\n \nNo they haven't. In the case of the arctic fox it is the ability to change, that is inherited, that is subject to selection.\nthat is nothing but conjecture. Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?\nActually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.\n \nIt is simple, an arctic fox that is white in the winter and dark in the summer has differential reproductive success over one that remains the same color the year round.\nAnd if I grew wings I could fly over downtown Dallas and watch the Cowboys through the roof at Texas Stadium\nI accept your admission of defeat. What does your statement have to do with the discussion? Nothing. If a frog had wings it wouldn't bump its ass when it jumped (an old Texas expression). I didn't say \"if\". My statement was quite straight forward. Let me say it again. An arctic fox that is white in winter and dark in summer has differential reproductive success over one that remains the same color the year round.\n \n Either you can respond intelligently or you reveal yourself for a fool.\n \n....that would probably help me make quite popular, which would help me reproduce....however this trait has not arisen yet....why not?\nPlease stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory. How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack.\n \nSadly, you aren't intelligent enough to realize that anoles, guppies, and peppered moths are the same case. Please show me an example of a peppered moth that changes from dark to light or light to dark.\ndid that already in the other reply.\nNo, you didn't. You asserted your position without answering.",

You don't call that conjecture?\n \n  An arctic fox that is white in winter and dark in summer has differential reproductive success over one that remains the same color the year round.\n \n \n You are assuming that some arctic foxes do change while other don't -- or that historically some did and some didn't. You are insane.\n \n Finally you said this earlier:\n \n It isn't that they \"can\" turn white, they are required by their genetic makeup to do so. \n \n of which I will disprove here.\n \n http://www.oldandsold.com/articles32n/animals-23.shtml\n \n just read it real slow all the way through. Please notice it was written over 100 years ago before the liars took over in science. I'm sure you won't be able to identify the words that disprove your above sentence so I'll point them out for you.\n \n This is exemplified by the well-known experiment made considerably more than half a century ago by Sir John Richardson on an Arctic lemming - a small mouse-like rodent, which habitually turns white in winter, although dark-colored in summer. In this in-stance the little animal was kept in a comparatively warm room till winter was well advanced, when it was suddenly exposed to a lower temperature. In consequence of the conditions under which it had been kept, this lemming was still brown in midwinter, when it ought to have been white. As the result of its first night's exposure, the fur on the cheeks and a patch on each shoulder became completely white, and by the end of the first week the whole coat had turned white.\n \n and this little interesting tidbit...\n \n That the animal has no control over the change from brown to white in autumn seems to be proved by in-stances referred to by Capt. Barrett-Hamilton, \" in which variable hares transported from Scotland and from Irish mountains to southern and low-lying regions continued for some seasons to appear in the northern garb of snowy whiteness. This persistence of the habit of turning white, even in unsuitable conditions, together with the lateness of the moult, resulted frequently in the curious spectacle of a mountain hare running about in all its conspicuous Arctic livery under the bright rays of an April or May sun. After a few years such imported hares, or more probably their offspring, ceased to turn completely white, and the breed assumed the appearance of the ordinary hares of the southern locality to which they had been transported.\"\n \n I thought evolution took millions of years? I thought they HAD to turn colors because of their genetic code? I thought new traits, like staying brown all year (you DO admit staying brown all year in that new environment would be a beneficial trait -- yes?) would have to be selected?\n \n Your theory is pathetic.",

If he can make it seem like he's being attacked for his views not that his views are wrong, then he can win a form of moral victory. He fires a shotgun of attacks, hopes one sticks, and then keeps firing the same arguments. \n \n This is why creationists are intellectually dispised and placed at the bottom of the debate food chain.",

MacNeill is saying the same thing: punk eek countered the idea of necessary gradualism, and there were other small \"revolutions,\" but the basics are the same: random mutation, natural selection, Mendelian heredity, and population genetics. You probably don't want us to notice that MacNeill points out that evolutionary theory is alive and well. (Either that, or you didn't even read that much.

Again, though, pandion can probably set us straight.\n \nThe penis enters the female at the same location where the eggs come out. When the male ejaculates, the semen enters a small storage pouch inside the females abdomen, called a spermathecae. After mating, the female has about 100 eggs inside her and a pouch full of the male spermatozoa. When ready to deposit her eggs, she will perform a kind of self-fertilization. When she places an egg on the host-plant, as the egg is passing out of her ovipositor, it will pass this pouch. At that instant, one spermatozoa will fertilize the egg and determine its sex. When the egg is first placed on the leaf, it was fertilized less than a second before. [source]\n\n More to the point, though, is supersport's assertion that the butterflies are born (\"from the womb\") with the \"appropriate\" wings. It is quite clear that there are no wings until the adult stage.",

Although I did do some research on the life cycle of Malacosoma disstria Hiibner, and while that research did involve reproduction, it didn't involve peeking into their reproductive organs. Maybe it should have since the research turned out to be a bust, yielding no methods effectively interrupt the life cycle. However, my first reaction to a reference to the \"womb\" of a moth was a hearty laugh. I think that you are correct in equating the womb with the mammalian uterus. At least, that's what my Little Golden Dictionary tells me.",
