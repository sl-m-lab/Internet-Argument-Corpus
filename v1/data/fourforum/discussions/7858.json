So you're angling that since abortion isn't illegal now in Indian reservations--that we know of--anyone doing it in their jurisdiction is safe from prosecution?\n\n \n I don't know, I'm not a lawyer, just curious as I watch our civil rights crumble. Indian gambling casinos run 24/7 surrounded by states where casino gambling is illegal, yet residents of that state (and others) travel to and from the casinos without being accused of breaking a state law. \n \n What would be the difference of someone traveling to and from Mexico, a sovereign nation, for purposes of an abortion and to and from Indian sovereign lands for the same purpose? Abortion is fortunately still a states right, which should deny federal interstate commerce regulation as no federal law is being broken. \n \n I'm trying to understand the basis of the South Dakota AG's statement of Indian nation abortions being limited to Indians and can't make any sense of it. Roadblocks at Indian lands with all non-Indian females submitting to MRIs going in and, if pregnant going in, MRIs when exiting? Non-Indian MDs being refused licensing if they're employed on Indian lands where an abortion might take place? Maybe current administration will invade that Indian nation offering abortions by classifying abortions as potential WMDs to adjoining South Dakota?",
