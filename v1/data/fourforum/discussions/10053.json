Thus, only humans are supposed to act on behalf of others, even toward genetically unrelated individuals, without personal gain, at a cost to themselves. Studies investigating such behaviors in nonhuman primates, especially our close relative the chimpanzee, form an important contribution to this debate. \n \n This week in PLoS Biology, Felix Warneken and colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology present experimental evidence that chimpanzees act altruistically toward genetically unrelated conspecifics. In addition, in two comparative experiments, they found that both chimpanzees and human infants helped altruistically regardless of any expectation of reward, even when some effort was required, and even when the recipient was an unfamiliar individual-all features previously thought to be unique to humans. The evolutionary roots of human altruism may thus go deeper than previously thought, reaching as far back as the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. In a related article, Frans de Waal discusses the issues brought out by this discovery. \n \n ###\n Citation: Warneken F, Hare B, Melis AP, Hanus D, Tomasello M (2007) Spontaneous altruism by chimpanzees and young children.

   "So much for 'genetic altruism'\n\n \n Well not exactly. The article addresses some commonality in humans and chimps with regard to altruism exhibited toward chimpanzees who are not known to the chimp exhibiting the behavior. The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection. The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways. One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group. Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point.\n \n None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect. Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects!\n \n There is of course no reason at al that one cannot have kinship selection as well as other motivators for altruistic behavior. So its rather premature to take kinship selection (which I think is what WW means by genetic altruisim) off the table just yet.\n \n The article certainly does not draw the same conclusions as WW would have it do. Once more the rabbit hops over the actual work to his own preferred conclusion. SOP for the lagomorph.",

Silk*\n \n Do you hold the door for shoppers laden with packages? If you received two copies of the latest issue of Science in the mail, would you give the extra one to a colleague or throw it in the recycling bin? Do you make donations to charity, serve on departmental committees, recycle bottles, or donate blood? If you are like most people, you help in these sorts of situations and are motivated by empathy and concern for the welfare of others (1). Two reports by Melis et al. on page 1297 (2) and Warneken and Tomasello on page 1301 (3) of this week's issue contribute to understanding how we came to be such caring and cooperative creatures.\n \n Evolutionary theory predicts that altruistic interactions, which are costly to the actor and beneficial to the recipient, will be limited to kin or reciprocating partners. This precludes anonymous acts of altruism on behalf of strangers, such as giving blood, or large-scale cooperation, such as serving on committees. Cooperation is equally perplexing to economists whose theorems are based on the principle of maximizing profit and self-interest, not concern for the welfare of others. Evolutionary theory and economic models provide a comfortable fit for the behavior of other animals (4, 5), including other highly social and intelligent members of the primate order (6), but humans stand out as a puzzling anomaly (1).\n \n This raises two questions: Why do humans cooperate so much? And what limits the extent of cooperation in other animals? While evolutionary social scientists struggle with the first question, primatologists are beginning to tackle the second. Much of this work focuses on chimpanzees. Chimpanzees participate in a variety of collective activities in the wild, but we can't say much about the motives underlying cooperation or the factors that prevent them from cooperating more in the wild. So researchers have headed into the laboratory to probe the capacity and motivation for cooperation.\n \n To cooperate effectively, individuals must know what needs to be done and be willing to do it. Experimental efforts to induce nonhuman primates (capuchins, tamarins, and chimpanzees) to work together in joint tasks have met with mixed success. But it is not clear whether collaborative failures occurred because animals didn't understand how to solve the tasks (7) or because they were inhibited by the presence of competitors who monopolized the apparatus and appropriated rewards (8-10).\n \n Figure 1 Work with me. A female chimpanzee fishes for termites while her infant sits on her shoulders. Tolerance during feeding enhances the effectiveness for cooperation in joint tasks involving food rewards.\n \n CREDIT: WILLIAM C. MCGREW/CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, LINDA MARCHANT/MIAMI UNIVERSITY\n \n Two sets of experiments conducted by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany (2, 11) provide compelling evidence that chimpanzees collaborate effectively under appropriate conditions. In one set of experiments (11), bowls of food were attached to a platform outside the testing room. A rope was threaded through the platform so that it could be pulled forward only if two chimpanzees pulled on the ends of the rope at the same time. Pairs of chimpanzees that got along well in other settings quickly learned to solve this task together, but chimpanzees paired with less preferred partners were much less successful. The same apparatus was used in another set of experiments (2), but with one chimpanzee placed in the testing room and the other in an adjoining room. The chimpanzee in the testing room could admit the other by removing a key that locked the door between the two rooms. First, Melis and her colleagues manipulated the need for collaboration by varying the distance between the ends of the rope threaded through the platform. A chimp was more likely to recruit an assistant when the rope ends were too far apart to be pulled at the same time by one individual. Second, the chimps were allowed to choose between two potential collaborators who differed in their effectiveness in the task. Initially, the chimpanzees did not discriminate between the two assistants, but they came to show a strong preference for the more effective helper.\n \n Both of these experiments indicate that chimpanzees can work together effectively when they profit directly. But humans also provide help when they don't benefit themselves. Warneken and Tomasello suggest that human helpfulness emerges at infancy. The authors presented 18-month-old children with situations in which an adult was trying to perform an everyday task (e.g., reaching for a marker or stacking books). In control trials, no help was needed by the adult. On the majority of tasks, children were more likely to perform the appropriate act (respond to others' needs) when help was needed than in the control condition, and they did so without prompting. These data complement findings that by 15 months of age, infants have some understanding of others' mental states (12) and respond to others' distress (13).\n \n Warneken and Tomasello also presented three 3- to 4.5-year-old human-reared chimpanzee infants with similar tasks and scenarios. The chimpanzees regularly responded when tasks required reaching, but not in tasks that required other types of assistance, perhaps because they more readily grasped the intended goal in the reaching task than in the other tasks.\n \n Although it is tempting to conclude that the responses of human and chimpanzee infants in these experiments were motivated by empathy, other experiments suggest that chimpanzees are not consistently motivated by concern for the welfare of others. In experiments conducted by two independent research groups at three different research facilities, adult chimpanzees were offered the opportunity to provide rewards to others at no cost to themselves (14, 15). One chimpanzee (the actor) was offered a choice between two options: One option (A) delivered a food reward only to the actor, and the other (B) delivered a reward to the actor, as well as to a familiar group member. Experimenters also included a control condition in which the actor was offered the same options when no other chimpanzee was present. If chimpanzees were concerned about the welfare of others, they would prefer option A. If chimpanzees were indifferent about the welfare of others, they would choose between the two options at random. In both studies, actors were just as likely to choose option B when they were alone as they were when another chimpanzee was present.\n \n The chimpanzees' responses in these two sets of experiments were equivalent to flipping a coin to decide whether to toss out that extra copy of Science. Human children behave quite differently. When 3- to 5-year-olds were offered a choice between a sticker for themselves and a sticker for the experimenter, or just one sticker for themselves, they overwhelmingly chose the prosocial option (16).\n \n It's not clear why chimpanzee infants were helpful to humans, but older chimpanzees did not help other chimpanzees obtain food rewards even when there was no cost in doing so. These studies will no doubt fuel debate about which best captures the essence of chimpanzee cooperation. We can hope that the creative approach of the Leipzig research teams will inspire new experiments to address the arguments.\n \n References\n \n 1. E. Fehr, U. Fischbacher, Nature 425, 785 (2003).

Spencer agreed, with his, \"Survival of the fittest.\" They were both 'gentlemen of their times'.[See neo-conservatism and fascism as darwinian politics [social darwinism], a notion derived from Hobbes' materialialism and laissez-faire 'liberal' capitalist economics].\n",

Do you wish to tell me what \"This notion\" in the second paragraph refers to or do you not? \n\n \n **\n I'll tell you. It refers to the darwinian notion of \"competition\", derived, as stated, from hobbesian political philosophy [and his materialism] through laissez-faire capitalism [see Malthus], straight into darwinism,[through Darwin et al] and carried on to its latest modern 'reductio ad absurdum' by dawkinisian 'selfish genes'. That's what I referred to in the 2nd para as 'this notion'. Got it?\n If putting 2 paragraphs together confused you, then you should have quoted them together to show where your confusion came from. Saying that you did not \"for sake of brevity\", smells like an excuse. Quoting the one para as if it concerned something you had carried over fr0om the first, when it in fact made no mention of any such thing, was, in a word. dumb.

   "Prey tell us lagomorph what shared identity means? \n\n \n **\n \n 'Identity' is that phenomenon which is produced in a mind by self-recognition, self-awareness, meaning the ability to distinguish and evaluate degrees of sameness and difference between 'self', and 'other'. Self-identity tends to emphasize differences as an individual, while 'group' or 'shared' or 'collective' identity emphasizes 'sameness with' a few others, and 'difference from' wrt everything else. see below\n \n \n shared, i.e., \n \n \"collective identity \n The term collective identity is a sense of belonging to a group (the collective) that is so strong that a person who identifies with the group will dedicate his or her life to the group over individual identity: he or she will defend the views of the group and assume risks for the group, sometimes as great as loss of life. The cohesiveness of the collective goes beyond community, as the collective suffers the pain of grief from the loss of a member.\" (answers.com)\n \n Genes, as physical 'bits of stuff', do not determine either self-identity nor group identity. 'Identity' is not a physically/chemically determined phenomenon, azlthough the process of 'identification' hangs on sense perception, and evaluation of sense data, including chemical data, for significance. 'Significance', in this case, being 'identity'.\n \n \n\n Are you referring to kinship?\n\n \n **\n No. To the contrary, if by 'kinship' you are refering, as darwinists usually do, to genetic similarity.\n \n \n\n Or are you proposing that two organisms can have a single identity between them? Or are you claiming that two organisms can each have the same identity? Or what? Do they pass around the ego they share? Does the ego undergo superposition as in QM? Is the soul shared here? What the heck are you talking about?\n\n \n **\n See above. It's quite simple to understand once you drop your insistence upon the 'all or nothing' fallacy.\n \n Of course, if it were truly just a matter of shared chemicals, it would have to be a case of 'all or nothing', wouldn't it?
