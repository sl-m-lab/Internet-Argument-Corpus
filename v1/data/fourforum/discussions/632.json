Just think about it, there would be a major disinsentive for rape, and men that have problem with this type of thing would suddenly be fixed (no pun intended) forever. Besides, abortion mills would pretty much go out of business. If you ask me the good very much outweighs the bad.",

Such a perversion could be carried out without a functioning penis. For instance, a sicko could rape someone else with a broomstick. That is why I propose that the penalty for rape should be execution. Such defective beings forfeit their lives when they take something that is not their's, and can never be replaced.",

The time-wasting side of prison is not the problem it's the threat of moving to a notoriously dodgey system which includes the active threat of other, hostile, prisoners. At the end of the day people really only fear for their lives.",

True they are harsh but it shouldn't be a problem if your as law abiding as you're supposed to be. \n \n The law shouldn't be an \"eye for an eye\" system but quite simply a concrete code of conduct that should never be brocken.\n Besides think of the damage a single rape can cause; The victim will be psychologically scarred for life which will effect not only the victim but all the other people in their lives.\n I am NOT saying I want rapists to die, I'm saying that if we can wave the death sentence in their direction then they just won't commit anywhere near as many crimes now would they (if any at all)?",
