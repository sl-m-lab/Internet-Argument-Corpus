   "Click here to see the picture\n \n The act of being born again is actually an OLD TESTAMENT concept given to us by GOD HIMSELF. In Jeremiah 17:1,4 (documented below), GOD told HIS people that they sin as if evil laws were chiseled on their hearts. Because of their actions, they LOST their right to eternal happiness. Instead, they were going to be enslaved and burn forever (hell).\n \n Then in Jeremiah 31:31-33 (documented below), GOD says the day will come when HE will make a new contract with man. Because of that new contract, GOD'S laws are actually inscribed upon our hearts and always in our minds. That change was supposed to make us want to honor and obey HIM. If we do, HE will be our FATHER and we will be HIS Children.\n \n What GOD is telling us is that we ARE NOT HIS people/HIS children if we DO NOT obey HIS laws. I'll put it another way, you CAN NOT be saved if you DO NOT follow the laws. HE has inscribed HIS laws on your heart and put them in your minds. Those that DO NOT obey HIS laws are the children of the devil NOT the children of GOD. GOD'S children honor GOD and obey HIS laws just as a good son or daughter obeys and honors his earthly dad.\n \n By putting HIS laws in our minds, GOD created what we call our conscience. Our conscience is there to tell us to do what's right and remind us of the consequences of doing wrong. It's GOD'S way of making sure everyone is aware of GOD'S laws, so no one can say they DIDN'T know it was wrong.\n \n As young innocent children, we often disobeyed our parents. But as we got older our parents became less tolerant of our misbehaving and if we were lucky they punished us. In time, we learned it was better to obey our parents then to suffer the consequences.\n \n Unfortunately, GOD gave us a free will. HE doesn't punish us when we do wrong. HE lets us get away with murder here on earth even though we know it's wrong. In the end, GOD will punish those that disobey HIS laws. That concept was explained by Christ in Matthew 13:36-43 the Parable of the Weeds Explained (documented below).\n \n In Matthew 13:24-30 the parable of the weeds itself (also documented below), Christ taught us that the land owner told his slaves not to pull up the weeds because they might pull up some of the wheat along with the weeds. That message wasn't explained in Christ's explanation. I would not be surprised to learn someday that Matthew's version left out that part of the explanation. The point that is being made by that part of the parable is that GOD'S going to let both the evil and the good live out their lives and then judge them accordingly after their lives are over (harvest time).\n \n The other reason for not pulling the weeds in the parable is that some of the wheat might be mistaken for a weed and some weeds look like wheat plants. The same can be said for good and evil people. One person may start out life looking like an evil person but in time develop into someone GOD will be proud of. On the other hand, some people start out looking like a good person but in time the evil in them is exposed. So we are NOT suppose to judge others because we just might be making a BAD assumption and pull the wheat (punishing a good person) thinking it's a weed (thinking he or she is evil).\n \n GOD doesn't judge us until it's time to harvest the crop. What makes us think we are better at judging people than HE is? GOD'S telling us that when it's time to harvest the crop the truth can not be hidden anymore. HE will easily separate HIS children from the devil's evil children. Just as the land owner easily separated the wheat from the weeds at harvest time.\n \n Jeremiah 17:1,4\n \n ----------1 \"Judah's sin is engraved with an iron tool, inscribed with a flint point, on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars. 4 Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever.\"\n \n Jeremiah 31:31-33\n \n ----------31 \"The time is coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. 32 It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,\" declares the Lord. 33 \"This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time,\" declares the Lord. \"I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.\n \n Matthew 13:36-43 Parable of the Weeds Explained\n \n ----------36 Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" 37 He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. 38 The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom (GOD'S CHILDREN). The weeds are the sons of the evil one (the DEVIL'S CHILDREN), 39 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. 40 \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42 They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.\n \n Matthew 13:24-30 Parable of the Weeds\n \n ----------24 Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. 27 \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 28 \"'An enemy did this,' he replied.\"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 29 \"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\"",
