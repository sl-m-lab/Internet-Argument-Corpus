   "Really? How politically correct. I wonder why homosexuals make up around 2-3% of the general population and represent a huge percentage of pedophiles? Must just be coincidence...\n\n \n \n Studies show that there is no connection to homosexuality and child sexual abuse.\n \n \n Dr. Carole Jenny reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in only 2 of the 269 cases in which an adult molester could be identified, less than 1percent of the cases. (Jenny et al., 1994). \n \n Groth and Birnbaum (1978) found that none of the 175 adult males in their sample - all of whom were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child - had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. \n \n In one review of the scientific literature, noted authority Dr. A. Nicholas Groth wrote:\n \n \"Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). \n \n The heterosexual partner of a relative is more likely to sexually abuse children than someone who is gay.\n \n A 1994 study found that \"a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is 100 times greater than by someone who might be identified as a homosexual. (Carole Jenny et al., Are Children at Risk for Sexual Abuse by Homosexuals?; 94 Pediatrics 41; July 1994; study of 269 sexually abused children when an adult offender was identified.)\n \n A sexual abuser who molests a child of the same sex is usually not considered homosexual.\n \n Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259). \n \n \"It is meaningless to speak of fixated molesters in these terms - as heterosexual or homosexuals - they are attracted to children, not to men or women. (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978).\n \n ** Note: The term \"fixated molesters\" refers to adults exclusively attracted to children.\n \n The experts agree that there is no link to homosexuality and child abuse.\n \n The American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Child Psychiatrists and the Child Welfare League of America all have policy statements stating there is no correlation between homosexuality and child abuse.\n \n When asked about this question, the American Psychiatric Association wrote to the Senate stating: \"While we are all concerned by the issue of sexual abuse, there is no credible evidence that lesbians and gay men are more likely to commit such offenses than others. Gay men and lesbians do not pose any particular threat to youth and should not be singled out or discriminated against in any manner. \n \n SOURCES\n \n Jenny, C., Roesler, T. A., & Poyer, K. L.

   "I've wondered why there seems to be some predominance of male pedophiles and they usually prey on male children.\n .\n\n \n Men Account for Almost All Sexual Abuse of Children Cases\n \u00b7 An essay on adult sex offenders in the book Sexual Offending Against Children reported:\"It is widely believed that the vast majority of sexual abuse is perpetrated by males and that female sex offenders only account for a tiny proportion of offences. Indeed, with 3,000 adult male sex offenders in prison in England and Wales at any one time, the corresponding figure for female sex offenders is 12!\"[1]\n \n \u00b7 Kee MacFarlane, et al., writing in Sexual Abuse of Young Children: Evaluation and Treatment report:\"The large majority of sexual perpetrators appear to be males (Herman and Hirschman, 1981; Lindholm and Willey, 1983).\"[2]\n \n \u00b7 A report by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children states: \"In both clinical and non-clinical samples, the vast majority of offenders are male.\"[3]\n \n \u00b7 A study in the Journal of Sex Research states that \"pedophilia does not exist, or is extremely rare, in women.\"[4]\n \n \n \n \u00b7 According to the Journal of Child Psychiatry: \"It was commonly believed fifteen years ago that girls were abused in excess of boys in a ratio of about 9 to 1, but contemporary studies now indicate that the ratio of girls to boys abused has narrowed remarkably. . . . The majority of community studies suggest a . . . ratio . . . in the order of 2 to 4 girls to 1 boy.\"[5] Another study found that \"some authors now believe that boys may be sexually abused as commonly as girls (Groth, 1978; O'Brien, 1980).\"[6]\n \n \u00b7 A study of 457 male sex offenders against children in Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy found that \"approximately one-third of these sexual offenders directed their sexual activity against males.\"[7]\n \n Sexual Abuse of Boys is Underreported\n The actual percentage of child sexual abuse victims who are boys very likely exceeds the above estimates. Many researchers echo the view of the Journal of Child Psychiatry study, which refers to the \"under-reporting of the incidence and prevalence of sexual abuse in boys.\"[8]\n \n \u00b7 Dr. Robert Johnson, in Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality, reports: \"The vast majority of cases of male sexual molestation is not reported. As a result, these young men keep both the incidents and their feelings to themselves.\"[9]\n \n \u00b7 The Department of Justice report on child sexual exploitation explains why the percentage of boy victims is underestimated: \"Adolescent boy victims are highly likely to deny certain types of sexual activity. . . . They are embarrassed and ashamed of their behavior and rightfully believe that society will not understand their victimization. . . . No matter what the investigator does, most adolescent boys will deny they were victims.\"[10]\n \n \u00b7 The Journal of Child Psychiatry adds: \"Boys are usually encultured into an ethos where self-reliance, independence and sexual prowess are valued, while showing hurt or homosexuality are denigrated. . . . This may lead to powerful repression or deletion of the experience, with failure to report.\"[11]\n \n Homosexuals Comprise Less than 3 Percent of the Population\n \u00b7 Relying upon three large data sets: the General Social Survey, the National Health and Social Life Survey, and the U.S. census, a recent study in Demography estimates the number of exclusive male homosexuals in the general population at 2.5 percent, and the number of exclusive lesbians at 1.4 percent.[12]\n \n \u00b7 A study of the sexual behavior of men in the United States based on the National Survey of Men (a nationally representative sample comprised of 3,321 men aged twenty to thirty-nine, published in Family Planning Perspectives), found that \"2 percent of sexually active men aged twenty to thirty-nine . . . had had any same-gender sexual activity during the last ten years. Approximately 1 percent of the men (1.3 percent among whites and 0.2 percent among blacks) reported having had exclusively homosexual activity.[13]\n \n \u00b7 J. Gordon Muir, writing in The Wall Street Journal, discusses a number of studies that have found that homosexuals comprise between 1 to 3 percent of the population.[14]\n \n \u00b7 In a survey of studies on homosexuals in different populations, the Archives of Sexual Behavior reported a random sample of Hawaii State residents interviewed by telephone. The study found \"just about 3 percent of males and 1.2 percent of females as having engaged in same-sex or bisexual activity.\"[15] However, this relatively higher number is attributed to the fact that the study was not limited to exclusive homosexuals, but included all those who at some time in their lives engaged in same-sex activities.[16]\n \n Homosexual Pedophiles are Vastly Overrepresented in Child Sex Abuse Cases\n Homosexual pedophiles sexually molest children at a far greater rate compared to the percentage of homosexuals in the general population. A study in the Journal of Sex Research found, as we have noted above, that \"approximately one-third of [child sex offenders] had victimized boys and two-thirds had victimized girls.\" The authors then make a prescient observation: \"Interestingly, this ratio differs substantially from the ratio of gynephiles (men who erotically prefer physically mature females) to androphiles (men who erotically prefer physically mature males), which is at least 20 to 1.\"[17]\n \n In other words, although heterosexuals outnumber homosexuals by a ratio of at least 20 to 1, homosexual pedophiles commit about one-third of the total number of child sex offenses.\n \n Similarly, the Archives of Sexual Behavior also noted that homosexual pedophiles are significantly overrepresented in child sex offence cases:\n \n The best epidemiological evidence indicates that only 2 to 4 percent of men attracted to adults prefer men (ACSF Investigators, 1992; Billy et al.,1993; Fay et al.,1989; Johnson et al.,1992); in contrast, around 25 to 40 percent of men attracted to children prefer boys (Blanchard et al.,1999; Gebhard et al.,1965; Mohr et al.,1964). Thus, the rate of homosexual attraction is 6 to 20 times higher among pedophiles.\"[18]\n The stark imbalance between homosexual and heterosexual child molestationswas confirmed in the Archives of Sexual Behavior study itself, which divided 260 pedophile participants into three groups: \"152 heterosexual pedophiles (men with offenses or self-reported attractions involving girls only), 43 bisexual pedophiles (boys and girls), and 65 homosexual pedophiles (boys only).\"[19] In other words, 25 percent of the offenders were homosexual pedophiles--or 41 percent if those who molest girls as well as boys are included.\n \n Other studies report an unusually high percentage of child molestations by homosexual pedophiles:\n \n \u00b7 A study on pedophilia in the Psychiatric Journal of the University of Ottawa reported: \"According to the literature, findings of a two-to-one ratio of heterosexual to homosexual pedophiles have been documented.\"[20]\n \n \u00b7 The Journal of Sex Research reports a study that included \"199 offenders against female children and 96 offenders against male children. . . . This would indicate a proportional prevalence of 32 percent of homosexual offenders against children.\"[21]\n \n \u00b7 A study of male child sex offenders in Child Abuse and Neglect found that fourteen percent targeted only males, and a further 28 percent chose males as well as females as victims, thus indicating that 42 percent of male pedophiles engaged in homosexual molestation.[22]",

   "Jenny, Roesler, and Poyer (1994) examined the sexual orientation of the perpetrators of sexual molestation of 352 children at a child sexual abuse clinic. They found that the rate at which these children were abused by identified gay or lesbian people was 0 to 3.1% (95% confidence interval). Since this interval includes the most recent estimate of the prevalence of homosexuality in the adult population, 1 to 2%, the authors conclude that children are not particularly at risk from gays and lesbians.\n http://www.rtis.com/reg/bcs/pol/touchstone/april97/mueh.html\n ***************\n Ten Facts about Sexual Abuse of Boys and its Aftermath \n \n 1. Up to one out of six men report having had unwanted direct sexual contact with an older person by the age of 16. If we include non-contact sexual behavior, such as someone exposing him- or herself to a child, up to one in four men report boyhood sexual victimization. (1, 2) \n \n 2. On average, boys first experience sexual abuse at age 10. The age range at which boys are first abused, however, is from infancy to late adolescence. (1, 2)\n \n 3. Boys at greatest risk for sexual abuse are those living with neither or only one parent; those whose parents are separated, divorced, and/or remarried; those whose parents abuse alcohol or are involved in criminal behavior; and those who are disabled. (3)\n \n 4. Boys are most commonly abused by males (between 50 and 75%). However, it is difficult to estimate the extent of abuse by females, since abuse by women is often covert. Also, when a woman initiates sex with a boy he is likely to consider it a \"sexual initiation\" and deny that it was abusive, even though he may suffer significant trauma from the experience. (1)\n \n 5. A smaller proportion of sexually abused boys than sexually abused girls report sexual abuse to authorities. (3)\n \n 6. Common symptoms for sexually abused men include: guilt, anxiety, depression, interpersonal isolation, shame, low self-esteem, self-destructive behavior, post-traumatic stress reactions, poor body imagery, sleep disturbance, nightmares, anorexia or bulimia, relational and/or sexual dysfunction, and compulsive behavior like alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling, overeating, overspending, and sexual obsession or compulsion. (3, 4)\n \n 7. The vast majority (over 80%) of sexually abused boys never become adult perpetrators, while a majority of perpetrators (up to 80%) were themselves abused. (1)\n \n 8. There is no compelling evidence that sexual abuse fundamentally changes a boy's sexual orientation, but it may lead to confusion about sexual identity and is likely to affect how he relates in intimate situations. (3, 4)\n \n 9. Boys often feel physical sexual arousal during abuse even if they are repulsed by what is happening. (4)\n \n 10. Perpetrators tend to be males who consider themselves heterosexual (5, 6) and are most likely to be known but unrelated to the victims. (3)\n _________\n 1. Lisak, D, Hopper, J, Song, P (1996).

   "In a more recent study,2 researchers reviewed the medical charts of 352 children evaluated for sexual abuse in a Denver children's hospital. In 74 cases, the abuser was another child or adolescent, none of whom were identified as lesbian or gay. In 9 cases, the abuser could not be identified (e.g., each parent accused the other). In 269 cases, the child (219 girls & 50 boys) was abused by an adult. Both girls and boys were most likely to be abused by their fathers, stepfathers, or other men married to female relatives. Only 2 of these 269 abusers (less than 1%) were identified as gay or lesbian. The researchers concluded that \"most child abuse appears to be committed by situational child abusers who present themselves as heterosexuals.\" \n \n http://www.rtis.com/reg/bcs/pol/touchstone/april97/mueh.html",

Do your research before you post...try google.\n\n \n Well, I thought you would enlighten me. I thought wrong.\n \n Ok, so it looks like it used to be considered a psychological disorder. Then, because of it's classification as such, there were certain political/social ramifications. So officially, homosexuality has been taken off the list of disorders since it can't really be treated or cured (so it must not be a disorder right?). It is now labelled as a sexual orientation. It was always that, but it is a sexual orientation that is the result of a defect in the brain. \n http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~kripston/homosexuality/Psychology.html\n http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/h/ho/homosexuality_and_psychology.html#Declassification\n http://www.narth.com/docs/normalization.html\n This page talks about certain studies done on the brain to determine the biological origin of homosexuality.\n http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Ekripston/homosexuality/Biological.html\n \nLeVay first examined the hypothalamus of each subject without knowing the subject's sexual orientation. Upon comparison between sexual orientation and hypothalamus size, he found that on average the INAH 3 was two to three times smaller in homosexual men. LeVay suggested, \"Gay and straight men may differ in the central neuronal mechanisms that regulate sexual behavior. ... It is very likely that there are fewer neurons in INAH 3 of gay men (and women) than in straight men. To put an absurdly facile spin on it, gay men simply don't have the brain cells to be attracted to women\" (1991). \n\n An underdeveloped INAH-3 would seem to be a defect to me.\n At the very least, it's an abnormality.\n \n http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro01/web1/Rana.html\n http://www.freetobeme.com/r_biol.htm \n http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/boardwalk/7151/biobasis.html\n \n The last page made me realize that people see psychology something separate from biology (that may be a matter of opinion), so from now on I'll call it a \"neural defect.\"\n \n Someone defending pedophilia (bad english translation):\n http://pf03.wz.cz/en/text/opf.htm#bio\n \n http://www.narth.com/docs/bioresearch.html\n This one compares homosexual and pedophiliac childhood trauma.\n \nThe Prevalence of Sexual Abuse in the Childhoods of Homosexuals\n \n The self-serving explanation for homosexual distress, however, is undermined by what we now know about the terrible effects of childhood trauma on the emotional well-being of adults. Many studies demonstrate a sadly disproportionate extent of sexual abuse in the childhoods of homosexual men, suggesting at the least that both homosexual unhappiness and homosexuality itself derive from common causes, and that unhappiness is therefore an inherent accompaniment of homosexuality:\n \n From May 1989 through April 1990, 1,001 adult homosexual and bisexual men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics were interviewed regarding potentially abusive sexual contacts during childhood and adolescence. Thirty-seven percent of participants reported they had been encouraged or forced to have sexual contact before age 19 with an older or more powerful partner; 94 percent occurred with men. Median age of the participant at first contact was 10; median age difference between partners was 11 years. Fifty-one percent involved use of force; 33 percent involved anal sex. Black and Hispanic men were more likely than white men to report such sexual contact. Using developmentally based criteria to define sexual abuse, 93 percent of participants reporting sexual contact with an older or more powerful partner were classified as sexually abused. Our data suggest the risk of sexual abuse may be high among some male youth, and increased attention should be devoted to prevention as well as early identification and treatment.{17} \n \n The same is true for pedophiles:\n \n The association between perpetration of sexual abuse and the offender's own victimization as a child has been well documented in the literature. Various researchers have examined this relationship by assessing the exclusiveness of the sexual abuser's behavior, the gender of his victims and the gender of his own childhood abuser.... Subjects were 135 pedophiles ... who admitted to their offenses. A total of 42 percent of pedophiles ... reported being sexually victimized in their own childhoods .... [and] appear to choose their age-specific victims in accordance with the age of their own experience of sexual victimization. Although the cause of child molestation remains undetermined, these results support social-learning and modeling theories.{18} \n\n \n So 58% of pedophiles were not sexually abused as children and either 63% or 7% of homosexuals were not sexually abused as children (depending on how you read it.)\n \n So now, I feel informed.\n \n Now that I am informed, thanks to your suggestion, I have concluded that there is a biological basis for homosexuality (at least in men) and it is due to an underdeveloped INAH-3 in the brain. This is not the same as a psychological disorder as defined by psychologists, who changed the classification of homosexuality because of the negative ramifications of its classification as a disorder.\n \n I cannot find any information on the biological basis for pedophilia. \n \n So, you don't know where pedophilia comes from and neither do I.\n Apparently, most pedophiles were not molested themselves as children.\n \n \nPedophile is one misused word.\n \n Pedophiles are turned on by kids.\n \n Most people who rape kids are not, in the truest sense, pedophiles - they, like most rapists, are into power. Not picked cuz they think kids are hot, picked because the power dynamic is right (hot) for the perp.\n \n Both are bad for children.\n \n Neither are homosexuals.\n \n Quite diverting attention from the REAL issue.\n\n \n It may be a misused word, but I did not misuse it. \n I'm not asking about child rapists, I'm asking about people who are sexually attracted to children. Is it wrong for them to be this way? Should they try some counseling or therapy? \n \n .\n \n .",

A good stats guy can make the stats and research say anything he wants.\n \n In the study HealthyPeople 2010 it states that there is a high amount of alcohol use in gay men and lesbians. BUT think, where do you find gays and lesbians to survey them.....BARS. So of course there is alot of drinking.\n http://www.glma.org/policy/hp2010/PDF/Health_Communication.pdf\n \n If you want the study to say something all you need to do is ask the right people, in the right place, at the right time. You can make the research say anything. So of course NARTH will tell you one thing and the HRC will say something else. Reputable studies come from Universities or government studies or by people who have nothing to gain from the results.\n\n \n \n Hey, I learned about NARTH and Le Vey. I call that being informed. :)\n You said google and I did. ;)\n \n Ah! So basically what you are saying is that whether one considers homosexuality a disorder or not depends on their opinion of homosexuality.\n \n That sounds like the guy trying to defend pedophilia. Actually, I don't know if he was trying to defend it or just say \"it's natural\" (everything's natural). \n \n \n This guy thinks that pedophilia is wrong despite the conclusions drawn by another based on evolutionary psychology.\n http://www.evoyage.com/BillsEssays/pedophile.html\n \n Ah! This page says that pedophilia is a psychological disorder.\n http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/psychology/pedophiles/\n \nIt is important to understand the differences between pedophiles and molesters. Pedophilia, which is a psychological disorder, is a distinct sexual preference for pre-pubescent children. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 111-R), which is published by the American Psychological Association, supplies this definition of pedophilia: \"recurrent, intense, sexual urges and sexual arousing fantasies of at least six months duration involving sexual activity with a pre-pubescent child\" (DSM, V.3, 1987). Generally, this means the target of the fantasy will typically be less than 12 years old. Notice the definition does not require the person to actually engage in a sexual act. Pedophilia is a psychological disorder that does not require, and usually does not involve, a criminal act. The pedophile might keep his desires a secret. He may never go public or share his fantasies with anyone. At times, they will even marry a single mother to gain or continue access to her children. Pedophiles can be very determined and single-minded in their efforts to stay close to children. Maintaining access to children at all costs is one of the defining trademarks of pedophilia, which will be discussed later. Child molesters, however, can have many different motivations for their crimes. And those motives, surprisingly, are often not of a sexual origin.\n\n \n [I said that I wasn't trying to link homosexuality and pedophilia. Here I am merely comparing the two as far as they may be considered a disorder.]\n \n Homosexuality was taken off the list. Pedophilia is still on the list.\n Homosexuality is socially accepted (mostly). It is not considered a disorder. Pedophilia is not socially accepted and is still on the list. It is considered a disorder. Call me silly, but if we lived in a society where pedophilia was tolerable and mostly acceptable, it wouldn't be on the list.\n \n It gets down to \"what are the criteria for a psychological disorder?\" \n What does it take for something to be considered defective?\n \n http://cms.psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia.html\n Maybe the reason is that one is considered harmful (even though we have established that pedophiles are not the same as child molesters).\n \nWhile pedophilia is illegal and harmful to the victims, the offenders are apt to delude themselves into viewing their actions are beneficial to the children, i.e., they are contributing to the children's development or the children are enjoying the acts; however, they will be sure to tell the children not to alert their parents or authorities to the activities.\n\n Here they must be confused. As we have established, not all pedophiles become child molesters.\n \n\n The precise cause or causes of pedophilia (and other paraphilias) are not known. There is some evidence that pedophilia may run in families, but this could suggest either a genetic or a learned behavior effect.\n\n \n And they don't know the cause at all (just like homosexuality), but it is most definitely a disorder.\n \n \n \n Anyway, I think you may see what I'm getting at.\n You said that one study will say one thing while another study will say another. It all seems like a matter of opinion. Order/disorder is in the eye of the beholder. So when you say that homosexuality is not a disorder, that is merely an opinion. \n \n \n \n \n \n .",

   "One thing I can assure you, no doctor on earth would tell his clients that homosexuality is safe and healthy behavior due to the malpractice claims his advice would incur, and due to the fact that he could probably lose his license for wrongfully advising people about the dangers to their health.\n \n And thats not a mid 80's thing either...... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Just what is homosexual behavior? How is the behavior of my gay friend friend fixing his car different than when my straight friend fixes his car? \n \n Doctors might have something to say about sexual behavior, however. They will probably talk your ear off about unprotected sex and promiscuity. That's bad news for EVERYBODY, not just homosexuals.\n \n Guess what Jamaan!? I would be willing to bet there are even homosexual doctors out there.\n \n And, as typical with the anti-gay crowd, you fail to notice how lesbians have the lowest rate of AIDS and STDs. I mean, if safety is really the issue, maybe women should just love each other, get artificial insemination when it's time for kids, and all men should just abstain.\n \n Or maybe we cold just encourage safe sexual practices and not tell others who to screw. What seems most reasonable to you?",

   "It is not really an opinion. It is fact as we know it now. Mostly because as you stated before the attempts to cure it were causing more harm than good.\n\n So cancer isn't a disorder because the treatments usually do more harm than good. There are disorders and diseases with no treatment whatsoever. They are still considered disorders. \n \n\n But one study saying one thing and another saying another is not opinions. Research has carefully written guidleines, studies need to be replicated with the same findings for them to be fact. NARTH and other groups have failed to properly prove that homosexuality can be changed. In fact there is no concrete evidence that it can be change. Now the nay-sayers will say there is no evidence it can't be. BUT the burden of proof lies with them not us.\n\n Has anyone proven that pedophilia, (or other paraphilias) can be changed?\n What does that have to do with its classification as a disorder?\n It has nothing to do with it. Just because something can't be changed doesn't mean that the authoritative position of a government agency won't change. Why isn't the burden of proof set upon the APA when they classify other paraphilias as disorders?\n \n The findings of studies are not opinions, but classifying things as a disorder relies on a subjective determination of those findings. There is where the opinion lies. If 1% of the population is born with a condition where they can't pronounce the letter \"s\" or something like that, there may be nothing one can do for it. Studies on the \"problem\" may even find the source of it. There may be more harm than good from trying to treat it. But, depending on one's opinion, it may or may not be classified as a disorder. [There may be some that revel in no \"s\" pronunciation and see it as a great thing that should be celebrated. They may hold parades and rallies about not pronouncing \"s.\"] \n \n \n\n Pedophia on the other hand is curable or at least treatable through a combanation of drugs and therapy. Not all cases but there is concrete evidence of reform. Scientifically proven through scientific process. So it remains on the books as a disorder.\n \n What, are you joking me? There is \"concrete evidence\" of gay people turning straight. I'm sure NARTH or someone like that can provide numerous examples.\n That has nothing to do with it being considered a disorder. \n \n\n You do have to look at what you find when you google for research and statisitcs and look at who is presenting them, what they have to gain by swaying the results before determining that any one study is more prevalent than another.\n\n Exactly, when the APA took homosexuality off the list it was because of social pressure. They would gain relief from that social pressure by taking it off the list. The benefits of doing so outwieghed the detriments. Taking it off the list didn't mean that a lot of psychologists, even within the association, did not have the opinion that homosexuality is a disorder. \n \n One day, maybe they will take ADD off the DSM. Maybe they will stop calling it a disorder and start calling it an anxious orientation. \n \n \nHere is a link that explains that process more. They use alcohol as the subject but the stuff on research would be the same no matter what the subject is.\n\n I was going to bring up alcoholism eventually too. :) They have done the same with marijuana. Depending on which study you want to pay attention to, you can get whatever opinion, I mean conclusion, you want.\n \n \n\n This is exactly what groups like NARTH, Focus on Families and many others use to make one thing look like another.\n \n http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol-info/Controversies/1070552005.html\n\n \n \n You mean making non-normal (abnormal) behavior look like normal behavior?\n Like the APA did when they took homosexuality off the DSM?\n \n \n \n .",

   "Why do we need to keep looking back 30 years? Homosexuality was only put on the list of disorders originally because of political pressure. There was never any basis for calling it a disorder. Gay and lesbian people are happy with who they are, and they fucntion in society like anyone else. The only basis for calling it a disorder, would be failure to function heterosexually(heterosexuality being valued by many in society). If that's the case, vegetarianism could also be a disorder, for the vegetarian's failure to function carniverously(carniverous behaviour being valued by many in society).\n \n http://www.psych.org/public_info/homose~1.cfm\n \n Both sides of the debate had their chance to present their evidence during the debate 30 years ago. There was nothing convincing presented then, as to why homosexuality should be a disorder, and there has been nothing presented since that time, either. The political winds will always blow one way or another, but solid evidence can withstand that.\n \n I do not trust NARTH to tell me that reparative therapy works, anymore than I would trust the tobacco company to tell me that smoking is healthy.",

   "How does fantasizing about having sex with children and/or horses impair one's functionality?\n \n Why can't these people funtion in society? Thay have harmed no child or poor horse (or any farm animal). \n \n Yet, these people's \"condition\" is still on the DSM. Pedophilia and zoophilia are still considered paraphilia (abnormal sexual behavior).\n \n Do you have any info as to why homosexuality was originally lumped in with other abnormal sexual behaviors? Was it political or was it because homosexuality was not normal? When I say normal, I mean being within the norm. \n \n Don't you think that it was taken off the list because of political pressure?\n By being on the list, it made homosexuals \"crazy\" and they couldn't become doctors or psychologists, or something to that effect. There were social and political consequences of it being labelled a disorder. It limited people. The benefits of lifting that label outweighed any possible detriment. They realized that there was no way to change homosexuality and that it wasn't harmful to the individual or anyone else. It's presence on the list only created barriers for homosexuals. \n \n Homosexuality is \"ok\" in our society (even if you feel dumped upon) because it involves consentual adults. Our society does not grant the same level of consent to children or animals. The actions taken by those who would have sex with children or animals is not tolerated. Because of this, tendencies towards these acts are still considered psychological disorders.\n \n I will not budge from my position that what one (or even the APA) considers to be a disorder is an opinion. It will always be in the eye of the beholder.\n \n .",
