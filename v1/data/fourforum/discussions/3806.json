   "Why do gay rights activists and apologists often try to portray gay relationships in history or the Bible, which are not directly recorded as such?\n \n Instances:\n \n - The story of David and Johnathan in the Bible. There is never any mention of a gay relationship there. There is mention that Johnathan deeply loved David. Why is it that some would automatically assume that would be a homosexual thing? Is there no room in their thinking that this could be the love of a deep friendship? If something is not claimed to be such in the source, isn't it best to not read into the material what isn't there to begin with?\n \n - Homsexuality between Jesus and one or more disciples. Again, there is nothing mentioned here other than love. And here the gay activist case is even weaker, because the Greek word for love used is not eros, or romantic love. But more importantly, why would they want to read into the material something that isn't stated to begin with?\n \n - Alexander the Great. There is some evidence he may have been gay, but there is also plenty of evidence that he was not. So why the insistence among gay apologists that he has to be gay? It is also possible that records indicating he was gay were intended to be less than flattering to a male-centric world--i.e. anti-Alexander propaganda. Sort of like the way haters of George W. Bush might portray him in ways that would be unflattering to today's culture.\n \n - Egyptian Pharoahs. This is also a common claim, that one or more Pharoahs were gay. Of course this goes back so far in history that we could never be sure this is the case. Basing such a view on 3000 year-old hieroglyphics that could be interpreted different ways or printed for various reasons is awfully weak.\n \n To be fair, there are figures in history that obviously were gay, because they claimed they were or there are very reliable records that state it. However, the common estimate of the gay percentage in the population is usually stated as around 3%. With that rarity, it is generally going to be much safer to assume a historical character was not gay, unless explicitly stated.\n \n To me, this is more a matter of motivations. The question is, why would gay apologists want to try so hard to portray as many historical figures as they can to be gay without even strong evidence? In the case of political figures, it is probably because people generally like to see others in history like them. This is not good reason to misrepresent historical evidence, however. In the case of Biblical figures where there is basically zero evidence of homosexuality, the motivation nearly has to be much more sinister. Perhaps it is a way of trying to take what religious people hold dearest and demean it, out of spite and revenge. After all, it is no secret that many gay rights activists disdain many organized religious groups. One only needs to browse posts in gay rights forums to discover that.\n \n My desire would be to see people, rather than being revisionist, take the facts of history as we know them and base their understanding on them. This reckless tendency among some gay people to read homosexuality into historical figures without good evidence doesn't flatter them at all. It only indicates that some don't have room in their thinking for deep rooted love and friendship that is not sexual.",

Marriage has already been redefined over time. Marriage was originally based in gains of power/political and Money.

Why bother when their joining will get zero recognition? \n \n I've had many friends ask why my partner and I haven't had a \"commitment\" cerimony or the like. I tell them just that. I know I'm married, my partner knows she's married, but what does it mean when we have no protections for our family? What does it mean when we have to fight for every little scrap of respect? \n Sure it means a lot to us and this is why we keep it between ourselves. \n It's like saying I have a degree in some field but I have no documentation to prove it. I means nothing and is worth about as much. \n I know I did the course work, I know I went to class, I know I took out the college loans and paid the ever increasing intrest rates, but without that piece of paper I can't lay claim to it. \n The same goes for gay/lesbian couples who have made the commitment, who vow to stay together, who raise families, who pay the emotional costs, but when something happens have no say in the matter. \n I may have power of attorney for my wife, but I have to prove it at every turn. I can't just go into the intensive care unit and claim to be married to the patient. \n BUT YOU CAN! \n You can file joint tax returns and not be asked to \"prove\" your marriage to the IRS. I know when I was married we never were asked to provide proof of our marriage. It was simply assumed. \n We had many priveledges dotted upon us simply because we said \"we're married.\" Granted it was all true, but we were NEVER asked to show proof.",
