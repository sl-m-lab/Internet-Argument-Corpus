   "I hear ya Billsco.\n \n While I'm confident that Wayne himself will be cleared of wrong doing, I'm amazed that he was even anywhere near it to begin with.\n \n That said, I think the whole thing is BS. If he bet a million dollars on the SuperBowl in Las Vegas, it would be fine, but a bet placed with a friend is illegal. The laws on gambling are total hogwash IMHO.\n \n As for Janet betting 100,000 on football, BIG DEAL. I'd be willing to bet (LOL) that in terms of a percentage of income, I bet way more on football this year than Janet did. Between my fantasy football leagues, the odd bet here and there with friends, and the SuperBowl party, it's probably not even close.\n \n On top of that, people everywhere around the world bet money on sporting events every day, it's just not a big deal, unless of course, the gov't isn't getting it's cut of the action, then it is a big deal. \n \n The timing is pretty suspect too IMHO (pre Olympics).\n \n Waxy",
