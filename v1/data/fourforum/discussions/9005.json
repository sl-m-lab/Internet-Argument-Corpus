   "From \"An Atheist Manifesto\"\n by Sam Harris\n www.truthdig.com 12/7/05\n \n \nOne of the greatest challenges facing civilization in the 21st century is for human beings to learn to speak about their deepest personal concerns--about ethics, spiritual experience and the inevitability of human suffering--in ways that are not flagrantly irrational. Nothing stands in the way of this project more than the respect we accord religious faith. Incompatible religious doctrines have balkanized our world into separate moral communities--Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, etc.--and these divisions have become a continuous source of human conflict. Indeed, religion is as much a living spring of violence today as it was at any time in the past. The recent conflicts in Palestine (Jews versus Muslims), the Balkans (Orthodox Serbians versus Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians versus Bosnian and Albanian Muslims), Northern Ireland (Protestants versus Catholics), Kashmir (Muslims versus Hindus), Sudan (Muslims versus Christians and animists), Nigeria (Muslims versus Christians), Ethiopia and Eritrea (Muslims versus Christians), Sri Lanka (Sinhalese Buddhists versus Tamil Hindus), Indonesia (Muslims versus Timorese Christians), Iran and Iraq (Shiite versus Sunni Muslims), and the Caucasus (Orthodox Russians versus Chechen Muslims; Muslim Azerbaijanis versus Catholic and Orthodox Armenians) are merely a few cases in point. In these places religion has been the explicit cause of literally millions of deaths in the last 10 years. \n \n In a world riven by ignorance, only the atheist refuses to deny the obvious: Religious faith promotes human violence to an astonishing degree. Religion inspires violence in at least two senses: (1) People often kill other human beings because they believe that the creator of the universe wants them to do it (the inevitable psychopathic corollary being that the act will ensure them an eternity of happiness after death). Examples of this sort of behavior are practically innumerable, jihadist suicide bombing being the most prominent. (2) Larger numbers of people are inclined toward religious conflict simply because their religion constitutes the core of their moral identities. One of the enduring pathologies of human culture is the tendency to raise children to fear and demonize other human beings on the basis of religion. Many religious conflicts that seem driven by terrestrial concerns, therefore, are religious in origin. (Just ask the Irish.) \n \n \n",

Just needling your ribs a bit over silly semantics. emoticon_xhoho \n The guy's obviously done a lotta homework, and I applaud him for that and for taking his stance right out in front.\n I'm not atheist, but I agree that religion appears to be the source of 99% of world conflict. Not the only cause, mind you, but a major factor quite often, stated outright or not. As he pointed out, it invades one's moral fiber (and I just know someone's gonna take exception to the use of the word \"invade\" emoticon_xangel ) so deeply that nearly all decisions one makes are affected. This is fine in many ways. Religion has helped a lotta folks kick drugs, stop beating their wives, all sorts of good things. Never mind that they could've done those same things, or not done them as the case may be, had they just gathered the will to do (or stop doing) what needed doing: religion can be a good thing.\n But when our elected officials determine policy based on God, in whole or in part, there's bound to be conflict. The God concept is unique to each individual. Everyone has equal right; everyone's idea of It has equal validity as far as I'm concerned. But it's hopeless to ask someone to not base their morals on their religion, as the author rightly points out.\n All the rest of us can do is hope that their God wants to play nice.

In most religions (Islam and Christianity mainly come to mind), there are arguments for peaceful and generous behavior as well as arguements justifying violent, intolerant behavior in the name of the religion.

If that anger can be connected to a noble cause - the percieved defense of Islam in this case - all the better for their sense of pride and worth.\n \n In that sense, I agree that people often use religion as an excuse for actions that they would take anyway. However, I would argue that if there were no justifications in Islam for jihad and violence in the name of Allah and if it was a much more consistently peace-loving religion as, say, Budhism is, then fewer people would view violence as an acceptable means of resolving their conflict. I believe that holds true for other conflicts as well. Some religions are more easily distorted for violent purposes than others.\n \n As a side note, moral approaches need not be religious to be used as an excuse for violence.

I think part of the problem with this is that we are dealing in generalities, which is not good. Speaking for myself, I don't assume that there aren't cases where religion might indeed lead someone to cause violence. The problem as I see it is in assuming religion (in general) is bad because of this, or that it (in general) leads to violence. If one is going to use cases of violence coming out of religion (as in 9/11) as an argument against religion, then it's using the actions of a few to damn far more people in general.\n \n It reminds me of the safe-sex/STD debate. Assuming that because there are some cases of STDs in which people didn't use protection doesn't mean that we should make sex illegal, or even discourage it. Though right-wing people sometimes think sex in general is the problem, rather than having sex unsafely. Instead of condemning sex, we condemn unsafe sex and focus on the bad apples and educational efforts. In the same way, we shouldn't condemn religion in general because of these cases in religion. If one wants to condemn violent religion, I think that's fine, and I applaud such condemnation. It doesn't make sense to me however, for religion in the broader sense in general to be condemned because of it's bad apples.",

Perhaps we should state that it is those fixed unquestioneable ideologies (be they relgious or secular) that we should be most wary of. \n \n Most religions fall under that category - i.e. the category of fixed ideologies which do not leave room for thorough objective self-examination. Certain global ideologies do as well, such as Communism, hero worship (of Mao, Stalin, or more innocently - The Founding Fathers, ...), etc. To be honest, we could partly include certain staunchly accepted political ideas in that list as well - i.e. blind patriotism, the push for free trade and globalization at all costs, ...\n \n Mainly, I think that any system which teaches a people an ideology that cannot be questioned without serious physical or societal reprecussions is one that we should be wary of. Some are harmless and can indeed have many beneficial aspects. Others, such as extremist Islam, can influence people to violence. I suppose that we simply have to learn to look objectively at which ones are dangerous ideologies and try to find ways to nullify them, if possible.\n \nThe 19 men who crashed the planes on 9/11 were not hopeless and downtrodden.

The societies in the Middle East have seen their relative position in the world historically go from one of dominance to one of backwardness, with the West (Britain, etc.) dominating the region in various periods. I would say that Bin Laden's anger at US troup presence in Saudi Arabia, among other things, is an expression of anger of someone proud of his heritage that has a distorted exaggerated view of how the West is trodding on that heritage.",

However, much (though certainly not all) of Christianity from its beginnings through the middle ages well into the 17th or 18th centuries was spread through violence or coersion. I am mostly thinking of the forced conversion of most indigenous Central and South American peoples to Christianity and even of the conversion of many kingdoms of Europe by royal decree as opposed to people's choice. \n \n I certainly agree that Christianity was also spreading of its own accord. For example, I understand that many pagans were so impressed by the strength of faith of the early martyrs who died under Roman hands that they converted. Also, at the time, Christianity seemed to be one of the few religions that catered to the masses of exploited, powerless people. \n \n However, Christianity would never have spread as far as it had if not for violence and coersion. People are attached to their religions - from familiarity, attachment to tradition, etc. It is not very easy to make conversions from arguement alone.

The boundaries can become blurred, though, when the founders of such ideologies become the objects of veneration. I quote John Gittings in today's Guardian:\n \n The manufacturing of holy relics did not, it seems, die out in the Middle Ages.\n\n I hear that a new version of the cult of Mao is also on the rise in China. I don't fully understand it but many people seem to need some idealization of a protective benevolent authority over them and, if they don't get it in reality, they will invent it. Perhaps it simply makes it easier for them to live their lives under that protective mythical father figure. Otherwise, perhaps there is a lot of underconfidence in their own capabilities to think for themselves. I am still struggling to understand such trends.",

   "I would agree that, in the last couple of centuries, the spread in Christianity happened far more through missionaries than through violence or coersion. However, much (though certainly not all) of Christianity from its beginnings through the middle ages well into the 17th or 18th centuries was spread through violence or coersion. I am mostly thinking of the forced conversion of most indigenous Central and South American peoples to Christianity and even of the conversion of many kingdoms of Europe by royal decree as opposed to people's choice. \n\n \n I believe this trend was not a part of Christianity early on before Constantine, and in large part ceased due to the influences of the protestant reformation.

   "I believe this trend was not a part of Christianity early on before Constantine, and in large part ceased due to the influences of the protestant reformation. (though it took awhile for the change to take place.)\n\n Constantine seemed to be the first authority (and a grand one at that) to make Christianity an official religion - i.e. sanctioned and imposed by the state. I agree that there was spread in Christianity before that - mainly from the point I had made in my post that Christianity was one of the few religions that catered to the masses of exploited, powerless people. I understand that Christianity was thought of by the general populace as being a religion of \"women and slaves\" - i.e. those who are exploited and powerless. \n \n It is not certain how far Christianity would have spread if not for the intercession of state power. However, once state power came into play, including an eclesiastic heirarchy with power of their own, then the leaps and bounds by which it spread seemed mainly due to the imposition of that state power.\n \n You seemed to claim that such forced spread of Christianity seemed to stop with the Reformation. Though I would claim that politics and power were very much at play during the Reformation in determining which version of Christianity a particular populace would follow, I admit that I am not familiar with any protestant sect forcing its religion by violence on an non-Christian population. Is that your claim - i.e. that the protestant sects were not guilty of such forced conversion?",

Indeed there were places early on, like Geneva, where the Protestant church in the area held political power for awhile.

(In fact, such cases of forced Christianity still pop up from time to time with certain sects.) But from a general standpoint, it definitely changed the way religion and governments worked because one of the things being protested in Protestantism was the way the Church and government were so intertwined.\n \n One exception might be England where religious-colonialism stayed very much alive even after the split from RCs to form the CoE. But in many ways the CoE is only barely Protestant--it still held onto many aspects of it's Catholic roots.

   "The Spaniards, upon \"discovering\" a new island or encountering a new tribe of Natives, used to read allowed to them what came to be known as The Requirement:\n \n \nI implore you to recognize the Church as a lady and in the name of the Pope take the King as lord and obey his mandates. If you do not do it, I tell you that with the help of God I will enter powerfully against you all. I will make war everywhere and every way that I can. I will subject you to the yoke and obedience to the Church and to his majesty. I will take your women and children and make them slaves.\n ...The deaths and injuries that you will receive from here on wil be your own fault and not that of his majesty nor of the gentlemen that accompany me.\n\n \n When Columbus was attempting to sell Isabella on the wonders of the New World, he described the inhabitants as being \"of quick intelligence\", \"well-built\", and having \"very good customs\".\n Later, when he needed to justify his enslavement of them, they became \"stupid\", \"cruel\", and \"a people warlike and numerous, whose customs and religion are very different from ours.\"\n Which just goes to show that it's useful to think badly of people one has exploited, or plans to exploit. When the Spaniards were conquering Mexico City one man wrote, \"when the Christians were exhausted from war, God saw fit to send the Indians smallpox, and there was a great pestilence in the city.\"\n \n John Locke said that, \"in the beginning, all the world was America.\" I've always taken him to have meant that at one time, no one was aware of God, or God's beneficience to Man. But that's a whole 'nother argument, eh?\n \n But 40 or more years later the Pilgrims saw things in much the same way. The Governor of the Mass. Bay Colony wrote to a friend in England, in 1634:\n \n \nBut for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by the smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection....\n *italics mine\n \n The question of Native Americans, and the explanation for them, since the Bible contained no reference, was a large part of what led to the Protestant Reformation that began in the early 1500's. One reason that Massasoit, the Wampanoag \"chief\" who greeted the Plymouth settlers so warmly, was so nice was that Plague had wiped out so many in his village that he feared the Naragansetts to his west.\n Religious Colonialism is very much a part of what happened here in the Americas, and was by no means restricted to Europe. I could go on and on citing examples, from primary sources, of just how and what the Pilgims and early settlers thought about the Plague they'd unwittingly unleashed upon the Natives. It all points to the same thing: these are heathens and God is removing them ahead of us.",
