You can commnet on their form of government, for sure, but suggesting you should get rid of it is something entirely different.\n \n However, it is also true of what another poster said re: Bosnia's composition. It is not a nation in any historical sense. It is a modern construct. With three hostile competing ethno-religious groups, it is amazing it's lasted so long.",
