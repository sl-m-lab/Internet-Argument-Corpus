He states that \"Aids\" is very real.

American bio warfare and cancer research scientists used the SV-40 monkey virus, the feline leukemia virus, the mouse sarcoma virus and hundreds of other viruses. They cut out part of the DNA in these viruses and replaced it with RNA (which would have the effect of tricking the normal DNA processing of the body to work backwards!), then incubated these viruses together in monkey kidney tissue and human blood/fetal tissue to make the \"new\" virus(es) jump the species barrier and actually work in a backwards fashion when compared with any \"normal virus\". After which, the virus(es) was/were placed purposefully or accidentally into polio vaccines to be tested in humans in Zaire, and in experimental Hepatitis B vaccines to be tested in Zaire and in New York's gay population during the 1970's Hepatitis vaccine trials (Note: to this day, the FDA allows over 100 monkey viral contaminants in vaccines given to every man, woman and child in America.",

How could a supposedly black African heterosexual disease- that some scientists claim has been around for decades or centuries in Africa- suddenly transform itself into an exclusively white male homosexual disease in America, and at a time when AIDS was unknown in Africa? Is AIDS, in reality, a man-made disease originally produced by human experimentation or human error? Could the bio-engineering of dangerous viruses that preceded the \"gay plague\" be responsible for the origin of AIDS? In view of covert and unethical government-sponsored human radiation experiments that preceded AIDS, is it fair to blame gays, blacks and chimpanzees for a disease that could have been started by vaccine programs utilizing gays and blacks as guinea-pigs? These are historical issues that will never be considered by the media in the wake of the AIDS controversies surrounding \"The Reagans\" and \"Angels in America.\" However, there is strong evidence to suggest that HIV/AIDS is indeed a man-made disease, and it is time to \"rewrite history\" to include long-forgotten and suppressed facts about AIDS and its origin.",

Claims that these \"emerging viruses\" naturally evolved and then jumped species from ape to man seem grossly unfounded in light of the compelling evidence assembled in this extraordinary text. Alternatively, the possibility that these bizarre germs were laboratory creations, accidentally or intentionally transmitted via tainted hepatitis and smallpox vaccines in the U.S. and Africa - as numerous authorities have alleged - is investigated herein. This book reviews the numerous viral vaccine studies conducted simultaneously in New York City and Central West Africa by a narrow network of virologists working for major military-medical contractors under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Included is Dr. Robert Gallo, the notorious discoverer of the AIDS virus.

Indefensible disorders such as AIDS and HIV as well as conditions like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Persian Gulf War-Related Illnesses are the new epidemics of the Silicon Age. By comparison, the days of polio and small pox epidemics seem crudely forgiving when we consider that today's viral mutants repeatedly outsmart gains made in vaccine development. However, it seems the days of polio are still with us - not in the form of acute viral outbreaks of fever and paralysis - but in the uncharted data on the long-term effects from the simian (monkey) viral contaminated polio vaccines given to countless children and adults three decades ago. Even more, what other undetectable monkey viruses have been transmitted in the vaccine batches of late? These unanswered questions continue to resurface in today's research and still riddle retired scientist Ben Sweet. \"No one really knows if there are any dangers, but no scientist can definitively say there aren't any, that is what's scary,\"; says Sweet. As a senior research scientist for a major pharmaceutical company from 1959 to 1964, Dr. Sweet was one of those responsible for the research, development and field testing of the killed respiratory virus vaccine. Contaminated Polio Vaccines Scientific literature states that some polio vaccines given between 1955 and 1961 may have contained low-levels of live monkey viruses. As many as 26 of the simian contaminants were readily detected but still other viruses, like SV40 slipped past rigorous quality control testing procedures available at that time. The simian viruses were inadvertently introduced into the vaccine pool because the polio virus was grown in monkey (Rhesus, Patas, or Cynomolgus) kidney cells.",

   "The March 1999 \"Vaccines\" feature in Parenting magazine provided all propaganda one would expect from a subsidiary of Time, Inc. Time-Warner, Inc., the parent company, is a corporate member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Time's president, Richard D. Parsons, and the Editor-in-Chief of TIME, Norman Pearlstine, are longstanding CFR members. One CFR published policy objective is substantial worldwide depopulation including half of the current U.S. population being targeted. This population reduction program is largely funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Merck Fund, both financially and administratively linked to the Merck pharmaceutical company--the world's leading vaccine manufacturer. Parents were told by Parenting's \"science writer,\" and \"contributing editor,\" Jessica Snyder Sachs, that infant and childhood vaccines are nearly risk free. Unstated was the ongoing virtual holocaust of vaccine-induced injuries affecting our youth that is earning vast fortunes for Merck and other TIME's supporters while fulfilling their depopulation policy objectives. As a \"science writer,\" Ms. Sachs's article was grossly devoid of scientific evidence for her egregious claims. She wrote that, \"vaccines have saved countless children from death or permanent disabilities due to disease. . . .\" Yet, even for this generally accepted fallacy, no scientific support exists. Authorities have yet to produce one definitive \"risk/benefit analysis\" on any of the more than twenty currently recommended vaccines. Today, in fact, vaccines may be killing and maiming far more people than they are helping or saving. But you don't read that in TIME to save your children from the vaccine risks including the epidemics of chronic fatigue immune dysfunction (CFIDS), fibromyalgia, lupus, Guillean Barr\u0082, Crone's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, and other autoimmune related disorders besides autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity, and several vaccine-linked cancers including lymphoma, leukemia and sarcoma. Likewise Ms. Sachs neglected to mention the French government's recent moratorium on childhood hepatitis B vaccine due to documented links to neurological illness including multiple sclerosis (MS), or the class action lawsuits pending against oral polio vaccine makers, including Merck, who spread monkey cancer viruses (including SV40) now linked to human cancer epidemics.",

Where and when was it published? According to the CDC MMWR publication (two studies on file) more than 99 percent of such brain damage cases never get reported. So how \"intensive\" is the CDC's study of this vaccine related injury after all? Parents be forewarned. The vaccine industry perpetuates the greatest conflict of interest in earth's history. Pharmaceutical industrialists employ standard Machiavellian practice. They create the problems and then manufacture the solutions.

   "Henry Kissinger's most influential patrons as he worked his way up the ladder of success to become Nixon's \u00d2Deputy to the President for National Security, was Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, the son of Standard Oil, that is Exxon, heir John D. Rockefeller, Jr.The Rockefeller family's involvement in the medical industrial complex, health science research, and American politics is clearly important. Before World War II, major administration of medical research, or financing by federal agencies, had been generally opposed by America's scientific community. In fact, it was only during times of war that organizations like the NAS or the NRC received major funding. Both the NAS, established during the Civil War, and the NRC, set up during the First World War, were largely ignored in times of peace.Between 1900 and 1940, private foundations and universities financed most medical research. According to Paul Starr, author of The Social Transformation of American Medicine: The rise of a sovereign profession and the making of a vast industry, the most richly endowed research center, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was established in New York in 1902 and by 1928 had received from John D. Rockefeller $65 million in endowment funds. In contrast, as late as 1938, as little as $2.8 million in federal funding was budgeted for the entire U.S. Public Health Service. Therefore, it is easy to see that Rockefeller family investment in health science research predated, and far surpassed, even the federal government's.More than the New Deal, the Second World War created the greatest boom in federal government and private industry support for medical research. Prior to the war, American science and medicine was heavily influenced by German models. This precedent was bolstered during the 1930s when the Nazis purged Jewish scientists from German universities and biological laboratories. These changes, according to Starr, significantly altered the course of American health science and medicine. Many of Germany's most brilliant Jewish researchers emigrated to the United States just as the movement burgeoned to privatize war related biological and medical research.At this time, the Rockefeller led medical industrial complex was fully poised to influence, and take advantage of, Congress's first series of measures to promote cancer research and cancer control. In 1937, the new federal legislation authorized the establishment of the National Cancer Institute under the National Institutes of Health, and, for the first time, the Public Health Service to make grants to outside researchers. The Rockefellers exercised significant control over the outcomes of these grants and research efforts through the foundations they established.",

   "Ryan White, who died last year at the age of 18, put an appealing face on AIDS. His struggle against illness and discrimination won the hearts of Americans, including the famous and powerful, and helped in fostering tolerance for those with the dread disease. His story is inspiring in part because of media manipulation; it is an example of censorship in the service of myth-making. In 1984 Ryan White, then 13, was diagnosed as having \"AIDS\". He had been infected with HIV through Factor VIII, a blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia. It was assumed that HIV was the cause of his illness. In July of 1985 Ryan was barred from attending school in his home town, Kokomo, Indiana. The school authorities felt that the health risk for the other children would be too great. Over a year of legal battles ensued. Ryan finally established his right to attend school, but he was treated very badly by the other children, and his family encountered great hostility from the community. In the summer of 1987 Mrs. White moved her family to the small farming community of Cicero, Indiana, where they were welcomed by the residents and the school system. In August 1987 Ryan began taking AZT. On 3 March 1988 Ryan White testified before the White House AIDS Commission. \"I came face to face with death at 13 years old,\" but he decided \"to live a normal life.\" Many famous people befriended Ryan, including Michael Jackson, Elton John, Vice president Dan Quayle, Senator Edward Kennedy, President George Bush, and Donald Trump. A necessary part of Ryan's appeal was that he, like Kimberly Bergalis, was perceived as an \"innocent victim\". Unlike other people with AIDS, he had not broken the moral code with regard to drugs or sex, and the media affirmed his normality. For example, Richard Pearson wrote in The Washington Post: \"White also tried to live something of a normal life.... After moving to Cicero, he got a job at a skateboard store, earned a driver's license, and had a girl friend.\" \n Ryan White died on 8 April 1990. The causes of his death and the nature of his illness were the targets of censorship. \n Let me describe the sequence of events which led to the discovery that Ryan did not die of \"AIDS\" but rather of hemophilia aggravated by Factor VIII concentrate and AZT poisoning. Craig Schoonmaker, founder of Homosexuals Intransigent, told me he had heard over the radio and on television that Ryan White had been admitted to the hospital with uncontrolled internal bleeding. We followed the print media closely for several days, but could not find a single mention of bleeding. Then Ryan died, and not a single reference to bleeding could be found in the Associated Press, New York Times, or Washington Post obituaries. However, the Times story contained this curious passage: Ryan, a hemophiliac who contracted the virus through a blood transfusion, died of complications of AIDS in Riley Hospital for Children, said Dr. Martin Kleiman, the youth's physician. He would not elaborate. [Emphasis added. What this indicates is that censors intervened to prevent the print media and Ryan's doctor from mentioning bleeding. I related these things to Peter Duesberg, who was most interested. Duesberg in turn told molecular biology graduate student Bryan Ellison, who took the bull by the horns and contacted the Hemophilia Foundation of Indiana. The people there knew Ryan White very well, and confirmed that hemophilia itself was his major health problem and the cause of his death. In a jointly-written article Duesberg and Ellison give the following account: Hemophilia has always been a fatal condition. This has only been partly alleviated by recent medical advances. Not only are blood transfusions still frequently needed, but blood clotting factors used by hemophiliacs today are somewhat immunosuppressive themselves. Interestingly, the controlled epidemiological study of hemophiliacs, cited above, found evidence to support the idea that hemophilia may be an inherently immune-deficient condition on its own. In the case of Ryan White, now often cited as an example of an AIDS death, the Hemophilia Foundation of Indiana has confirmed that his death was due to such complications as liver failure and internal bleeding, conditions that typically result from hemophilia itself. Indeed, White already had a severe case of hemophilia, ultimately requiring clotting factor therapy every day. He also underwent daily AZT therapy, the dangers of which are reviewed below. \n In wartime this kind of censorship is not uncommon. For example, in 1917 Philips Price, the Russian correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, cabled the immensely important story of the March Revolution and the fall of the Romanov dynasty. The Guardian ran his story for one edition only, at which point the censor intervened, and there was a total blackout on these events in the United Kingdom. It is understandable, if regrettable, that censorship would be applied to coverage of a revolution, but it is disconcerting to find such censorship applied to public health issues. What public interest is served by covering up the fact that a hemophiliac died of hemophilia?",

   "The Ottawa Citizen 7 Sept. 1999 \n A growing number of HIV-positive mothers in Canada and the United States are going into hiding as part of an \"underground railroad\" to avoid having their children treated with anti-AIDS drugs. Some of the Canadian women, concerned that child-protection agencies will take away their babies, are fleeing to the U.S. to remain anonymous and stay beyond the reach of doctors. The development is part of a recent trend that is infuriating the country's leading AIDS doctors and researchers. A group of U.S.-based dissident scientists has argued for years that HIV is not the cause of AIDS and there's no point in taking the drug cocktails designed to prevent the virus from turning into AIDS. They argue the side effects of the drugs are so severe that they pose a greater risk to the patient than HIV itself. Montreal doctor Mark Wainberg, president of the International AIDS Society, dismisses the dissidents as \"fringe people\" who are trying to \"make themselves out to be more important than they are.\" He wishes people would just ignore them so their views aren't given credence. \"Let me give you an example. There are people out there who deny that the Holocaust happened. Do we want to give them equal credibility?\" Nonetheless, it appears the message is getting out, despite the best efforts of the medical community to persuade people with HIV that the anti-viral drugs offer the best, if not the only hope, of staying healthy.",

   "AIDS in Africa: lies and deceptions \n Today, in Africa and other so-called third world countries, the AIDS nightmare is continuing and growing more frightening as each day goes by. Not because of any viral pandemic, sweeping across the plains of Africa, but because of an orchestrated pandemic of lies and deceit, sweeping across the globe via a Western-controlled media campaign. In actual fact, it is pre-existing illnesses (the majority of which could be treated relatively easily and cheaply, but which are not) which are now accounting for so much of these spiralling conventional AIDS death statistics. The World Health Organisation, World Bank, UNAIDS, associated UN organisations, the pharmaceutical giants and related media colleagues etc., are manipulating the current AIDS 'epidemic' in order to continue with their scare-mongering AIDS DEATH HEADLINES. More shamefully, these organisations are now colluding in the delivery of toxic drugs into Africa and other so-called third world countries, with the express intent of using these drugs as a form of population control in the recipient nations. The World Bank and the IMF are granting loans to HIPC's (heavily indebted poor countries) only if they agree to spend a considerable proportion of that loan on combating AIDS...

   "While most people in the U.S. and Western Europe go right on believing that the so-called Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] is the sole cause of AIDS, debate rages even within the alternative AIDS community over whether HIV exists at all. Though Peter Duesberg, Ph.D. -- virtually the only alternative AIDS theorist with any significant public reputation -- continues to insist that HIV exists but is harmless, other alternative AIDS researchers and activists are coming to the conclusion that the virus doesn't exist. The main proponents of this view are Australian researcher Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos and her colleagues, who argue that HIV has never been isolated according to the Pasteur Institute criteria of 1973, and therefore it's probably what's called an \"endogenous retrovirus\" -- a creation of the body's own genetic material that looks and functions partly like a virus, but is not an infection because it comes from the body's own cells. Stefan Lanka, Ph.D. takes the challenge to HIV's existence even further. A German researcher, Dr. Lanka is usually referred to as a virologist. But that hardly begins to describe his wide-ranging fields of study. Based on experiences in marine biology, biochemistry, evolutionary biology and virology, he's worked out a whole new view of HIV and AIDS. He believes that all so-called retroviruses are actually the body's own creations; that hepatitis is an autoimmune disorder (a disease in which the body is attacked by components of its own immune system) rather than a viral disease; that AIDS has nothing to do with immune suppression; and that it should really be called Acquired Energy Deficiency Syndrome -- AEDS -- because its true cause is a breakdown in the delivery of oxygen to the blood and/or body tissues.",

   "Such myths about the sexual excesses of Africans are old ones. \n Early European travelers returned from Africa bringing tales of black men allegedly performing carnal athletic feats with black women who were themselves sexually insatiable. The affront to Victorian sensibilities was cited alongside tribal conflicts and other \"uncivilized\" behavior to justify the need for colonial social control. Today, AIDS researchers have added new, undocumented twists to an old repertoire: stories of Zairians who rub monkey's blood into cuts as an aphrodisiac; claims that ulcerated genitals are becoming widespread; and urban folklore about philandering East African truck drivers who get HIV from prostitutes and then infect their wives. The World Health Organization claims that 10 million HIV-positive Africans are responsible for 300,000 cases of AIDS reported since 1981. On the face of it this seems to be a catastrophe. Unlike in developed countries, where over 90 percent of AIDS cases are homosexual males, intravenous drug users and blood transfusion recipients, African AIDS is supposedly suffered by men and women in equal numbers who contract it, presumably from heterosexual intercourse. The African figures are often cited by the AIDS establishment and safe sex activists in Europe and the United States to prove that \"everyone\" is at risk. BUT INCREASINGLY, discrepancies about the dynamics of HIV transmission, skepticism about what really causes AIDS and mounting evidence of imprecise medical diagnoses are stirring up a backlash among African scientists. They argue that in Africa AIDS is not a contagious epidemic linked to sexual habits but is the new name for old diseases that result from inadequate health care, widespread malnutrition, endemic infections and unsanitary water supplies. Dr. Richard Chirimuuta of Zimbabwe notes sarcastically that in order to have one-third of the sexually active adults in some central and east African countries infected with AIDS, \"life in these countries must be one endless orgy.\" A growing number of African physicians including Dr. Mark Mattah (Midland Center for Neurology in England), Dr. Sam Okware (former director of AIDS research in Uganda) and Dr. P.A.K. Addy (director of clinical microbiology in Kumasi, Ghana) say they think the panic over the heterosexual transmission of AIDS may be a hoax. Dr. Felix Konotey-Ahulu, a Ghanaian physician at London's Cromwell Hospital, toured Africa countries a few years ago to assess the \"epidemic.\" In a scathing report for Lancet, Dr. Konotey-Ahulu asked, \"If tens of thousands are dying from AIDS (and Africans do not cremate their dead), where are the graves?\" Some Western scientists, including Dr. Luc Montagnier, the French virologist who discovered HIV, claim that the practice of female circumcision facilitates the spread of AIDS. How do they explain the fact that Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sudan, where female circumcision is the most widespread, are among the countries with the lowest incidence of AIDS? In fact, there is little evidence to support Western perceptions of African sexual promiscuity. Widespread modesty codes for women, whose sexuality is considered a gift to be used for procreation, make many African societies seem chaste compared to the West. The Somalis, Afars, Oromos and Amharas of northeast Africa think that public displays of sexual feelings demean a woman's \"gift,\" so that sexual contacts are restricted to ceremonial touching or dancing. Initial sexual relationships are geared to the beginnings of making a family. The notion of \"boyfriends\" and \"girlfriends,\" virtually universal in the West, has no parallel in most traditional African cultures. No one has ever shown that people in Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Kenya-the so-called \"AIDS belt\"-are more active sexually than people in Nigeria, which has reported only 722 AIDS cases out of a population of 100 million, or Cameroon, which reported 2,870 cases in 20 million. Scientists dismiss the notion that males from any continent or region are more addicted to sex than those from another because testosterone levels, the measure of sexual vigor in men, never vary more than a tiny fraction of a percent anywhere in the world.",

   "WHAT IF HIV DOES NOT EXIST?\n By Colman Jones\n Now 21-27 Nov. 1996\n If shocking claims by renegade researchers are true, current anti-AIDS strategy is fatally misdirected\n London, Ontario - After years spent wading through the minutiae of AIDS science, I now find myself very close to believing the truly astounding - that the virus known as HIV, which has sucked up billions of our research dollars and tied up laboratories the world over, does not exist. This possibility - devastating in its implications - came to me here in London, courtesy of a number of mind-blowing interviews with renegade scientists who believe that HIV is not really a microbiological entity but merely a collection of signals caused by stresses on the immune system. If this is true, every assumption about AIDS testing and treatment gets thrown to the wind. \"HIV is a metaphor for a lot of quasi-related phenomena,\" says Val Turner, an AIDS analyst and senior consultant in emergency medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital in Perth, Australia. \"No one has ever proved its existence as a virus.\" \n Most HIV specialists consider this theory out-and-out heresy. I can hear the indignation in their voices when I query them. \"It can't be questioned,\" insists an incredulous Stanley Weiss, director of the division of infectious disease epidemiology at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark and a leading AIDS researcher. \"The data is out there. \"Multiple laboratories across the world using somewhat different techniques, different approaches, different specimens, have come up with essentially the same result, which is as strong as you get in terms of causal linkage in science,\" he tells me.",

Otherwise there would be no more gifts, just as there are no gifts to any of the 30 odd colleges in the United States that don' t use therapies based on drugs. \"Harvard, with its well-publicized medical school, has received $8,764,433 of Rockefeller's Drug Trust money, Yale got $7 ,927,800, Johns Hopkins $10,418,531, Washington University in St. Louis $2,842,132, New York's Columbia University $5,424,371, Cornell University $1,709,072, ete., etc.\" And while \"giving away\" those huge sums to drug-propagandizing colleges, the Rockefeller interests were growing to a world-wide web that no one could entirely explore.Already well over 30 years ago it was large enough for Bealle to demonstrate that the Rockefeller interests had created, built up and developed the most far reaching industrial empire ever conceived in the mind of man. Standard Oil was of course the foundation upon which all of the other Rockefeller industries have been built. The story of Old John D., as ruthless an industrial pirate as ever came down the pike, is well known, but is being today conveniently ignored. The keystone of this mammoth industrial empire was the Chase NationaI Bank, now renamed the Chase Manhattan Bank. Not the least of its holdings are in the drug business.

   "The fact that most of the 12,000 separate drug items on the market are harmful is of no concem to the Drug Trust... THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION Back To Top The Rockefeller Foundation was first set up in 1904 and called the General Education Fund. An organization called the Rockefeller Foundation, ostensibly to supplement the General Education Fund, was formed in 1910 and through long finagling and lots of Rockefeller money got the New York legislature to issue a charter on May 14, 1913. It is therefore not surprising that the House of Rockefeller has had its own \"nominees\" planted in all Federal agencies that have to do with health.So the stage was set for the \"education\" of the American public, with a view to turning it into a population of drug and medico dependents, with the early help of the parents and the schools, then with direct advertising and, last but not least, the influence the advertising revenues had on the media-makers. A compilation of the magazine Advertising Age showed that as far back as 1948 the larger companies in America spent for advertising the sum total of $1,104,224,374, when the dollar was still worth a dollar and not half a zloty.Of this staggering sum the interlocking Rockefeller-Morgan interests (gone over entirely to Rockefeller after Morgan' s death) controlled about 80 percent, and utilized it to manipulate public information on health and drug matters - then and even more recklessly now. CENSORSHIP Back To Top \"Even the most independent newspapers are dependent on their press associations for their national news,\" Bealle pointed out, \"and there is no reason for a news editor to suspect that a story coming over the wires of the Associated Press, the United Press or the International News Service is censored when it concerns health matters.",

It was thus easy for the Rockefeller Trust to persuade the Associated Press Science Editor to adopt a policy which would not permit any medical news to clear that is not approved by the Drug Trust \"expert\", and this censor is not going to approve any item that can in any way hurt the sale of drugs. This accounts to this day for the many fake stories of serums and medical cures and just-around-the-corner breakthrough victories over cancer, AIDS, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, which go out brazenly over the wires to all daily newspapers in America and abroad. Emanuel M. Josephson, M.D., whom the Drug Trust has been unable to intimidate despite many attempts, pointed out that the National Association of Science Writers was \"persuaded\" to adopt as part of its code of ethics the following chestnut: \"Science editors are incapable of judging the facts of phenomena involved in medical and scientific discovery.",

One single censor decreed NO and SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENT sank in silence. Thus newspapers continue to be fed with propaganda about drugs and their alleged value, although according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1.5 million people landed in hospitals in 1978 because of medication side effects in the U.S. alone, and despite recurrent statements by intelligent and courageous medical men that most pharmaceutical items on sale are useless at best, but more often harmful or deadly in the long run.",

Confronted with goverment buIletins to the contrary, the medicos wiggled out of that one by declaring that these standard publications were outdated!\" In addition to the FDA, Bealle listed the following agencies having to do with \"health\" - i.e., with the health of the Drug Trust to the detriment of the citizens - as being dependent on Rockefeller: U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Veterans Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Surgeon General of the Air Force, Army Surgeon General' s Office, Navy Bureau of Medicine & Surgery, National Health Research Institute, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences.The National Academy of Sciences in Washington is considered the all-wise body which investigates everything under the sun, especially in the field of health, and gives to a palpitating public the last word in that science. To the important post at the head of this agency, the Drug Trust had one of their own appointed. He was none other than Alfred N.

AMERICA'S MEDICO-DRUG CARTEL Back To Top The medico-drug cartel was summed up by J.W Hodge, M.D., of Niagara Falls, N.Y., in these words: \"The medical monopoly or medical trust, euphemistically called the American Medical Association, is not merely the meanest monopoly ever organized, but the most arrogant, dangerous and despotic organisation which ever managed a free people in this or any other age.",

   "THE PURCHASE OF PUBLIC OPINION In the following years, not only newsmen, but whole newspapers were bought, financed or founded with Rockefeller money. So Time Magazine, which Henry Luce started in 1923, had been taken over by J.P. Morgan when the magazine got into fInancial difficulties. When Morgan died and his financial empire crumbled, the House of Rockefeller wasted no time in taking over this lush editorial plum also, together with its sisters Fortune and Life, and built for them an expensive 14-story home of their own in Rockefeller Center - the Time & Life Building. Rockefeller was also co-owner of Time's \"rival\" magazine, Newsweek, which had been established in the early days of the New Deal with money put up by Rockefeller, Vincent Astor, the Harrimann family and other members and allies of the House.",

   "ROCKEFELLER AND MASS MURDER \n The Rockefeller Foundation is the prime sponsor of public relations for the United Nations' drastic depopulation program. Evidence in the possession of a growing number of researchers in America, England, and Germany demonstrates that the Foundation and its corporate, medical, and political associates organized the racial mass murder program of Nazi Germany. \n These globalists, who function as a conduit for British Empire geopolitics, were not stopped after World War II. This United Nations alliance of the old Nazi right, with the new left, poses an even graver danger to the world today than it did in 1941. Oil monopolist John D. Rockefeller created the family-run Rockefeller Foundation in 1909. By 1929 he had placed $300 million worth of the family's controlling interest in the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now called ``Exxon'') to the account of the Foundation. The Foundation's money created the medical specialty known as Psychiatric Genetics. For the new experimental field, the Foundation reorganized medical teaching in Germany, creating and thenceforth continuously directing the ``Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry'' and the ``Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity.'' The Rockefellers' chief executive of these institutions was the fascist Swiss psychiatrist Ernst Rudin, assisted by his proteges Otmar Verschuer and Franz J. Kallmann. \n In 1932, the British-led ``Eugenics'' movement designated the Rockefellers' Dr. Rudin as the president of the worldwide Eugenics Federation. The movement called for the killing or sterilization of people whose heredity made them a public burden.",

   "DR. Gallo and others defend that the HIV's, slow acting lentiviruses, similar to the SIV's, differ too much from the viruses that the NCI and DOD scientists were recombining during the 1960s and early 1970s to be related. Again, not so. Under the old taxonomy (based on electron microscopic appearance) the HIVs were classified as 'type-C' oncornaviruses like those they were studying. And as far as their DNA sequences are concerned, Gallo falsely argued during a recent interview, that the DNA in HIV is too dissimilar from the DNA in viruses he had previously studied to implicate him. According to other experts, however, the viruses are similar enough. Moreover, Gallo himself published DNA sequence similarities between HIV and his earlier alleged 1970s discovery of the HTLV-1 - the first leukemia virus.\n Moreover, beginning in the late 1950s, risky vaccine experiments took place in which numerous monkey virus contaminants were transmitted through experimental and production vaccines to human populations. This could have easily led to the development of SIV and HIV relatives in infected monkeys and humans. Then, when blood was taken from these primates, to infuse elsewhere or develop additional vaccines, then new recombinants would be expected and subsequently transmitted. DR Gallo theory is additionally supported by the recent announcement of University of Kansas Medical Center researcher Bill Narayan who, with help from Gallo's colleague Max Essex at Harvard, was able to produce an AIDS-like illness in monkeys using a hybrid of HIV-1. Narayan reported combining the core of the monkey virus and the outer coating of the human AIDS virus.21 This, Narayan said, offered new hope for the development of a vaccine. Under scrutiny, however, the announcement appeared to be more supportive to Narayan's $1.6 million grant awarded by the NIH. When HIV-2, co-discovered by Max Essex, was shown to be a monkey virus laboratory contaminant not found in monkeys in the wild at all, this fact should have told 'the authorities' something. At the 1996 National AIDS Update Conference in San Francisco, I had the opportunity to ask Dr. Essex, 'Other than through vaccines, how could HIV-2, a monkey virus laboratory contaminant, not found in monkeys in the wild, have gotten into the Senegalese African women in whom you discovered it?'22-26 After beating around the bush for several minutes unwilling to answer the question directly, he defended, 'I can tell you how my monkeys got infected. . . . Researchers had inoculated the monkeys with human tissues during experiments [unrelated to HIV] prior to them coming to my lab.'\n Though Essex's comment failed to explain just how HIV-1 and HIV-2 got into black Africans and gay American's in the first place, it did provide an insider's view of human error commonly associated with laboratory animal experiments, including the threat of viral contaminants being spread from humans to monkeys and back again.",

   "Merck, like Bionetics and the NYUMC, was a documented biological weapons contractor for the CIA and DOD. In fact, the pharmaceutical giant's president, George W. Merck, served as America's biological weapons industry director during most of the cold war. At the end of, and following, World War II, the German-based company was spurred to global pharmaceutical industry dominance by cash infusions made by Hitler's chief financial officer, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann. According to \"Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile\" (Lyle Stuart, Inc., 1981), by WWII CBS News correspondent Paul Manning, these investments were part of 'Operation Eagle's Flight' - the NAZI 'flight capital' plan to insure a 'Fourth Reich,' and continuing German control over an evolving Neuordnung, or 'New Order' in which industrial institutions like IG Farben, Merck, and other Nazi funded firms would remain at the forefront of world economic leadership. Every epidemic in history has been associated with major social/political upheaval. In Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola - Nature, Accident or Intentional? examines the connections between Eric Traub - Hitler's top biological weapons developer - who was brought to the U.S. during Project: Paperclip - the exfiltration of approximately 2,000 Nazis out of Germany by OSS and CIA directors for service to American intelligence and industry; Henry Kissinger - a Merck consultant and leading Nazi hunter during Project: Paperclip, who later, in 1968, became National Security Advisor under Richard Nixon, and then as the most powerful man in American Intelligence and foreign policy, Kissinger virtually ordered, and then oversaw the development of, immune-system-ravaging viruses for germ warfare; and military medical industrialists like the Rockefellers who became partners with IG Farbin and the Third Reich. The Rockefellers were also intimately connected to the New York City Blood Bank - the organization that allowed 10,000 hemophiliacs throughout the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, to get AIDS from contaminated blood and clotting factor VIII.",

   "Devil Doing Behind \n the American Red Cross\n In Emerging \n Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? explaines \n how and why, at the end of WWII, the Dulles brothers, in support of Rockefeller alliances, arranged false Red Cross identifications for Nazi war criminals, scientists, and military officials to escape through the \"rat lines.\" \n A couple of years ago, the New York Times carried a story that explained \n that Red Cross officials were aware of the Nazi atrocities occurring in \n the concentration camps of WWII.

After developing AIDS, approximately ten thousand hemophiliacs died throughout the United States, along with countless others around the world. Likewise, in 1999, CNN reported that approximately 500,000 Chinese people became HIV infected similarly through contaminated blood. Not to mention the millions of others who received the hepatitis B, C \n and herpes (cancer) viruses through contaminated blood, likewise preventable, but purposely neglected.",

   "Pharmaceutical companies rely upon ill health in the population to survive and reap their profits. No drug company has a vested interest in curing disease. They do, however, have a massive vested interest in maintaining ill-health, creating disease and manufacturing chemicals which will promote this under the guise of 'therapy' for the symptoms - rarely ever the cause - of disease. Dr John Braithwaite, now a Trade Practices Commissioner, in his expose, Corporate Crime in the Pharmaceutical Industry, states International bribery and corruption, fraud in the testing of drugs, criminal negligence in the unsafe manufacturing of drugs - the pharmaceutical industry has a worse record of law-breaking than any other industry.'",

Under him the Council on Foreign Relations and the Tri-Lateral Commission drew up the blue print for the post war era centered around a United Nations. The land upon which the United Nations building rests was his grant. It was David who in 1944 had the Bretton Woods conference convoked, to draw the rules for the post war international monetary relationships. It was David who stood behind the foundation of the IMF, the World Bank, the Bilderbergers, the many G-x Meetings and the World Economic Council. Whatever important events occurred in the last 70 years, be it the Land-Lease to Russia, the Marshall Plan, the decolonization movement, the Alianza para el Progresso, the Point Four program, the Peace Corps, the opening up of China and Russia, they all carry the stamp of David Rockefeller, his Council on Foreign Relations and his Tri-Lats. I give little credit to Washington for ever having directly initiated any important, forward looking programs on its own initiative. If so, then the originators were the ones put into government by David's instigation. To take it one step further: I do not think that any American President has ever been elected in David's time who was not first suggested or approved by him or not obliged to accept a vice-president or a secretary of State of Rockefeller's choice. Who controls America's major Banks and thus the FED, the IMF and the World Bank? Who controls the media? And who controls the armaments industries? Not the Pentagon! More than anywhere else, in the USA he who has the money rules. And this are not the salaried employees in the Pentagon! Neither are they the government ( or the FED's!) employees dependent on salaries. Even up to the highest level, where some presidents of late were also men of fortune in their own right, their financial weight was nothing in the face of the financial power of David Rockefeller. It is not the amount of riches that counts, but how these riches are organized and what is and can be done through them. Bill Gates, with all his money is purportedly the richest man in the world, however, he is only a prisoner in his single enterprise and counts little in the world of finance in the broader sense. Warren Buffet's riches are but passively invested. On the other hand, David's money moves, works and rules. Through holdings and trusts, control and leverage, he has cunningly followed in the steps of his grandfather and converted his inheritance into a financial empire, mightier than the world has never seen, even mightier than any one forged by armies. Conquered by imposing debt, at home and abroad, its arms but fiat paper dollars. An Empire in itself, organized into the finest details, with councils of ministers, executives, information services and the grooming, training and planting of faithful lackeys at strategic points. Many will disagree, but for me David Rockefeller has been the king maker of the last sixty years. His policies alone have made the American Dollar the money of the world, pushing all other currencies and gold into the background, not tolerating any rival to his dollar empire. He has made the world dance to his and America's tune. Not the hospitality of the American people, but David's imperialistic debt enslavement policies underlie resentment against the United States.",

   "The Rockefellers provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate. Education influences the religious values of our people.\n In 1952, Congressman Eugene E. Cox headed up a committee that for the first time tried to uncover the Rockefeller's (and other's) foundations' activities. For some reason, Cox encountered stiff opposition everywhere against his committee's investigation, and the Congressman for some reason got sick and died. One member of the committee, Congressman Carroll Reese, and his Counsel Rene Wormser attempted to continue the investigation. Rockefeller's henchmen and newspapers did their best to destroy Congressman Reese. The Reese investigation was given only the barest minimum of time and little resources for their investigation. However, they were still able to uncover that beginning in the 1930s vast sums of money were spent in Education by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations. This money went to promote John Dewey, Marxism, a One-World-Government agenda, and Socialism. The foundations (principally the Rockefeller and Carnegie) stimulated two-thirds of the total endowment funding of all institutions of higher learning in America during the first third of this 20th century. The NEA (National Education Association was largely financed by the Rockefeller/Carnegie foundations. A 1934 NEA report advised, \"A dying laissez-faire must be completely destroyed and all of us, including the 'owners', must be subjected to a large degree of social control.\" Reece Committee Counsel Rene Wormser wrote of the investigation, \"...leads one to the conclusion that there was, indeed, something in the nature of an actual conspiracy among certain leading educators in the United States to bring about socialism through the use of our school systems...\" They discovered that the Rockefeller foundation was the primary culprit behind the teaching of socialism in America's schools and universities and also behind the NEA's policies. Rene Wormser, Counsel for the Reece Committee reported, \"A very powerful complex of foundations and allied organizations has developed over the years to exercise a high degree of control over education. Part of this complex, and ultimately responsible for it, are the Rockefeller and Carnegie groups of foundations.\" This was the situation in the 1950s when the Reece Committee briefly investigated. The Rockefeller-Carnegie groups have continued basically unopposed for the next 40 years in controlling education. One of the educational book producers is Grolier, Inc. Avery Rockefeller, Jr. sits on Grolier, Inc. board meetings. Another interesting board member is Theodore WaIler who is the director of Grolier, Inc. He was a member of the International Book Committee of UNESCO. The Rockefellers maintain great influence in the United Nations.",

   "David Rockefeller - No other individual comes close to matching the influence that David Rockefeller has exerted over U.S.-Latin American relations - through both Democratic and Republican administrations - over the past five decades. And no other individual has been as instrumental in the design, promotion and implementation of NAFTA, FTAA and other regional schemes. In his April 23, 1992 address to the Forum of the Americas, President George Bush (the elder) paid public homage to Rockefeller's key role, saying: \"David, thank you, sir. And thank you for your really vital work in rallying the private sector and congressional support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.... And let me say to his many friends here that David's personal involvement has been a major factor in the success we've enjoyed so far.\" President Clinton, President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, likewise, have all publicly praised Rockefeller as an indispensable force in the process of hemispheric convergence. The 89-year-old Rockefeller has combined his family's dynastic wealth and business contacts with a formidable array of organizational power bases at the global and hemispheric levels. He was founder and chairman of the Council of the Americas, the Americas Society, and Forum of the Americas, through which he has exercised enormous influence over the thinking and policies of U.S. and Latin American business and political elites. He founded the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University and has funded the Latin American studies programs at many other institutions. As chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, he has intertwined his business dealings with the operations of the IMF, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and US AID. He has also been one of the main voices on Wall Street for increasing U.S. taxpayer funding for these globalist institutions. In addition, Mr. Rockefeller is the founder and honorary chairman of the Trilateral Commission, as well as a continuing power within the Council on Foreign Relations (he was CFR chairman for 15 years) and a major financial angel of the Institute for International Economics, all of which have been at the forefront of the push to establish sovereignty-eroding regional trade pacts. At the end of World War II, Rockefeller was named secretary of a special CFR study group headed by Charles M. Spofford to plan the merger of Western Europe. That CFR plan became known as the Marshall Plan, which was soon funneling millions of U.S. dollars to European socialists and business leaders who would sell out their countries and work to establish a supranational governing structure for Europe. The Marshall Plan's ostensible purpose, fighting Communism, was intended to justify the cost to U.S. taxpayers. The Common Market was formed as a supposed \"free trade\" pact and has, by design, morphed into the European Union, a continental monstrosity that is destroying what remains of its members' residual national sovereignty and is rapidly being transformed into a socialist tyranny. Mr. Rockefeller, the last living member of the CFR study group that devised the EU scheme, has utilized the same ploys and deceptions that worked so successfully in that long-running ruse to advance the treasonous NAFTA-FTAA conspiracy here in the Americas.",
