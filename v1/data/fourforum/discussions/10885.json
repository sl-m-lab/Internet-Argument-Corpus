   "What Poland's leaders are thinking. Are an couple billion dollars worth being targeted by several hundred Russian warheads? \n \n The US is trying to convince Poland to let them place part of the US missile shield in Poland. They are doing this in their normal bribing way. However, since the shield can obviously in the future be used against China and Russia, is it worth it to Poland to go from being not an target to being the coordinates for many multimegaton warheads? \n \n And you have to account for the likelihood of any actual exchange.\n \n So it is worth it to the Poles?",
