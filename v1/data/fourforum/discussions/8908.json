It really is about time we stop supplying the UN with more money than what we really owe them.\n\n \n Yes and no. This seems to be an important time for the UN, and the responses to the varios speaches were, IMO, good indicators of which way changes at the UN are likely to go.\n \n On the one hand you have Bolton there screaming about the UN being ineffective and trying to overhaul it to give the US more control (face it, that is what he is after). MEasures he proposes include allowing the the over ride of security council vetos EXCEPT for the US veto. \n \n On the other hand, you have several nations pushing for reform in the UN that include the LOSS of the US veto, or the ability for other UNSC set holders to override ANY veto, including ours. They pain the US as using hte UN when possible to push our own policy goals, and ignoring it when those policy goals do not fall inot line with international law.\n \n The stakes here are higehr than many seem to realize. Barring a US veto, the UNSC would have voted military action against israel 7 times in the last 30 years. Without our veto, there is a good to excelent chance that there would have been consequences to our invasion of Iraq which, regardless of motivation was without quesiton illegal. Certainly nobody at the UN would even consider a military confrontation with the US, but economic sanctions against us would be more destructive than any military action ever could be. \n \n Since its inception, the UN has essentially been an organization that allowed us to impose our will on others with impunity. We have never had to fear reprisals fromteh UN. If those like Chavez get their way, we may well have to fear such actions. \n \n The US is not in the position it once was where we could give the world the bird and say \"our demise would hurt them more than it would hurt us\". The world has changed. We now need the rest of the world just as badly as they need us, and probably more. \n \n There are actually stakes here, just like there are with the NAM conferences. We have finally reached the point that we are weak enough that we can be hurt, and badly, with things like economic sanctions.",

Hayward\n FrontPageMagazine.com | August 26, 2004 \n In this morning's Wall Street Journal online edition, Jimmy Carter attempts to respond to critics of his role in legitimizing the recent Venezuelan referendum on the loathsome Hugo Chavez regime. The nub of the problem is this: While exit polls conducted by the very reliable American firm of Penn, Schoen, and Berland showed Chavez losing by a large margin (59 - 41), the official results put Chavez free and clear by a vote of 58 to 41 percent.\n \n How could the exit polls be nearly 40 points off? The short answer is, they weren't. Chavez, whose anti-democratic, pro-Castro sympathies are openly proclaimed (he tried to block the constitutionally-mandated referendum for months), stole the election. \"I think it was massive fraud,\" Doug Schoen told Michael Barone at U.S. News and World Report. \"Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the [Venezuelan] central commission.\" There are widespread reports of irregularities and evidence of fraud, many of them ably recorded by Mary Anastasia O'Grady in the Wall Street Journal last week. Carter is untroubled by any of this, and declares that Chavez won \"fair and square.\"\n \n \n The remarkable thing about Carter's \"rebuttal\" to his critics is that he does not offer any refutation of the criticisms. Instead, his article reads like a puff-piece for the wonderful character of the Carter Center, and offers up a fog of sentimentality. \"The Carter Center has monitored more than 50 troubled democratic elections, all of them either highly contentious or a nation's first experience with democracy,\" he writes, neglecting to tell readers that he has opposed the use of independent exit polls in most of those elections. In this case, Carter simply waives away the exit poll results as though they didn't exist. Incredibly he writes: \"During the voting day, opposition leaders claimed to have exit-poll data showing the government losing by 20 percentage points, and this erroneous information was distributed widely.\" Erroneous information? \n \n Carter apparently believes that he is not only entitled to his own opinion, but also to his own facts. (Neither does he answer or rebut any other specific allegations about the election.)\n \n \n Carter has a long history of coddling dictators and blessing their elections, and among his complex motivations is his determination to override American foreign policy when it suits him. In the famous 1990 election in Nicaragua, Carter, along with most of the liberal Democratic establishment in Washington, openly hungered for a Sandinista victory as a way of discrediting the Reagan-Bush support for the Contras. Sandinista strongman Daniel Ortega had visited Carter in the U.S. and called him \"a good friend,\" and Carter consistently downplayed or excused reports of Sandinista pre-election thuggery and voter intimidation. When the early vote count showed the Sandinistas losing by a landslide, the Sandinista junta ordered a news blackout and appeared on the brink of canceling the election.\n \n Although Carter pressured the Sandinistas to relent, he also told opposition candidate Violetta Chamorro not to claim victory until Ortega had conceded defeat-potentially disastrous advice if Ortega had ignored Carter and nullified the election. Carter returned to the U.S. bitterly disappointed that his Sandinista pals had been turned out. (Among other ridiculous things Carter said about Nicaragua under Communist rule was that there was \"as much free enterprise, private ownership, as exists in Great Britain.\")\n \n \n There is speculation that Carter blessed Chavez's stolen election to prevent further violence, but it should also be kept in mind that Carter also enjoys seeing the interests of the United States, especially when defined by Republican presidents, humiliated. Chavez's anti-Americanism will now intensify, thanks in part to the worst ex-President in American history, who has never been content to let his four years of ruinous rule be his last public deed.\n \n \n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=15283\n Carter's love of thugs has not waned over the years. Last month, he certified the widely condemned referendum in which Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez supposedly won by a wide margin of 59-to-41. \n \n Exit polling conducted by the highly regarded Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, however, found the exact opposite result: 59 percent opposed the communist \"President,\" with only 41 percent in favor. \n \n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110005586\n Conned in Caracas \n New evidence that Jimmy Carter got fooled in Venezuela. \n \n Thursday, September 9, 2004 12:01 a.m. EDT \n Both the Bush Administration and former President Jimmy Carter were quick to bless the results of last month's Venezuelan recall vote, but it now looks like they were had. A statistical analysis by a pair of economists suggests that the random-sample \"audit\" results that the Americans trusted weren't random at all.\n \n \n This is no small matter. The imprimatur of Mr. Carter and his Carter Center election observers is being used by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to claim a mandate. The anti-American strongman has been steering his country toward dictatorship and is stirring up trouble throughout Latin America. If the recall election wasn't fair, why would Americans want to endorse it?\n \n \n The new study was released this week by economists Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard and Roberto Rigobon of MIT. They zeroed in on a key problem with the August 18 vote audit that was run by the government's electoral council (CNE): In choosing which polling stations would be audited, the CNE refused to use the random number generator recommended by the Carter Center. Instead, the CNE insisted on its own program, run on its own computer. Mr. Carter's team acquiesced, and Messrs. Hausmann and Rigobon conclude that, in controlling this software, the government had the means to cheat.\n \n \n \"This result opens the possibility that the fraud was committed only in a subset of the 4,580 automated centers, say 3,000, and that the audit was successful because it directed the search to the 1,580 unaltered centers. That is why it was so important not to use the Carter Center number generator. If this was the case, Carter could never have figured it out.\" \n \n \n Mr. Hausmann told us that he and Mr. Rigoban also \"found very clear trails of fraud in the statistical record\" and a probability of less than 1% that the anomalies observed could be pure chance. To put it another way, they think the chance is 99% that there was electoral fraud.\n \n \n http://www.counterpunch.org/petras07082004.html\n The Unknown History of James Carter\n The two faces of imperial power include the iron fist military intervention and the \"soft sell\" of electoral frauds, intimidating diplomacy and democratic blackmail. Jimmy Carter is \"the quiet American\" of Graham Greene fame, who legitimates voter fraud, blesses corrupt elections, certifies murderous rulers, encourages elections, in which the opposition is funded by the US state and semi-public foundations, and the incumbent progressive regime suffers repeated violent disruption of the economy.\n \n \n Behind the simple and humane fa\u00e7ade, Carter has a strategy to reverse progressive regimes and undermine insurgent democrats. Carter and his \"team\" from his Center probe and locate weaknesses among insecure democrats, particularly those under threat by US-backed opponents and thus vulnerable to Carter's appeals to be \"pragmatic\" and \"realistic\"--meaning his barely disguised arguments to accept fraudulent electoral results and gross US electoral intervention. Carter is a quiet master in mixing democratic rhetoric with manipulation of susceptible democrats who think he shares their democratic politics. The international mass media feature his self-promoted overseas trips to conflictual countries and above all his phony \"human rights\" record. The mass media provide Carter with the appearance of democratic credentials.\n \n \n In fact, his frequent political interventions have been dedicated to sustaining dictators, legitimizing fraudulent elections and pressuring popular democratic candidates to capitulate before US-backed opponents. Carter has deliberately and systematically worked over the past quarter of a century to undermine progressive regimes and candidates and promote their pro-imperialist opponents.\n \n \n Today in Venezuela, faced with a referendum of dubious validity, backed by the most rancid reactionaries, Carter once again poses as a \"neutral monitor\" while working with the anti-Chavez opposition to first legitimate the referendum then to provide opportunities for its favorable outcome. Carter has said absolutely nothing about strenuous US funding of the opposition--a blatant violation of any democratic, electoral process -- activities which would be felonious in his own country, the USA. He calls for \"fair reporting\" by the hysterically anti-Chavez mass media, knowing full well that, with a wink of his eye, they have free rein to provide exclusively favorable coverage of the opposition and uniformly negative disinformation about Chavez.\n \n In exchange Carter secured from Chavez a promise to avoid compulsory national chain broadcasts. Carter refuses to recognize that the electoral playing field is not equal, yet under the guise of \"free press\" he defends the right of the media oligarchs to voice venomous lies, denying the electorate the right to hear both sides. Carter refuses to recognize the intimidating effects of US military maneuvers in the Caribbean, the belligerent statements of undersecretary of state of Latin American Affairs Noriega against Chavez and the hyperactivity of the US Ambassador Shapiro in support of the anti-Chavez forces. Above all Carter ignores the plots, fraudulent practices and paramilitary activities leading up to and beyond the referendum.\n \n Focusing on enforcing the Government's compliance with electoral procedures and ignoring the highly prejudicial context of the election, Carter is fulfilling his role of a \"set-up man\" for either an electoral victory of the opposition or in the event of a defeat, for a post-election pretext for violent coup. Carter's history provides an extremely useful context for substantiating these observations and affirmation.\n \n \n http://www.vcrisis.com/index.php?content=letters/200408310659\n The margin of error between Carter's certified fair-and-square ballots and the independent exit poll results constituted a swing of almost forty points -- a statistical impossibility. Chavez counted on Carter leaning his way -- Carter's history of promoting anti-American dictators is no secret.\n \n http://www.proveo.org/fraud_report.pdf\n \n http://www.vcrisis.com/index.php?content=letters/200509152101\n \n \n http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=3821\n Was the election in Venezuela stolen?\n September 8th, 2004\n Several weeks back, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman warned that the Presidential election might be stolen in Florida. This year, he warned, unlike the Presidential race in 2000, the election might be stolen even without help from the Supreme Court. The fraud would be perpetrated through the use of new touch screen voting machines which do not leave a paper trail. This meant that Bush die-hards working for Florida Governor Jeb Bush could or would fix the results regardless of the real vote (presumably by receiving secret passwords or instructions from the machine manufacturers).\n \n Shockingly, one executive with Diebold, one of the machine manufacturers, was a Bush supporter! For Krugman, this all but assured that the dastardly deed would occur, if needed. Krugman, of course, never suggested or even contemplated that anybody on the left might do something so nasty and unethical. \n \n \n Well, it turns out that the Left may have just stolen an election in Venezuela. The media has tuned out on this story, after proudly reporting that Hugo Chavez won a resounding victory, once former President Carter blessed the results as fair. The big story in the mainstream media was the rebuke to President Bush, since Chavez was Fidel Castro's best friend in the hemisphere, and had trounced his opponents in the recall election.\n \n \n In the days following the recall election, stories began to surface that the election results were inconsistent with polling results conducted before the election, and with exit polls conducted on election day. Interestingly, Krugman argued in his alarmist column that exit polls should be used as a check on the honesty of the results on election day, to see whether the fix was in. If for instance, an exit poll showed Kerry ahead on Election Day in Florida, but Bush won the state in the actual tally on November 2nd, then we would know, Krugman told us, that the results were suspect.\n \n \n All year so far, polling results in Florida have been within the margin of error, with one or the other candidate holding onto a narrow lead. It is of course very possible for a candidate to be ahead by a point or two in pre-election surveys, and even in an exit poll and still lose a state. In fact, this happened in 2000. Then-Governor Bush led in almost all pre-election surveys nationally by a point or two, but lost the popular vote by 0.6%.\n \n \n But what is the likelihood that one side could lose in an exit poll by 18%, and win the election the same day by 18%? That, statisticians tell us, is virtually impossible. And that is what happened in Venezuela.\n \n \n Doug Schoen, is a very respected Democratic Party pollster. He was President Clinton's favorite pollster, and remember that Clinton was so obsessed by polls that he once conducted a survey to determine where he should take his summer vacation in 1996. Schoen was a busy man during the Clinton years. Schoen's firm, which was hired by an opposition group in Venezuela, conducted pre-election surveys, and also undertook a large exit poll on the day of the Chavez recall. His pre-election surveys indicated that those who wanted to recall Chavez were ahead by at least 10%, and gaining momentum.\n \n In his exit poll, the margin for the anti-Chavez side grew to 18%. Schoen expressed disbelief when the results showed that Chavez retained his office by the same 18% margin. That, of course, is a 36% swing from an exit poll conducted the same day, or about six times the margin of error in terms of a vote shift. We are talking here of many standard deviations away from the expected result. That result is about as likely as Osama Bin Laden agreeing to be on Bill O'Reilly's show in person tomorrow night.\n \n \n Another oddity that was revealed in the days following the election was the remarkable similarity in the vote count for one side or the other on individual voting machines. On over 400 voting machines, the anti-Chavez vote was identical-down to the single vote. The most prominent defender of Chavez's election win, Jimmy Carter, responded in an op-ed that this meant nothing, since on over 300 polling machines, the vote to retain Chavez was also identical. One thing that Carter did not mention, however, was whether the vote for Chavez on the 300 machines, was higher than the vote recorded against Chavez in the other 400. Clearly, if the fix was in, one could record a maximum result for the anti-Chavez side on some polling machines (regardless of how many people voted against Chavez, in all likelihood a larger number) and also record a vote total for Chavez on other machines that was much higher than the actual vote total for Chavez. \n \n \n The two things that are suggested by these results are that a fraud may have occurred, and that if it did, the fixers were lazy. Having identical vote totals on hundreds of different machines around the country is about as likely to occur as the results from the famous missing ballot box that was used to give \"Landslide Lyndon\" Johnson his 87 vote victory in the Senate race in Texas in 1948. The votes in that mystery precinct when they finally turned up, were almost 100% for Johnson, and the voters who signed in to vote \"that day\" did so in alphabetical order, a first I am sure, even for Texas.\n As critics of the results in Venezuela continued to challenge the outcome, the Carter Center called on a statistician from Stanford University, Jonathan Taylor, who analyzed the one issue of identical vote totals on hundreds of machines. He concluded that that occurrence was normal. His report, and other defenses of the election results were summarized in a lengthy article in the current issue of the Economist, written by a Carter Center staffer, Jennifer McCoy.\n \n \n Now, three weeks after the election, the smokescreen of the Carter Center imprimatur has begun to be blown away. Perhaps not wanting to be identified with a fraud, Taylor has recanted his support for the premise that the identical results on hundreds of machines was not an aberration.\n \n \n And two Venezuelan professors, including one from MIT, and another from Harvard have issued their own report,concluding that there is at least a 99% chance that the election result was a fraud. Their study analyzed precinct vote totals with voter recall petition numbers, as well as with exit polling data. They found it highly unusual that the reported vote was significantly higher as a percentage of the petition count for the recall in those machines in precincts which were examined after the election than in those which were not. They suggested the possiblity that tampering occurred with selected machines.\n \n \n Fifteen percent of Venezuela's voters used paper ballots. In these areas, the pro-Chavez forces won overwhelmingly, by 70%-30%, accounting for a third of the total margin of victory. Stuffing paper ballots is the easiest fraud to undertake. The Carter people dismiss this possibility by arguing that these voters were in rural areas (poorer), and naturally more supportive of Chavez. \n There is no front page news story on this in the New York Times or Washington Post of course, and no editorial condemning Chavez for holding onto power through a probably-fixed election. And of course, there has been no criticism in the liberal press for Saint Jimmy, who has, over many years, sanctified the behavior and character of the leaders of North Korea, Yassar Arafat, the Sandanistas, Fidel Castro, and now Hugo Chavez. Carter, the Nobel Prize Peace Prize winner, is also the man who invited serial liar Michael Moore to share his Presidential box at the Democratic Convention, effectively anointing him by extension, as a truth-teller, like Carter himself.\n \n \n But the association works the other way as well. When Carter associates himself with the likes of Moore, it throws into question his commitment to honesty in an undertaking like the Venezuelan elections. Moore cares only about results-in his case defeating Bush. So it seems, does Carter. \n The other real truth is that Jimmy Carter loves dictators, so long as they are enemies of America. And he plays off the respect he has accumulated in the 24 years since his landslide defeat in 1980 (the worst Electoral College loss ever for an incumbent President) for all that it is worth, and always in a predictable fashion. If you attack Republicans, America, or Israel, you are likely to be a friend of Jimmy Carter. The man, who some call the soul of the Democratic Party and the conscience of the world, has just provided a seal of approval for what may well have been a stolen election. Carter's statistician may have done an about-face, but Carter has not yet said a word about changing his own conclusion about the Venezuelan election. Perhaps Carter and Paul Krugman will make a joint statement about this in the coming days. \n \n \n http://www.nysun.com/article/719\n Exit polling from the American firm of Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates suggested the inverse of the results Mr. Carter blessed last Monday that showed Mr. Chavez survived the recount referendum by a margin of 59% to 41%.",

   "Yes and no. This seems to be an important time for the UN, and the responses to the varios speaches were, IMO, good indicators of which way changes at the UN are likely to go.\n \n On the one hand you have Bolton there screaming about the UN being ineffective and trying to overhaul it to give the US more control (face it, that is what he is after). MEasures he proposes include allowing the the over ride of security council vetos EXCEPT for the US veto. \n \n On the other hand, you have several nations pushing for reform in the UN that include the LOSS of the US veto, or the ability for other UNSC set holders to override ANY veto, including ours. They pain the US as using hte UN when possible to push our own policy goals, and ignoring it when those policy goals do not fall inot line with international law.\n \n The stakes here are higehr than many seem to realize. Barring a US veto, the UNSC would have voted military action against israel 7 times in the last 30 years. Without our veto, there is a good to excelent chance that there would have been consequences to our invasion of Iraq which, regardless of motivation was without quesiton illegal. Certainly nobody at the UN would even consider a military confrontation with the US, but economic sanctions against us would be more destructive than any military action ever could be. \n \n Since its inception, the UN has essentially been an organization that allowed us to impose our will on others with impunity. We have never had to fear reprisals fromteh UN. If those like Chavez get their way, we may well have to fear such actions. \n \n The US is not in the position it once was where we could give the world the bird and say \"our demise would hurt them more than it would hurt us\". The world has changed. We now need the rest of the world just as badly as they need us, and probably more. \n \n There are actually stakes here, just like there are with the NAM conferences. We have finally reached the point that we are weak enough that we can be hurt, and badly, with things like economic sanctions.\n\n \n Ok, there are stakes here....how does Chavez getting up there and being an a-hole going to help anything?

   "So, there is ABSOLUTLY NO eveidence that the elections were rigged. The claim is being made on the basis of the exit polls. \n \n This is one of the flimisiest bits of BS I have ever seen you try to use, Jim.\n \n If you truly believe that the fact that the exit polls indicate that there was fraud, then you must absolutly by proxy agree that the Bush adminsitration was elected by fraud in 2004, BECAUE THE EXIT POLLS ON THAT ONE WERE OFF A LOT FURTHER THAN THE ONES IN VENEZUELA.\n \n http://www.buzzflash.com/analysis/04/11/ana04027.html\n \n Gillespie (chairman of the RNC):\n \n \n\"But I've been through this before,\" he said. \"In 2000 the exit data was wrong on Election Day. In 2002, the exit returns were wrong on Election Day. And in 2004, the exit data were wrong on Election Day -- all three times, by the way, in a way that skewed against Republicans and had a dispiriting effect on Republican voters across the country.\" \n\n \n Good lord, so by your twisted, irrational, and completely indefensible logic, our elections in 2000, 2002, and 2004 were obviously rigged!!\n \n Lets say for a second that exit polls actually are ultimatly reliable as opposed to the facts that we know to the contrary. Lets say that in order to skew exit poll results, sombody actually has to work at it.\n \n On the one hand, you have a firm that has been paid by the US government, who we KNOW helped plan and fund a coup against Chavez, saying that Chavez lost. Who was actually running the polls? Volunteers from Sumate, which is an anti chavez political group.\n \n On the other hand, we have the certified results of a closely montiored elections where a guy who had a popularity rating of 80% 6 months before won the election. This should be a no brainer. \n \n What you, and other folks that do not seem to be able to handle the fact that a socialist, rabidly anti american leader was elected by a fair vote do not seemt o understandis that the recall election never would have taken place had Chavez not stepped up and urged people to support the recall. It was a massive (and somewhat risky) PR move by Chavez. \n \n 6 months before the recall petitions started circualting, he had a popularity rating of 80%. The opposition started a new (and by all accounts sucessful) publicity campaign criticizing NOT the changes that Chavez was making, but how fast he was making them.

   "So, there is ABSOLUTLY NO eveidence that the elections were rigged. The claim is being made on the basis of the exit polls. \n \n This is one of the flimisiest bits of BS I have ever seen you try to use, Jim.\n \n If you truly believe that the fact that the exit polls indicate that there was fraud, then you must absolutly by proxy agree that the Bush adminsitration was elected by fraud in 2004, BECAUE THE EXIT POLLS ON THAT ONE WERE OFF A LOT FURTHER THAN THE ONES IN VENEZUELA.\n \n http://www.buzzflash.com/analysis/04/11/ana04027.html\n \n Gillespie (chairman of the RNC):\n \n \n \n Good lord, so by your twisted, irrational, and completely indefensible logic, our elections in 2000, 2002, and 2004 were obviously rigged!!\n \n Lets say for a second that exit polls actually are ultimatly reliable as opposed to the facts that we know to the contrary. Lets say that in order to skew exit poll results, sombody actually has to work at it.\n \n On the one hand, you have a firm that has been paid by the US government, who we KNOW helped plan and fund a coup against Chavez, saying that Chavez lost. Who was actually running the polls? Volunteers from Sumate, which is an anti chavez political group.\n \n On the other hand, we have the certified results of a closely montiored elections where a guy who had a popularity rating of 80% 6 months before won the election. This should be a no brainer. \n \n What you, and other folks that do not seem to be able to handle the fact that a socialist, rabidly anti american leader was elected by a fair vote do not seemt o understandis that the recall election never would have taken place had Chavez not stepped up and urged people to support the recall. It was a massive (and somewhat risky) PR move by Chavez. \n \n 6 months before the recall petitions started circualting, he had a popularity rating of 80%. The opposition started a new (and by all accounts sucessful) publicity campaign criticizing NOT the changes that Chavez was making, but how fast he was making them. Essentially they accused him of being lazy at the expense of the poor. His popularity rating fell form 80% to 30%.\n \n Chavez pushed the recall election through. He said that when actually faced with the possibility of going back to the way things were, the venezualan people would recognize that he was fighting the entire establishement, and that takes time, and that nobody else had EVER been willing to do that for them.

First, the mysterious \"tied\" results or \"caps\" on the machines. We found that 402 of 8,100 mesas (each with one to three machines) had two or three machines with the same result for the Yes vote; and 311 mesas had the same results for the No vote. So the phenomenon affected both sides. We consulted Jonathan Taylor, a statistician from Stanford University. Using various mathematical models, he predicted that 379 mesas would have ties (of two or three machines) in the Yes votes, and 336 mesas would have ties in the No votes. The error range would be plus or minus 36 mesas. So the actual results fell within the range of probability, and do not provide evidence of fraud.\n\n \n So, whoops, the results work out just fine mathematically. \n \n Even if you don't read the entire 139 page report, at least read the first link.

His analysis can be found at http://venezuela-referendum.com/ They even went so far as to generate computer models to simulate the election. \n \n \n \n If there was any substance to it at all, I might. There is not, so I don't see the point. It is just pages and pages of completely unbacked \"we lost\" whining. There were no dead people voting or anything else (though several dead peopel DID sign the recall petition). \n \n You don't have a leg to stand on here, Jim. Also, could you link the article where \"Several statisticians with infinitely greater credentials than yours have said it is a virtual impossibility and that the machines were obviouosly fixed\"? I can't seem to find it in your links. The only thing that comes close is a bunch of XXXXXX claimign that since the exit polls were off, the election must have been rigged. We have already established that exit polls are not particularly reliable, and that the only exit poll that showed him loosing was the one funded and operated by his opposition. It was also the SMALLEST one. The other, larger exit polls NOT funded and operated soley by the opposition showed him winning. Additionally, we know for certain that he was ahead by 9 points going into the election.\n \n You must really live in a fantasy land if you believe that the results of an exit poll funded and operated by an opposition group are correct, but a heavily monitored elections whose results mirror pre election polls, as well as the other exit polls that were taken, was rigged.\nYour predictability is uncanny.\n \n I predicted you would write off the Venezeulan written report, the one that is replete with substance and statements regarding government intervention and manipulation of election machinery and audits, as meaningless. Sure enough, all you say is that it lacks substance and is nothing more than unbacked whining.\n \n Yet you follow this with a contention that those unbacked analyses from the high and mighty Johns Hopkins liberals are dead on the money despite the fact that they merely simulated an election in their own model.\n \n Jesus, daewoo! How stupid do you think people are? Don't answer that... I already know you consider anyone who disagrees with you to be an imbecile or a XXXXX...and you quickly label them as such when you have a weak or completely powerless argument to present.\n \n Your opinion doesn't matter at all in regard to Venezuelan election fraud.

Unlike you, I try to look at all available information and then make a decision. Youwant me to refute it? No problem. Here are essentially the primary claims laid forth in the propoganda piece:\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; The fraud, corruption and manipulation of the Electoral Roll.\n\n \n Speculation, no proof given\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; The purchase of an automated voting system in violation of the regulations established in Venezuelan legislation\n\n \n Irrelevant to the discussion (though the venezuelan courts ruled that this was incorrect)\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; That the software of the automated voting system was not updated according to the security norms that would have guaranteed their operation only by authorized personnel and the execution of adequate testing.\n\n \n i can't find anythign on this at all. Apparently it is just one of the hundreds of completely unbacked claims made in this particular propoganda piece. According to McCoy:\n \n \nSecond, we drew a larger sample of poll results from those received electronically at CNE headquarters, to test the accuracy of tabulation by the CNE's computers. These tests confirmed there was no manipulation of the software or data transmission. \n\n \n Whoops, the first bit of complete and utter BS in your \"report\"\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; That the design and operation of the voting stations did not fulfill the optimization criteria and which consequently subjected voters to the indignant attacks against their dignity so evident during the recall vote\n\n \n This seems to be tied to the fact that the voters used a fingerprint identification system to ensure that each person only voted once. What an affront to dignity! It takes a pretty ruthless dictator to beleive in a \"one man one vote\" principal and to make people only vote once. \n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; That there was inadequate protection for the equipment to prevent the manipulation and alteration to which it was subjected.\n &#56256;&#56457; That the audits failed.\n &#56256;&#56457; That the process of returning all of the electoral material was not respected, nor where the ballot boxes and the cover forms protected during the ninety (90) days as established by law.\n\n \n These 3 all go the same direction....ballots were nto protected and the audit did not come out correctly.\n \n From Jennifer McCoy:\n \n \nMissing from those tests was what happened within the black box of the voting machines. Fortunately, the Venezuelan machines were programmed to produce a paper trail: after each vote, a paper ballot was printed, inspected by the voter, and deposited in a cardboard ballot box. We had urged a \"hot audit\", an immediate count of the paper ballots. At the last minute, the CNE approved an audit of 1% of the voting machines. But this was only half completed, because of the high turnout, late closing of the polls (some as late as 3am) and poor instructions to CNE auditors. We were only able to observe a few of these \"hot audits\", as we needed to be at other mesas for our own quick count. \n \n We therefore proposed to the CNE a second audit, three days after the vote, to check the paper slips. We agreed a methodology with the opposition's technical advisors, but its political leaders decided not to participate (they had wanted to negotiate directly with the CNE). We tested and verified the CNE's computer programme to draw a new random sample of 150 mesas, comprising 334 voting machines, and observed the drawing of the sample. We put observers in the main military garrisons where the boxes of paper receipts were stored, before the sample was drawn, to avoid any tampering with the chosen boxes. The observers accompanied the boxes to Caracas, and then watched over a meticulous count in which each slip was compared with the electronic result. \n \n The only way the boxes could have been altered would be for the military-historically the custodians of election material in Venezuela-to have reprogrammed 19,200 voting machines to print out new paper receipts with the proper date, time and serial code and in the proper number of Yes and No votes to match the electronic result, and to have reinserted these into the proper ballot boxes. All of this in garrisons spread across 22 states, between Monday and Wednesday, with nobody revealing the fraud. We considered this to be supremely implausible.\n \n This second audit showed that the machines were very accurate. We found a variation of only 0.1% between the paper receipts and the electronic results. This could be explained by voters putting the slips in the wrong ballot box. An additional piece of corroborating evidence was the result from the 15% of polling stations that used the old-fashioned manual ballot. These stations (in mostly rural areas without telephones) were even more favourable to the president, voting 70:30 against recall.\n\n \n So, 3 more bits of utter BS from your report.\n \n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; The takeover of the facilities where the fundamental activities of the electoral process took place, forbidding the entrance of opposition members and easing the participation of pro-Government forces.\n\n \n This was actually answered above, but I will put it here for you again-\n \n \nWe agreed a methodology with the opposition's technical advisors, but its political leaders decided not to participate (they had wanted to negotiate directly with the CNE).\n\n \n So, they decided not to participate, depsite the fact that their technical people had approved the methodology, and now they are complainign that they were not there.\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; That a fingerprint capture system was used for the purpose of identifying voters, in real time and controlling the flow of pro-Government/opposition voters by using the databases from both sides collected during the recall petitions.\n\n \n OMG...the fingerprint system was used to identify voters!!! No schit, sherlock. that sis what they boght it for. In order for it to personally identify the individual voters and correlate that to those who signed the petition and those who did not, they woudl have to have the fingerprints of EVERY venezuelan on file and in an indexable database, on a computer powerful enough to run hundreds of complete searches per minute. We don't haev anythign that advanced in the US, so if they have it in venezuela, we need to see about buying one from them.\n \n \n&#56256;&#56457; That the transmission of information and its processing was unreliable and was intervened via a number of covert centers established for that purpose.\n \n &#56256;&#56457; That there were no security procedures for access to the network.\n\n \n Also covered above:\n \n \nThis was to check the official results that were transmitted from the machines to CNE headquarters. Second, we drew a larger sample of poll results from those received electronically at CNE headquarters, to test the accuracy of tabulation by the CNE's computers. These tests confirmed there was no manipulation of the software or data transmission. \n\n \n \n So, there are your main claims. None are concrete enough to draw any conclusion, and coupled with the fact that the VAST majority of them are demonstratably BS, your argument here is just dead.\n \n You seem tohave completely lost your ability to seperate facts from propoganda. Did the fact that the article makes a big deal of the fact that the names of those who signed the petition were made public not clue you in and set off your \"propoganda\" alarm? Heres a little hint, Jim. The list of names on poltical petitions int he US are made public as well. Thay have to be.

We put observers in the main military garrisons where the boxes of paper receipts were stored, before the sample was drawn, to avoid any tampering with the chosen boxes. The observers accompanied the boxes to Caracas, and then watched over a meticulous count in which each slip was compared with the electronic result. \n\n \n Is that clear enough, or do you want to continue to beat this dead horse??",
