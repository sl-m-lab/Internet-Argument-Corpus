It is not, as some suggest, a zero sum gain. I do believe, however that all currency should be allowed to float to seek its natural level. The only logical reason I can see for the Chinese not to let it float is that they want to keep their people at work and to have a booming economy knowing that if it tanks the government's hold on power would be severely weakened. We already know that their banking system is bankrupt because of the government edicts to loan to failing enterprises. It appears to me that their economic system is founded on quicksand and one day it will give way.",

It was owned by a guy who is pushing 70 and has been around long enough to know that his business was failing and it could not be saved. He simply did not have the heart to fire all his employees (1500) and chop the business he spent his whole life building into little saleable pieces. We expect to double our money on it. Just the manufacturing facilites will bring almost our entire purchase price since they are both located on prime redevelopment land. One of them is already essentially sold. Then there is equipment to be sold, excess inventory to be moved, and even the name is going out for sale (already have offers) along with the IP.\n \n Most of the equipment, which was on a 5 year replacement/rotation cycle will end up in either china or india.

Your way is the right way to do it.\n\n \n Sorry, I was unclear on this. There was absolutly no chance severace packages were going out. I don't care that much about the employees of a defunct company. The severance packages were purely hypothetical. the only real choise was fire them all now or fire them all later. I would have had some sleepless nights if I had just fired everybody and had them out the door on the spot. I have done it before, though, so I know that the money that starts rolling in from the liquidation eases the pain.\n \n When I say that it didn't matter from a financial standpoint, what I meant was that we would keep production going for another 7 weeks. There were some onhand orders that we can fill, and any surplus will be sold to a competitor to be rebranded. Keeping the employees on is essentially economically neutral in this regard since They are paying for themselves, and when that 7 weeks is up, we will utilize existing employees to break down facilities and pack up offices. \n \n \nThat's a perfect example of the future from our switch of industrial to service economy.

I have financials for another company I am looking at doing the same think with sitting on the corner of my desk right now. It is essentially another victim of the low dollar. This is why I do not understand the Bush crowds hurry to get the yuan unpegged. It seems to me that it is pretty average for \"american made\" goods to consist of 40-60% foreign cost (materials, BLM, tooling costs, etc...).
