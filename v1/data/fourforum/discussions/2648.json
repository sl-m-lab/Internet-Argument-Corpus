   "Ever hear of \"Living Sacrifice\"\n or \"Extol\" or \"ZAO\" or \"Embodyment\" ?\n \n Well, these are only a few bands that have really heavy, hard, fast music, which stylistically would be classified as \"Death Metal,\" but their barely discernable lyrics are all about jesus and their love for him. I've been to many a show and I swear I couldn't tell the difference between them and any other death metal band, except that they would talk about jesus between songs. Then, they would get back into it, playing straight thrash while the mosh pit gets all worked up into it.\n \n What's your opinion of these folks (guess you've either heard them or you can look them up)? Are they really spreading the word?",

It was pretty funny to see him, he had a huge mohawk, a ton of tattoos ... looked like all around freak :)\n yet all he would talk about was God and Jesus emoticon_xangel So I guess he was spreading the word, it was just hard to take him seriously.",
