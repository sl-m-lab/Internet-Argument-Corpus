   "The handwriting is on the wall. Congress had a recent approval rating of 9% and it appears that Democrats are wising up to the fact that liberalism is on the wane. emoticon_xbyeemoticon_xbye Bayh! Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya. emoticon_xhoho\n \n \n\n Evan Bayh to retire\n Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh will not seek re-election this year, a decision that hands Republicans a prime pickup opportunity in the middle of the country.\n \n \"After all these years, my passion for service to my fellow citizens is undiminished, but my desire to do so by serving in Congress has waned,\" Bayh will say.\n \n Bayh will announce the decision at a press conference later today. He was first elected to the Senate in 1998 and was re-elected easily in 2004. National Republicans had recruited former Sen. Dan Coats to challenge Bayh in 2010 although polling suggested Bayh began the race with a 20-point edge. He also had $13 million in the bank at the end of the year.\n The Fix - Evan Bayh to retire \n",
