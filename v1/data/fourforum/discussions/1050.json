I am against it because I believe that it is dangerous to our government to let someone recall the governor this easily, and that an elected official shouldn't be able to be kicked out of office expect if he commits a serious crime.

   "What's going on in California?\n\n \n California law allows the citizens to vote on a recall of the governor if 12% (I think) sign a petition to do so. There's two questions on the ballot. 1) Should the current governor be recalled? (or basically, removed from office) and 2) If he is recalled, who should replace him?\n \n \nI am curious to see some arguments on this important issue going on in California. \n\n \n I am against recall becuase it doesn't hold the voter accountable. The voter goes to the polls and selects people to represent them for a certain period of time. With recall, if the voters make a mistake and decide that they elected the wrong person, they can fix the problem. However, the knowledge that they could fix the problem makes it much more likely that the voter will not take the time to be educated about the candidates and the issues because they know that if they make a mistake, they can fix it at any time.\n \n However, I am in favor of this recall going forward, simply because the recall is allowed and the people have followed the rules to proceed with it.",

Of course registering to a certain party will make you more likely to vote straight for them. I bet if you did a check on registered independents against registered republicans, registered democrats, and those that are unregistered, you will find that out of all four group 90% of the people who will vote straight one way or another are in the registered republican or registered democrat group.

If you are focusing on this then you are missing the bigger picture. Do you think he is spending over a billion dollars on his campaign? Wake up man. California is nearly broke. It has the highest debt of any state in the US in our entire history and by a lot!

You failed to take into consideration that Davis was three years away from his next election and in his previous one he won based on lies. He lied and lied and lied and people bought it until they discovered he was laying. He is now being held accountable. I hope that anyone who runs for office and makes false promises has to think twice now because of what is happening here in California. The people can hold them responsible if they are lying and they don't need to wait until the next election either. So no, re-election procedures cannot accomplish this.\n \n \nCould he really destroy a state in 9 months? And if it took longer, why did the people re-elect him?\n\n \n He made promises. Promises that the people of California believed in. Now they find out everything his opponent was saying was accurate and Davis was a liar. He got re-elected based on lies and his lies were used to cover up how bad the situation was 9 months ago. Now that we can see how bad it is we can realize how badly we need a change.\n \n \nThat sound like a stupid argument.

The unions then had control of all the money that Davis owed them. Next, he wasted millions of dollars on the education system. The schools in California never needed money; they needed better teachers and faculty! Then, at this time of crisis, Davis raised the prices on schools, forcing the schools to lay off teachers, and forcing students to squish into classes of sometimes over 40 students.

As a matter of fact one of the radio stations here in Arizona had a gig going where they were reciting the 1-800 #s for drivers licenses. They were numbers to reach different languages for the license. There apparently is no requirement that anyone be able to speak or read english. The radio station made fun of it.\n \n Our Governor, Napalitano, said she would sign similar legislation should the Legislature provide her with such a bill. (She is Democrat and the legislature is Republican).",

It was going out of control. I am looking forward to Schwarzenegger's administration.\n\n \n I'll take each point separately:\n \n 1) I alreday stated that this was a valid point. However, I do find it hard to believe that even Davis could rack up a 38 Billion Dollar deficit in 9 months. That can only mean one of two things: One: The people knew about the deficit and didn't care or Two: The people didn't know about the deficit because they did not research the issue. Either way, it is the voters fault.\n \n 2) I remember these going on before the previous election. Once again, it appears as if the voters didn't care.\n \n 3) Again, going before the election.\n \n 4) I don't know too much about this. However, I am sure that Davis could not possibly have run 3 companies out of the state in 6-9 months.\n \n 5) Davis was presented this (I think twice.) He vetoed it both times. However, with the impending recall and his job on the line, he decided to sign it the third time as a pander to voters. Thus, the money spent on this is a direct result of the recall and an argument against it, not a reason why Davis should have been recalled.\n \n 6) Once again, I don't think that Davis turned into a madman the day after he was reelected.",
