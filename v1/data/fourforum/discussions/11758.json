   "\n Mercury still rotates. Very slowly, but it still does. \n \n about 'comets preferring the cold regions of cold planets'? \n \n about the sun splitting into 19 pieces?\n \n \n\n \n &#8226; Mercury is the smallest of the planets and the nearest to the sun; it is relatively faraway from us; it is only just now that some part of its surface has been visualized in this way.\n \n Why is that? Because of its bizarre way of the alleged axial rotation; while in fact it does not rotate around itself, but they say it rotates in retrograde way.\n \n Why does any planet rotate around itself: the energy for such rotation is from the heat stored in its core; which will not last forever; it will gradually decrease until it will finish when the planet will stop its axial rotation, but will keep up revolving around the sun.\n See \n the subject of: http://universeandquran.t35.com/new_page_2.htm#The_Reason_for_the_Rotation_of_the_Earth_Around_Itself_\n \n Now because Mercury is the smallest planet, it lost its internal heat before the rest of the planets: at the start it slowed down, then it stopped spinning around itself.\n \n When it stopped its spinning, one hemisphere faced the sun <<< which led to the increase in its temperature to many hundred degrees centigrade.\n The other hemisphere which did not face the sun <<< had extreme coldness.\n \n Then there happened the various changes (that now is happening on Venus) like the permanent cloud of its atmosphere because of the mixing of the various gases of its atmosphere which returned to the same initial phase of smoke which was at the start of its formation.\n See the subject of: http://universeandquran.t35.com/new_page_2.htm#The_Journey_to_Venus_Is_Dangerous_ \n \n Then by time, its core became more cold until its volume contracted &#8594; which led to the appearance of many trenches and fissures on its surface, and its gases were lost into the space &#8594; which led to its surface being clearly seen (in comparison to Venus whose surface is obscure.).\n See the subject of: http://universeandquran.t35.com/new_page_4.htm#The_Burnt_World \n \n &#8226; Comets: are not dirty ice ! as do they claim; comets are fire masses separated from the sun following some local solar explosions; they are hurled out with extreme speed, they go along without any certain goal or orbit, and being oblong objects they do not spin around themselves neither do they circle around the sun, but they go roaming in the space until they are hunted by some cold object or some frozen area of some planets or moons, when they will fall down and impact that planet.\n See the subject of http://universeandquran.t35.com/new_page_3.htm#Comets \n \n \n &#8226; The sun will break up into 19 pieces:\n Our sun is bigger than the previous sun; the previous sun of the previous solar system was relatively smaller which exploded in the previous Doomsday into 9 pieces: the planets of our present solar system. \n \n Our sun is bigger; it will break up into 19 pieces in the next Doomsday to form the new planets of the next solar system; this is confirmed by the interpretation of an aya in the Quran 74: 35\n &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1607;&#1614;&#1575; &#1604;&#1614;&#1573;&#1616;&#1581;&#1618;&#1583;&#1614;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615;&#1576;&#1614;&#1585;&#1616;\n The explanation: ([That] surely [Saqar] is one of the greatest [suns.]) \n It means: Saqar [which is the name of the next sun] is one of the large volume suns.\n \n God -be exalted - said in the Quran 74: 30\n &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1607;&#1614;&#1575; &#1578;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1593;&#1614;&#1577;&#1614; &#1593;&#1614;&#1588;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;\n The explanation: ( [Imposed] upon it [the attraction of] nineteen [planets.] )\n It means: Upon it lies the burden of gravitating nineteen planets.\n \n \n See the subject of: http://universeandquran.t35.com/new_page_4.htm#The_Sun_Will_Burst__ \n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.t35.com",
