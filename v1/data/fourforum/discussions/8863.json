   "Guppies Disprove Darwinists \n \n \n In this post I'm going to show how even the simplest experiments/observations on animals destroys the Neo-darwin theory. There's a reason evolutionists don't do tests/studies on real animals....it's because real-world biology crushes their theory. Thus, they normally avoid real-world tests and experiments like the Plague.\n \n Natural Selection Study Shows Animals Can Adapt Dramatically Fast\n \n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...SSS-270397.php\n \n In a unique, real-world test of the theory of evolution, a National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported research team has demonstrated that animals can adapt to sudden changes in their environment with surprising speed. It's a finding that challenges current methods of evaluating evolutionary changes through the fossil record.\n \n The study of wild guppies on the West Indies island of Trinidad, reported in the newest (March 28) issue of the journal Science, found that the fish could evolve between 10,000 and 10 million times faster than the rate of evolution inferred from the fossil record. It suggests that characterizing evolution from the palaeontological record alone may yield a misleading picture. \n \n So right off the bat, the theory of evolution is in trouble. What is supposed to take thousnds/ millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by David Reznick. \n \n See what's happening with this is experiment is that David Reznick has noticed that guppies, upon being placed in an environment with predators, grow larger quicker and give birth to larger offspring. Of course he hasn't tested what actually CAUSED this phenomenon to happen, he's merely observed it in the population and is blindly attributing it to evolutionists' holy creator, Natural Selection. And being the good evolutionist that he is, Mr. Reznick is falling in line nicely with the current theory by suggesting that these guppies evolved through death of the \"unfit.\"\n \n But is there is another way? Well of course there is! And it has nothing to do with death or which fish goes on to breed and which doesn't. As I have posted in here before, the following link shows that many animals have the miraculous ability to evolve during development according to external conditions - including the ability to grow larger when their environment dictates that they need to be so:\n \n http://www.fiu.edu/~donnelly/termpaperex1.pdf#search='plasticity%20body%20struc ture'\n \n ..... Flatworms (Phagocotus gracilis) were used as\n predators or predator chemical cues upon salamander larvae (Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma barbouri). The presence of the flatworms and their cues induced the eggs to delay their hatching time. This resulted in larger, and more advanced hatchlings. This finding supports the earlier field observations that the flatworm preyed heavily on smaller, less developed hatchlings. This shift in hatch time is adaptive and supports greater hatchling survival (Sih and Moore 1993).\n \n But not only that, but many animals can actually alter their COLOR based on predators.\n \n in response to the presence of a predatory dragonfly (Aesha umbrosa). The larvae that were reared in the presence of the predator differed in shape and in color than those that were reared in predator free environments. The treatments exposed tadpoles to tail damage and to chemical cues of the dragonfly feeding on conspecifics. The tadpoles responded plastically by altering their color and tail shape. The tail was extended, presumably increasing swimming speed and hence survivorship. The color change was seen in the tail. The appearance of color on the tail is thought to attract predatory attacks on the tail rather than on the body.\n \n So here we have a problem! David Reznick says that the guppies evolved through natural selection, yet we know that many animals can evolve instantly in the egg to accomplish the same thing. Same sets of genes. Different phenotypes. Genes don't dictate life. Life dictates genes. Evolutionists have it all backwards. \n \n And you know what the kicker is? This is not a mechanism that can be ADDED to the theory...as some might insist.....instead, it's a mechanism that REPLACES the whole theory. And the reason it replaces it is because it dismantles the need for selection - which is the lifeline of evolutionists. And the reason it dismantles selection is because God created every creature with this adaptive ability -- which gives them all the same traits and makes them all the same \"fitness\" upon the same environemental cue. \n \n Without selection, this theory withers on the vine.\n \n But this thing is really a double edge sword for you evolutionists. There are a couple more things about the article that I find interesting.\n \n The first is this: Notice how Mr. Reznick calls this \"Evolution.\"\n \n In a unique, real-world test of the theory of evolution, a National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported research team has demonstrated that animals can adapt to sudden changes in their environment with surprising speed.\n \n Why is this important? Because this implies whatever physiological changes happened, happened over generations. In otherwords, this was a heritable thing. It wasn't a study where Mr. Resnick set out to observe simple plasticity. No, his goal, as stated, was to study evolution. -and that's exactly what he saw.\n \n Thus, what we have is not an addition to Neodarwinism, but a substitution.\n \n Not only that....but if you are to believe \"every paleontologist since Cuvier\" you would also have to acknowledge that the fossil record does not show a gradual change in animals. On the contrary, it shows long periods of stasis, interupted by short periods of rapid physiological change upon an enviornmental shift.\n \n Gould states...\n \n The fundamental reason why a lot of paleontologists don't care much for gradualism is because the fossil record doesn't show gradual change and every paleontologist has known that ever since Cuvier. If you want to get around that you have to invoke the imperfection of the fossil record. Every paleontologist knows that most species don't change. That's bothersome if you are trained to believe that evolution ought to be gradual. In fact it virually precludes your studying the very process you went into the school to study. Again, because you don't see it, that brings terrible distress.\" Steven Jay Gould\n \n \"The fossil record is full of gaps and disconinuities, but they are all attributed to the notorious imperfection of the fossil record. The fossil record is imperfect, but I think that is not an adequate explanation...one thing it does show that cannot be attributed to its imperfection is that most species don't change...they may get a little bigger or bumpier but they remain the same species and that's not due to imperfection and gaps but stasis. And yet this remarkable stasis has generally been ignored as no data. If they don't change, it's not evolution so you don't talk about it. Steven Jay Gould\n \n And guess what we see with the guppies? We see a rapid physiological change upon an enviornmental cue.\n \n Finally, in the article, Reznick does make the following brilliant observation with which I agree with totally:\n \n Such studies are important because people tend to think of evolution as a historical process that is not subject to experiments. It is the scarcity of experiments that is the source of some of the criticism of the theory.\n \n That is the understatement of the century. THIS is why evolutionists don't do these types of tests....because they EXPOSE themselves when they do them. \n \n This theory of evolution is nothing but a made-up piece of baloney. They've replaced God's plan of giving each creature adaptive abilities, which help them fit in with a changing environment, with a twisted plan that requires death (before breeding) to any creature that happens to be unfit.\n \n This is the beautiful truth...and evolutionists simply cannot get around it. That's why most evolutionists would probably just assume people like David Reznick keep their mouths shut.",

   "The theory of evolution does not demand it take place at any particular pace... in stable conditions we expect it to usually take place very slowly, in conditions of great change, eg the introduction of new predators, climate change, much faster..\n \n No biologist denies that organisms can change their physical characteristics for reasons unrelated to their gene pool, for example, people can become obese by eating large quantities of food (One of God's Beautiful Miracles nodoubt), the idea that this \"disproves\" evolution has no basis in fact at all.\n \n The only thing you have proven (yet again) is your complete ignorance of something you spend a lot of time talking about. Try shutting your mouth and opening a book once in a while.\n \n The key to understanding that evolution, not some vague notion of plasticity is responsible for these particular changes is the fact they took place over the span of generations. Once dropped in a pool with fewer predators, fish did not transform instantaneously into larger creatures that lived longer - nor did their children, the change took place bit by bit over generatios. The \"plasticity\" theory cannot explain why the 7th generation fish exhibited more of these characteristics than the 4th generation fish.",

Each animal has an adaptive phenotype so that they can multiply and fill the earth by spreading out into many different environments and habitats.

Have you ever noticed how neo-darwinists never even discuss adaptive phenotypes or the ability of new traits to arise during development via the environment? Never. Oh, occasionally you might hear the word \"saltationism\" or \"Lamarckism\" thrown about in a negative tone, but evolutionists rarely have the guts to face reality to dive into these subjects deeply. In fact, I have never read an in-debth discussion about plasticity or environmentally induced biological changes in a neo-darwinist's book. And it's not that these people are dumb.....They're just simply too afraid to go there, in fear of planting seeds in people's minds. Their whole world-view depends on people's faith in their thoery -- and that there are no reasonable alternatives. So they just play like the alternative isn't there. \n \n But if it can shown that animals' evolve/change in a different way than what evolutionists say, then their theory must be overthrown. They say the evolution of new traits happens gradually through the population over thouands/millions of years through random mutation via selection...I say it happens instantly, within the lifetime of the individual animal...no selection needed. \n \n I also say new traits emerge in offspring nonrandomly in response to environmental cues. These traits form during development or even afterwards during the lifetime of the animal. New traits can be a result of plasticity or in the form of mutation during development. If the mutation occurs in somatic cells, only the individual (parent) organism is affected. If the mutation occurs in the germ cell, the mutation may pass on to the next generation -- though not necessarily expressed in the parent in which it arose.",
