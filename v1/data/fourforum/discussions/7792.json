   "Poll finds U.S. warming to gay marriage\n Opposition off 12% since '04 -- support for adoption, military role is up nationally\n \n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/23/MNGAOHSE4I1.DTL\n Opposition to same-sex marriage dropped sharply across the country during the past two years, though just over half of Americans still oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center released Wednesday.\n That's a remarkable improvement over the last two years. It's not really surprising. People can see that marriage in Massachusetts hasn't brought ruin.\n \n The continuing problem, of course, is that most people don't vote, so the GOP tactic of demonizing gay people will continue to drive those opposed to same-sex marriage to the polls in disproportionate numbers.\n \n Still, it's good news on several issues.",

   "The point of my initial post (besides presenting the lastest polling data) is that those opposed to same-sex marriage are just barely a majority. Of those, many are reflexively opposed (just as some are reflexively in favor). \n \n The difference between polling and voting data is that the most rigidly opposed are more likely to vote because the GOP stirs them up (intentionally). And, mostly, because MOST people don't vote -- pretty pathetic in a democracy, but whatchagonnado? \n \n Gay people DO need to figure out how to counteract that group's disproportionate influence.
