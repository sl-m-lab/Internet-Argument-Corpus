   "Have you heard European Commission had arrived at a decision to invest 130,000 euro in independent radio and television broadcasting in the territory of Byelorussia? Lol When I've learned about it I thought, \"Yeah, yeah, right, go ahead stupid XXXXXX.\" They said the project would be implemented by Deutsche Welle - Germany's International Broadcaster. I don't know maybe the to-be \"orange revolution\" is well within the interests of official Berlin but what I know for sure is that the shrewd and meticulous businessmen of Germany didn't take into account that they would merely chuck away money as it is an absolutely dead business. This losing business will never pay off I tell you. Just look, in 1999 there was an independent oppositional Radio Racja in Byelorussia. Two years later it went bankrupt and was closed down owing about $700,000 to Telekomunikacja Polska broadcasting company and ZUS retirement fund. Now you see it? True, Germany shouldn't have succumbed to persuasion of Poland and America. They just want to make a revolution with the use of Germany laying the expenses on it and giving nothing in exchange (the way it was in Ukraine). I bet it will be all the same in Byelorussia! Germany won't be represented in the market in any serious rate because it had been apriori shared among Polish and American companies. It's fulish to think this stupid broadcasting in Byelorussia will change anything for Germany. Our future lies in business relations with Russia!",
