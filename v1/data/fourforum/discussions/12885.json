   "Louisiana voters could be allowed to change the constitutionally protected freedom of religion under legislation that narrowly passed the state Senate Wednesday.\n \n House Bill 340, sponsored by state Rep. Cameron Henry, R-Jefferson, attempts to \"clarify\" the state Constitution's provision for the free exercise of religion, according to proponents of the bill.\n \n Opponents say the constitutional amendment, which voters would have to approve, actually muddies the water and opens the state to lawsuits.\n \n State Sen. Nick Gautreaux, D-Meaux, who was handling HB340 in the Senate on Wednesday, cited cases of people being stopped from ringing church bells, handing out leaflets or speaking publicly about their faith.\n \n State Sen. Dan Claitor, R-Baton Rouge, noted few such problems have come up in Louisiana and none has made it to the state Supreme Court.\n ....\n \n Previously, the government had to prove it had a \"compelling interest\" before infringing on the religious rights of a person, Ghetti said. But after a case in 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the \"compelling interest test\" would only apply to laws that specifically target religion, she said.\n \n All other laws and ordinances would be subject to a \"rational basis test,\" \"which tends to be no protection at all under the various cases that have been brought,\" Ghetti told a Senate committee last week.\n \n Ghetti said that one other state, Alabama, has amended its Constitution to spell out the \"compelling interest test.\" A number of other states have changed their statutes or their state Supreme Courts' have supported the test, she said.\n \n Gene Mills, executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum, lobbied senators along the sides of the chamber. Family Forum is a nonprofit group whose stated mission is to \"persuasively present biblical principles in the centers of influence.\"\n \n He said in an interview that courts will sort out the examples given by opponents by weighing the merits and assessing if a religious belief is \"sincerely held.\"\n \n \"I don't think smoking from a bong is a new religious tradition, based on case law and Louisiana tradition,\" Mills said. \"But a court will decide that.\"\n\n 2theadvocate.com | News | Religious freedom? &mdash; Baton Rouge, LA\n \n So if John, an atheist, breaks a law he goes to jail.\n But if Mark, an adherent to a religion, breaks the law and persuades the courts that he acted according to his religion, then that's okay???\n \n This is religious favoritism.\n Either the law is valid for EVERYBODY, regardless of religion...\n ... or it is invalid for everybody.\n \n Do we really want a court to start evaluating how \"sincere\" a religious belief truly is? And ignoring existing law because of it?",
