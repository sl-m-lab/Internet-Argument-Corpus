So as a result they don't play them against each other.\n But the distinction based on sexual orientation shouldn't have any bearing on ability.

For the \"only male\" leagues, it isn't really any examination of skill which eliminates women.\n \n \n \nSure. In point of fact, national teams don't necessarily only pick people who are from that nation. So this isn't really an issue.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n I am amazed at how some people's minds do that.\n Pretending that an exception to a situation somehow disproves the point of the very situation in the first place.\n While some national teams may pick people who are from other nations, MOST DO. It's part of the requirement in the first place.\n \n So if you've got 1 team that includes a foreigner, that doesn't disprove the point of 49 other teams that exclude all foreigners.\n \n \n \nThat's an issue that's dealt with by creating a whole league between women-only, and men-only.

So as a result they don't play them against each other.\n\n Again, you look at an exception to ignore the generic rule.\n \n There are MANY sports where no such advantage exists. But the sports are typically gender separated anyways.\n \n \n Another amusing thing is that the article noted TWO SEPARATE teams which were \"discriminatory\".\n Jyoshu noted the \"gay\" team. No doubt he would pick up on the \"gay\" thing.\n But the story also included a MUSLIM ONLY team. Discriminatory?\n \n But it's only the gay team that is complained about... emoticon_ic",

To make the statement \"We can be just as discriminatory as they can.\"? \n\n Actually, some people have questioned whether or not the group actually discriminates against straights in the first place.\n It is unknown whether or not straight players are forbidden from the team.\n \n \n \nI can't help but lol at them being discriminated against by a ISLAM team. Um there are no gays? They deserved that for trying to force themselves on another culture. I mean tolerance is all well and good but somethings are just common sense.\n\n \"force themselves on another culture\"?\n Routinely, I am struck by the absurdity of the assessments of some people.\n \n We're talking about people playing soccer against a team that has gays.\n For the Islam players, would you think THEY are \"trying to force themselves\" onto others by being in the league?\n :xbanghead\n \n As usual, when it comes to gays, some people adopt ridiculous standards.\n \n Obviously, \"tolerance\" would be a situation where two teams could play against each other.\n REFUSING to play another group, just cause they are gay, is an example of Islam NOT being tolerant.\n If another group refused to play the Islamic team, who would be the intolerant ones?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Why are simple assessments so tough for some people?\n \n \n \nNo different than someone trying to eat a hamburger (beef) in India. \n\n They aren't playing a soccer game \"in Islam\". :xbanghead\n Do you even bother to think about the REAL circumstances before shooting off your mouth?",

   "Wow.\n Talk about insisting that the forest ain't there because there are too many trees...\n \n What you're talking about, with \"marketability\", is a problem brought about by homophobia...\n \n If you were to talk about black athletes not being as marketable to whites, that would be recognized as a racist problem........\n\n \n I can see how it could be taken that way, but IMO, there's a difference between homophobia and exercising one's preference. Homophobia is an irrational fear, exercising one's preference isn't. \n For example, I have no desire to see a WNBA game. It isn't because I fear women, I just don't see the caliber of play being up to that of the NBA and therefore, spend my entertainment dollars elsewhere.\n \n IMO, marketing themselves as an \"all gay soccer team\" isn't going to get me rushing to the box office.",

   "I can see how it could be taken that way, but IMO, there's a difference between homophobia and exercising one's preference. Homophobia is an irrational fear, exercising one's preference isn't. \n\n Ahhh.\n Once again, I must educate right-wingers.\n \"-phobia\" does not mean JUST \"irrational fear\".\n \n homophobia: \n ** irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals\n xenophobia:\n ** fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign\n \n -phobia\n * 1 : exaggerated fear of <acrophobia<\n * 2 : intolerance or aversion for <photophobia<\n \n So you see, if somebody cannot watch a perfectly good player because he is gay, that IS homophobia. We should obviously recognize the situation as \"racist\" if the situation revolved around race, but for some reason you want to ignore the prejudice and proclaim it simply \"exercising one's preference\" while you ignore the prejudice that fuels that prejudice...\n \n \n \nFor example, I have no desire to see a WNBA game. It isn't because I fear women, I just don't see the caliber of play being up to that of the NBA and therefore, spend my entertainment dollars elsewhere.\n\n And likewise, if a player is an inferior player, obviously the issue would be the quality of the game regardless of the sexual orientation.\n But what we're talking about here is making the decision on SEXUAL ORIENTATION.\n NOT on the quality of play...\n \n As is customary, I have to explain a LOT when it comes to this issue cause for some reason some posters insist on muddling what is crystal clear.\n \n \n \nIMO, marketing themselves as an \"all gay soccer team\" isn't going to get me rushing to the box office.\n\n And what does \"gay\" mean about their capability to play the game?\n That's right. You don't know squat about their quality.\n \n You've made a judgment based solely on sexual orientation. Demonstrating your aversion to homosexuals.\n Ergo, homophobia...\n \n So yes. You can exercise your prejudiced preference.\n But don't try to pretend it's not about prejudice... emoticon_ic",
