   "I notice a lot of times in my opinion that a lot of movies that a sequels or trilogy (or any way, not the first one) most people say that they are never as good as the first one. Now granted, some movies should never have a sequel, like Armageddon, Titanic, ect. (Where would the sequel go in those, would it be worth it for anything other than a spoof.) I'd like to read opinions based upon movies where the sequel (or any part in a series) was better than the first. Or, were there movies that had a sequel that shouldn't have had a sequel.",

   "Really?? How could they do that and have it make any sense??\n\n Well I've heard that it was going to happen but then there are always rumors about movies coming out that never get made or brought out. For example, there was a movie made back in about '97 called The Fantastic 4. It was filmed but never released. It was not even brought out on tape or DVD. The movie that came out this last summer is actually the second movie made. Now Hollywood is always making sequels to movies that don't really work. (Home Alone 3 for example) It may work as a spinoff. One of the rumors I heard or read was that what happened was that Dr. Okin (Played by Brent Spiner) never really died. Maybe another group of aliens. Hey, there are plenty of more solar systems in the sky. Maybe it would be 2 groups of aliens. Maybe the ones from the first movie mixed with the aliens from the Aliens series. Something like Alien VS Preditor only Alien VS Independence Day. (AVI - Whoever wins, we blow up.) :p Maybe it would be like a spoof. Something like AF1 - April Fools Day (Now that would be worth it. :p) Over all, I don't know if it will be done or how it would be done. It could take place a few years later.",
