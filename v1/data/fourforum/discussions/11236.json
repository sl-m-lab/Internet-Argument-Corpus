   "Dear Irmo Nation, \n In March I told our faculty and staff, PTSO Board, and SIC that I would be remaining at Irmo High school for two more years. I was committed to stay through the 2009-2010 school year. I am currently in good health, am excited about the future of Irmo High school, am making new friends every day, and continuing to learn from my student heroes on a daily basis. In short I am excited about coming to work every day. \n However due to a recent conflict involving my professional and religious beliefs I sent Dr. Angela Bain a letter of resignation effective June 30, 2009. On May 14, 2008, I was instructed by email to allow the formation of a Gay/Straight Alliance Club at Irmo High School. On May 15, 2008 I told Ms. Ann Pilat to allow the formation of this club for the 2008-2009 school year. Allowing the formation of this club on our campus conflicts with my professional beliefs and religious convictions. I considered resigning this year but reconsidered because to not fulfill my written contract for the 2008-2009 school year would also conflict with my professional beliefs and religious convictions. In my opinion failure to fulfill my contract would constitute a breach of trust with School District Five of Lexington and Richland County, my student heroes, returning Irmo High School employees, and new employees who have chosen to work at Irmo High school for the 2008-2009 school year. \n The formation of this club conflicts with my professional beliefs in that we do not have other clubs at Irmo High school based on sexual orientation, sexual preference, or sexual activity. In fact our sex education curriculum is abstinence based. I feel the formation of a Gay/Straight Alliance Club at Irmo High school implies that students joining the club will have chosen to or will choose to engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, opposite sex, or members of both sexes. \n I plan to tell our students via the intercom on Wednesday, May 21, 2008 that 2008-2009 will be my last year as Principal of Irmo High School. I don't plan to go into detail but simply plan to let them know that I will be graduating with the class of 2008-2009 next year. I don't intend to make a big deal out of this. Lets get it over quick so we can close this year and have a great 2008-2009 school year. I intend to work with you and our students to make 2008-2009 the best year in our illustrious history. It is very important to me that the club sponsor and all students who join this club receive Golden Rule treatment from everyone. \n My decision to resign is a personal choice based on my professional beliefs and religious convictions. I have prayed about the decision for a period of time and I have a peace about it. I would ask that you respect my choice as I respect your choice to disagree with me on this issue. I bear no malice towards anyone involved. If the people involved at the district level had chosen not to allow the club to form I am sure the district would have been sued and the current legal opinions and precedents indicate that in all likelihood the district would have lost. \n Sincerely, \n Eddie Walker: Class of 2008-2009 http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=8356379\n \n I would hazard a guess that the principal has no problem being a principal in a school that HAS gay teen-agers.\n But a club ACKNOWLEDGING their existence is too much...\n \n I feel there are significant points that he just plain misses the boat on (above and beyond his overall stance on gays).\n 1) \"we do not have other clubs at Irmo High school based on sexual orientation ...\"\n Really?\n Do you have Prom? Homecoming?\n Do you elect a prom King and Queen?\n Do kids typically \"get dates\" for these dances? And would you balk at suddenly finding a gay couple attending when you want heterosexual couples?\n \n 2) \"our sex education curriculum is abstinence based\"\n \"formation of GSA Club at Irmo High school implies that students joining the club will have chosen to or will choose to engage in sexual activity...\"\n The point of abstinence would appear to be that kids wait for marriage \"to engage in sexual activity\".\n If you ask these kids who are taught abstinence if they intend on never having sex, would you count each \"yes\" as a failure?\n The GSA club is just about what gender a person is attracted to. There is nothing inconsistent with being gay and taking an abstinence pledge, or being a member of a GSA club and taking an abstinence pledge.\n \n 3) If a \"Jewish\" club were to start up, which would obviously conflict with a Christian belief (violating the first commandment), we wouldn't expect people to see it as a \"moral\" problem, or expect a principal to resign over such a club.\n But with sexual orientation and a club where people JUST SAY that they are gay, that's a problem.\n I don't understand the rational behind such a different response.\n \n \n But finally, kudos to the principal for making one thing clear: \"It is very important to me that the club sponsor and all students who join this club receive Golden Rule treatment from everyone.\"\n Hopefully Eddie never has to run into a problem where a different authority figure decides that they have to publicly resign because they can't stop Eddie from starting up a Christian club ...",

Sounds to me like I'd want you gone now.\n \n \nThe formation of this club conflicts with my professional beliefs in that we do not have other clubs at Irmo High school based on sexual orientation, sexual preference, or sexual activity.\n\n What, you want a Straight/Straight Alliance, too? No, we all know that you don't; you just don't want a Gay/Straight Alliance because you're a bigot.\n See also foundit's point about Homecoming/Prom King & Queen vs. King & King or Queen & Queen.\n \n \nIn fact our sex education curriculum is abstinence based.\n\n So your sex education curriculum is ineffective. Why don't you do something about that instead of whining?\n \n \nI feel the formation of a Gay/Straight Alliance Club at Irmo High school implies that students joining the club will have chosen to or will choose to engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, opposite sex, or members of both sexes.\n\n Then (1) you're a complete f***ing idiot, and (2) it's not your business. Why don't you sit in on a meeting and see how many times \"You know, I would have stayed abstinent, but joining this club has convinced me to sleep around\" gets declared.\n A rather religious teacher I work with pointed out that schools could do nothing better to lay out the red carpet for a night of drinking and sex than host a formal dance (often at a nice hotel ballroom) and let the kids make a big deal out of it. And it happens at damn near every high school in the country. According to your website, it happens at yours, too. But you didn't resign over that, did you?\n \n \nI don't intend to make a big deal out of this. Lets get it over quick so we can close this year and have a great 2008-2009 school year.\n\n What a crock. You're resigning, and you're pretending that you don't intend to make a big deal out of it. You're making an intercom announcement about your resignation that will occur more than one year in the future\n \n \nI have prayed about the decision for a period of time and I have a peace about it.\n\n And your peace is to be a homophobic bigot. So be it.\n \n \nIf the people involved at the district level had chosen not to allow the club to form I am sure the district would have been sued and the current legal opinions and precedents indicate that in all likelihood the district would have lost.\n\n \"Current legal opinions and precedents\"? You mean THE LAW, you numbskull. You're allowed to be a bigoted, homophobic XXXXX, but everyone has the right not to be oppressed by your stupidity.\n \n I hope that you never get a job in administration again.",

Quitting over a student club seems extreme. He could just say that he disagrees with having this club at the school, but people have different views, and he could accept that and not throw his job away. \n \n It seems unlikely that this principal will ever find a public school to serve that reflects his religious beliefs entirely.
