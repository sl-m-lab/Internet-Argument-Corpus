   "Actually Chaves might be up to something, the press reports are all in Dutch and I couldn't find an English report all that quick, but this thing I graciously stole from a googled webbie explains the current chess-play ;)\n \n \nMarch 1, 2006: Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has been making noises about running the Dutch out of nearby Caribbean islands, areas that the Netherlands have owned for centuries. In response, the Dutch are trying to orchestrate a suitable, and scary, message for Chavez. The Dutch are trying to get the United States to make a port call with an aircraft carrier, and its accompanying warships, at one of their Caribbean islands. This would be part of a series of \"messages\" that they're sending to Venezuela. An additional \"message\" is an invitation to the Venezuelans to take part in a navy/marine exercise that the Dutch are going to run in the Caribbean later this year. This will have U.S., British, French, and even Swedish participation, primarily as a way of demonstrating that if Chavez pulls something against the Dutch-owned islands, he may get a bloody nose. Even without the port call, it's unlikely that the United States would just stand by if Venezuela made a move on Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n \n [edited] I've read up a bit on it, and it seems to be mostly back-and-forth namecalling, the Netherlands are \"imperialist pawns of Bush\", that sort of thing. So few media sources actually picked up on it",

   "There is a safeguard agains $100+ oil barrels, at least for the coming decades: CANADA!\n \n I kid you not, Canada has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, but most of it's oil is locked in a substance called tar sands. This is alot more expensive to extract oil from than the traditional way. Many fear it's an assault on nature to extract, but at oil prices being what they are, and few willing to give up our current lifestyle, it's actually becoming a real consideration to develop.\n \n I'd rather see a serious attempt to develop viable alternatives to the current oil consumption, though.",

History shows that regime change in the Latin American does not come through direct Military intervention but in support for Right wing Military coups which usually topple a left wing Democratically Elected Government.\n \n So if I where Chavez I would be more worried about a military coup of some kinds.",
