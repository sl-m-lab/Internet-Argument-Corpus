   "\"Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told The Associated Press that the large black doll was found Saturday morning along Main Street in the small town of Plains. Footage from WALB-TV shows the doll was hanging by a noose in front of a red, white and blue sign that says 'Plains, Georgia. Home of Jimmy Carter, our 39th President.' A witness told the station that the doll had a sign with Obama's name on it. Mayor L.E. Godwin III says the volunteer fire department was called to take it down. He says he saw the doll but couldn't read the signs.\"\n \n \n \n FBI Investigating Obama Effigy Hanging on Plains, GA Main Street - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men",
