   "Merry Christmas, XCaliber!\n \n Answering Bible Contradictions: Theological Conflicts\n\n \n \n LMAO.. Nice try.. However you should know...\n \n If you tell me the sky is blue and then turn around later and tell me the sky is green that is a Contradiction. You can spin words however you like, it doesn't change the FACT that it is a Contradiction.\n \n First... Going by YOUR reply and the link you sent me you are fully aware of the Contradictions in your Book of Fairy Tales. If you believed there were none you would not attempt to explain them away...\n \n Second... A Perfect being such as your God would be incapable of doing anything imperfect. So, your Book , if it was indeed the Inspired words from the Invisible man would actually make sense, and would most surly not contradict , yet they do...\n \n So, Merry Christmas again, Now you're going down the path of the REAL truth, I hope it helps.",
