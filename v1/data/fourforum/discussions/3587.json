   "a very interesting article I came across endorses bush's method in the war against terror over kerry's\n \n \nJohn Kerry's response to Osama bin Laden's Friday tape tells us all we need to know about his understanding of the present war. He assures us that he will spare no effort to hunt down and capture or kill every terrorist. That is the law enforcement model of the war on terror.\n \n There are approximately a billion Muslims and conservative estimates put the number of potential terrorists in the tens of millions. Ten million would represent one percent of the world Muslim population.\n \n Is John Kerry going to hunt down and capture or kill ten million people? How long would it take to capture or kill ten million terrorists one by one? Let's see: Let's say he got five a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year. How long would it take to get them all? Ten years? Fifty? No, it would take 5,479 YEARS.\n\n obviously, if you dont look past the asurdity that assumes kerry plans to kill 10 million muslims, you'd think kerry's plan is stupid. sadly, its absurd. nobody is going to kill 10 million muslims simply because they could possibly be potential terrorists. the terrorists in the middle east are organized into known and visible groups. these are the terrorists that should be killed without delay. incidentally, NONE of these groups are or ever were in iraq...\n \n \nGeorge Bush's model is quite different. He understands that terrorist organizations cannot exist without state sponsorship. They need somewhere to live, somewhere to conduct training camps, they need money. If they cannot find hospitable countries, these organizations will wither away and die. You don't need to capture or kill ten million people.You need to remove the conditions under which their organizations flourish.\n\n this is one of the most narrow-minded and uninformed analyses of terrorist activity i have ever seen. let's take a look at al qaeda, for example. they have within their organization the means to fund their operations without any state sponsorship. as a matter of fact, it was al qaeda that was supporting the taliban, not the other way around. al qaeda is a multi-national network. they are not aligned with any particular country. from all research and intelligence gathered, there has not been a single monetary transaction between saddam and al qaeda. saddam wasnt supporting al qaeda, al qaeda was not supporting iraq. by installing a democracy in iraq, where no terrorists ever were, how could that possibly affect al qaeda, or any of the other terrorist networks? the author of this article clearly has no clue who the enemy is or how the enemy operates. yet this is the sentiment shared by nearly all invasion supporters\n \n go figure...",

That job is left to the intellegence/law enforcement community. \n \n From what I have seen, the majority of Al-Qeada members and supporters are in the Afghan/Pakistan area. Whole provinces in Pakistan look to bin Laden as a hero. Now, where the operatives are is another question. Yeah, I'm sure they are well spread. I would wager that they are now in places we'd never suspect, obscure countries that we have little influence over, or at least countries where is it easiest to hide these things. But, they are spread out all over the place.\n \n I don't have any references to Bush's personal efforts. I don't think we hear about any covert ops going on because then they wouldn't be covert. \n \n The point I was trying to make was that the US is fighting Al-Qeada as best we can. We don't see it on the news because we are all wrapped up in Iraq and the election (which is heated because of Iraq). Changing presidents isn't going to fundamentally change how we fight AQ, which is through intellegence and law enforcement means. \n \n I was really bringing it up because we get commercials here that say Kerry wants to fight terrorism through intellegence/law enforcement and because of that \"he doesn't understand the threat.\" But, the fact is that we are fighting terrorism in exactly that way. The invasion of Afghanistan wasn't entirely necessary to fight AQ, but it was effective in scattering them and killing a lot of them. I think it would have happened regardless of who's president (and regardless of the fact that we killed twice the number of civilians than died on 9/11.)\n \n What happened to the bin Laden thread?\n \n \n .",

But, they are spread out all over the place.\n\n this is exactly what the reports would have us believe. in reality, the greater part of the al qaeda network lies in the saudi peninsula and egypt. in these states you have the highest concentration of fundamentalist and jihad-ready muslims. jordan, syria and pallestine also make it no secret about their ties and support of al qaeda. i'm not saying that the presence in afghanistan and pakistan wasnt significant, but the reports are terribly distorted. think about this: could funding for al qaeda operations come from pakistan and afghanistan alone?\n \n \nI don't have any references to Bush's personal efforts.

Changing presidents isn't going to fundamentally change how we fight AQ, which is through intellegence and law enforcement means. \n\n i think you'd agree that we are obviously doing more to maintain our occupancy in iraq than to fight al qaeda. are we putting half the resources used in iraq towards fighting al qaeda? quarter? a tenth? i'd bet the farm (as jim would say) that we arent doing a fraction of what what we can in the fight against al qaeda. the fact that so many people looked perplexed when they saw bin laden alive is testimony to how misleading the reports are.\n \n \nI was really bringing it up because we get commercials here that say Kerry wants to fight terrorism through intellegence/law enforcement and because of that \"he doesn't understand the threat.\" But, the fact is that we are fighting terrorism in exactly that way.

I think it would have happened regardless of who's president (and regardless of the fact that we killed twice the number of civilians than died on 9/11.)\n\n twice? i heard estimates of above 30,000 iraqi casualties. and its not like we \"got back at iraq\" for the 9/11 tragedy. we could have just as well killed any 3000 innocent arabs and called it even...\n \n the question is, what does the bush administration (sponsors of those ads) plan to do about fighting al qaeda, seeing as they \"understand the threat\"? if they admit on national television that fighting al qaeda through intelligence is a bad idea, then how exactly are they fighting al qaeda?\n \n i agree with invading afghhanistan. frankly i hoped for harder and more sudden strikes. bush's stalling for time by asking the taliban to hand bin laden over was what was unnecessary if you ask me. bin laden had already struck hard and suddenly, it was only fitting to return the same courtesy back to him. but, i guess bush \"understood the threat\" better than us simple civilians did...\n \n \nWhat happened to the bin Laden thread?\n\n people on this board (particularly bush supporters) avoid talking about bin laden, especially since bush himself makes it a habit to avoid talking about bin laden. his topic avoidance stategy goes something like this:\n \n Q: so mr president, what actions are you going to take against bin laden?\n bush: i plan to hunt terrorism wherever it may rear its ugly head\n Q: yes, but how do you plan to defeat al qaeda\n bush: can you see? we're winning the war against terror\n Q: we might be winning in iraq, but what does that have to do with bin laden?\n bush: you see, terror comes in many forms. my plan is to rid the world of terror, regardless of the form it takes\n ari: thank you, no futher questions\n *press cheers for bush's strong stand on the war on terror*",
