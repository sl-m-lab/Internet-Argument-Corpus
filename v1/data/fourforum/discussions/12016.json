   "I'll weigh in on this one...\n \n I always get a hoot out of those that are proponents of requiring civilians who wish to hold a concealed carry permit to meet the same training requirements as law enforcement. It really would surprise most people to know just how under trained law enforcement is when it comes to actual firearms law and use. \n \n The reasons for this are many, but chief among them is simply that it requires too much time and money. The average police academy lasts about six months. During this time, the course of study encompasses a vast array of subjects and unfortunately firearms law and use falls short in importance to other subject matter. \n \n Our department requires officers to qualify twice a year and to attend recurrent training once a year. The qualification course is not terribly difficult and is much less intensive than I would prefer. As for practice, the department will provide one hundred rounds of ammo per month for each officer. Any additional practice is at the expense of the individual officer.\n \n A great number of police officers are not firearms enthusiasts, thus they do not take it upon themselves to maintain proficiency. In this regard, they are very similar to the average gun owner that gets limited, if any training, and only practices rarely.\n \n In contrast to this, there are officers that are true firearms enthusiasts that are highly proficient in both firearms handling and use. If I were to guess, based on what i see within my own department as an instructor, the latter group makes up less than 40% of our officers. That is not terribly encouraging.\n \n Along the same line, there is a difference between the average (civilian) gun owner and the true firearms enthusiast. The true enthusiast seeks out training (often at great expense), frequently visits the range for practice, and are frequently involved in competitive shooting, where safety, speed and accuracy are all of critical importance to be competitive. This type of gun owner is, in my opinion, what the average should aspire to be. These people often display a level of knowledge and proficiency that would shame many military special forces operatives. Because of this level of competency, I would have full confidence in this type of gun owner in about any situation. Unfortunately, this group is probably not the majority group either. \n \n While I do believe that the majority of gun owners are responsible and reasonably safe, I ALWAYS encourage additional training and practice for anyone. I also encourage those who do not, and have no desire to own a gun to at least take a basic safety course. I recommend this for many reasons, but chief among them is that no harm can come from the knowledge of safe handling of a firearm, yet disaster is born from a lack of knowledge in this arena. Even if you never intend to own a gun, you may find yourself in a situation in which you have little choice but to handle one. Just as an example...you go outside to your front yard to find that your child and his friends have found a gun somewhere in the neighborhood...Wouldn't you prefer to know how to take charge of the situation and ensure the safety of all involved? Or would you prefer to rely on what you have seen on TV to guide you?\n \n As for trusting LE in preference to civilians, I have never seen any evidence that shows LE is safer, or more trustworthy with firearms. I have however met many civilians that I would trust far more than a fair number of police officers that I have met. When you get right down to it, I do not believe that we (Law Enforcement) are any more trustworthy than the general populace, yet I would also say that the reverse is true.\n \n JW",

   "Mumbai photographer: I wish I'd had a gun, not a camera. Armed police would not fire back - World news, News - Belfasttelegraph.co.uk\n \n \nIt is the photograph that has dominated the world's front pages, casting an astonishing light on the fresh-faced killers who brought terror to the heart of India's most vibrant city. Now it can be revealed how the astonishing picture came to be taken by a newspaper photographer who hid inside a train carriage as gunfire erupted all around him.\n \n Sebastian D'Souza, a picture editor at the Mumbai Mirror, whose offices are just opposite the city's Chhatrapati Shivaji station, heard the gunfire erupt and ran towards the terminus. \"I ran into the first carriage of one of the trains on the platform to try and get a shot but couldn't get a good angle, so I moved to the second carriage and waited for the gunmen to walk by,\" he said. \"They were shooting from waist height and fired at anything that moved. I briefly had time to take a couple of frames using a telephoto lens. I think they saw me taking photographs but theydidn't seem to care.\"\n \n The gunmen were terrifyingly professional, making sure at least one of them was able to fire their rifle while the other reloaded. By the time he managed to capture the killer on camera, Mr D'Souza had already seen two gunmen calmly stroll across the station concourse shooting both civilians and policemen, many of whom, he said, were armed but did not fire back. \"I first saw the gunmen outside the station,\" Mr D'Souza said. \"With their rucksacks and Western clothes they looked like backpackers, not terrorists, but they were very heavily armed and clearly knew how to use their rifles.\n \n \"Towards the station entrance, there are a number of bookshops and one of the bookstore owners was trying to close his shop,\" he recalled. \"The gunmen opened fire and the shopkeeper fell down.\"\n \n But what angered Mr D'Souza almost as much were the masses of armed police hiding in the area who simply refused to shoot back. \"There were armed policemen hiding all around the station but none of them did anything,\" he said. \"At one point, I ran up to them and told them to use their weapons. I said, 'Shoot them, they're sitting ducks!' but they just didn't shoot back.\"\n \n As the gunmen fired at policemen taking cover across the street, Mr D'Souza realised a train was pulling into the station unaware of the horror within. \"I couldn't believe it. We rushed to the platform and told everyone to head towards the back of the station. Those who were older and couldn't run, we told them to stay put.\"\n \n The militants returned inside the station and headed towards a rear exit towards Chowpatty Beach. Mr D'Souza added: \"I told some policemen the gunmen had moved towards the rear of the station but they refused to follow them. What is the point if having policemen with guns if they refuse to use them? I only wish I had a gun rather than a camera.\"\n\n \n What's the point of only allowing police to have guns, if they're unwilling to use them to do their job?",

Multiple single events fare no better compared to the huge numbers of police in the country than just one single event.\n \n Although, if you do want this to be used as evidence, it would be interesting to see how it compared to NATO's claims about gun-induced police violence from the other thread...\n\n \n Then show me this \"statistical probabilty\".",

You're trying to prove that police are less trustworthy, it's your job to provide the data. Without it, all we have is the knowing nothing (our base state, which assumes that the police are just like everyone else) and my and flyboys statements that the police get mandatory firearms training and testing, which lends weight to my argument.\n \n I seriously recommend reading the burden of proof topic before you make another post related to a source.",

   "While training for law enforcement is compulsory, it must be kept in mind that a typical law enforcement officer is far more likely to be engaged in a violent encounter than the typical civilian is. Furthermore, law enforcement is charged with a responsibility that far exceeds that of the average person. We are the ones that are placed between the criminal element and the rest of society in the hope of reducing the effects of crime. The average person has no obligation to intervene in a violent encounter, aside from the defense of their own person.\n \n Although I do encourage training for everyone (even those who do not own a firearm), making training mandatory has it's own pitfalls. When training for the average individual is mandated by government, it becomes far too easy for that same government to make the training too expensive, too inaccessible or even impossible to obtain. This is a path that I believe is best left untaken.\n \n JW",
