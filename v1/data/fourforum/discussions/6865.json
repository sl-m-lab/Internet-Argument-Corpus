In the meantime if you see them on the street corner, ignore them. Make it look like you don't even care. If they see that enough people are realising the truth they will eventually stop.

I support you 100% to stop them. \n \n How can people be so selfish as to undermine the safety of free people. Why is there so much hate towards single groups of people? Why must we always find a group of people to harm, or make fun of? Once again I support your move to stop this insanity.\n \n One tip.

There is nothing to go to court for here. This club is promoting music with a call to murder, shoot,pour acid and burn people. This is not a first ammendment right. It is a call for others to commit a crime. Not protected speech.

The message being sent by this music (Buju Banton) has a direct call to murder someone.

The lyrics are appalling......here are some samples....\n \n Beenie Man's hit tune \"Damn\" includes the line \"I'm dreaming of a new Jamaica, come to execute all the XXXXXX.\" His song \"Han up Deh\" includes the words: \"Hang chi chi gal wid a long piece of rope\" (hang XXXXX women with a long piece of rope). Another Beenie Man track is called \"Bad Man, Chi Chi Man.\" \"Chi chi\" man is a derogatory Jamaican patios insult, similar to XXXXXX, poof, and XXXXX.

   "Beenie Man and Buju Banton Frequently Asked Questions\n \n What is the problem with these performers?\n \n Reggae singers Beenie Man and Bujo Banton are both scheduled to perform at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in November. Both performers sell music that calls for the murder of gays and/or lesbians. Beenie Man's hit tune \"Damn\" includes the line \"I'm dreaming of a new Jamaica, come to execute all the XXXXXX.\" His song \"Han up Deh\" includes the words: \"Hang chi chi gal wid a long piece of rope\" (hang XXXXX women with a long piece of rope). Another Beenie Man track is called \"Bad Man, Chi Chi Man.\" \"Chi chi\" man is a derogatory Jamaican patios insult, similar to XXXXXX, poof, and XXXXX. The lyrics of \"Bad Man, Chi Chi Man\" include the exhortation that if you see a gay DJ, run him off the stage like a clown, kill him: \"Yuh see im to run off a stage like a clown, kill dem DJ!\" Buju Banton's hit song \"Boom Boom Bye\" threatens gay men with a \"gunshot in the head.\" Furthermore, according to the international Human Rights Watch, Buju Banton was suspected of involvement in physical attacks on gay men in Jamaica last year.\n \n Doesn't the First Amendment protect the rights of these men to say what they want?\n \n Yes, it does-the First Amendment guarantees the right to free speech absent incitements to violence. It does not, however, guarantee the right to get PAID for one's speech. Beenie Man and Buju Banton can speak out against gays as much as they want, but we don't have to let them profit from that speech. Lupo's is not a government entity and is free to book, or not book, whomever it chooses. An establishment's refusal to book Beenie Man and Buju Banton does not suppress their free speech-it suppresses their ability to get paid for what they say. And in America, it's perfectly legal and morally just to refuse to let people profit from hate speech.\n \n I heard that Beenie Man apologized for his lyrics-isn't that enough?\n \n Well, first of all, his apology wasn't really an apology. He said he was sorry \"if he offended anyone.\" Furthermore, reports indicate that Beenie Man's public relations manager denied the apology, stating, \"that it was initiated by Virgin Records not by Beenie Man, and that Beenie Man reserved his right to continue criticizing 'the homosexual lifestyle', of which he does not approve.\" \n \n But I contacted Lupo's, and they indicated that Beenie Man and Buju Banton wouldn't perform any anti-gay lyrics. If they agree not to talk about the issue, shouldn't they be allowed to perform?\n \n As with all musicians, concert tours are designed to promote the singer, not just the music played at a particular concert. Both performers still rake in royalties from their gay-bashing music, which is readily available on the Internet and in most stores; the profits from that music will simply increase as local clubs promote them. Lupo's seems to believe that it's okay for these performers to have music out there that glorifies the oppression and torture of others, so long as they promise not to oppress and torture in Lupo's presence. We would like Lupo's to understand that the Rhode Island community will not spend its money in clubs where that philosophy prevails.",

   "I would first like to comment on the 1st amendment.\n \n In this country, the 1st amendment is set to protect the speech that offends. Why doesn't it affect the speech that doesn't offend, you may ask. It doesn't protect speech that doesn't offend because the speech that doesn't offend doesn't really need protecting. For example; Mr. Rogers (the now late Mr. Rogers) had freedom of speech. But there was no argument about it because Mr. Rogers hardly ever offended anyone. (For anyone who doesn't know, I'm talking about the young-child-TV-show guru who always wore a sweater and had a trolley and had a show on most PBS stations.) Now on the other hand, Eminem (The Oscar winning white rapper) also has freedom of speech and it is argued over. Eminem does offend people and therefor, is protected by the freedom of speech. And I believe that the \"Freedom Of Speech\" would be on the Jamaican artist side as long as they don't say something bad in this country about the Bush administration. Back in the early 70s, I believe it was, John Lennon and Yoko Ono were in the US and said something bad about the Nixon administration, and then got their VISAs taken away and sent back to England.\n \n Second, I would like to comment on the Boycott/Ban.\n \n The idea of something getting banned or boycotted (especially in the music industry) actually has a reverse effect. Elvis (Presley, not Costello) was practically banned in the mid 50s (because of moves that were at the time considered \"too black\") and has become a rock icon. Or even among DJs, the Ban doesn't really stop people. Howard Stern has gotten banned a few times and therefor is going to Satellite Radio. He still has a following.\n \n Now to be totally honest, most of the artist who have gotten themselves or a song banned from airplay have gotten banned for stupid reasons IMO. Probibly the stupidist and funniest was that Bob Dylan got banned. It was okay if someone sang a cover of one of his songs but he wasn't allowed to sing the song over some Texas radio stations because no one could understand what he was saying.\n \n Anyway, does what I said make sence?

But frequently I hear \"that's not protected speech\", of course that just means \"that offends me\". People say that the f word isn't protected speech frequently.\n \n \n\n \n Just a few corrections on the First Ammendment.\n \n Though the text of the First Amendment limits only Congress' ability to abridge speech, the courts have interpreted the First Amendment as being applicable to any \"state action\" by officials at any level of government. Thus, the First Amendment pertains to regulations by the FCC, acts of Congress, and the local police department. Private organizations, such as private art galleries or colleges, in contrast, are not technically bound by the First Amendment.\n \"Speech\" has been broadly defined by the courts to include not only verbal expression, but also visual art, music, theater, dance, and other expressive conduct and non-verbal forms of communication. However, First Amendment rights are not absolute, and have some exceptions. Unprotected speech includes:\n \n \u0095 Incitement to illegal activity and/or imminent violence; (like asking to kill gays)\n \u0095 Defamation and libel; \n \u0095 Obscenity; \n \u0095 Threats and intimidation; and \n \u0095 False advertising. \n \n Government suppression of otherwise legal speech can be justified only if the government can advance a compelling reason. For example, national security concerns might justify suppression of an article describing military strategy in wartime. More often, free speech cases involve claims that government regulations are vague or overly broad, or that the government is engaging in viewpoint discrimination - trying to suppress speech because of opposition to the message it conveys. As this website details, different forms of expression are protected to varying degrees, often depending on where the expression occurs, and whether the regulation is formulated or applied to affect the content or viewpoint of the speech in that forum.",

Sort of the thing where many say watching porn will cacuse you to be more likely to rape someone, or if you hear talk of racists and stories about killing blacks, that you will be more likely to commit violence. Or the same thing with gays. If you here stories about murdering them, do you start to subconciously think it's ok to commit violence against them? I don't think anyone knows, but EVERYONE (well mostly everyone) will admit that it isn't the sole cause. They can still resist the urge to commit violence even if they hear about it, that's just one factor. If someone could prove it true or false, they would really advance their case. If they could prove that it didn't actually contribute to violence, it should be totally legalized as free speech. If it does contribute to violence, it should be much more restricted.",
