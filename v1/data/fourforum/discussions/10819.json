It is because US workers with minimal skillsets demand premium pay.

In order to facilitate the expansion, $21 million worth of roadwork was done, a $10 million electrical service upgrade was done and a new 24\" water main was run 12 miles. ALL of that was paid for with our tax dollars. \n \n If you open a new factory in india, where taxes are low, the factory owner has to pay for the cost of all those upgrades. Even in most of Europe they would have to pay for AT LEAST the cost of the electrical build out.\n \n Business taxes in the US are basically infrastructure rental costs and businesses pay them HAPPILY because it is one hell of a lot cheaper than the alternative. \n \n Companies move overseas becuase labor is cheaper. They do not move for tax reasons or because of regulations regardless of the BS that some folks like to tell you.

I don't think you can reasonalby argue that it's the manufacturers' faults. If you're a company, and you can save millions or billions manufacturing out the country, that's just good business. They're breaking no laws, and IMO they aren't even being unethical. The problem is that our market has come to the point where these companies are HAVING to do that to keep up.

   "Thanks for reminding me of that. And you can thank your local union hall for that.\n\n \n IIRC you work in the service sector...something related to laundry IIRC. Do you make more than $2 per day? If so, it is your fault, and everybody like you. $2 per day is what your average service sector worker makes in china. In order for the imbalances to be addressed, you need to drop your pay to $2 per day, as does every other service sector worker. Production workers need to drop their wages to somewhere betwen $1 and $3 per hour, depending on skill level. \n \n \n Then tell me why, for example, private sector businesses will not set up shop in areas where economic development is sorely needed, such as the Rust belt??? \n\n \n 2 Reasons. The first is that wages even in the rust belt are not low enough to make up for disparities. The second is that the infrastructure through most of the rust belt is dated and wortheless and we don;t have the money to replace it. Toyota recently opened a factory in the rust belt and they had to shoulder their own infrastructure costs because the state and local governments could not afford them. The infrastructure in those areas broke down because of Reaganomics. Reagan dropped corporate taxes so low that those states could not afford to maintain their infrastructure. At the same time his defict spending created the illusion of prosperity which led to increased wage expectations. The rust belt is a casualty of bad economic policy.\n \n The bigger problem is that a capitalist system requires balance. Int he past we have used foreign workers for whatever we thought they were good for and paid them nothing (or next to it). Our \"foreign aid\" included provisions that required that recipients remove \"barriers\" to US companies...things like wage minimums and basic safety requirements. Essentially we exploited foreign workers but were careful not to ever pay them enough that they could develop their own robust economies because we did not want them competing for consumer goods, since that would drive up the cost of those goods. \n \n We have done this for DECADES, which has allowed the imbalances to grow to epic proportions. Now we have a REAL problem because despite our best effirts, all those skilled workers in India, China, Costa Rica, Brazil, and allt he other countries we have used as slave pools over the last several decades have developed their own economies, started their own companies, and the worst part, developed their own technical skills that now exceed ours, which have essentially atrophied from lack of use. \n \n Now, capitalism is seeking balance. Henry Ford was right when he put forth that a company could only survive if its workers could afford to purchase the product they produce. What people miss is that he was not jsut talking about his company, he was putting forth a general economic policy. We are jsut on the wrong side of the balance for our liking. Our lifestyle will continue to decline until it is LOWER than that of the foreign workers because they are more productive than us on a base level. On the up side, their standard of living will continue to increase, so don;t start building your mud shack with an open sewer in front quite yet...it may well be that you will be able to afford a toilet in that shack when all is said and done.",

Unions account for a scant percent of workers, manufacturing and service in the country. You're missing one key thing: unionized companies like Ford and GM make bad products. It doesn't matter if you are unionized or not if your products suck.",
