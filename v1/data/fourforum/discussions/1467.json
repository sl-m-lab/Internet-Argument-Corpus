   "I personally didn't really take great offense at the movie. I did feel it was inappropriate for him to brand a political commentary as a documentary, and I think it was downright fraudulent for him to accept an award for it. \n \n As far as the gun/bank thing, more power to them. The bank has an FFL. The background check was completed properly. Totally legal transactions done as it should have been.\n \n \nI do think that the way he edited hestons speach was wrong. I watched that speach on TV, and even going by the transcript he links to, he did quite a bit of editing and re-arranging. I hate it when people take things out of context, and re-arranging a speach to entirely change the context is just wrong. Even by his own account, he inserted a portion from a different speach As for the clip preceding the Denver speech, when Heston proclaims \"from my cold dead hands,\" this appears as Heston is being introduced in narration. It is Heston's most well-recognized NRA image &#8211; hoisting the rifle overhead as he makes his proclamation, as he has done at virtually every political appearance on behalf of the NRA (before and since Columbine). I have merely re-broadcast an image supplied to us by a Denver TV station, an image which the NRA has itself crafted for the media, or, as one article put it, \"the mantra of dedicated gun owners\" which they \"wear on T-shirts, stamp it on the outside of envelopes, e-mail it on the Internet and sometimes shout it over the phone.\". Are they now embarrassed by this sick, repulsive image and the words that accompany it? \n \n \n In the movie, it is made to appear that this is all part of the same speach. That clip changed the entire tone of the speech that Heston gave. THis reminds me of a little SWF I got in my e-mail. It had a picture of bush and a bunch of \"buzz words\" on a sidebar. You dragged the buzzwords onto a speach line and hit the PLAY button and it makes bush say what you want (it was really funny). WHat more did was a \"Create a heston speach\". THe difference is he didn't let anybody know it was a joke.\n \n \nThe U.S. figure of 11,127 gun deaths comes from a report from the Center for Disease Control\n\n \n HIs link doesn't back this up, according to the report he links to, the number is actually much higher. Here is the relevant text:\n \n \nIn 1999 a total of 28,874 persons died from firearm injuries in the United States, down nearly 6 percent from the 30,625 deaths in 1998\n\n \n I hadn't seen that figure before. It is interesting (though unrelated to the film) that gun ownership was at an all time high in 1999, but gun deaths were actually down. Cool\n \n \nMost Americans want stronger gun laws (among others, see the 2001 National Gun Policy Survey from the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center\n\n \n Even the University of Chicagos National Opinion Research Center has invalidated this report, and fired the researcher who carried it out. I can't gaurantee that Moore knows this, we do know that over half of Americans are gun owners, and according to the Pew research center, roughly 20 percent of a random sampling of 15,000 households want stricter gun laws. I would hardly call 20% a majority.\n \n \n Overall, I would say that after hearing his defense (which does lay to rest some of the rumors we have heard) that he is at least as honest as Bill Clinton becasue, after all, Bill Clinton didn't actually have sex with that woman.\n \n While the facts as presented by Moore (except for the reprehensible act of turning what was in actuality a good speech by Heston into a bad one) may be technically correct, the conclusion he leads the viewer to is not supportable in the presence of additional evidince which he would have undoubtedly been in posession of during the course of his research for the film.\n \n A lie of omission is still a lie.\n \n \nAnd don't forget for a second that if they could have shut this film down on a technicality they would have. But they didn't and they can't &#8211; because the film is factually solid and above reproach. In fact, we have not been sued by any individual or group over the statements made in \"Bowling for Columbine?\"\n \n \n \n This particular statement (it is in regards to the NRA, if you havent read the page) is a particularly rediculous one. Can anybody ever remember the NRA suing anybody, ever, over false claims they have made? I certainly cant (and if they were going to start they would most likely start with the **** the brady campaign spews forth on a regular basis). Pro-gunners tend to be a little paranoid, whihc is probably ustified since several of the prominent anti-gunners have openly stated that the end goal is the confiscation of all firearms. What moore is presenting is simply deranged paranoia without basis in reality. Worse, he has taken the NRA's respect for the first amendment (the NRA does not pick and choose which rights they support) as a victory. Odd indeed.",

It just seems really offensive to the families of the massacre to come in and promote guns when so many people died because of guns. Why could they just not have been more sensitive to the families? That was his point. \n \n \n \n THe NRA had no choice. They are required to hold a meeting of voting members each year under new yorks laws for non-profit orgganisations. They cannot change the location of the meeting without giving their memebrs 10 days notice (Also the law). The columbine shootings took place 11 days before the meeting was scheduled to take place. By the time the NRA was able to get everybody together to discuss options, they were inside the 10 day timetable. \n \n Really, the NRA meeting would have been almost unnoticable except for all the media hype and moores hype. The parts of the meeting that were open to the public took less than 4 hours and occupied a small auditorium. All other events surrounding the NRA rally were canceled (which Heston stated in his speech, and moore edited out). I don't know if you have ever seen/been to an NRA rally, but usually it is a full weekend with all kinds of activities planned. \n \n They did the part they were required to do by law, and tried to do that part quietly. Unfortunatly, the media figured it would make a juicy story and jumped all over it. According to the hotel where the meeting was held, media ALMOST outnumbered NRA for the meeting.\n \n There is a side by side comparison of moores version of the speech and the actual transcript of the speech at http://www.hardylaw.net/Bowlingtranscript.html\n \n \n \nI don't know, maybe his number were off (I haven't tried to follow up.)\n Again, I don't believe that the exact number is important, it is the point. There seems to have a huge problem with gun violance in this country. (both as an absolute number and per capita) That is his point. \n \n \n Yes, but a much larger problem with other types of preventable injuries/deaths. \n \n \nYeah, again, I don't know. It would be interesting to see some studies on it, though. I would say, though, that this is not in the movie, is it?\n\n \n Nope, not in the movie. JUst an interesting lie. I also wish more research would be done on this.\n \n \n \nI disagree that that not showing both sides is a lie, to me that is showing an opinion, perhapes skewing things, leaving out some things.

But again, to me, not a lie.\n\n \n Philisophical difference, I suppose. My mother was big on \"Not telling the whole truth is the same as a lie\". \n \n \nWhat suprises me about all of the pro gun fury about the movie on this page, is that I don't think that his message in the film was that we need more gun control. In fact, I think that he skewed things to make it seem like more gun control is not the answer. He showed Canada has having the same gun laws as we do, which I don't think is true.

Thus, the conclusion that he drew, was not that having so many guns in this country is the problem.\n Really his message in the movie, I think, was about fear in this country.\n \n Aye, that got long...looking forward to response...\n\n \n \n \n I agree. I don;t think the message was an anti gun one overall. It almost seems like he started out to make on movie and ended up making another. Like I said before, what offended me was not so much the content of the film as the ws he carried it out. I expect a documentary to be big on facts and historical documentation (or, at least, will someday be historical documentation). Instead we got edited speeches and skewed perspective. The purpose of a documentary, to my mind, is to document. Documeting means showing things as they are, not editing them to make them fit your agenda.\n \n I was also very disturbed by the lengths he went to to portray the NRA, and Heston in particular, as callous extremists when this simply is not the case. It also angered me that he attempted to associate the NRA with the KKK, and portray heston as a racist. You are talking about a man who worked for Martin Luther King! The NRA elected Grant as their president after he was prsident of the united states. This is the same President Grant that suspended Habeus Corpus and deployed troops to fight the KKK.\n \n If moore can't tell it like it is and make his point, I think he seriously needs to re-examine his convictions, as they ar obviously flawed.\n \n There is page at http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html that has a critique of bowling that is worth reading. It is well documented and provides links to pertinent informations. They make the point that Moores reply to the criticism of his work focuses on a few points, but leaves much to be desired.",
