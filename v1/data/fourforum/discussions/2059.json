   "Just when you thought the war was over, the 600th member of the U.S. military has been killed. \n \n All I've heard day in and day out, is that we can not hurt the morale of the soldiers, that give their sweat, blood, tears, and lives for us lightly. Then why won't this administration take this war seriously??? They continue to tell us that the war is over. \"We are in a transitional period of handing over power to the Iraqi's.\" Let me be 100 percent clear about this. The war is not over!!! We are being lied to. Everytime another soldier is killed it only makes me realize the mess our administration got us into. I blame George Walker Bush for every soldier and civilian, U.S. and foreign, that dies in this war. I'm not as silly as John Kerry, to claim that this war was about oil, this war was for a multitude of reasons that were so selfish and imperialistic that the Dubya should be impeached and jailed in any sane society. \n \n However my words of anger to not cross to the point of ignorance, I know the hegemonic nature of Western civilization and realize that these actions hardly go noticed never mind reprimanded to the point where justice is served. \n \n Over ten thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed since this war has begun. Nearly 700 Americans have been killed. And about 155 billion dollars has been set aside or spent. Finally our credibility as a leader of the free world has been shot. \n \n Patriotism is to have the sense to look out for your country, to do what is best for it's citizens and protect it at all costs. I object to this war out of love of my country and the way of life a thriving democracy should strive for. Imperialism is not the key to Patriotism. I wish to God that the Bush administration could find the golden key and save Iraq tomorrow and implement democracy that works to the whole world. But their hybrid vision of what democracy is, fuels hate, anger and ignorance. And these actions need to stop!! \n \n Since the first of May, 461 American soldiers have lost their lives in the newest Iraq war. How many more need to die???\n \n Check out my new site, poeticinjustice.net, I have a forums page as well",

Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 \n \n \"This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" -- From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, & Tom Lantos among others \n \n \"Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities\" -- From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter on July 18, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's goal ... is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. We cannot, we must not and we will not let him succeed.\" -- Madeline Albright, 1998 \n \n \"(Saddam) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day, some way, I am certain he will use that arsenal again, as he has 10 times since 1983\" -- National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Feb 18, 1998 \n \n \"Iraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement.\" -- Barbara Boxer, November 8, 2002 \n \n \"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability.\" -- Robert Byrd, October 2002 \n \n \"There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we.\" -- Wesley Clark on September 26, 2002 \n \n \"What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad's regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs.\" -- Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002 \n \n \"The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.\" -- Bill Clinton in 1998 \n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\" -- Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002 \n \n \"I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.\" -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 \n \n \"Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people.\" -- Tom Daschle in 1998 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our allies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, Saddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. He has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and is trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002 \n \n \"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" -- Al Gore, 2002 \n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Bob Graham, December 2002 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to deprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Jim Jeffords, October 8, 2002 \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002 \n \n \"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\" -- Ted Kennedy, Sept 27, 2002 \n \n \"I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" -- John F. Kerry, Oct 2002 \n \n \"The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\" -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War.\" -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003 \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" -- Carl Levin, Sept 19, 2002 \n \n \"Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons, and the development of nuclear weapons is a day of danger for the United States.\" -- Joe Lieberman, August, 2002\n \n \"Over the years, Iraq has worked to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 1991 - 1994, despite Iraq's denials, U.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of nuclear facilities that Iraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate that Iraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no reason to think otherwise. Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and chemical weapons.U.N. inspectors have said that Iraq's claims about biological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran, and later, against its own Kurdish population. While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there have been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Patty Murray, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 \n \n \"Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.\" -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998 \n \n \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources -- something that is not that difficult in the current world. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002\n \n \n tick t0ck.... tick t0ck.... tick t0ck...",

   "In order to believe Bush has lied about WMD you would have to believe that the UN, France, Germany, Russia, Klinton, Kerry, Hussein himself, Gore all lied. They have all said that Iraq has WMD. Now my question to your is why do they get a pass and Bush does not.\nWell probably because they didn't start a war over it!\n \n So if Bush never lied then where pray tell are all the WMDs? Don't get me wrong, I see the war as the right thing to have done, but also see that all the WMD talk were nothing but lies to get the general populace into supporting it.\n \n \n \nWhat would your liberal response be if we invaded Afghanistan before 911 in order to prevent 911?\nWell my 'liberal' response (as you appear unable to see people as having individual views on things and constantly insist on lumping them into one stereotypical political group or the other) is that we should have in no way have invaded a country because it held a group of minor terrorists. Are you suggesting we should have?",

   "Well here is the problem. Many of the people you mentioned to an extent are liars or fabricators to pursue their own agenda.

I think you misread my site, poeticinjusitice.net (I know you like that), because I dont' like John Kerry. I agree with most arguments Bush puts forth about Kerry.

And don't you find it scary out of the millions of people in this country Kerry is the best you can do???\n \n As for the WMD HUSSEIN said he had it and I for one am not willing to let him either have them or bluff about them so that the can potentially proliferate through the mideast.
