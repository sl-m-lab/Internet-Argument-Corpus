If we are really just wanted health insurance reform and not cost reform than as your link pointed out this misses the point since most people care about cost. \n \n \nAgain, I would love to see validation of those numbers.\n I suspect the same thing will happen where your claims are not sticking to what you are actually saying.\npollingreport.com go to health care reform. \n \n \nPeople want a public option.\nBut don't want to pay for it...\n \n \nI started pointing that out in my earlier post when I pointed out that the wording was not talking about INSURANCE, but rather \"care\".\nThe entire purpose of insurance is to pay for care provided in the event something happens. Pointing out the number of uninsured is only showing the number of people who pay out of pocket but overall they are happy with the product...they just don't like the price tag. A public option then keeps the price tag and changes the care. This is where the rationed care argument comes in. That deals with level of care..not cost. We don't have rationed care now. It is possible we could under a different system...but I'm not convinced.\n \n More importantly, costs are associated with care that is charged by a hospital etc. What makes you think changing the insurance company will all of a sudden make the doctor decide to charge less? It hasn't worked with TennCare...would would it work for ObamaCare?\n \n \nYou claim it's a failure.\n I look at whether the system would be better off WITH medicare than without it.\n You refuse to recognize how the current system is funded.\n You're the one who doesn't seem to know how it is funded nor do you understand the intent of medicare when it first started and why it is in a problem now. Not only would we be better off without it but costs for seniors might even go down...or at least stop rising. \n \n \nYou cut off that conversation earlier, so I still don't know if you fail to recognize that the baby boom IS the problem. That currently our corrupt government is raiding the coffers of the medicare and social security taxes for other purposes.\nThe second part is correct. If we had no baby boomers but the government still raided than we would still have a problem. You seem to think the problem with the Titanic was water in the boat while I realize it is the hole in the hull that is the problem..removing the water does nothing if you don't fix the hole... can't drain the boat forever.\n \n as an aside, you can create your own new analogy instead of trying to manipulate mine...it is too annoying when you do that. \n \n \nMedicare has problems.\n But so do ALL programs.\n I can go through a long list of complaints about insurance companies and declare them as \"failures\" too, but that wouldn't help anything...\nThat's because they are failing too. When the federal government helps them out as much as they are and no free market system can drive costs down than this is what you get. \n \n \nPlus, you talk about satisfaction with healthcare...\n Didn't I show you a poll showing a high satisfaction with Medicare?\n Oh wait. Then you insisted that me using the practice that you PREVIOUSLY USED was pointless, didn't you...\nActually you showed me a poll of satisfaction with Medicare Part D.",

   "Abstract for the article I linked to: \"This paper finds that the vast majority of uninsured Americans are satisfied with their health care\"\n\n This has already been addressed.\n \"health care\" is different from \"health insurance\".\n Just because they are satisfied with the doctor helping them fix Timmy's health problem doesn't address the fact that they are going bankrupt with the expenses.\n \n \n \nYour link didn't show that either...and it isn't a fallacy. If we are really just wanted health insurance reform and not cost reform than as your link pointed out this misses the point since most people care about cost. \n\n emoticon_xdonno\n \"wanted health insurance reform and not cost reform\"???\n WHO is talking about that???\n NOT me.\n \n You still don't understand what the pointed difference between the \"satisfaction\" that your article talks about, AND THE REAL PROBLEM that is facing Americans, do you...\n \n \n \npollingreport.com go to health care reform. \n\n I swear.\n It's a tell-tale sign when somebody throws out a claim, and then gives vague instructions on how to substantiate their claim.\n \n Health Policy\n There's the link.\n Name the group that did the poll you referenced and the dates covered.\n Otherwise, your response is little better than \"go google it\"... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nBut don't want to pay for it...\n\n Says you.\n \n \n \nThe entire purpose of insurance is to pay for care provided in the event something happens. Pointing out the number of uninsured is only showing the number of people who pay out of pocket but overall they are happy with the product...they just don't like the price tag. A public option then keeps the price tag and changes the care.\n\n WOAH!\n Stop right there...\n Are you seriously claiming that you THINK that a \"public option\" would mean the SAME OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURE for the uninsured, but just \"change the care\"?\n Is that what you're saying?\n \n \n \nThis is where the rationed care argument comes in. That deals with level of care..not cost. We don't have rationed care now.\n\n Yes. We do Steeeeve.\n I don't understand how you think that claim is in any way intelligible or believable.\n We DO HAVE rationed health care now.\n It's rationed on \"capability to pay\".\n \n \n \nMore importantly, costs are associated with care that is charged by a hospital etc. What makes you think changing the insurance company will all of a sudden make the doctor decide to charge less?\n\n Seeing your responses makes me realize that you aren't even understanding what I\"m saying.\n I never said anything to intimate that an insurance company will suddenly make the total bill less.\n \n \n \nYou're the one who doesn't seem to know how it is funded nor do you understand the intent of medicare when it first started and why it is in a problem now. Not only would we be better off without it but costs for seniors might even go down...or at least stop rising. \n\n emoticon_xdonno\n There is positively no logic behind any of what you just said.\n The funny thing is how you claim I am wrong, but then you SHOW NO INFORMATION about where you are right.\n I have already corrected you in showing how our medicare / social security systems work.\n I KNOW the \"intent of medicare when it first started\".\n That is NOT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS NOW is the problem, as I have already explained to you.\n \n Maybe you should actually do something REAL in your statements, instead of these sweeping claims that repeatedly claim I am wrong, but offer absolutely no evidence that you have any understanding of the system. \n \n \n \nThe second part is correct. If we had no baby boomers but the government still raided than we would still have a problem. You seem to think the problem with the Titanic was water in the boat while I realize it is the hole in the hull that is the problem..removing the water does nothing if you don't fix the hole... can't drain the boat forever.\n\n That analogy is all hosed.\n Actually, you CAN drain the boat forever, unless a \"baby boom\" situation comes along.\n It's not ideal. I've already stated that it is a BAD way to run things.\n But as long as the ratio of tax-payers to medicare recipients stays about the same, the system WILL WORK like that.\n \n Can you explain why, in your analogy, you supposedly \"can't drain the boat forever\"?\n \n It is painfully obvious that you don't understand the first thing about the problems...\n \n \n \nas an aside, you can create your own new analogy instead of trying to manipulate mine...it is too annoying when you do that. \n\n emoticon_ic\n You create a bad analogy, and then you get annoyed when I show the holes in your analogy.\n Yeah. I can see why that would annoy you...\n \n \n \nThat's because they are failing too. When the federal government helps them out as much as they are and no free market system can drive costs down than this is what you get. \n\n Steeeeve? Answer me this.\n Johnny Poorhouse can't afford medical coverage.\n Federal government is not involved.\n HOW does the \"free market\" supposedly correct itself to make medical coverage affordable for Johnny Poorhouse???\n \n If Johnny Poorhouse can't afford a car, does that mean the price of cars automatically lowers itself so that Johnny can afford it?\n NO!\n \n \n \nActually you showed me a poll of satisfaction with Medicare Part D.\n\n You have a real knack for pointless observations.\n It was a poll on Medicare, regardless of what \"Part\" it pertained to.\n It showed SATISFACTION, which is just as valid as the \"satisfaction\" that you show.\n At least mine actually dealt with a PAY PROVIDER satisfaction, whereas you keep trying to trumpet the doctor/nurse satisfaction numbers...\n \n \n \nYet I seem to have a study that suggests differently. Fancy that!\n\n There is another thread around here with a guy who is whining incessantly about studies \"suggesting\" something.\n Oh wait. That would be you...\n Should I cut and paste all your criticism from there over to here?\n \n \n \nAgain, a moving target with you people...\n\n No. Actually the problem is that you obviously fail to recognize the real distinction we are raising in the first place.",

You make an argument for one thing and come up with a random conclusion. This is basically what you seem to think: Most americans are considered by the cost of health care therefore we should give everyone health care insurance even if it doesn't lower costs. \n \n Do you really want a solution that doesn't address your problem?\n \n \nI have already corrected you in showing how our medicare / social security systems work.\nYou didn't know what a pension was and you want people to buy this load?

It is idiotic to think the problem was the baby boomers. No raiding of money means medicare is fine...raiding of money means medicare is bankrupt. So where is the problem again?\n \n \nSteeeeve? Answer me this.\n Johnny Poorhouse can't afford medical coverage.\n Federal government is not involved.\n HOW does the \"free market\" supposedly correct itself to make medical coverage affordable for Johnny Poorhouse???\n \n If Johnny Poorhouse can't afford a car, does that mean the price of cars automatically lowers itself so that Johnny can afford it?\n NO!\nYeah, as a matter of fact they do. cars lower in price and used cars are bought up by the poor. \n \n Johnny Poorhouse can't afford medical coverage but gets medical care anyway and is apparently happy with it...but not the cost. So you ask how the free market fixes that...Johnny doesn't get coverage if Johnny can't afford it but Johnny still gets medical care. Now a government model makes it so Johnny gets health insurance while Middle class Joe gets the majority of the bill. Joe now pays his insanely expensive premiums and Johnnys insanely expensive premiums which makes Joe mad. Johnny in turn gets made a Joe because his coverage is garbage since hospitals start refusing to accept Fed Govt insurance as they are slow to pay and don't pay what things are worth (see TennCare). Now the Govt requires all places to accept Govt insurance so now the care at hospitals is worse because they get less money so Johnny still has bad care with high costs and Joe now has even higher costs with worse care. Joe says screw this and goes onto govt care because it is cheaper to Joe but now Fed Govt Care can't afford all the mad Joe's and has to either reduce benefits or raise taxes. \n \n All this could have been avoided if the government stayed out and actually let the free market work (something we don't have now). Some people would be left out from time to time but nothing stops them from getting back in and costs could go back to being reasonable. \n \n Good story :)\n \n \nYou have a real knack for pointless observations.\n It was a poll on Medicare, regardless of what \"Part\" it pertained to.\n It showed SATISFACTION, which is just as valid as the \"satisfaction\" that you show.\n At least mine actually dealt with a PAY PROVIDER satisfaction, whereas you keep trying to trumpet the doctor/nurse satisfaction numbers...\nMedicare Part D is the prescription drug plan passed a few years ago.

It's part of the pay package.\n \n\n But if a company pays <8% of its payrool in healthcare insurance now, they'll be able to switch to the puublic option and fix their costs at 8%. That is what every company with higher costs will do.\n \n\n Yeah.\n Like the existence of the Post Office has prevented FedEX and UPS from existing...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n\n See above...and then take a class in Economics. \n \n \n\n non-sequitur\n While I would agree with a sentiment that the Congress critters should be forced to live under the new plan, it's not relevant.\n The point is that it will be better for those WITHOUT health insurance.\n Even if the Congress people have a better plan, that shouldn't stop others from getting something better than what they currently have.\n\n Again, your logic sucks. Why should I, one of the payers, willingly participate in a plan that our congress critters don't think is good enough for them? That's like buying a lemon that the seller knows is a lemon and tells you so.",

   "I'd say that you should go back to the archives and see for yourself. It's there.\n\n Quite frankly, I would love to see Republicans make abolishing Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, welfare, etc a party platform.\n It would be good for a laugh.\n Good luck with that...\n \n \n \nObama doesn't even understand his own plan. He thinks that people that like their current plans and doctors will be able to keep them.

NOT a poignant issue.\n \n See? That would be an example of me explaining something to somebody who refuses to get it, because I know OTHER PEOPLE can read and recognize your fallacy. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nI don't give a rat's rectum what some poor slob that's too lazy to get a job and doesn't have healthcare thinks should be done with MY money.

Charity is a private matter, NOT a Federal one! :xcensored\n\n I am reminded of Craig T Nelson who complained that nobody helped him out when he was getting food stamps and on welfare...\n \n If you are callous towards your fellow man and don't care if he lives or dies, that's your issue.\n You can make that your campaign slogan if you want.",
