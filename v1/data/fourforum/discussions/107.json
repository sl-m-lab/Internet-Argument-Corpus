   "Since Calligirl refuses to believe that Archie is a good example of a transitional fossil, here's some more for her to chew on.\n \n Fish to Amphibians\n \n * Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis) -- These ancient bony fish probably gave rise both to modern ray-finned fish (mentioned above), and also to the lobe-finned fish.\n \n * Osteolepis (mid-Devonian) -- One of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other lobe-finned fishes). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of major limb bones, capable of flexing at the \"elbow\", and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.\n \n * Eusthenopteron, Sterropterygion (mid-late Devonian) -- Early rhipidistian lobe-finned fish roughly intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Eusthenopteron is best known, from an unusually complete fossil first found in 1881. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian- like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet in the overall layout of the major bones, muscle attachments, and bone processes, with tetrapod-like tetrahedral humerus, and tetrapod-like elbow and knee joints. But there are no perceptible \"toes\", just a set of identical fin rays. Body & skull proportions rather fishlike.\n \n * Panderichthys, Elpistostege (mid-late Devonian, about 370 Ma) -- These \"panderichthyids\" are very tetrapod-like lobe-finned fish. Unlike Eusthenopteron, these fish actually look like tetrapods in overall proportions (flattened bodies, dorsally placed orbits, frontal bones! in the skull, straight tails, etc.) and have remarkably foot-like fins.\n \n * Fragmented limbs and teeth from the middle Late Devonian (about 370 Ma), possibly belonging to Obruchevichthys -- Discovered in 1991 in Scotland, these are the earliest known tetrapod remains. The humerus is mostly tetrapod-like but retains some fish features. The discoverer, Ahlberg (1991), said: \"It [the humerus] is more tetrapod-like than any fish humerus, but lacks the characteristic early tetrapod 'L-shape'...this seems to be a primitive, fish-like character....although the tibia clearly belongs to a leg, the humerus differs enough from the early tetrapod pattern to make it uncertain whether the appendage carried digits or a fin. At first sight the combination of two such extremities in the same animal seems highly unlikely on functional grounds. If, however, tetrapod limbs evolved for aquatic rather than terrestrial locomotion, as recently suggested, such a morphology might be perfectly workable.\"\n \n * Hynerpeton, Acanthostega, and Ichthyostega (late Devonian) -- A little later, the fin-to-foot transition was almost complete, and we have a set of early tetrapod fossils that clearly did have feet. The most complete are Ichthyostega, Acanthostega gunnari, and the newly described Hynerpeton bassetti (Daeschler et al., 1994). (There are also other genera known from more fragmentary fossils.) Hynerpeton is the earliest of these three genera (365 Ma), but is more advanced in some ways; the other two genera retained more fish- like characters longer than the Hynerpeton lineage did.\n \n * Labyrinthodonts (eg Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) (late Dev./early Miss.) -- These larger amphibians still have some icthyostegid fish features, such as skull bone patterns, labyrinthine tooth dentine, presence & pattern of large palatal tusks, the fish skull hinge, pieces of gill structure between cheek & shoulder, and the vertebral structure. But they have lost several other fish features: the fin rays in the tail are gone, the vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined, etc.",

   " it is hilarious that I am yelled at for copying resources off of websites that are \"blatanly creationist\".\n\n \n 1) No-ones yelling.\n \n 2) It's illegal to copy someone elses work without referencing.\n \n 3) No-one made objections to the copy'n'paste simply because they were \"blatanly creationist\", unless I missed it.\n \n \nHow so?

Plus, I didn't have the time to type out the entire lineages by hand.\n\n \n Point conceded, let me re-phrase. In my opinion, when you cut and paste large amounts of information, it does nothing to help the argument for several reasons.\n \n 1) When you do it with large amounts of technical information, exemplified by the Tetrapods, it's too much to digest and it just gets overlooked. Perhaps you should establish a basis on which something would be accepted as a transitional form, and a number of them that's acceptable and then present the relevant info.\n \n 2) It doesn't help YOUR understanding of the subject. Read the subject, paraphrase if you can and quote where necessary only 2 or 3 sentences if you can. The more it's YOUR work and the less it's someone elses, the better. That's just my opinion.\n \n \nI was simply saying \"trillions\" to stress my point. \"The Earth is accepted by scientists to be around 4.5 billion years old.\" -www.talkorigins.org (I love how they generalize!)\n\n \n Ok, a reference, yay! Perhaps extend it to include the exact paper, and by whom it was written. When calculating ages of this magnitude, how precise to you expect or want scientists to get?\n \n In the interest of clarity, don't generalise. Saying \"trillions and trillions\", when no-one supports anything like that, just comes of as dishonest.\n \n \n...where are the MILLIONS of links that supposedly connected them?\n\n \n Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.\n \n Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.\n \n It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.\n \n 3 questions for Calligirl.\n \n For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?\n \n When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?\n \n How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?\n \n I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see.",

This is because it has evolved to be different from it's fossilized ancestors. So there is no basis to make the claim that Coelacanths havn't evolved during the last 70 million years, there's simply no record.\n \n There are 360 million year old Coelacanths but they belong to a different genera and suborder. There are also 80 million year old Coelacanths, but these are also a different genera.\n \n The reason it hasn't appeared in the fossil record is probably ecolgical and geological. Coelacanths live in caves and under the overhanging marine reefs of volcanic islands, these environments are not conductive to fossilisation. There is a lack of fossil bone beds because the deposits get either subsided with the volcanic islands or subducted beneath continental plates and the beds are drastically metamorphosed during this process. Any existant beds lie at the bottom of the ocean, under younger sediment where no-one can get to them.",

However, it must contain many of these, and I imagine a few would have \"melded\" during the process.\n\n \n Not bad. I'm surprised that you actually were facing in the right direction. Unusual for a creationist. Here is the definition that Mark Isaacs gives at the Talk Origins Archive.\n \n \"A transitional fossil is one that looks like it's from an organism intermediate between two lineages, meaning it has some characteristics of lineage A, some characteristics of lineage B, and probably some characteristics part way between the two.\"\n \n Of course, your idea of \"upper\" and \"lower\" evolutionary forms is quite confused. There actually is no requirement of progress or increase in complexity or whatever you think is upper and lower. And I don't understand why there should have to be many such characteristics. Shouldn't the characteristics of one decrease while those of the other increase as evolution continues through time?\n \n So even according to your definition of a transitional, what is wrong with Archaeopteryx?\n \n Archaeopteryx\n \n \n2)For a calculation of the Earths age, I would like to get within a few thousand years. I very much doubt equipment will be accurate enough to get a reading this prescise (even if it is a false reading), so I'd settle for a couple million years. (Of course, thats even more against creationism, so whatever).\n\n \n How funny. Creationists can peg \"THE CREATION\" to 6 to 10 thousand years ago. That is a margin of error of 40% - it is within a few thousand years. But you want between 4.5 and 4.6 billion years (a margin of error of about 2%) narrowed to less than hundredths of a percent.\n \n \n \n3)When looking at transitional fossils, I don't want to see a handful of creatures with a few similarities. Dozens between two evolutionary steps are required in order to show how one creature has transformed into another.\n\n \n Nope. That's not to say that they aren't known. It's just that they aren't required. And of course, you think that they must be shown to be actual ancestors. That is not the case. Here is the idea. If birds descended from theropod dinosaurs, then we should find organisms that have characteristics of both lineages. We do. It seems that more and more are being found. Just like there are lots of intermediates between land mammals and whales, and amphibians and reptiles, and reptiles and mammals. Lots. But of course, unless every lineage can be provided with every intermediate, you just can't believe it.",
