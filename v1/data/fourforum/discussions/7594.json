   "I want to thank Steeeeve for giving me the link to Loving vs. Virginia I was reading though the link and I am finding eerily similar arguments being used today against samesex marriage. Wow sent chills up my spine.\n \n \n The trial judge that convicted said this and I have heard something similar about gays and lesbians\n \n\"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n \n\n \n So basiclly the equal protection argument will help us based upon sex.\n \n There is also this at the end\nThese statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. \n \n Marriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival. Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.\n",

   "Aside from Loving not really being the ones to say marriage in a constitutional right (it was a few later causes that pretty much fixed that one) I disagree with the final paragraph of the Loving case as it was just flat wrong...as explained in the other thread. \n \n Lucky for you though you still have the 5 judges from Texas v. Lawrence who believe in a living constitution. So I agree that samesex marriage is inevitable so long as the court continues to decide what they think morals should be. O'Connor was not in favor of gay marraige (as stated in Lawrence) and Scalia, Thomas, and Roberts are not gonna help you out any. Alito replaced O'Connor and he probably won't go to finding new rights in the constitution. \n \n I do find it sad that you must resort to having 5 people set the morals for this country instead of leaving it to the will of the people.

It protects the people from the government. But, at the end of the day, the minority doesn't get to set the rules just so they aren't subject to the \"tyranny\" of the majority. \n \n You also misquoted the 14th amendment. It says nothing about privileges. It says you can't deny life, liberty, or property without due process of law. So what is due process of law? Seems obvious...you have a right to all the processes of our law. So if you are thought to have killed someone they can't just hang you the next day without a trial by jury. The government can't just take your house without due process (unless you follow the Kelo decision). It seems if you ban gay marriage via a state amendment then that is due process. \n \n as for Romer v. Evans case...I don't see why people don't think it is silly. \n Here is the example which is in the dissent that I can't see the courts getting over:\n \nTo take the simplest of examples, consider a state law prohibiting the award of municipal contracts to relatives of mayors or city councilmen. Once such a law is passed, the group composed of such relatives must, in order to get the benefit of city contracts, persuade the state legislature--unlike all other citizens, who need only persuade the municipality. It is ridiculous to consider this a denial of equal protection, which is why the Court's theory is unheard of.\n",

   "I'm not positive what he would do but I'm guessing he would vote against it, and if it passed and was important enough to him he would move to another state. The problem comes when all the states have the same law that you don't like. I'm thinking he would fight it just as you are to try to gain support for his side in at least one state. I believe Massachussettes allows gay marriage and I think some other states are close. Just keep on fighting, I believe if you look at the polls more and more people are becoming for gay marriage.\n\n \n They would go to court faster then any liberal they have accused. Look at Oregon's assisted suicide law, Bush V Gore just to name two examples.",

   "May not be exactly what he said. You know as well as I do that if there were laws on the ballot or proposed in the legislature against heterosexual civil rights he would be reacting just the same as he denounces gays for acting. It is all academic till it hits home then it is an outrage.\n \n I'm right here, no need to talk about me in front of my face.\n \n \n\n To steeeeve. Are you really telling me that if legislator X in your state of virginia proposed a law that would annul your marriage then you would just deal with it? Are you really saying that you would have no problem if a law was passed by the voters, that targeted you specifically, that said you could not remain married? What if one was passed by the voters that outlawed children in resturants or said their parents must keep them quite or face fines? Would you just deal with it? You would not go to court because you have allready said that you don't believe in the courts overrulling the will of the people. Or would you if a law passed by the majority of the people targeted you personally would you go to court to fight it?\n If Virginia passed a law doing something like that then I would have to move or deal with it depending on how much I didn't like it. Laws I don't like get passed every year. I fight for the ones I agree with and I lose some battles...it happens. I don't think you shouldn't fight but I do believe you should do it the proper way.\n \n \nThey would go to court faster then any liberal they have accused.\n Wouldn't see me in court...what law would have been violated? The \"I don't like this law so its unconsitutional\" amendment?\n \n \nLook at Oregon's assisted suicide law, Bush V Gore just to name two examples\n Oregon's assisted suicide is not one I look at too often, however, the origins of Bush v. Gore were actually filed by Gore...Bush just appealed to the Supreme Court (thus Bush v. Gore). In the Supreme Court case, 7 outta 9 justices felt the supreme court of florida got it wrong. Oh those 7, 5 thought the election should just be over. So there you have it. Try actually reading the case before you complain about it.",
