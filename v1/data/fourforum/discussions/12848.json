Mike McCaig, who coordinates investigations for the Fundy Integrated Intelligence Unit. \"It's a serious situation.\"\n \n The situation might not be as dire as the frequent gun battles taking place in Mexico, where thousands of guns from the US are being used in a drug war. But Canadian authorities say they're also scrambling to stanch the flow of illegal weapons from the US.\n \n The same pattern that allows guns from the US to arm Mexican cartels - a disparity in gun laws, a porous border, and a thriving drug trade - is also sending guns into Canada, city officials and police here say.\n \n \"These guns are causing people to die on the streets of Toronto, and they come about because the US gun laws are so lax, and it's very difficult to stop the guns at the border,\" Toronto Mayor David Miller says. .......... \"\n \n \n 'River' of US guns also flows north of the border | csmonitor.com",

   "As far as Canadian health care goes, a few of my wife's relatives live in Canada, and one is a nurse in Toronto. She doesn't quite paint the same picture as you do about the Canadian health care. So I got to call that B.S.\n \n As to the World hating us. Yep, but they still admire us much of the time as well, too. However, like Old Sarge says, Who Cares! emoticon_smile I surely don't!\n \n Also, the guns, gangs and drugs problems seem to know no boarders. You are not immune. \n \n   Mexico's portable drug war \n Mexico's drug wars don't stay in Mexico. The recent spike in gang-related murders in metro Vancouver is a result of the ongoing violence wreaking havoc in Mexico.\n\n \n   Mexico's drug war becomes Canadian security issue \n Mexico's war on the drug cartels has become a national security issue for Canada, say Ottawa officials, as the violent backlash from the syndicates spills across the border into Canada and the U.S. \n \n Security agencies, including the RCMP, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and the Integrated Threat Assessment Centre, are concerned an organized-crime problem could turn into a full-fledged national security threat. \n \n This week, the RCMP publicly described a series of B.C. gang murders as a Canadian echo of the bloody feuds among the Mexican drug cartels, notorious for beheading their enemies and bribing corrupt local officials.\n\n \n   Gang violence in Canada linked to Mexico drug wars\n \n   Mexican drug wars behind Vancouver gang violence: police \n \n If one looks at crime in our suburban, and rural settings, our murder rate is no worse than the rest of the world. And yet, this is exactly where the greatest concentration of firearms are. Murders happen regardless of weather or not guns are allowed to be owned by citizens. Ever since Cain Slew Able, that seems to be an inevitable human condition. \n \n In my city of Fairview Park, there have been zero murders even since I have lived here, and very little, and usually petty, crime, if it happens at all. The same in our surrounding communities as well. Although, there has been one murder in one of our adjacent communities since I have lived here.\n \n So you can talk about safety all you want, but we are very safe here! Just as long as you don't live in our Inner Cities. That, is the problem we need to fix. And, if we can stop wasting all of our time, money and crime fighting efforts on trying to control the law-abiding by gun control, maybe we could actually turn our attention to the actual problems! But I wouldn't count on that happening! emoticon_smile Gun Controllers are very Radical in their beliefs!",

   "Oh, and please, continue telling me how enslaved I am by free health care \n\n T.Q., I hope that you DO realize that, we already know that you are indeed paying for your Free health care with your taxes. Nothing is free, and that tax is pretty high according to our nurse relative! \n \n Also, I think your illegal gun and Constitution analogy, as a double standard, is a bad one. Terrorist from other countries coming across our boarder with Canada has nothing to do with our Constitution, smuggling drugs or guns, or our lack of proper socialization, control of our boarder, crime or societal issues. It is because of hate.\n \n Mostly, the Muslim World hates us because we help and protect Israel! They would dearly love to wipe them off the map, but we will not let them! However, they also fail to realize that we did the same for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. So their persecution of Americans is also bull!\n \n As I previously said, I don't think we can totally protect our boarders, but I also think we all need to try and do a better job. We have seen that proven with the smuggling of Liquor from Canada across the Great Lakes during prohibition. However, we did not blame Canada for the criminal acts of our own people.",

   "Actually, Tither, if you tell most Europeans, Australians, Canadians, or South Americans that you're from the US, they'll be complete douchebags. But don't worry, that's because in the cases of Europe, Australia, and Canada, they're left-wing and they have a highly-distorted idea of just how right-wing our country is. They can't bear to be disagreed with.",

   "92 Mexican police arrested in drug cartel investigation - CNN.com\n \n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Federal agents arrested 92 municipal police officers accused of providing information and security to one of Mexico's most ruthless drug cartels, the state-run Notimex news agency reported.\n \n The arrests occurred Wednesday in the city of Hidalgo in central Mexico after an investigation that started in October, Notimex said Thursday.\n \n So far, the news agency said, the investigation has led to the arrests of 124 suspects and the discovery of 12 safe houses in which 14 secret graves were found.\n \n Officials say the Zeta drug cartel is responsible for many of the kidnappings, extortion and drug trafficking in Hidalgo.\n \n The Zetas were paying the Hidalgo police officers 3,000 to 5,000 pesos ($228 to $380) every two weeks, Notimex said.\n \n So we know that the police, the people charged with upholding and enforcing the laws, are being bribed regularly by the mexican drug cartel, meaning they're on the payroll. With the police working for them, the drug cartel can get away with whatever they want.\n \n Are we still to believe that the only way to make things better in Mexico, is to drastically restrict my rights here in America? How exactly will taking away my rights do anything to solve the problems in Mexico, when it's the mexican police working for the cartels?\n \n Especially since all police are exempt from any gun laws that get passed.",
