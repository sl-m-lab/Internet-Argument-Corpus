   "From a book review in the Wall Street Journal:\n \n \nTHE DECLINE OF THE SECULAR UNIVERSITY By C. John Sommerville, Oxford, 147 pages, $22\n \n Conservative critiques of higher education often take one of two forms. The first is a lament that universities no longer teach the Great Books or help students answer the Important Questions: What is good? What is true? What is just? Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\" (1987) is probably the most forceful expression of this point of view. The second is a lament that universities are out of touch with the populace and that tax dollars should not be funding subjects as obscure as transgender studies or professors as offensive as Ward Churchill, the man who cheered the 9/11 deaths of the World Trade Center's \"little Eichmanns.\"\n \n The two critiques are not always compatible. (A public referendum on college courses might favor \"Thelma & Louise\" over Thucydides.) But sometimes they are. In \"The Decline of the Secular University,\" C. John Sommerville, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Florida, attempts both lines of attack simultaneously. He argues that universities today are increasingly irrelevant to the wider culture precisely because they are not asking the Important Questions. . . .\nWell, yeah, one should ask:\n \n What is good? \n What is true? \n What is just? \n \n But, isn't there more to life than that? And, don't you always get a bunch of cockamamie answers from a bunch of kooks when you ask such questions?",

We already have a thread on here about What is good and what is evil and one about truth. I don't know if there is one on Just yet or not. But part of the problem is that people have different diffinitions of what those words mean. That's why you get different answers. And by the way...\n \n...The second is a lament that universities are out of touch with the populace and that tax dollars should not be funding subjects...\n\n Oh please, give me a break. By the way, what would they consider the \"Great Books?\" That's plural. I'm not sure what are the \"Great Books\" they are talking about.\n I bet they would be upset about classes that have to do with other cultures.",

   "\"The second is a lament that universities are out of touch with the populace and that tax dollars should not be funding subjects as obscure as transgender studies \"\n \n This sounds like a classic case of taking the specific and applying it to the general. Most universities offer roughly the same set of classes; what you might call \"the standards\". Math, science, psych, history, philosophy, english lit; I'm sure we all know the list. But part of learning is to explore new areas. If someone wants to go into new territory and see what's there I see no reason why they shouldn't have the chance. If a school closed down their philosophy department to make room for transgender studies that would be one thing, but simply offering the courses? How could that possibly be bad? Students should be able to get what might be considered a \"traditional\" education, but I don't think that it should be absolutely required. Let people branch out and explore new terrain; who knows what it might gain us?",
