   "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has stepped into the controversy between religious fundamentalists and scientists by saying that he does not believe that creationism - the Bible-based account of the origins of the world - should be taught in schools.\n Giving his first, wide-ranging, interview at Lambeth Palace, the archbishop was emphatic in his criticism of creationism being taught in the classroom, as is happening in two city academies founded by the evangelical Christian businessman Sir Peter Vardy and several other schools.\n \n \"I think creationism is ... a kind of category mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories ... if creationism is presented as a stark alternative theory alongside other theories I think there's just been a jarring of categories ... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it,\" he said.\n The debate over creationism or its slightly more sophisticated offshoot, so-called \"intelligent design\" (ID) which argues that creation is so complex that an intelligent - religious - force must have directed it, has provoked divisions in Britain but nothing like the vehemence or politicisation of the debate in the US. There, under pressure from the religious right, some states are considering giving ID equal prominence to Darwinism, the generally scientifically accepted account of the evolution of species. Most scientists believe that ID is little more than an attempt to smuggle fundamentalist Christianity into science teaching.\n \n States from Ohio to California are considering placing ID it on the curriculum, with President George Bush telling reporters last August that \"both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.\" The archbishop's remarks place him firmly on the side of science.\n\n \n Indeed, Jo. Would you like to make your own stance clear so that we have something other than Marc9000's view, particularly in regards to the origins of Monotheism.\n I have heard that it has something to do with a bloke called Zoroaster from Persia. This would effectively suggest that the book of Genesis was deliberately written to obscure and/or conceal the true origins of monotheism from monotheists. \n I didn't probe any futher as I'm an Agnostic with no real intrest in the subject per se.",

   "From my point of view, the literal truth or otherwise of Genesis is rather irrelevant. The key points to take from Genesis are about the nature of mankind, about the choices we are offered and our persistence in falling short of the ideal. As a Christian I believe the origins of monotheism to be simply the recognition that there is one God, I believe Christian theology provides the current \"best guess\" as to who God is. I believe God is responsible for the world's creation, the how and the when of it is something I'm largely happy to trust science on.\n \n On the teaching of creationism, I think it is a profound mistake to confuse scientific theory with religious teaching. There is nothing in evolution theory that precludes an extra-universal creator, but there is nothing that requires one either.",

   "I think it is good to see the church speaking out on this issue, mainstream Christianity has been silent in the face of the ravings of fundamentalists for too long.\n\n \n I agree, its good to see Dr. Williams make a clear statement on this issue as it becomes increasingly prominent in the UK. Vardy's use of money to forward his personal religious views in public schools has gone uncriticsed for to long. I recently saw an interview with the Director of The Emmanuel Schools Foundation, Nigel McQuoid, and while the general approach of Dispatches was overly confrontational here was guy happy to admit to teaching the controversy in public schools.\n \n Certainly raised my eyebrows- what if influences like this are left to spread in our education system? Blair has been rather reticent is spealking against such, and if anything is encouraging it to happen (his close ties to Vardy no doubt are relevant in that example.)\n \n Dr. Williams is not the first learned person in Britain to raise this issue, but every additional voice is to be welcomed.",

   "I think the intervention of the Archbishop is key though, he is head of the established church in England, and he is often reluctant to speak out on issues like this (a lot of the rest of the interview emphasises how reluctant he is to give the press \"archbishop condemns...\" quotes). Renta-atheist Richard Dawkins opposing teaching creationism is no surprise, and you can generally find a junior Bishop in the church of England willing to support pretty much any position.",

   "Charles Clarke follows up with this:\n \n \nClarke opposes creation teaching\n By Jonathan Petre, Religion Correspondent\n (Filed: 22/03/2006)\n \n Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, stepped into the controversy over creationism yesterday by declaring that he was \"totally opposed\" to the concept.\n \n Mr Clarke, who said that he did not believe in God, insisted that science was the basis for progress and praised Charles Darwin as one of the greatest scientists in history.\n \n \"It is certain, in my view, that creationism is anti-scientific and as I believe that science should be the route of where we go, I therefore do not approve of it,\" he said at a London conference. He added that it was acceptable for schools to teach that there were people who held a creationist point of view.\n \n His remarks follow an interview given by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, in which he said that he opposed the teaching of creationism in science lessons.\n \n Dr Williams told The Guardian that it diminished rather than enhanced the biblical story of the origins of the world. \"I think creationism is, in a sense, a kind of category mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories,\" he said.\n \n \"It's not as if the writer of Genesis, or whatever, sat down and said, 'Well, how am I going to explain all this? I know: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.' \n \n \"So if creationism is presented as a stark alternative theory alongside other theories, I think there's just been a jarring of categories. It's not what it's about.\"\n \n His comments will refuel the debate over whether creationism or \"intelligent design\" should be taught in schools alongside evolution. While the issue is most contentious in the American Bible Belt, creationism has been promoted in at least one academy sponsored by the evangelical businessman Sir Peter Vardy.\n",
