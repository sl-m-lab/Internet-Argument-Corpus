   "North Korea is seeking to get it's sanctions lifted. Last night it talked with Japan on the phone, and asked if they could ask America if they will lift the North Korean sanctions. Personally, I think North Korea is up to something. Japan has mixed feelings on the lifting too.\n Now, North Korea, threatened that they will not return to talks unless the sanctions are lifted. Well, why would we do that? We sanctioned the companies that are supplying them with weapons grade material. If we lifted those sanctions, they would resume construction of such weapons. America is not stupid. But, anyway. I think these guys think we are fools.\n =John",
