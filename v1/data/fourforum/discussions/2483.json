We all want freedoms 'to' do things that benefit us, and we want freedoms from things that harm us.\" \n\n \n Those versed in even rudimentary political science also recognise that \"Freedom\" is a subjective term. I understand why she chose to focus on \"freedom\" instead of \"rights\", since \"rights\" is a well documented, non-subjective term with a legal definition. \n \n \"freedom\" is just a by-product of the existance of rights.\n \n \n \"\nThe cost of firearm injuries in the US in 1990 was an estimated $20.4 billion. This includes $1.4 billion for direct exp enditures for health care and related goods, $1.6 billion in lost productivity re sulting from injury-related disability, and $17.4 billion in lost productivity from premature death.

Hundreds of thousands of injuries, limiting the freedoms of those shot, and tens of thousands of deaths, completely halting those freedoms.  \n \n \n Wow, I didn't know that anybody wtill quoted the junk science in \"Shooting in the Dark: Estimating the Cost of Firearm Injuries\" (the max and rice article being quoted here). Here is how they came up with their numbers. They took the number of firearm deaths and injuries per year, and calculated their cost in lost time and wages using the average income data for AMerica. BAsically, they assumed that all those people are middle class. Oddly enough, in the same report, they cite a source which shows that over 80% of the medical costs of gunshot victims are born by the taxpayer. Why is the government paying hospital bills for the middle calss? They are not. THe fact is, over 80% of deaths due to guns is criminals killing each other. MOst shootings in this country are career criminals shooting it out. So, lets look at this another way. \n \n According to the DOJ, career criminals cost us on average $753,000 per year, per criminal. Take the 13000 people who were killed the year that report was written, multiply by .8 and you get 10,400. Multiply THAT by $753,000, and you get 7,831,200,000. That is what we saved that year by doing away with those people. That doesn;t even include the 100,000 who were shot and only injured, and it desn't include the benifits for years to come (we save over 7 billion EVERY year thereafter becasue those same career criminals are gone).\n \n \n\"Rights come from one of two places. Either they are granted by God, or they are formed in agreement among people. Since God, although an important part of American society, has no official place in American government, our system of rights is based on an implicit social contract, one in which the general goal is to maximize freedom. Only when the American public comes to its senses and realizes that guns cost more than they are worth, will we all agree to limit one freedom, to provide us with another.\n\n \n Our rights are pre-existing. They are endowed by our creator, or whatever you want to call it. The government does not have the power to grant, nor to limit rights. It as been argued (and there are several supreme court cses that seem to agree) that the rights in the bill of rights, since they pre-date the government, are not even open to ammendment. Limiting one freedom in order to secure another is fine. Limiting a right to obtain a percieved freedom is not acceptable.\n \n Who was it that said \"he who would trade liberty for security deserves neither\" (paraphrase)?\n \n \n\"This is also known as the 'workability' argument, or by some, the 'I refuse to submit' argument. How can we possibly get people to 'give up their guns'? Well, as I indicated above, we can't, unless they are willing to.

You also need to factor in that over a million times a year, guns prevent crimes. \n \n \nAre you willing to make America freer by giving up your guns? Pro-gunners love to pay lip service to the idea of freedom, but are they willing to make the necessary sacrifice for the cause of freedom?\n\n \n No, pro gunners like rights, you can have all the freedoms you want. We just want our rights, which will preserve your freedoms, as well as our own. WE can actually document, using real numbers and approved methds of research, our side of the arument. It is a shame that the anti gunners are so far out in la la land that they have to resort to junk methodology and creative numebrs in an attempt to make their point.

   "\"Guns in the United States - Easy Access to Deadly Weapons\n \n There are approximately 192 million privately owned firearms in the U.S. - 65 million of which are handguns.[1]\n \n Currently, an estimated 39% of households have a gun, while 24% have a handgun.[2]\n \n In 1998 alone, licensed firearms dealers sold an estimated 4.4 million guns, 1.7 million of which were handguns.[3] Additionally, it is estimated that 1 to 3 million guns change hands in the secondary market each year, and many of these sales are not regulated.[4]\n \n Gun Deaths and Injury - The United States Leads the World in Firearm Violence\n \n In 1998, 30,708 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths - 12,102 (39%) of those were murdered; 17,424 (57%) were suicides; 866 (3%) were accidents; and in 316 (1%) the intent was unknown.[5] In comparison, 33,651 Americans were killed in the Korean War and 58,193 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War.[6]\n \n For every firearm fatality in the United States, there are two non-fatal firearm injuries.[7]\n \n In 1996, handguns were used to murder 2 people in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 9,390 in the United States.[8]\n \n In 1999, there were only 154 justifiable homicides by private citizens in the United States.[9]\n \n Gun Violence - Young Lives Cut Short\n \n In 1998, more than 10 children and teenagers, ages 19 and under, were killed with guns everyday.[10]\n \n In 1998, gunshot wounds were the second leading cause of injury death for men and women 10-24 years of age - second only to motor vehicle crashes.[11]\n \n In 1998, firearm homicide was the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34.[12]\n \n From 1993 through 1997, an average of 1,409 children and teenagers took their own lives with guns each year.[13]\n \n Each year during 1993 through 1997, an average of 1,621 murderers who had not reached their 18th birthdays took someone's life with a gun.[14]\n \n Guns in the Home - A Greater Risk to Family and Friends\n \n For every time a gun is used in a home in a legally-justifiable shooting [note that every self-defense is legally justifiable] there are 22 criminal, unintentional, and suicide-related shootings.[15]\n \n The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.[16]\n \n The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.[17]\n \n The Economic Costs of Gun Violence - All Americans Pay a High Price\n \n A study of all direct and indirect costs of gun violence including medical, lost wages, and security costs estimates that gun violence costs the nation $100 billion a year.[18]\n \n The average total cost of one gun crime can be as high as $1.79 million, including medical treatment and the prosecution and imprisonment of the shooter.[19]\n \n At least 80 percent of the economic costs of treating firearm injuries are paid for by taxpayer dollars.[20,21]\"\n http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/factsheets/?page=firefacts\n \n Children are killed with guns each day, not just criminals. 80% of the medical costs of treating gun injuries are paid for by taxpayers. Guns mean higher taxes. And there are only 154 justifiable homicides out of tens of thousands of gun deaths each year. That's not what I call freedom.\n\n \n Hey your citing the Brady. Do you know what Brady has to say about the Brady Bill?\n \n Something about \"safer streets\"? http://www.nrablacklist.com/\n \n What does the CDC have to say about Brady and other gun laws? \n \n \"Centers for Disease Control (CDC) committee has reported that it cannot find any evidence that gun-control laws reduce violent crime\" - http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/wheeler200310220911.asp\n \n So then there can only be two possible cases. 1) Brady is wrong and CDC is right or 2) CDC is right and Brady is wrong.\n \n How many children? Do you know. It might help if you can put a figure on it.\n \n And again. There is nothing in the 2nd Amendment about limiting gun ownership if it gets to expensive.\n \n How about your buddy? The lawyer who thinks it is OK to \"cook data\" as long as you get what your after?",

   "Why do you think the Bradys have that on their website? \n\n \n Most likely becasue that was the last year the DOJ attempted to compile such a figure. It was only after the FBI (much to the embaressment of the DOJ) issued a report the same week showing the # of times a weapon is used in defense was well over 1.6 million, that the DOJ decided they would not attempt to run seperate figures. The big difference btwn the DOJ numbers and the FBI numbers was that the DOJ didn't count defensive gun uses unless somebody was shot. The FBI, on the other hand, counted all instances they coud find involving somebody using a firearm defensively. They then used some method (honestly, I don't remember what it was, but I remember Reno admitting it was legitimate) to estimate the number of people who used a weapon defensively but did not report the encounter.\n \n This was 1994, and it was the first time Reno came under serious attack for lying to the public. It was on the news for over a month (battle between the FBI and justice department over crime statistics). \n \n \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reported an additional 13,200 handgun homicides during the same year, a 24 percent increase over the five-year average.\" http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/hvfsdaft.pr Almost a million crimes commited with guns (and that's just handguns) and less than 100,000 guns used in self defense.\n\n \n Again, this was regarding 1992, when crime in America was at its peak. crime has been declining pretty steadily since then (oddly enough, gun ownership has been increaseing). Also, the FBI did not report those numbers, the DOJ did. \n \n It seems that this year, violent crime is down 3.2 percent, yet by all accounts gun ownership is actually up almost 6%.\n \n There is a more recent article about crime related gun use at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/fidc9397.pdf One thing I find interesting is that, according to that report, of all the gun deaths between 1993 and 1997 (180,533), 51% were suicides, not homicides.\n \n They still don't attempt to calculate the number of defensive uses of weapons, since this is difficult to impossible to do (as Reno graciously proved for us in the early 90's).",

I took 3 semesters of statistics, and a sampling of 5000 household is HUGE when doing statistical research. Generally 600-1600 is more the norm.

A murderer can kill you just as fast with his bare hands. Suppose the 200 million man Chinese army decides to rush us. How free will we be then without guns? The fact that we are armed is our greatest defense. People like you are trying to set us up for a fall. Take our guns? Yea right,\n \n From my cold dead hands,\n \n Terral",

   "\"Freedom, as those versed in even rudimentary political science know, comes in two variants, freedom 'from,' and freedom 'to.' Both of these are crucial in American society. We all want freedoms 'to' do things that benefit us, and we want freedoms from things that harm us.\" \n \n Do you want to have more freedom by giving up your guns? We could have freedom from gun violence and freedom from high taxes that are caused by thousands of gun injuries each year. \n \n \"The cost of firearm injuries in the US in 1990 was an estimated $20.4 billion. This includes $1.4 billion for direct expenditures for health care and related goods, $1.6 billion in lost productivity resulting from injury-related disability, and $17.4 billion in lost productivity from premature death. (Max and Rice, 1993)....There you have it: costs of up to $20 billion, most of which is borne by the taxpayer, which limits our rights and freedoms. Hundreds of thousands of injuries, limiting the freedoms of those shot, and tens of thousands of deaths, completely halting those freedoms.  \n \n \"Rights come from one of two places. Either they are granted by God, or they are formed in agreement among people. Since God, although an important part of American society, has no official place in American government, our system of rights is based on an implicit social contract, one in which the general goal is to maximize freedom. Only when the American public comes to its senses and realizes that guns cost more than they are worth, will we all agree to limit one freedom, to provide us with another.\n \n \"This is also known as the 'workability' argument, or by some, the 'I refuse to submit' argument. How can we possibly get people to 'give up their guns'? Well, as I indicated above, we can't, unless they are willing to. This is why I advocate explaining the costs of guns as much as possible, and fighting the gun lobby at every turn. Only when we convince gun owners that their guns are dangerous to the freedoms of others can we hope to succeed. If nobody buys the argument, and everybody wants guns, then all I can (and will) do is continue to attempt to persuade otherwise. But I believe that when looking at the problem honestly and evaluating the tremendous costs of guns to our freedoms, and their relatively minimal returns on such, we as a society will decide to maximize our freedoms by giving up the guns.\"  \n http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/freedom.htm\n \n Are you willing to make America freer by giving up your guns? Pro-gunners love to pay lip service to the idea of freedom, but are they willing to make the necessary sacrifice for the cause of freedom?\n\n The first loss of freedom is not the gun itself but the loss of the right to use the gun. The American way of life was based upon the right to kill those that offend. Our Bill of Rights was intended only to limit the powers of government in regard to the people. At the time of the founding of this nation it was perfectly legal to force others into a duel or even dip them in tar and ride them out of town on a rail simply for uttering an unpopular opinion or belief. A person cursing in public or staggering drunk might be gunned down with impunity for the shooter. In Shakespeare's day it wasn't unusual for an actor having to defend himself with a sword on stage as any patron who disliked the acting was likely to attack with sword. Knights who hacked down waiters for poor service were only given trivial fines. The American tradition was actually built upon the notion that violence was acceptable and a useful social tool.",
