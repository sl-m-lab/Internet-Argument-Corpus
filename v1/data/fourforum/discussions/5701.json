And it's funny how they remake old songs and put a little more beat into it and speed it up. My little brother was astonished when my mom started singing along to \"What a Wonderful World\" remade on a movie soundtrack (forget which one) and \"I'm a Believer\" from Shrek. He really thought \"I'm a believer was written just for the movie. I also heard that he country song \"Beautiful Mess\" by Diamond Rio was supposed to be recorded by someone else. The someone else? Eminem.",

Sometimes they will go the other way - Joss Stone's sultry ballad \"Fell in Love With a Boy\" was originally a perky little number by the White Stripes.\n \n Funny story on the new generation - my 12 year neice came up to me and my sister in law a few weeks ago to tell us all about this great new band called Green Day. :p",

   "Funny you mention punk--when I was younger I was into the punk scene, which led me to the ska scene, both of which eventually led me back into the early 80s/late 70s punk/ska scene in the UK, and a lot of the ska eventually led me to being interested in older rock (50s and 60s) as well as jazz. Within two years I went from Dead Kennedys to Benny Goodman. Who knew? :p \n \n My playlist now looks like it belongs to 3 different people. Dead Kennedys next to Dvorak, Rachmaninoff next to Rage Against the Machine, Glenn Miller next to Green Day and CCR next to The Clash.",
