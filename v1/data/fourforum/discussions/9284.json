The idea that somehow in 2006 we want to be rigid about the definition of marriage, considering that history, is a thinly veiled bigotry against gays.

To me that sounds frighteningly similar to something that could be heard several decades ago: \"Our schools should only teach white children. We don't hate gays or anything, we just oppose having them in schools with our children, it just isn't possible to us to allow them in our school. We aren't really opposed to them going to school, we'll support that as long as they go to their own school for blacks and aren't allowed in our white schools.

   "Hm. To me that sounds frighteningly similar to something that could be heard several decades ago: \"Our schools should only teach white children. We don't hate gays or anything, we just oppose having them in schools with our children, it just isn't possible to us to allow them in our school. We aren't really opposed to them going to school, we'll support that as long as they go to their own school for blacks and aren't allowed in our white schools. Allowing them in the white schools is just silly.\" \n \n I'm sorry, but just like what was decided back then, seperate but equal is NEVER equal. Basically they are saying that gays are somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution lest they sully the institution of marriage (something heteros are doing without anyone else's help).\n\n \n Separate but equal is NEVER equal? Which are better? Boys' or Girls' bathrooms? Other than that last statement I agree 100%. I don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but I DO believe they could be if we wanted them to be.
