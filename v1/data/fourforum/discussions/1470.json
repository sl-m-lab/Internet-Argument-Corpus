   "How the drug war affects us all\n \n There is little doubt that the most pressing crisis in America today is the so-called War On Drugs. This modern day prohibition has created an environment that affects all of us, in ways that might not be immediately apparent. \n \n What study after study has shown is that the drug prohibition laws have not only failed completely, but have actually made matters worse.\n \n For instance, as a result of the current drug laws, use among teenagers is up over 7 times over the last 35 years. Overall, homicides are an order of magnitude higher than they were in pre-prohibition days. Crime in general is substantially higher - higher as a result of the drug prohibition.\n \n The reason? Drug prohibition does virtually nothing to stop people from making, selling, buying or using drugs. In fact prohibition encourages illegal drugs because prohibition keeps drug profits high for drug dealers. These high profits are supported by the government's prohibition policies which create our current unregulated drug black market.\n \n \n  The Black Mark Of Black Markets\n \n Of course, with all black markets come severely increased crime and many other tragic injuries to society. Have you stopped for a moment to think about why our cities are plagued with graffiti? Simple - gangs marking their territory. Gangs supported by illegal drug money. Gangs that would disappear if prohibition were replaced with regulation.\n \n Have you wondered why so many innocent Americans have been killed by police officers? It's because the police have been resorting to terror tactics as a way to enforce the nation's unjust drug laws. Further, the police have become more reliant on paid, anonymous informants. These informants often provide incorrect or dishonest information. The result has been a terrible denial of freedom and civil rights for Americans.\n \n The huge money flow outside this country to drug lords demonstrates the ultimate futility of our nation's policies - the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of potential tax revenues ending up in the pockets of criminals.\n \n Even gun owners have been subjected to more and more severe gun control laws as a result of the crime wave caused by the war on drugs.\n \n \n  D is for Drug War, F is for Failure\n \n The drug war has made drugs more prevalent in schools, resulted in destroyed civil rights and freedoms, provided higher profits for drug dealers, taken hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenues away from valuable government programs, and promoted higher crime throughout our country.\n \n In other words, the \"War On Drugs\" has not only failed - it has made matters worse for all of us. The biggest obstacle to winning the war on drugs is the war on drugs itself. It really does not matter if you are for or against recreational substance use - the war on drugs must be brought to an end. \n \n ~ Andrew Somers",

   "Crime is not \"substantially higher\" today, crime is at its lowest levels since they started measuring it. Just take a look at the FBI web site. Drugs were regulated for good reason: they create fewer problems that way. Guess when crime was at it's highest levels? My gosh, the early 1970s!\n \n \"Hundreds of billions of dollars\" in tax revenues is a very inaccurate number. The total product of the country is only 10 trillion dollars, drugs counting for so much of it is completely absurd.\n \n The studies on the economic impact of allowing the drug trade show that we would lose a great deal of productivity and the nations output would be greatly reduced. \n \n Millions of homes have already been broken, millions of lives shattered, why in the world would someone advocate making that far cheaper and far easier to do?",

   "Crime is not \"substantially higher\" today, crime is at its lowest levels since they started measuring it. \n\n \n False. They started measuring crime around the turn of the century. If you study this chart:\n \n http://www.druglibrary.org/special/friedman/a_war_we_are_losing.htm\n \n You'll see definite increases in violence that coincide with prohibiton laws taking effect.\n \n \n\n Just take a look at the FBI web site. Drugs were regulated for good reason: they create fewer problems that way. \n\n \n Drugs are NOT regulated - they are UNregulated. A black market has no regulation. Purity, health, dose level, and other issues are ignored, meanwhile potential tax revenues are lost.\n \n Drug prohibition creates FAR MORE problems than the drugs themselves.\n \n \n\n Guess when crime was at it's highest levels? My gosh, the early 1970s!\n\n \n False. Crime ESCALATED As Nixon started the drug war. The black markets of the drug war are what created that escalated crime, not the drugs themselves. It peaked in the 80s and early 90s.\n \n \n \n \n\n \"Hundreds of billions of dollars\" in tax revenues is a very inaccurate number. The total product of the country is only 10 trillion dollars, drugs counting for so much of it is completely absurd.\n\n \n The annual illegal drug trade is between 70 and 90 Billion each and every year. And right now ALL of that money is going to drug dealers and drug lords. In addition, we are now spending 100 Billion per year in criminal interdiction efforts on this war. That money is going to filling our prisons with non-violent users, and NOT going to education and treatment.\n \n \n http://civilliberty.about.com/library/PDF/prisoner.pdf\n \n \n \n\n The studies on the economic impact of allowing the drug trade show that we would lose a great deal of productivity and the nations output would be greatly reduced. \n \n\n \n \n False. We lose more productivity due to prohibition and black markets than we would if recreational substances were regulated. They are not regulated now.\n \n \n \n \n\n Millions of homes have already been broken, millions of lives shattered, why in the world would someone advocate making that far cheaper and far easier to do?\n\n \n \n More homes and families have been broken and destroyed by drug war policies than by any drug use.\n \n \n Keep in mind that alcohol is among the most dangerous of recreational drugs, yet we tolerate it quite well as a society with it REGULATED.\n \n When it was PROHIBITED, under prohibition, we had enormous violence, crime, corruption, and increased drinking. After prohibition, with regulation and health education and treatment, we were able to lower drinking levels, and the crime and social problems associated with prohibition.\n \n http://civilliberty.about.com/library/content/blDrugWarIssues.htm\n \n It does not matter if you are for or against dug use, prohibition is an abject failure.\n \n http://www.DrugWarFAQ.com\n \n Regards\n \n \n Andy",

   "I agree. I did not understand how anyone would recommend legalizing drugs. Then I inserted the words \"drug prohibition related crime\" in place of \"drug related crime\" and it became apparent. Then it became apparent that we did not need to \"legalize drugs\" but we needed to \"remove the prohibition laws\". \n \n I would expect a spike in drug consumption if prohibitions was repealed, but over time usage would go down. Every decade the per capita use of Alcohol and cigarettes declines. \n \n I remember when I was in High School, drugs were easier to get than alcohol.

In a regulated envirnment you can curtail that \"hard sell\" aspect, and naturally use will drop.\n \n In Amsterdam, marijuan is legal, and heroin is given to addicts by the government. The result?

   "I want to toss in my 2 cents on this one. Drugs are illegal because they are evil and bad for you. Of course, alcohol is evil and bad for you (anything that can make you feel that bad the next day is obviously evil). Personally, I do not see the difference between the mjority of drugs and the use of alcohol.\n \n There are some exceptions. There are certain drugs that are devestatingly addictive. Specifically, crack cocain has proven to be so. I do not think that something like crack should be made legal, I think it is against the public intrest.\n \n Of course, I think that if drugs were legalized, there would be far fewer pwople after drugs like crack.

I live in kansas, and we have seen a big upsurge in crime in the last several years. This is entirely because of the meth trade, specifically production of meth. It is my understanding that people like meth mostly because it is cheaper than good drugs. If we had some good drugs that were cheaper, or the same price as meth, maybe even some that are FDA approved, I think the trade in crappy cheap drugs like meth would dry up.\n \n I also don;t buy into the whole \"gateway drug\" **** in relation to marajuana. I smoke marajuana in high school a handfull of times, and I can honestly say it never hurt me or caused me to take up the use of harder drugs. \n \n I think that scare tactics and lying to our kids is the true \"gateway\". For years I heard in school how addictive pot was and what terrible consequences there were for using it. I actually still have a handout we were given in middle school that claims that most people become hopelessly addicted with their first use. I smoked pot and did not become hopelessly addicted. Other people that I knew that had smoked pot were not hopelessly addicted. Nobody ever stuck a baby in the oven, or a dog in the microwave. Once you figure out that you have been lied to for year about pot, I can see where some people would assume that all the **** they have heard about drugs and their bad side is a lie.\n \n I chose not to do drugs (besides smoking pot a few times) because I couldn;t see th point. You spend $30 on a quarter ounce of the stuff, smoke your joint, eat your twinkie and fall asleep. To me, this was the exact opposite of having a good time.",

My idea of efficient is simply that we do not destroy what we need while trying to get what we want.\n\n \n ...elements...that are...\n \n \n Your opinion of my integrity is just that...your opinion. I learned many years ago that just because someone calls you a fool doesn't mean that you are one. Manipulatory intent is part of the process of changing someone else's mind, or educating them to believe something. We all do that. You are trying to manipulate me as much as I am you. So what!\n \n \n \n \nJim, the above shows your lack of intellectual integrity, fairness. You can sit in ignorance unless you give it your best shot. I asked first!\n \n I've already commented on your intellectual integrity and now you throw your spiritual integrity into question.\n\n \n My spiritual integrity has nothing whatsoever to do with this discussion.\n \n Again, I say that is nothing more than your misguided opinion. And again, it appears that having integrity is something subject to your judgement.\n \n I have told you my thoughts on the main purpose of law....and by my expression of having no interest in why only two presidents have been non-Masonic, I have answered the question. I don't know why and I don't care why. \n \n Just to satisfy your need for an answer, here's mine:\n \n Two non-Masonic men were elected President of the United States because each of them won a presidential election.\n \n Why don't you explain \"the real reason\" and let me see if I agree.\n \n Now I repeat my question. What do you consider to be the purposes of law and which one do you consider to be the greatest of them?\n \n \n \nTry backing up your posts with real answers.\n\n Apparently you perceive my answers to be unreal because they do not comply with your feelings. If you're waiting for me to \"get it right\", get real!",

   "Thank you Jim,\n I'll retract all undue criticism of your intellectual integrity. I can tell you are trying to answer. It is not quite the answer but it is good information/perspective. The answer has philosophical context proportionate to the question.\n \nI'll answer this post first. \n the purpose of law are contained in my statement for the need of a government...to protect our freedoms. Governmental authority is needed solely for the formulation of (by democratic process) and the enforcement of laws, all of which protect us from each other and the outside world. \n\n The purpose of law is to protect life.\n \n\n To put it quite simply, the purpose of communication is to transmit data. The data can be in the form of facial expressions, pauses, sound, motions, numbers, alphabetical characters, intonations, flashing lights or whatever method is recognizable and understood by the sender and recipient(s).\n\n You have described accurately how communication is done, not why. Communication is for the purpose of protecting life, our own or our interests in life. Generally, everything we do serves that purpose. The greater service is to use communication to protect our children's futures. Historically, philosophically, communication has produced coded structures of behavior that act to control our populations called government. Good government protects life.\n \n\n Competition is what it is all about. You seem to promote sheep herding, and only you seem to qualify as the shepherd. We are quite conscious and have learned through experience to be skeptical of people who claim to know everything but appear to say nothing.\n\n You will see that I do not compete much. In defending ones position it may appear that way. Actually as human beings we are 86% unconscious mentally. The barrier between our unconscious is unbroken and maintained by the unconscious for its purposes. Our conscious does not want to know that so the unconscious accommodates with thought patterns that allow the conscious to believe it has control. It also helps in the execution of cognitively controlled actions. All of us are mostly unconscious and for 30% of our live we do not know what we are doing with our minds.\n \n Good answers, thanks.\n \n \nWe have no freedom to pollute.\n\n \n We value freedom because it protects life. Pollution, if it's happening in a society that espouses freedom, is an abuse of freedom. All only possible because the purposes of communication and law are ignored.\n \n\n The role of environmentalists is to fight for methods of protecting the environment. \n\n Your correct statement above is now a link to my site about water and algae in southern California.\n \n\n Biology itself is not a thinking group of individuals, therefore cannot exhibit a democratic face.\n\n Our instincts serve to protect life.\n \n Our instinct unconsciously known may include something primordial as an ether that ends up allowing us to interact to live as a group and adapt. There is actually a scientific word used to describe it. Mitogenetic Radiation. Here is a site that explains it. There are many such.\n \n http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/mitogenetic.html\n \n It has been around for some time and many replications show that there is a very real effect. That effect is the basis for another aspect of our group interactions called a Morphogenetic field. The Hundredth Monkey Theory is a result of morphogenetic unconscious sharing of information. What is curious is that if you search for the hundredth monkey you will never find a reference to the original story written by the 23 Japanese biologists conducting the study. You find Ken Keys book which is not a competent retelling of the story. I have never found anyone who has read the original story either. I read it twice and can say that every indications of our behaviors show that if monkeys can share information in their dreams, we can too and do it better. \n \n\n What is your point? What is \"that\" in the above quote? Are you saying that the lack of a democratic principle in biology will control us?\n\n Let me repeat and add a word to what you refer to;\n There is no democratic principle involved with biology and that fact WILL and does control us.\n \n All I'm saying is that a biologic species has invented democracy and they struggle to control themselves with it (at best) but the biological instincts will most often prevail.\n \n\n Manipulatory intent is part of the process of changing someone else's mind, or educating them to believe something. We all do that. You are trying to manipulate me as much as I am you. So what!\n\n Excellent response. Exactly how I feel about it too. All communication is manipulation. What matters is why we manipulate.\n \n Just to satisfy your need for an answer, here's mine:\n \n Two non-Masonic men were elected President of the United States because each of them won a presidential election.\n \n Why don't you explain \"the real reason\" and let me see if I agree.\n \n Fear is a feeling we need to reject if we cannot reason why we feel it. If you do successfully, you will return and discuss what I share at the site your answer and request are now linked to. The page is a little silly in some ways, but it is correct. The site is huge, spend some time looking around and there are 3 important links from the index page that are filled with facts of history, law and psychology that will probably answer a number of questions you have about wtf I'm coming from. Certainly a small percentage of what I contend could be coincidence, then again maybe not.\n \n Excellent responses Jim. Toukalos evaluation of your intellectual integrity is high, and quite correct, your spiritual integrity is also sound. How far can you go with that?",
