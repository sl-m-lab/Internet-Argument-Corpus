This is what scientists report in a groundbreaking study in the May 16, 2007 issue of the open-access journal PLoS ONE. \n \n \"Animals and especially insects are usually seen as complex robots which only respond to external stimuli,\" says senior author Bj\u00f6rn Brembs from the Free University Berlin. They are assumed to be input-output devices. \"When scientists observe animals responding differently even to the same external stimuli, they attribute this variability to random errors in a complex brain.\" Using a combination of automated behavior recording and sophisticated mathematical analyses, the international team of researchers showed for the first time that such variability cannot be due to simple random events but is generated spontaneously and non-randomly by the brain. These results caught computer scientist and lead author Alexander Maye from the University of Hamburg by surprise: \"I would have never guessed that simple flies who otherwise keep bouncing off the same window have the capacity for nonrandom spontaneity if given the chance.\" \n \n The researchers tethered fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) in completely uniform white surroundings and recorded their turning behavior. In this setup, the flies do not receive any visual cues from the environment and since they are fixed in space, their turning attempts have no effect. Thus lacking any input, their behavior should resemble random noise, similar to a radio tuned between stations. However, the analysis showed that the temporal structure of fly behavior is very different from random noise. The researchers then tested a plethora of increasingly complex random computer models, all of which failed to adequately model fly behavior. \n \n Only after the team analyzed the fly behavior with methods developed by co-authors George Sugihara and Chih-hao Hsieh from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego did they realize the origin of the fly's peculiar spontaneity. \"We found that there must be an evolved function in the fly brain which leads to spontaneous variations in fly behavior\" Sugihara said. \"The results of our analysis indicate a mechanism which might be common to many other animals and could form the biological foundation for what we experience as free will\". \n \n Our subjective notion of \"Free Will\" is an oxymoron: the term 'will' would not apply if our actions were completely random and it would not be 'free' if they were entirely determined. So if there is free will, it must be somewhere between chance and necessity - which is exactly where fly behavior comes to lie. \"The question of whether or not we have free will appears to be posed the wrong way,\" says Brembs. \"Instead, if we ask 'how close to free will are we\"' one finds that this is precisely where humans and animals differ\". \n \n The next step will be to use genetics to localize and understand the brain circuits responsible for the spontaneous behavior. This step could lead directly to the development of robots with the capacity for spontaneous nonrandom behavior and may help combating disorders leading to compromised spontaneous behavioral variability in humans such as depression, schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder. \n \n The research will appear in the May 16, 2007 issue of the open-access journal PLoS ONE. \n \n \n ###\n [A multimedia version of this story, with video and illustrations, is available on Bj\u00f6rn Brembs' website, at http://brembs.net/spontaneous] \n \n Disclaimer \n \n The following press release refers to an upcoming article in PLoS ONE.

   "well then obviously cells have free will as well!\n \n I'm not sure how you think this helps your position. I don't think it means what you think it means:\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18684016/\n \n \nA plethora of increasingly sophisticated computer analyses revealed that the way the flies turned back and forth over time was far from random. Instead, there appeared to be \"a function in the fly brain which evolved to generate spontaneous variations in the behavior,\" Sugihara said.\n \n Specifically, their behavior seemed to match up with a mathematical algorithm called Levy's distribution, commonly found in nature. Flies use this procedure to find meals, as do albatrosses, monkeys and deer. Scientists have found similar patterns in the flow of e-mails, letters and money, and in the paintings of Jackson Pollock, Brembs said.\n \n These strategies in flies appear to arise spontaneously and do not result from outside cues, according to findings detailed in Wednesday's issue of the journal PLoS ONE. This makes their behavior seem to lie somewhere between completely random and purely determined, \"and could form the biological foundation for what we experience as free will,\" Sugihara added. \"This function appears to be common to many other animals.\" \n \n Brembs said that \"even a fly brain possesses a function which makes it easier to imagine a brain that creates the impression of free will.\"\n \n \"If even flies show the capacity for spontaneity, can we really assume it is missing in humans?\" he asked.\n",

Some of those states will result in activity of the fly.\n\n \n \nGibberish.\n\n \n It most certainly is not. In fact, this is one of the best short descriptions of the science of chaos/complexity theory that I have seen. The theory deals with mathematical models that can be used to track the development of non-linear, fluctuating systems as diverse as the stock market, wild animal populations, fluid turbulence, climatic behaviour, heart rhythms, and the fractal patterns (patterns self-similar at all scales) found everywhere in nature, from the structure of crystals to the patterns of desert dunes.\n \n Before this science was fully developed, mathematical models used by biologsts, economists, demographers and psychologists among others tended to be caricatures of reality; the complexity of real phenomena studies outstripped anything to be found in the controlled environment of the lab. \n \n Systems studied in these areas, it was realised, fluctuate between states within certain parameters, with an inversely proportional relationship between the extremity of a state and its number of occurences. Additionally, there are patterns of fluctaution within the overall pattern, where the system oscillates around a \"basin of attraction\", a point of relative stability, before eventually leaping off unpredictably to a new \"basin of attraction\".\n \n Chaos theory essentially shows that simple deterministic systems can easily give rise to what looks like 'random' behaviour - the reality is that they become unpredictable in terms of specifying which states will be achieved at which time. But the maths of chaos does allow us to model the parameters of a chaotic system, the probability of attaining any given state, and the likely effects of introducing new factors into the already complex, fluctuating system; what ususally happens is that the system oscillates wildly between states, then settles down to a new pattern of fluctuation with new parameters.\n \n Regarding the fly's brain, it is easy, IMO, to see how models of such non-linear systems are applicable. If you reduce the brain to its constituent neurons, glial cells etc you find, obviously, that the chemistry that underlies the workings of the brain is entirely deterministic, and these constituent structures are well-understood in terms of their internal structure and their functional relationships. What is not understood is how the system as a whole operates and how any one given state (which is a seething complex of sub-states) influences the dynamic evolution of future states.\n \n Chaos theory, the study of non-linear systems gives us a starting point from which to conduct investigations into brain behaviour: the basic features of any chaotic model are points of stability within instability, and regions with changeable boundaries. All complex systems have been found to have these same organisational principles. Interestingly, the equations used to model them are surprisingly simple, but provide very complex solutions, much in the same way that the systems themselves are composed of very simple, deterministic parts which act together to produce apparently random behaviour with apparently spontaneous state changes.\n \n BTW I haven't had time to respond in the other thread WW, but now I've finished uni I will get around to it when I've thought about your ideas some more.",

In fact the fractal nature of these patterns means that at any scale, no matter how small, you will find similar patterns and similar \"basins\".

Yes, in that when any system is reduced to its constituents it is relatively easy to understand the underlying mechanisms.

   "It's not the same behaviour per se, it's the very complex behaviour which, following the same organisational principles that determine the fractal patterns of the system's state change, defines a system as 'chaotic'; patterns of fluctuation around a \"basin of attraction\" that themselves are part of a larger pattern with its own \"basins\".

   "**\n So are you saying that live organisms are just \"chaotic systems\",[like weathersystems]? If not, what does all this chaos theory have to do with the fruitfly behaviour in the OP study?\n\n \n Yes, as long as we take the definition of 'chaotic' as being, as shown by chaos theory, to be a system which is deterministic in parts but unpredictable as a whole. This definition may be unsatisfactory to your philosophy (I'm guessing here; fill me in) but chaos theory has shown that such systems do certainly exist; they may not be the be-all and end-all of existence (I don't know) but they certainly do exist. \n \n \nI would say that \"chaotic\" is, FAPP, close enough to \"stochastically random\" as far as this particular question, \"volition\", goes. The question is--is the fly behaviour\n A/totally pre-determined by mechanistic determinism, i.e. the passive reaction caused by external forces.

As you may know, I tend to base my views on basic, substantial matters such as these on the views of experts whose work I have read. I do not consider myself a philosopher; I do not have the courage of my convictions to be such a person!:) So, given what I know, I can only really go with option A (while preferring an alternate option C). for the following reasons:\n \n Option B\n \n Option B says (in short) 'totally non-deterministic'; this is patently false by the standard of any method of investigation; based on the premise that if any phenomena were wholly non-deterministic we would in principle have no hope analysing such phenomena.\n \n Option C is, to my mind, close but has it the wrong way around. This may be (but I don't think so) semantic pedantry on my part, but I would rather word it \"Partially mechanically determined but to some extent unpredictable\". Does this make sense to you? If so, then this is the option I would choose. If not, we need to continue the discussion on very basic terms.\n \n Option D falls into the realm of the non-falsifiable (unless you can convince me that we can analyse such a concept rationally); the concept of volition is entirely subjective unless we have a standard against which to measure it; as far as I know, no such standard exists. Or does it...?\n \n \n \nAnd that is where materialist reductionism fails, and it once again calls upon its old magical cure-all, 'spontaneous generation',-- this time calling it, 'emergence'.\n\n \n OK, I see where you're coming from on this point, but it really, REALLY is not seen as spontaneous (ie ex nihilo) generation by anyone that studies it. I suspect that we will differ on this point, and here is my reasoning; you take the gain/loss of information as a subset of entropic 'evolution' (no pun intended!); I do not; for the reason that 'information' is, to my mind, a subjective term, whereas the energy of a physical system (not that again!) is an objective, measurable quantity. \n \n Let me expand on this, from my point of view; Let us say that within system x, which is chaotic, certain emergent properties become apparent. I will admit that I am not remotely familiar with information theory in terms of Shannon et al but I can say that physics does not allow any extra mass-energy to be created ex nihilo; all that is allowed is a rearrangement of already extant mass-energy. If certain emergent properties become apparent, I would expect them to conform to the 2LoT. If they do not, then some major re-theorising is necessary. However I am already confident that it is not necessary because the 2LoT has proven itself to be as infallible as a theory can be; I genuinely cannot think of an equation that has been so thoroughly tested. So emergent properties of a system can only comprise mass-energy that already existed; fact. But it is the fact that emergent properties are literally unpredictable that generates so-called 'information' by transforming a system; the key point is that as much information is lost as is gained in the transformation; the energy of the system remains constant. If there is any discrepancy here, the 2LoT is violated; this does not imply impossibility, but it does imply that one of the 'safest' theories of man is questionable, which opens a Pandora's Abyss of problems.\n \n \nIt's only a \"paradox\" to a materialist. To anybody else it's just another natural phenomenon that needs explaining.\n\n \n This is true. However, I have yet to read anything (and you know my knowledge has huge philosophical gaps!) that might offer an alternative that does not paint this as a paradox. \n \n \nSo in what possible sense can such a phenomenon be described as 'determined'?!? When you cannot get the same physical effect from the exact same physical cause, every time, then you don't just have unpredictability--you have mechanical indeterminism, i.e., pure chance, randomness.\n\n \n OK, yes, BUT, this is what chaos theory tries to address; it is hard to accept, if one chooses to accept it. You seem to suggest (correct me if I'm wrong) that we have to accept either totally deterministic or totally stochastic causation; chaos theory suggests that what we actually have is a bit of both; that all systems are deterministic but that the eigenstate of a complex system is unpredictable without being wholly non-deterministic. The fact that non-linear equations have been used to model such systems is all the evidence I need to accept this hypothesis.\n \n \nActually, it is an undeniable contradiction in terms; one that appears merely 'paradoxical' to materialists, but is far worse than that wrt to their metaphysic. The only way to understand the issue is to dump materialism.\n\n \n Again, I have to say, that if such a theory opposes the fundamentals of materialism, then yes, by all means dump it! I really have to say at this point that I know a good deal of psychologists, physicists, biologists and mathematicians (by virtue of my being a student) and precisely NONE of them adhere with any dogmatism to the values of materialism that you tend to expound. That's really all I can say on the matter. I don't know enough detail of these areas of study to truly argue the points.",

   "Yes, as long as we take the definition of 'chaotic' as being, as shown by chaos theory, to be a system which is deterministic in parts but unpredictable as a whole. This definition may be unsatisfactory to your philosophy (I'm guessing here; fill me in) but chaos theory has shown that such systems do certainly exist; they may not be the be-all and end-all of existence (I don't know) but they certainly do exist.\n\n \n Hi Liminus,\n I'm a biochemist by training, and don't claim to be any sort of expert on chaos theory, but my understanding of it is that a random-appearing chaotic system is fully deterministic in that every state n is fully and causally determined by the preceding state n-1. In other words, there need be no truly stochastic element where some state spontaneously arises uncaused, i.e. without any antecedent conditions, to get random-seeming behaviour. Thus in principle, if it were possible to know the absolute value of every relevant variable, the mathematical relationships between them, and to calculate the evolution of the system to infinite precision, then it would be possible to know the state of the system at any given time in its evolution, from any starting point within its evolution, forwards or backwards. IOW, a chaotic system is fully causal and deterministic, yet its behaviour can be indistinguishable in many respects from a truly stochastic system. And with such a system, if you start with the same values for the variables, and calculate them to the same arbitrary precision, you will always get the same system trajectory.\n \n The reason real chaotic systems (e.g. the course of a tornado, or the operation of a mind) are unpredictable in practice is basically two-fold (if we ignore for the sake of argument the sheer magnitude of the calculation as a practical factor). First, there is great sensitivity to initial conditions: it's impossible to know the initial, absolute values of the variables, and usually they can only be estimated and recalculated to some arbitrary precision. Consequently, very small differences in initial estimates will quite rapidly lead to very large differences between predicted and actual behaviour. Second, it's impossible to jump from step n to step n+m, where m is some arbitrary integer, without plodding through the intermediate steps -- there are no shortcuts to calculation, so long range prediction without doing all the fiddly bits in between is impossible.\n \n So one can have fully deterministic behaviour that appears random to the eye, and is in important practical respects, unpredictable. One doesn't need genuine stochasticity to achieve this. Of course, whether genuine stochasticity is relevant in the real world of brains, say through quantum events, or whether one can regard the brain as a fully deterministic, non-stochastic chaotic system, is an open question as far as I'm concerned. I don't think we know enough to answer it beyond all doubt. We can't really tell just by observing it, so far as I can figure out.",

Thus it is what transpires with the weathersystem that counts, and not what transpires with the individual raindrops, their molecules, or any other molecules or atoms contained within it. If \"chaos\" theory is not concerned with the internal behaviours of a systems parts, but is applied to whole complex systems, per se, such as whole weather/climate systems in meteorology and climatology, and elsewhere. That means that chaos theory is concerned with discernible cause/effect patterns and regularities exhibited by systems as _wholes_, so that, as always, science can make many more valid predictions than invalid ones; that is, overcome stochasticity/pure chance. What you are calling 'parts' are the confused, disordered, and irregular [i.e., stochastically random in any mathematical sense] initial external conditions whose unpredictable interactions generate the system as a whole into an identifiable entity, plus, later inputs into the now identifiable system from unpredictable [random] external sources--let's call them \"mutagens\".\n \n Now, what is interesting here is that chaos theory can only apply to passive systems, those systems, such as weathersystems, whose behaviour and even existence is entirely the result of external forces, and not any internal ones. But that is what separates a weathersystem from a biosystem, like a sheep or an oak tree or a fruitfly.\n Biosystems are truly dynamic, not passive, and not entirely dependent upon external forces, (such as RM+NS) for their existence or their behaviours. Now, materialists/mechanists insist that no such distinction exists, in keeping with a basic metaphysical postulate of their faith/ideology. Their ideology asserts that existence and all the events within existence begin at the bottom, with the ultimately reduced 'particle', and then deterministically work their way up to weather systems, fruitflies and human beings, _all_ as mere passive congregations of 'particles'. But there is absolutely no reason in the world to accept that postulate, from any rational and/or empirical standard. It's merely an article of their faith.\n But that, it seems to me, is the only reason you have for saying that in chaos theory the determinism is in the parts and the chaos is in the whole, instead of the other way round.\n \n \n\n This definition may be unsatisfactory to your philosophy (I'm guessing here; fill me in) but chaos theory has shown that such systems do certainly exist; they may not be the be-all and end-all of existence (I don't know) but they certainly do exist. \n\n \n **\n I do not think so. As above, I think you have it backwards.

Although not, it would seem, by quantum physics. However, we are discussing systems, not particles here, and, contra materialism, there is an empirically discernible difference between one or mor particles, and a system. A difference that, contra materialism, is not merely a quantitative one , but a qualitative one as well. But it is true that no system can exist, by definition, as the sum of the totally non-deterministic behaviours of any number of parts. So yes, B/ is out the window in this case, by definition.\n \n \n\n Option C is, to my mind, close but has it the wrong way around. This may be (but I don't think so) semantic pedantry on my part, but I would rather word it \"Partially mechanically determined but to some extent unpredictable\". Does this make sense to you? If so, then this is the option I would choose.

We all undergo entropy unto death, in physical, mechanical terms. Your problem, as a materialist, is to convince the world that life, intelligence, volition, information, etc. are physical, mechanical phenomena,-- like clockwork dolls and steam trains.\n \n Add to that the notion of 'emergence', which in such a mechanical, physical system, always entails 'creatio ex nihilo'.

That means that chaos theory is concerned with discernible cause/effect patterns and regularities exhibited by systems as _wholes_, so that, as always, science can make many more valid predictions than invalid ones; that is, overcome stochasticity/pure chance. What you are calling 'parts' are the confused, disordered, and irregular [i.e., stochastically random in any mathematical sense] initial external conditions whose unpredictable interactions generate the system as a whole into an identifiable entity, plus, later inputs into the now identifiable system from unpredictable [random] external sources--let's call them \"mutagens\".\n\n \n But I wouldn't call them \"confused, disordered and irregular\" if I were to desire to explain the phenomena in a truly detailed and meaningful way. There is certainly nothing confused about them; there will always be a certain level of order in such phenomena (even if it is only the bell curve of so-called 'random' distribution) and use of the word irregular is a truism; when comparing any system against its constituents, those smaller elements will always be relatively irregular.\n \n \nNow, what is interesting here is that chaos theory can only apply to passive systems, those systems, such as weathersystems, whose behaviour and even existence is entirely the result of external forces, and not any internal ones. But that is what separates a weathersystem from a biosystem, like a sheep or an oak tree or a fruitfly.\n\n \n What is your reasoning behind this statement?\n \n \nBiosystems are truly dynamic, not passive, and not entirely dependent upon external forces, (such as RM+NS) for their existence or their behaviours.\n\n \n There is nothing in the universe that is entirely dependent upon external forces. In fact I am not sure that physics (again!) makes a distinction between external and internal forces; all there are, are forces which are relevant to a given system, and forces which are not. I am not just talking fundamental forces here, but all the forces at all scales which may or may not apply.\n \n \nNow, materialists/mechanists insist that no such distinction exists, in keeping with a basic metaphysical postulate of their faith/ideology. Their ideology asserts that existence and all the events within existence begin at the bottom, with the ultimately reduced 'particle', and then deterministically work their way up to weather systems, fruitflies and human beings, _all_ as mere passive congregations of 'particles'. But there is absolutely no reason in the world to accept that postulate, from any rational and/or empirical standard. It's merely an article of their faith.\n But that, it seems to me, is the only reason you have for saying that in chaos theory the determinism is in the parts and the chaos is in the whole, instead of the other way round.\n\n \n I find it hard to imagine how existence and all its events could possibly start at the top rather than the bottom. Of course, the limitations of my imagination are irrelevant, but in terms of chaos theory, we KNOW that the determinism is in the parts, because all chaotic systems that have been studied have well-understood (in terms of their deterministic interactions) constituents which gave rise to surprising, unpredictable, emergent phenomena. This is why they were studied, and why chaos theory exists. I suppose you could argue that the chaos IS in the parts, in terms of the parts of any complex system being too complex for us to accurately model, but (1) this does not adhere to the definition of 'chaos' as applied to chaos theory, and (2) the patterns of system-state changes are far more chaotic than the patterns of constituent-state changes.\n \n \nI do not think so. As above, I think you have it backwards. I know that my opinion is holistic and anti-reductionist, whereas your opinion reflects the standard materialist/mechanist, 'bottom-up' causality of that metaphysic, but I, as a Dynamist, simply do not accept that postulate.\n\n \n Just a question: How do you analyse a system holistically? I know that we have different definitions of 'system', but I would like to know what the dynamist/idealist methodology of analysis consists of. I hope you understand and accept why a 'physical system' is defined as anything more than one fundamental unit/particle/quantum for the purposes of physics. If it helps we can in future talk in terms of 'physical systems' and 'dynamic(?) systems'.\n \n \nAh, but my point was, not what you think happened, and not what I think happened, but rather, what it would appear to either of us that the researchers think happened, and from where I sit, they seem to think D./ happened.\n\n \n OK, well, just based on what I know, I would say that D./ is plausible but unfalsifiable, and is better explained by my (further) modified option C./. See below. \n \n \nNot to mention that in the materialist/mechyanist metaphysic such phenomena are denied any existence at all. Although not, it would seem, by quantum physics.\n\n \n I wouldn't say they are 'denied' existence, they are just assumed to have, at their root, some kind of non-stochastic cause, because without that assumption how can we study anything? This is indeed a problem for QM; radioactive decay has pretty conclusivey proven itself to be an utterly random (ie unpredictable) occurence, so physics has made the best of what it can with it. But this is the last resort, if you know what I mean.\n \n \nIt's an interesting question, so take a look at what I've said above and get back to me. Right now it's seems that your \"Partially mechanically determined but to some extent unpredictable.\", doesn't really say anything.\n\n \n OK, I will replace the word 'partially' with 'totally'. This is the premise of chaos theory. As lesz said, in principle if we know all the interactional details and all the starting conditions then we should be able to model the evolution of the entire system. It turns out, I was wrong about my computer model example; the computer models do in fact give the same result every time; however the real-world systems that they model do not, even though the fully predictable computer models have all the details. This is what amazed scientsists, and is what I got backwards. It's due to the small-scale real-world instabilities and (possibly) quantum effects at the smallest level that cannot be simulated by the current generation of computers. You've heard of the 'butterfly effect'. It does not mean that a butterfly in Rio causes a storm in Indonesia, but it does mean that the butterfly's effect on air currents has to be taken into account. Similarly, all the genuinely stochastic quantum events within a system influence that system's evolution. At some point this will become macroscopically visible as an unpredicted system-state change. \n \n \nI do. And not only rationally, but empirically, via the scientific method. \n\n \n So... explain, and amaze me!\n \n \nYes, it does. Any systemic behaviour not observed to be solely the result of any immediate, automatic, chemical or physical efficient cause, may be said to be mediated, non-mechanical, and teleological, i.e., is goal-directed and volitional, at least in part.\n\n \n But the materialist (!) view of this is just that the {assumed-to-be-non-teleological} cause has yet to be found. How does your philosophy answer this? I realise that to a certain extent this is a vacuous question, but I only ask it with reference to my reply to your previous quote, above.\n \n \nAnd I don't know why you characterize volition, and by extension, intelligence as 'subjective'. If they are 'subjective', then so is anything else that is incapable of throwing a shadow. Including gravity, for example.\n\n \n Because gravity is 'fully' (ie very bloody well) described and explained by Newton's laws of motion and Einstein's general relativity. I have yet to be made aware of a comparable theory that deals with the seemingly abstract notion of volition/intelligence. To my mind, that is edging into the debate about what constitutes 'consciousness'. Please clarify. Even if I never agree, I am genuinely interested in learning about the concepts that underlie your metaphysic, and internet sources are never as good as person-to-person communication. (I have not replied in the other thread because I feel that we are encroaching upon the same fundamental differences in this debate, if you disagree let me know).\n \n Onto your 2nd reply:\n \n \nI do not \"take the gain/loss of information as a subset of entropic 'evolution'\". \n I take any loss of efficiency in a productive system as entropic, and any gain in efficiency in a productive system as 'evolutionary'. In any given 'information' system, meaning any data acquisition, storage, retrieval, processing, and information generation system, the same 'efficiency' criterion applies, in which efficiency is a measure of the least input for the most output, but 'input' is data and 'output' is information, aka, meaning, significance.\n \n In a physically productive system, by way of comparison, 'energy' is held to be the amount of force required in order to overcome the inertial state of a mass. Neither 'mass' nor 'energy' (and certainly not 'inertia', itself!) are themselves \"objective, (meaning determined and universal), quantities\". They are insubstantial, non-corporeal phenomena that are arrived at by using a completely arbitrary, but universally accepted, symbolic system of measurement. You are familiar with them through their systems of measurement, and associated concrete measuring devices, but these phenomena, in se, are no more immediately apprehensible than is 'information'.\n\n \n OK, how do you differentiate between 'data' and meaningful 'information'? I fully understand the comparison in the second paragraph, and, our previous exchanges notwithstanding, I have a lot of trouble conceptualising the true meaning of energy (unless we are talking specifically about thermodynamic energy), so your point is well-made, but its foundations are incomprehensible unless you can provide a clear distinction between that which is meaningful and that which is not.\n \n \nAll very well for a physical, mechanical system. No-one is claiming that the physical components, nor the physical whole, of any corporeal system, including live organisms, do not adhere to the physical dictates of the 2LoT. We all undergo entropy unto death, in physical, mechanical terms. Your problem, as a materialist, is to convince the world that life, intelligence, volition, information, etc. are physical, mechanical phenomena,-- like clockwork dolls and steam trains.\n \n Add to that the notion of 'emergence', which in such a mechanical, physical system, always entails 'creatio ex nihilo'. There is simply no rational way around it. Simply claiming that if the parts are confused, complicated, and chaotic enough, they can somehow 'cough up' 'emergent' properties out of their own mass and energy, just won't cut it.\n\n \n But it's not ex nihilo. Without an external source, the thermodynamic energy of the system does not increase. New (ie emergent) properties do not equal an increase in thermodynamic energy; in fact they cannot. They are simply the result of a redistribution of the thermodynamic energy of the system. This is what I mean by some of your terms (in this case, 'information') seeming to be subjective. You can define an emergent property as being a novel addition to a system in terms of our human conception of the identity of that system, but in terms of thermodynamics, absolutely nothing new has been created; the system has simply reorganised itself in a manner which we could not have predicted beforehand due to the colossal variety of variables involved..\n \n \n\n Start by postulating a fifth natural, but non-physical, force. Let's call it, \"Vitality\"... \n \n ...You are quite surprisingly wrong!! What I am plainly suggesting is a third option--volitional causation. It is your materialism/mechanism that insists that only deterministic mechanical causation exists empirically, while totally stochastic causation exists, but only mathematically, and that that is whole spectrum of causation.\n\n \n OK, and I'm sure you've heard this before, but do you have any evidence for this beyond the fact that some phenomena seem too complex to you to be purely accounted for by deterministic causation? I don't want to sound like a psychiatrist, but I really want to get at your reasons for seeing the world this way, because, as you've probably gathered (!) it makes no sense to me. I can understand why you are often met with abuse; there are so many people that frequent this board with tired old 'refutations' of evolution that new ones tend to be ignored or insulted, rightly, as I think you'll agree. But their ideas are grounded in pure misunderstandings, whereas yours is grounded in a worldview diametrically opposed to both 'Darwinists' (I still maintain that there are no such people) and creationists which is why I am interested, even if makes no sense to me.\n \n OK, bring it on! *ducks behind furniture*",

I suggest that it is only a fundamental, 'sine qua non', principle of materialism/mechanism, not science itself. Science can get by very nicely, thank you, with a discernible cause/effect correlation that can be mapped into some kind of regularity, even if it is only discernible mathematically, i.e., probabilistically. It does not _need_ the materialist metaphysical assumption that all and every cause/effect event is mechanically determined, and that the only reason certain events \"appear\" to be less than linearly predictable, i.e., non-linear, mathematically-speaking, is our 'ignorance' of the chain of efficient causation. That assumption is for metaphysics, not science or math.\n \n Added to which is the correlate to that materialist/mechanist principle; the notion that ALL causation is physical and thereby mechanical and therebye linear, and that 'non-linearity' is just ignorance of chain of causation and other 'initial conditions' and 'inputs'. The entire concept of real non-linear cause and effect is contra the basic principles of materialism/mechanism, i.e., 'determinism' and 'reductionism', but they have to pretend that it isn't, in order to deal with reality. Hence, \"ignorance\" and \"emergence\"(aka, 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo') and other non-science. If they would only admit to psychical causation as a reality, such problems could be largely resolved. But they cannot, because that would destroy their entire belief system, including its all-important correlate, atheism.\n \n \n\n This is indeed a problem for QM; radioactive decay has pretty conclusivey proven itself to be an utterly random (ie unpredictable) occurence, so physics has made the best of what it can with it.

How does your philosophy answer this?\n\n \n **\n By pointing out that it is nothing but a vacuous evasion, a 'determinism of the gaps' opinion, i.e., metaphysics, not science.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabit \n And I don't know why you characterize volition, and by extension, intelligence as 'subjective'. If they are 'subjective', then so is anything else that is incapable of throwing a shadow. Including gravity, for example. \n \n \n Because gravity is 'fully' (ie very bloody well) described and explained by Newton's laws of motion and Einstein's general relativity.\n\n \n \n No, it's not. Hate to burst your bubble, but what both Einstein and Newton found were two different, but not truly contrary, ways to mathematically model [i.e., 'describe', but not 'explain'] the regularities in gravitational effects. Nobody knows what gravity is, but only what it seems to do. Same for all forces. But you cannot 'explain' something fully unless you can not only describe what it does, but explicitly state what it is. That is unother perpetual mistake made by materialists and darwinists--they constantly confuse a simple description of a phenomenon for an explanation of that very phenomenon. See their definitions of 'evolution' and 'natural selection' and 'mutation' and on and on, for glaring examples of this repeated logical fallacy.\n \n \n\n I have yet to be made aware of a comparable theory that deals with the seemingly abstract notion of volition/intelligence.\n\n \n **\n Well, at risk of elevating my hypothesis to the level of 'theory', as darwinians commonly do, allow me to introduce you to the notion of \"Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis\" as the mechanism for biological evolution. And if intelligence and volition are 'abstractions', then so are sadness, joy, imagination, hope, guilt and a whole lot of other natural phenomena. Including any force you care to name.\n \n \n\n To my mind, that is edging into the debate about what constitutes 'consciousness'. Please clarify.\n\n \n **\n What's to clarify? It is a part of what the 'consciousness debate' is really all about; i.e., the old problem of reconciling 'mind' and 'matter'. Remember, materialism never resolved the cartesian 'mind/matter' duality--they simply made an arbitrary metaphysical decision to scoff at anything previously referred to as 'mind', and assert without proof that 'matter' was the only 'real' thing in existence, and that what looked exactly like 'mind' was in reality only the \"epiphenomena\" of 'bits of stuff' aimlessly and inexplicably zooming about and accidentally colliding with one another. Regularities in the patterns of these collisions remain unexplained, but are attributed to themselves, as 'physical forces', which are then transmogrified from effects into their very own causes. [again, see \"natural selection\" for a darwinian example of this fallacy] Unless you 'pray at their church', that kind of self-righteousness is plainly seen as either dishonest or delusional.\n \n \n\n Even if I never agree, I am genuinely interested in learning about the concepts that underlie your metaphysic, and internet sources are never as good as person-to-person communication. (I have not replied in the other thread because I feel that we are encroaching upon the same fundamental differences in this debate, if you disagree let me know).\n\n \n **\n I can't remember the details of 'the other thread', but you're probably right, and I don't have enough time to deal with even one thread, not properly, but hav e to keep cutting it up into chunks as opportunity allows. So it's just as well. Maybe someday we can get back to it?\n \n Speaking of time, gotta take another break. Later.",

   "\n Onto your 2nd reply:\n \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I do not \"take the gain/loss of information as a subset of entropic 'evolution'\". \n I take any loss of efficiency in a productive system as entropic, and any gain in efficiency in a productive system as 'evolutionary'. In any given 'information' system, meaning any data acquisition, storage, retrieval, processing, and information generation system, the same 'efficiency' criterion applies, in which efficiency is a measure of the least input for the most output, but 'input' is data and 'output' is information, aka, meaning, significance.\n \n In a physically productive system, by way of comparison, 'energy' is held to be the amount of force required in order to overcome the inertial state of a mass. Neither 'mass' nor 'energy' (and certainly not 'inertia', itself!) are themselves \"objective, (meaning determined and universal), quantities\". They are insubstantial, non-corporeal phenomena that are arrived at by using a completely arbitrary, but universally accepted, symbolic system of measurement. You are familiar with them through their systems of measurement, and associated concrete measuring devices, but these phenomena, in se, are no more immediately apprehensible than is 'information'. \"\n \n \n OK, how do you differentiate between 'data' and meaningful 'information'?\n\n \n **\n I've spoken on this several times, but perhaps not in this thread; I can't remember. \"Information\" is the meaning, the significance, discovered within the relationship that two or more bits of \"data\" have with one another. Data, like brute facts, are meaningless, insignificant, in and of themselves alone. It is how, when, why, etc., that they connect with each other that generates a new understanding that we call, 'information'. Data and facts cannot be 'understood', because there is nothing about them to understand, but only to observe, and to accept.\n Now a false confusion of 'data' for 'information' began with typical materialist word confusion in the 1940's, but thankfully that, at least, is being rectified.\n \n Finally, it should be understood that nothing inanimate actually contains information, nor ever communicates it. Not a software program, not a book or a map, and certainly not a rock in space. Information can only be created by that which can, in and of itself, inherently, detect significance between separate facts or other data. So far only live organisms can do this, but apparently every single one of them can do this, to a greater or lesser degree. As well, inanimate entities do not possess 'data'. 'Data' are externally and arbitrarily imposed categorical 'signs' that begin and end in a mind. No rock can percieve that another rock is faster, smoother, heavier, or blacker than it is. Those are sense perceptions that depend upon an 'a priori' mental system of categorization, eg., this thing is a building and this building is green. Two bits of data which do not, per se, generate information, i.e., which are insignificant. But unless some living thing observed those two data bits, they simply would not exist as data. The old conundrum of whether a sound exists if nothing and nobody ever hears it. That applies to all data, and since all data are sense experience, I say no, because sound is a sense experience that cannot exist apart from a hearer. The physical 'vibrations' exist, but not as 'data'; not until they are perceived by an observer. They, like some unknown space rock, are simply 'there', as entities, but not as data, and certainly not as information.\n \n \n\n I fully understand the comparison in the second paragraph, and, our previous exchanges notwithstanding, I have a lot of trouble conceptualising the true meaning of energy (unless we are talking specifically about thermodynamic energy), so your point is well-made, but its foundations are incomprehensible unless you can provide a clear distinction between that which is meaningful and that which is not.\n\n \n **\n I'm not sure how to express it that doesn't come with the definition. It revolves around the epistemological question wherebye an ability to grasp the implications of 'particulars' is extended to universally applicable concepts, as an 'understanding' is 'informed', or created. Sadly, this 'understanding', like information, can be true or false. Something a 'thing in itself', a fact, an entity, an event, can never be.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n All very well for a physical, mechanical system.

Your problem, as a materialist, is to convince the world that life, intelligence, volition, information, etc. are physical, mechanical phenomena,-- like clockwork dolls and steam trains.\n \n Add to that the notion of 'emergence', which in such a mechanical, physical system, always entails 'creatio ex nihilo'. There is simply no rational way around it. Simply claiming that if the parts are confused, complicated, and chaotic enough, they can somehow 'cough up' 'emergent' properties out of their own mass and energy, just won't cut it. \"\n \n \n But it's not ex nihilo. Without an external source, the thermodynamic energy of the system does not increase. New (ie emergent) properties do not equal an increase in thermodynamic energy; in fact they cannot. They are simply the result of a redistribution of the thermodynamic energy of the system.\n\n \n **\n Not quite sure what you mean here. It would seem to me that when you say 'properties' you mean 'products', but I'll let you clarify that.\n \n \n \n\n This is what I mean by some of your terms (in this case, 'information') seeming to be subjective.\n\n \n **\n If by that you mean my usage of the term is not a popular one, then yes, it is 'subjective'.

   "\n OK, and I'm sure you've heard this before, but do you have any evidence for this beyond the fact that some phenomena seem too complex to you to be purely accounted for by deterministic causation?\n\n \n \n **\n Indoctrinated people are incapable of seeing anything but what they are unconsciously programmed to see. Which is why darwinists, creationists, et al, have so much difficulty in reading comprehension. I continuously provide evidence for my position, but they are incapable of seeing it. My thread on \n 'linear genetics takes a hit', (or words to that effect), is a perfect example of this. And it is not that \"some phenomena seem too complex to [me] to be purely accounted for by deterministic causation\", it is that too much in biology is too original to be accounted for by determinist causation. Why is that? Because 'ex nihilo, nihil fit'. Because nothing can supply or generate or create anything that it, in se, does not already have; not unless it gets extra help from outside itself with a supply of something it lacks. Since 'bits of stuff' have no life, life can only be generated by the 4 physical forces that generates 'stuff', PLUS another force to make that 'stuff' into lifeforms, i.e., autopoietic, complex, productive biosystems. Saying that life, 'emerges' from physical mechanics, unassisted, abiogenesis, is just an attempt to evade 'ex nihilo, nihil fit' with an appeal to magic.\n \n \n \n\n I don't want to sound like a psychiatrist, but I really want to get at your reasons for seeing the world this way, because, as you've probably gathered (!) it makes no sense to me.\n\n \n **\n That's alright. New ideas never make sense when first heard by people with settled opinions. Unlike most, you do not scoff at what you do not understand, and start attacking me instead of my ideas, as is SOP with most darwinists.\n \n \n\n I can understand why you are often met with abuse; there are so many people that frequent this board with tired old 'refutations' of evolution that new ones tend to be ignored or insulted, rightly, as I think you'll agree.\n\n \n **\n \"Rightly?\" No, I don't agree. If you've heard an argument a million times, and refuted it a million times, then ignore it. If a post contains no thought or information, ignore it. But if you come across a fresh idea or argument, then you cannot in good conscience ignore it or simply scoff at it until you have actually refuted it, reasonably. Something very few darwinists even attempt to do.\n \n \n \n\n But their ideas are grounded in pure misunderstandings, whereas yours is grounded in a worldview diametrically opposed to both 'Darwinists' (I still maintain that there are no such people) and creationists which is why I am interested, even if makes no sense to me.\n\n \n **\n Well, I'm very glad that you're interested, because your sincere and open mind makes you fun to debate with, and I need to debate, at my advanced age, just to keep my mind from shutting down. \"Use it or lose it!\", as Lamarck used to say. :)",

That is, when you switch from doing physics and/or chemistry and start doing biology instead. I call that force, as seems perfectly apt, Vitality.\n OK but I want a few examples before I buy that particular pig in a poke. How do you know its not due to FirstTuesdayism instead? And I would like to know specifically what non-physical etc properties you are referring to as well as the basis upon which you conclude that they are non-physical other than current limits of our knowledge of the details of their physical mechanisms!emoticon_xdonno",

Its not.\n\n \n **\n Whoever taught you to speak English, you should sue. \"Self-organization\" implies and entails intelligence, volition, and direction. These are the sine qua non of self-organization. Molecules do not 'self-organize'--they are organized by exterrnal forces, such as the electro-magnetic force and the strong ansd weak nuclear forces. Crystals do not 'self-organize'--they are organized by external forces as well. The forces that determine the molecule'geometry, and the forces that generate large numbers of identical molecules connected to one another. That is not \"self\" organization, only repetition and accumulation of an exogenously generated molecule. \"Self\" organization requires a \"self\" to organize.

There is a difference between, \"based on\" and \"involving\", just as there are no humans whose operation does not 'involve' breathing, for example, but is not 'based upon' the act of respiration.\n \n \n\n There is no evidence for the vitalist claim of some other mechanisms being operable.\n\n \n Yes, there is.

I've had this physical thermodynamics in biosystems argument a dozen times. You guys still can't see that organisms do not operate on the same principles as steam engines and wind up toys, even though their physical components do.

   "What does the length of time it takes a virus to be randomly mutated have to do with anything?

That is, viruses are either passive chemicals subject to random chance, or they are live, self-directed organisms in charge of their own DNA. Which is it?\n Well I come down on the side that viruses are life-forms. And most viral mutations are due to imperfect copy processes (see HIV for a good example of this). The mutations are not due to external mutagens they are due to failures of the copy mechanisms.

Certainly there is no external presense beyond natural law which is operational.\n Phenotype? What phenotype? To have a phenotype requires an essential, permanent form and behaviour with only accidental properties changing. If a chicken mutated into an eagle, then a dove, then an ostrich, then there is no 'phenotype' to speak of.\n \n Sorry but viruses have phenotypes just as any other organism does. Viruses are simpler of course in that the phenotype is very directly related to the genotype and the traits are relatively simple ones.

Of course I expect you to resist with all your stubborness accepting these basic facts, but thats your problem not mine.\n \n \"Multiple\"? Two generations would suffice, then? Good. However, I suggest that it is the change in the organism,(in its organic properties/traits, and not its genetic chemicals), that persists across several generations that is evolution, as distinguished from chemical/molecular/genomic change. WRT viruses, I ask again, where is the essential continuity in the whole entity that creates a 'phenotype', as contrasted to the discontinuity in some of its 'non-essential' parts that you attribute to 'evolution by random mutation'? If there is such a continuity, then please explain how it is able to persist in the face of random genetic mutation, in an entity that is scarcely more than its own DNA. \n Two generations won't get the job done.

If all they are is a bit of stuff that is shape-shifted, randomly, by forces beyond their control, then they are no more live entities then gobs of mud.\n \n Very funny. If DNA were not unstable in general life would not be possible based on DNA! Its in the nature of things that such molecules cannot be inert. The instability is not accidental, nor is it extremely high. The copy rate errors are RELATIVELY high in HIV (a RNA virus please note NOT DNA). Some of the reasons for this include the following:\n All RTs show poor fidelity when compared with host DNA polymerases in in vitro systems (Battula and Loeb 1974; Preston et al. 1988; Roberts et al. 1988; Takeuchi et al. 1988; Weber and Grosse 1989; Boyer et al. 1992a; Kati et al. 1992; Bebenek et al. 1993; Patel and Preston 1994; for reviews, see Bebenek and Kunkel 1993; Williams and Loeb 1992). The lack of a proofreading function (Battula and Loeb 1976) probably explains much of this high error rate, although the enzyme's ability to extend mismatched primer termini may contribute to a tendency to incorporate \"wrong\" nucleotides (Perrino et al. 1989; Bakhanashvili and Hizi 1992; Pulsinelli and Temin 1994). As discussed below, if the tendency of RT to switch templates is paired with its ability to extend mismatches, genetic recombination may be a significant source of replication errors. \n Excerpted from here - which provides additional detail and discussion. Its not the latest word but it illustrates the point.\n \n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=rv.section.1097\n \n This is not a state of random out of control chemistry, its a state of imprefect replication. Its as if a factory from time to time makes more or less random errors in making millions upon millions of a single product. Making a few mistakes pre 100,000 units is NOT the chaotic situation you envision.",

Mutations in coat protein genes result in changes in the coat proteins themselves. And that changes the virulence and host range of the virus. The difference between a virus particle and a simple toxin like arsenic is that a virus is infective while the toxin is not. Arsenic by the way is not a carbon compound while viruses consist of many different carbon based compounds. The arsenic is by definition inorganic and the virus by definition organic. And shape is in some sense at least not \"all there is\" the coat proteins are biologically active serving as enzymes, attachment points to the host and others.

Perhaps picking up a fractional percent frequency increase per generation, maybe less!\n Good.

That is, a virus was the reproductive machinery of some lifeform that came loose and now performs lateral gene transfer randomly, blindly, with no restraint other than opportunity, with opportunity an accidental correlation between its randomly mutated external shape and a live cell's devised and perfected resistance response to that physical viral reproduction machine, and its mechanically determined viral action. IOW, viruses are not organisms;but they are the artefacts of organisms, presumably some ancient bacteria, archaea, whatever, that 'got out of the lab' and probably wiped out the lifeforms that created them.\n \n Whatever the story, the fact is that they themselves cannot reproduce themselves, cannot develop themselves, cannot feed and maintain themselves, and therefore are not autopoietic systems, but simple mechanical systems passively dependent upon their environment for everything they do, mechanically and inevitably.

Koonin #\n \n National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20894; e-mail: koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n \n Several theoretical and experimental studies have endeavored to derive the minimal set of genes that are necessary and sufficient to sustain a functioning cell under ideal conditions, that is, in the presence of unlimited amounts of all essential nutrients and in the absence of any adverse factors, including competition. A comparison of the first two completed bacterial genomes, those of the parasites Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium, produced a version of the minimal gene set consisting of 250 genes. Very similar estimates were obtained by analyzing viable gene knockouts in Bacillus subtilis, M. genitalium, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. With the accumulation and comparison of multiple complete genome sequences, it became clear that only 80 genes of the 250 in the original minimal gene set are represented by orthologs in all life forms. For 15% of the genes from the minimal gene set, viable knockouts were obtained in M. genitalium; unexpectedly, these included even some of the universal genes. Thus, some of the genes that were included in the first version of the minimal gene set, based on a limited genome comparison, could be, in fact, dispensable. The majority of these genes, however, are likely to encode essential functions but, in the course of evolution, are subject to nonorthologous gene displacement, that is, recruitment of unrelated or distantly related proteins for the same function. Further theoretical and experimental studies within the framework of the minimal-gene-set concept and the ultimate construction of a minimal genome are expected to advance our understanding of the basic principles of cell functioning by systematically detecting nonorthologous gene displacement and deciphering the roles of essential but functionally uncharacterized genes.",

The same goes for all of the psychical phenomena exhibited by lifeforms. There has to be a natural force causing these real, observable, and theoretically measurable phenomena. If the 4 physical forces could do it then the very stones of the earth would fall in love with one another, and some would feel the pain of a broken heart. But they cannot do it, and do not do it. A 5th force is the source of all of life's psychical phenomena. I call this force,Vitality, for obvious reasons. It is no more 'mystical' than gravity or electro-magnetism. Theoretically the effects of vitality are measurable, just like the effects of gravity are measurable.\n \n \n\n However the instruments used are not responding to something imaginary are they?\n\n \n **\n No more so for vitality than for gravity. One of trhe effects of vitality is intelligence, and we've been working on arbitrary wys of universally measuring that psychical phenomenon for quite some time, and with some success.\n \n \n \n\n And far better to have arbitrary standards of measurements for physical forces than to have arbitrary physical forces (such as vitality).\n\n \n **\n Are you calling gravity, 'arbitrary'?!?

Given that free-will is mechanistic and thus must at its core be deterministic (barring quantum effects). Its perfectly possible for a fully deterministic mechanism to produce behaviors which one might characterize as spontaneous or due to some sort of \"free-will\". This is especially true when you do not know the inner details of the mechanism (yet). Its at best pseudo-free-will given the underlying determinism - and many philosophers would not call anything which is deterministic free-will. When the mechanism (which is apparently genetic) is worked out the appearance of \"free-will\" will vanish in a puff of smoke. The illusion will crack.\n \n Free-will is a will-o-the-wisp kind of thing. With sufficient knowledge of how choices are actually made at the neurological level it simply becomes an unnecessary and unuseful assumption. It is after all a theological concept in its origins - meant to place responsibility for sin upon man and absolve GOD for responsibility for sin and evil.
