   "Florida's bay area is experiencing a huge increase in STDs, with rates of infection among teenagers nearly doubled since the 1990s. It's a statistic that doesn't make any sense (didn't we just hear that you guys are having less sex these days?) except that Florida is one of the many states that began teaching abstinence-only sex education about, oh, ten years ago.\n \n Wow, weird coincidence, huh?\n \n Most people would look at these stats and conclude that abstinence education-which has been criticized for, among other things, misrepresenting the effectiveness of condoms in preventing pregnancy and STDs-is neither effective nor educational. But for fans of abstinence education, not even an army of syphilis-infected 14-year-olds proves that their programs don't work. Boy, would I love to be a fly on the wall at those school board meetings:\n \n Board Member #1: Bill, I just don't understand it. We've had our abstinence education program in place for ten years, but kids are still doing it!\n \n Board Member #2: I know! They're... they're... sexing each other! All the time!\n \n Board Member #1: I mean, what more do they want? We told them not to do it!\n \n Board Member #2: We did! We told them specifically not to sex each other! It's like they aren't listening. What are we supposed to do now?\n \n Non-Clueless Board Member: Maybe we should expand the program to include some information about condoms.\n \n Board Member #1: No way. Are you crazy? You know what will happen! First you show them a condom, and the next thing you know, they're running all over the place with their dingles and hoo-has hanging out!\n \n Slightly Less Clueless Board Member: Dingles and... do you mean \"penises\" and \"vaginas\"?\n \n Board Member #1: I will not tolerate language like that at this meeting!\n \n Slightly Less Clueless Board Member: But those are the scientific term-\n \n Board Member #1: Enough! Look, how about this: let's just go back out there and tell them not to have sex with each other. Except this time we'll say it, like, really loud.\n \n Board Member #2: Great idea. Really, I don't understand why they're having such a hard time with this. Just don't have sex! That's it! How hard is it to just not have sex?\n \n Board Member #1: I don't get it either, Bill. Abstinence isn't so hard. I mean, my wife hasn't had sex with me in years.\n\n \n SparkLife The Worst Sex (Education) in History\n \n While I was procrastinating from studying, I came across this funny yet informative article. The author hits the nail on the head, and presents the dangers of abstinence-only sex ed thoughtfully. Definitely a good read. Any comments?",

   "Nice fictional conversation, and nice job projecting a National Epidemic on 1 State just because they promote abstinence. Too bad your focus on Florida is bogus when the numbers in States which promote safe sex are as bad or worse. You fail to recognize that the issue is socially accepted promiscuity as younger and younger children are pummeled with sexually suggestive marketing in the pop culture which permeates every aspect of our Society today. Here's some evidence, (NOT A PRO ABSTINENCE SITE EITHER) which faces and defines the real problem head on.\n Lax Morals Lead to Social Ills Such as STDs and Teen Pregnancies \n WiseTo Social Issues Digest. The Gale Group, Inc. All rights reserved. 2007. \n Viewpoint\n \n \n America is in crisis to those citing divorce rates, rising rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and more unmarried teens becoming pregnant. They view these problems as the result of increasingly lax morals surrounding sexual behavior, as even the youngest adolescents are taught that promiscuous sex is acceptable.\n Premarital sex became more of a social norm with the1960s sexual revolution. As a legacy, according to Vanessa Warner, \"unbridled sexual activity is ravaging our youth and our land: sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), AIDS, abortion, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, fatherlessness, crime, welfare, violence and poverty.\" Rather than teaching that marriage is the appropriate (and most fulfilling) outlet for sex, Warner, a special projects writer for Concerned Women for America, asserts that youth \"are bombarded with messages to engage in sex outside of marriage by educators, health workers, government officials, entertainment and news media outlets.\"\n Many of those who assume teens will have sex promote the protective ability of information about \"safe sex.\" Yet many others believe that abstinence is the only real protection, both physically and emotionally. Bridget E. Maher, a policy analyst with the Family Research Council, asserts that abstinence-only programs effectively change teen behavior. She cites a Physicians Research Council statement that teen birthrate declines during the 1990s were correlated to less frequent teen sex, not contraceptive use. Contraceptives are not failsafe at preventing pregnancy or STDs. To Maher, promoting the idea that premarital sex is acceptable and safe is detrimental.\n One of the costs of more frequent sexual activity has been an STD epidemic. Vanessa Warner points to a National Institutes of Health report showing there are \"12 million new cases of STDs annually, 3 million of them are teenagers.\" Some STDs are asymptomatic, but lead to serious complications, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer, and death. Acquiring an STD can affect someone (and their loved ones) for years, or even a lifetime.\n The idea that \"free love\" is liberating is challenged by those who argue that, rather than creating equality for women, it victimizes increasing numbers of unwed teen mothers and their children. The result has, according to Maher, \"negative consequences for mothers, children, and society. Unwed mothers are likely to live in poverty and be dependent on welfare.\" She notes that half of unwed teen mothers do not complete high school, their babies are likely to have low birth weights, and eventually \"to have lower grades, to leave high school without graduating, to be abused or neglected, to have a child as an unmarried teenager, and to be delinquent.\" Successive generations are caught in the cycle.\n The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops believes Title X, the program offering low-income women reproductive health services, is partially to blame for increased sexual activity among teenagers, since services are offered to teens without parental consent. Teens circumvent the people who love them when making decisions about sexuality and health. The Conference cites a Kaiser Family Foundation study showing 55 percent of teens believe parents offer \"the `most reliable and complete' information about sex and birth control.\" Title X abrogates parents' rights as children's primary educators about sexual activity and primary overseers of health, according to the Conference.\n Lax Morals Lead to Social Ills Such as STDs and Teen Pregnancies - Sex Education",

Let's pick the dung apart and find the really stinky parts.\n \n \nTitle X, the program offering low-income women reproductive health services, is partially to blame for increased sexual activity among teenagers, since services are offered to teens without parental consent.\n\n Not sure how that cause and effect relationship would actually work..but hey, if you say so...emoticon_rolleyes\n \n And yes, while Title X is devoted to low income women, you should probably check out Tittle XX, a program specofically targeted to adolescents. \n \n A snippit from their page:\n \n \nThe Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Demonstration and Research program, created in 1981 as Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, supports both demonstration and research grants. Within OPA, the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (OAPP) is responsible for administering the program. The AFL program is funded at $29.8 million in fiscal year 2008.\n \n The AFL program supports demonstration projects to develop, implement and evaluate program interventions to promote abstinence from sexual activity among adolescents and to provide comprehensive health care, education and social services to pregnant and parenting adolescents. The program supports two basic types of demonstration projects: (1) prevention demonstration projects to develop, test, and use curricula that provide education and activities designed to encourage adolescents to postpone sexual activity until marriage, and (2) care demonstration projects to develop interventions with pregnant and parenting teens, their infants, male partners, and family members in an effort to ameliorate the effects of too-early-childbearing for teen parents, their babies and their families. The AFL program also funds grants to support research on the causes and consequences of adolescent premarital sexual relations, adolescent pregnancy and parenting.\n\n Adolescent Family Life\n \n \n \nTeens circumvent the people who love them when making decisions about sexuality and health.\n\n Absolutely, they are teens after all. Perhaps a lot of teens seek outside information and counseling because their parents have never approached them directly to talk to them about such subjects? What teen is going to run into their parents room and say \"mom, I was thinking about having sex with Tony, do you think that would be ok\"? Parents have the responsibility as \"adults\" (and in many cases I use that word lightly) to take an active role in their childs life. Chances are, if a child does not feel comfortable going to their parents for information or advice, it is a fault of the parents...not the child. \n \n \nThe Conference cites a Kaiser Family Foundation study showing 55 percent of teens believe parents offer \"the `most reliable and complete' information about sex and birth control.\" \n\n And again, perhaps there is a reason so many teens don't believe their parents offer the most reliable and complete information? Does simply telling a child that sex outside of marriage is a sin count as the most reliable and complete information? You may scoff, but that is the only information many teens get from their parents (myself included). \n \n \nTitle X abrogates parents' rights as children's primary educators about sexual activity and primary overseers of health, according to the Conference.\n\n abrogate&#8194; &#8194;-verb (used with object), -gat&#8901;ed, -gat&#8901;ing. 1. to abolish by formal or official means; annul by an authoritative act; repeal: to abrogate a law. \n 2. to put aside; put an end to. \n \n That is simply a lame excuse. Nothing \"abrogates\" a parents right to educate and oversee their children. More importantly, nothing relieves a parent of their RESPONSIBILITY to educate and oversee their children. Programs like Title XX should simply serve as a backup resource, yet due to many parents failures they have become the only avenue open to some teens. \n \n Hmmm, turn out that the whole thing was stinky.",

We don't expect everyone on campus to agree with our beliefs, but we would ask people, and students in particular, to respect them.\"\n \n McGovern said the college's policy follows church teachings, which oppose use of artificial contraception. Most Catholic colleges do not distribute birth control on campus.\n \n \"This is not a shocking revelation,\" that the college does not permit condom distribution, he said.\n \n Freitas, who said she is not Catholic, said she decided to make condoms available because she was concerned about the consequences of students having unprotected sex.\n \n \"Abstinence can be part of sex-ed, and should be,\" she said. \"But college students are going to have sex, and they should be encouraged to have safe sex.

Abortion Laws for Teens by State You can see the direction that the abrogation of parental rights is going in.

And why is this? It's because the parents are no more emotionally or sexually mature than the children they are raising. \n \n \n In my world, parents understand that creating an atmosphere of open and free communication with their children is not only a parents right, but a parents responsibility.\n\n \n This is a delusion. If parents had a truly open and honest relationship with their children, the kids wouldn't be surprising them with the news that they are pregnant @ 12- 16 in record numbers, only to find out from the OB-GYN that they take them to that she also have 1 or more STDs. \n \n How can we expect minor children to respect their bodies until they are emotionally and sexually mature enough to handle sex when our society has taken all social references to shame or personal responsibility out of the equation? Minors having sex used to represent the worst of what a young person could do to themselves and was seen as a type of personal abuse which rightly exposed a larger self image issue. But today, it's cool and completely socially accepted so what are we accomplishing as you state the realities in your world?\n \n You say one thing in regards to how wrong minors having sex is, but everything else you say just excuses and promotes it to continue to go as it has been going for decades now on that slippery slope downward toward a completely reprobate society, just as conservatives warned would occur decades ago as the liberals forced their feel good morality on us piece by piece.

One adolescent dying as a result of poor sex ed is hundreds too many. Put your righteousness aside and do the right thing. There are lives that need saving.\n\n \n How is this juvenile analogy the least bit applicable or on point in responding to my argument to snakespit? Does the sport of sky diving require that an innocent victim dies with each and every jump a person makes? Of course not! And where does the teaching of abstinence to our young people require that if they do have sex, they must never use condoms? The obvious answer is it doesn't teach that at all.\n \n This is the great lie and dishonest argument of the sex ed promoters. That abstinence teaching is against the use of protection if young people choose to submit to their raging hormones. Abstinence teaches why avoiding intimate sexual contact is the surest way to avoid disease and pregnancy, which is undeniable, it does NOT oppose the use of condoms for those adolescents who choose to ignore that advice and risk their health and futures on pre-marital sex.\n \n What abstinence rightly teaches is that in this age when STDs and teen pregnancy is ravaging our youth even though many of them DO USE protection, the only sure and guaranteed way to avoid the pitfalls of pregnancy or disease is to not have sex at all until they are in a committed relationship once they are mature enough emotionally to handle the responsibility and consequences of participating in such a relationship. Here's my response to snakespit once again. This time read it for comprehension. I'm sure you'll then ignore it since it is common sense and true. Something your response which I quoted is anything but.\n \n If you can't see that giving legally minor children the right to get contraceptives and abortions without their parents consent or knowledge isn't abrogating their parental rights, authority and control over their own children's lives, then we are living in different worlds.\n\n \n \nSomething I have long suspected Archie. \n \n In my world, teens are going to continue to have sex regardless of whether or not they have access to contraceptives and abortion. \n\n \n You have just admitted that the true issue isn't abstinence only teaching, but a dumbing down of the morality of this generation since having adolescent sex has become the rule in our society rather than the exception. Consequences are no longer a consideration as the culture of \"If it feels good, do it\" is promoted at every level of our society. Personal responsibility is an antiquated concept since justifying a woman's right to abort the innocent child she conceived by way of her own irresponsible actions in so many cases. \n \n \n In my world, people understand that the parent is still by far the most important educator and monitor of their children. \n\n \n But these policies being proposed and some already in existence in certain States do allow MINOR CHILDREN to make medical decisions regarding contraceptives without parental consent. Contraceptive Info :: Can I Get Birth Control Without Parent Permission?\n \n Regarding abortion, here are the laws which exist in each of the 50 States. Abortion Laws for Teens by State You can see the direction that the abrogation of parental rights is going in. And now Obama wants to make it a Federal Law allowing minor children to have total anonymous and independent medical authority which excludes the Parents who otherwise have legal responsibility for their well being.\n \n \n In my world, people understand the dangers and consequences of STD's and adolescent pregnancy, and would rather see teens have access to free contraceptives than dead from AIDS or knocked up and missing out on their lives. \n\n \n That's because in your world, the SOCIETY find it easier to place a proverbial band-aid on the problem (contraceptives) rather than actually demanding that parents raise their children with a moral value system which builds into them the confidence and personal self respect to honor themselves by not giving into the immediate gratification which results in acting upon their adolescent hormones. And why is this? It's because the parents are no more emotionally or sexually mature than the children they are raising. \n \n \n In my world, parents understand that creating an atmosphere of open and free communication with their children is not only a parents right, but a parents responsibility.\n\n \n This is a delusion. If parents had a truly open and honest relationship with their children, the kids wouldn't be surprising them with the news that they are pregnant @ 12- 16 in record numbers, only to find out from the OB-GYN that they take them to that she also have 1 or more STDs. \n \n How can we expect minor children to respect their bodies until they are emotionally and sexually mature enough to handle sex when our society has taken all social references to shame or personal responsibility out of the equation? Minors having sex used to represent the worst of what a young person could do to themselves and was seen as a type of personal abuse which rightly exposed a larger self image issue. But today, it's cool and completely socially accepted so what are we accomplishing as you state the realities in your world?\n \n You say one thing in regards to how wrong minors having sex is, but everything else you say just excuses and promotes it to continue to go as it has been going for decades now on that slippery slope downward toward a completely reprobate society, just as conservatives warned would occur decades ago as the liberals forced their feel good morality on us piece by piece.

I can just hear it now.\n \"That's not really having sex is it, Mommy?\"\n\n \n Actually, this history behind Clinton's statement is more puritanical in its origin than it belongs to Clinton.\n \n Historically, \"sodomy\" (which does include heterosexual oral sex) was not considered as \"sex\". It was considered as something disgusting that was not \"sex\".\n \n There were two court cases, one in Canada and one in a New England state, whereby the husband tried to argue he did not commit \"adultery\" cause it was sex with the same gender, ergo not coital and not \"sex\".\n By the DEFINITION in the law, they had an argument.\n The Canadian court decided it WAS sex, and thus it was adultery, and the New England state claimed it was NOT sex, and thus not adultery.\n \n Ironically, with conservative \"chastity pledges\", the STD rates are similar because the people pledging are engaging in non-coital sex as a way to keep their \"chastity\" pledge.\n But I'm sure we can just blame Clinton for everything... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "A long-awaited national study has concluded that abstinence-only sex education, a cornerstone of the Bush administration's social agenda, does not keep teenagers from having sex. Neither does it increase or decrease the likelihood that if they do have sex, they will use a condom.\n \n Authorized by Congress in 1997, the study followed 2000 children from elementary or middle school into high school. The children lived in four communities -- two urban, two rural. All of the children received the family life services available in their community, in addition, slightly more than half of them also received abstinence-only education.\n \n By the end of the study, when the average child was just shy of 17, half of both groups had remained abstinent. The sexually active teenagers had sex the first time at about age 15. Less than a quarter of them, in both groups, reported using a condom every time they had sex. More than a third of both groups had two or more partners.\n \n \"There's not a lot of good news here for people who pin their hopes on abstinence-only education,\" said Sarah Brown, executive director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a privately funded organization that monitors sex education programs. \"This is the first study with a solid, experimental design, the first with adequate numbers and long-term follow-up, the first to measure behavior and not just intent. On every measure, the effectiveness of the programs was flat.\"Study Casts Doubt on Abstinence-Only Programs - washingtonpost.com\n \n Abstinence education doesn't work, according to a new federal survey on teens and sex that was released today. This is a sweeping new study. It says most teens have sex before marriage, even if they pledge not to. It also found a dangerous trend, the abstinence group was more likely to have unsafe sex.\n \n Teenagers who pledge to remain virgins until marriage are just as likely to have pre-marital sex as those who don't promise abstinence, according to the new report that included 11-thousand students in in middle and high school. Researchers say 82-percent of teens end up breaking their virginity pledge.\n \n \"We all want our kids to wait until our kids are married to have sex, generally but its a fantasy that children are doing that,\" said Mary Banecker, Planned Parenthood, Southeastern Pennsylvania.Study: Abstinence Education Doesn't Work - cbs3.com\n \n I don't get conservatives.\n To me, it's a goal related issue. I want teen pregnancy / STD rate cut.\n Conservatives don't seem to even look at the result of their actions. They don't want to admit that their approach is flawed.\n \n Iraq War? Go-go-go-go!\n Ignore the fact that we are actually INCREASING the terrorist threat, and go for killing terrorists... emoticon_rolleyes",

Under the Common Law, sodomy consisted of anal intercourse. Traditionally courts and statutes referred to it as a \"crime against nature\" or as copulation \"against the order of nature.\" In the United States, the term eventually encompassed oral sex as well as anal sex. The crime of sodomy was classified as a felony.\n \n Because homosexual activity involves anal and oral sex, gay men were the primary target of sodomy laws. Culturally and historically, homosexual activity was seen as unnatural or perverse. The term sodomy refers to the homosexual activities of men in the story of the city of Sodom in the Bible. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because of their residents' immorality became a central part of Western attitudes toward forms of non-procreative sexual activity and same-sex relations.\n \n Beginning with Illinois in 1961, state legislatures reexamined their sodomy statutes. Twenty-seven states repealed these laws, usually as a part of a general revision of the criminal code and with the recognition that heterosexuals engage in oral and anal sex. In addition, state courts in 10 states applied state constitutional provisions to invalidate sodomy laws. As of early 2003, eight states had laws that barred heterosexual and homosexual sodomy. Three other states barred sodomy between homosexuals.\n \n In Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Georgia sodomy statute. Michael Hardwick was arrested and charged with sodomy for engaging in oral sex with a consenting male adult in his home. A police officer was let into Hardwick's home to serve a warrant and saw the sexual act. Although the state prosecutor declined to prosecute the case, Hardwick brought suit in federal court asking that the statute be declared unconstitutional.\n \n On a 5&#8211;4 vote, the Court upheld the law. Writing for the majority, Justice byron r. white rejected the argument that previous decisions such as the Court's rulings on Abortion and contraception had created a right of privacy that extended to homosexual sodomy. Instead, the Court drew a sharp distinction between the previous cases, which involved \"family, marriage, or procreation,\" and homosexual activity.\n \n The Court also rejected the argument that there is a fundamental right to engage in homosexual activity. Prohibitions against sodomy were in the laws of most states since the nation's founding. To the argument that homosexual activity should be protected when it occurs in the privacy of a home, White stated that \"otherwise illegal conduct is not always immunized whenever it occurs in the home.\" Because the claim in the case involved only homosexual sodomy, the Court expressed no opinion about the constitutionality of the statute as applied to acts of heterosexual sodomy.\n \n The Bowers decision was severly criticized. Justice lewis powell, who voted with the majority, later stated that he had made a mistake in voting to affirm the law. In July 2003 the Supreme Court reversed itself on the issue of sodomy. In Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. ___, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508, in a 6&#8211;3 decision, the Court invalidated a Texas anti-homosexual sodomy law by invoking the constitutional rights to privacy.\n \n Further readings\n Arnault, E.

With that said, let me assure you that oral sex plays an integral role in our marital sex life and we have never been convicted by the Holy Spirit that it is wrong in any way. \n \n Your application of it on the other hand, no matter how you define sodomy has always been condemned since it's with members of the same sex and has historically involved the anal version of it.

It was believed that straight men needed an outlet to release their sexual tension or they would commit acts of adultery, rape or homosexuality. The Catholic church and Thomas Aquinas saw prostitution as a &#8220;necessary evil.&#8221; (a)Sodomy, Sex And The Catholic Church | The Purple Pew\n \n Like I pointed out earlier, this is something THE CHURCH did.\n Our U.S. laws were just following existing precedent.\n \n \n \nAnd 2) it isn't a thesis but a dictionary definition so it isn't expected to give historical context/justifications for the two definitions. But it does give sources which allows for further reading which no other dictionary did. I looked at 5 other sources and this was the most complete.\n\n The capability to give sources is irrelevant.\n I am giving sources as well.\n \n Moreover, the veracity of the link between the article and the \"sources\" it claims to cite is questionable considering it couldn't even get it right that oral sex IS LEGALLY considered \"sodomy\".\n Moreover, I find at least one of the citations amusing.\n It quotes \"<www.sodomylaws.org<\". If you look back, I have already linked to and quoted from this web-site as proof of MY statements.\n \n A while back, SCOTUS overturned sodomy laws. There were a handful of states that included HETEROSEXUAL sodomy (as opposed to states like Texas that just outlawed homosexual sodomy with heterosexual sodomy legal).\n And with the states that included heterosexual sodomy, ORAL SEX was included!\n \n \n \nTrue, legally sodomy includes oral sex, but the historical definition of sodomy doesn't.\n\n Wrong.\n 14th century Catholic definition, cited above.\n \n \n \nWhat you have this boring habit of doing is forcing your very limited and subjective personal opinion as fact as you refuse to consider anything that proves you are dead wrong in your prejudicial assumptions. That is why I speak my piece and allow you to continue to ramble on with your shallow denials and justifications for your self serving arguments.\n\n Funny.\n Were you looking in a mirror when you said that?\n \n \n \nIf you are capable of noticing, I have never once denied that oral sex could also be defined as sodomy.\n\n It's funny watching you post junk, cause you habitually contradict yourself. Sometimes WITHIN A SINGLE POST.\n Okay. Archie says this.\n But let's take a look at his VERY NEXT RESPONSE to what I said...\n foundit66: \"ROFLMAO!\n You think I oppose it just cause \"you posted it\"?\n I oppose it cause it's wrong.\n The Hills, which you quoted, claim that oral sex is not included in sodomy.\n It IS included in sodomy.\n The Hills were wrong. \"\n Archie: So you constantly say ad infinitum every time you are proven wrong. Just keep insisting how right you are foundit, eventually you'll convince one other person who sees the world through the lens of your distorted perspective.\n \n I am amazed at how he claims to \"never once denied that oral sex could also be defined as sodomy\", but then when I point out that \"oral sex\" IS included in sodomy, he gives me the above junk response...\n HOW have I been proven wrong for something you claim that you have \"never once denied\"????\n \n There are times I wonder if Archie is just a bot. A compilation of denying claims put together, with occasional irrelevant bible verses peppered in.\n \n \n \nThe disparity in application is irrelevant to me. What mattered to me was to give a more complete picture of its definition, something you can't seem to handle. So I needn't obfuscate or defend anything I have posted. Any objective and rational person can see that the link I posted gives the most complete definition of the word sodomy.\n\n Any objective and rational person can see that the link you posted WAS WRONG in its claims.\n To repeat myself, The Hills, which you quoted, gave what is supposed to be a \"legal\" analysis of sodomy.\n The Hills, which you quoted, claim that oral sex is not included in sodomy.\n It IS included in sodomy. States INCLUDE \"oral sex\" in their interpretation of the \"sodomy\" laws.\n The Hills were wrong. \n \n \n \nSo you constantly say ad infinitum every time you are proven wrong. Just keep insisting how right you are foundit, eventually you'll convince one other person who sees the world through the lens of your distorted perspective.\n\n Again, were you looking in the mirror?\n I think you really fail to recognize who is perceived as not credible or reliable here.\n \n \n \nLike I said, you puritans who waggle your fingers at others and cackle incessantly about your condemnation (excuse me, what you claim is your god's condemnation) of others refuse to recognize how often you change your own interpretation of the bible.\n Historically, the puritan sense of sex was opposed to oral sex. PERIOD.\n And yet, today's puritans kinda like it so they ignore it, just like they ignore the bible's comments on women's equality and wearing clothing of different fibers and similar stuff.\n\n \nWOW, I challenge you to quote me posting any moral judgement or condemnation regarding the act of sodomy anywhere since responding to this definition issue.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n It's amusing how you try to limit the scope of the analysis in a preferential and completely self-centered way to ignore the obvious.\n Archie specifies \"anywhere since responding to this definition issue\"...\n Like his capability to avoid his condescension for three posts in one solitary thread somehow means that he isn't a \"puritans who waggle your fingers at others and cackle incessantly about your condemnation (excuse me, what you claim is your god's condemnation) of others refuse to recognize how often you change your own interpretation of the bible\".\n \n For the rest of the board, if anybody doubts my classification, I will elaborate.\n If Archie is going to obfuscate what everybody else ALREADY KNOWS IS TRUE, I'll let him continue to prove himself untrustworthy... \n \n \n \nAnd since when was this about what christians think of oral sex? This is just more moving of the goalpost by you in order to define christians as puritanical.\n\n You respond with three posts, and already you're lost...\n And the really sad part is that is the norm for discussions with you...\n \n This whole discussion came up when another poster tried to blame Bill Clinton for making \"oral sex\" seem like \"not sex\".\n The truth is that Clinton was simply REPEATING AN EXISTING STANDARD that started long before he was ever fertilized.\n It's a CHRISTIAN standard.\n \n I tried to set the record straight.\n You jumped in, evidently (or so you claim) not objecting to the inclusion of oral sex as sodomy.\n And here we are...\n \n This isn't about \"moving the goalposts\".\n FROM THE START this point has been about WHO ORIGINALLY defined \"oral sex\" as NOT being sex.\n \n For the life of me I don't understand why you insist on involving yourself in conversations when you obviously lack the comprehension skills to keep up with it...\n \n \n \nWith that said, let me assure you that oral sex plays an integral role in our marital sex life and we have never been convicted by the Holy Spirit that it is wrong in any way.\n\n And to this, I refer people to the 14th Century Catholic Church pronouncement.\n I don't know who this \"we\" is you claim to quote, but HISTORICALLY Christians have condemned oral sex as sodomy and dirty.\n It was LABELLED AS ILLEGAL.\n Do you really think the reason for that was based on secular reasons???\n \n \n \nYour application of it on the other hand, no matter how you define sodomy has always been condemned since it's with members of the same sex and has historically involved the anal version of it. Since homosexuality is an unnatural relationship, any version of its application is considered wrong according to Gods word. That isn't my opinion either foundit, its Gods.\n\n And one has to wonder why if God finds it so supposedly unnatural, why do we find gay animals throughout nature?\n Why does God continue to make gays?\n \n What you quote isn't \"God's word\". It's the words of barbaric men and women who thought misogyny, slavery, and genocide were okay.\n It's the words of barbaric men who saw their daughter get raped, and expected payment from the rapist as compensation for what the MAN had lost as they force the daughter into marriage.\n THAT is a \"perversion\". THAT is an unhealthy relationship.",

   "Archie, you fail to recognize the significance of what is going on.\n\n \n \nArchie, what you fail to recognize is that this \"definition\" is failing to appreciate a bigger history.\n \n The CHURCH proclaimed oral sex as \"sodomy\" LONG BEFORE the Americas were even discovered!\n The definition of sodomy was expanded in the 14th century by the Catholic church to include masturbation, oral sex, and any \"sex between the legs and from behind\" by same-sex male couples. Thomas Aquinas expanded the definition of sodomy even further to include lesbian sex and any sexual act where the woman was not in the bottom submissive position.

Does this sound like a rational and consistent doctrine to you? Not at all, but you still hold it us as if it matters in the real world of scriptural beliefs.\n \n And I don't fail to recognize anything except that your warped and distorted opinion is forced on reason in every argument you offer. There is nothing here worth defending against when all people have to do is read the exchange first hand to get the true merit of my posts, and the irrational responses you offer.\n \n \n\n True, legally sodomy includes oral sex, but the historical definition of sodomy doesn't.\n\n \nWrong.\n 14th century Catholic definition, cited above.\n\n \n And we all know what the 14th century popes stood for, don't we. Also, why are you holding the 14th century catholic church up as a moral authority in any way, shape or form? Here's what the Popes of that century represented in reality. \n BONIFACE VIII (1294-1303). He had his predecessor, Celestine, put in prison, where he died. [133:2] He openly styled himself \"King of Kings,\" trafficked in indulgences, and declared all excluded from heaven who disputed his claim to universal dominion. He persecuted the Ghibellines, and ordered the city of Bragneste to be entirely destroyed. He was publicly accused of simony, assassination, usury, of living in concubinage with his two nieces and having children by them, and of using the money received for indulgences to pay the Saracens for invading Italy. [133:3]\n \n CLEMENT V (1305-1314). He is noted for his cruel suppression of the order of Knights Templar, so as to appropriate their property. He summoned the grand master of the Templars under false pretexts to his court, and issued a bull against the order in which he brought against it the most unfounded and absurd charges, and finally pronounced its abolition, having the Grand Master and many leading members burnt alive. [134:4] After sharing the spoils of the Templars with the king of France, Clement V fixed his court at Avignon, and gave himself publicly to the most criminal debaucheries. He preached a new crusade against the Turks and gave each new crusader the right to release four souls from purgatory. Dante places him in hell.\n \n JOHN XXII (1316-34). Like his predecessors, he persecuted and burnt heretics. He anathematised the emperor of Germany and the king of France, and preached a new crusade. Money was raised in abundance by the sale of indulgences, and was misappropriated by the pope. He left enormous treasures. Villani, whose brother was one of the papal commission, states that this successor of the fisherman amassed altogether twenty-five million florins. [134:5] Gieseler says: \"He arbitrarily disposed of the Benefices of all countries, chiefly in favor of his own nephews, and the members of his curia.\" [134:6]\n \n URBAN VI (1378-89). In his time occurred what is known as \"the great Western schism,\" which lasted from 1378 till the Council of Constance (1414). There were during that time two popes, one residing at Rome and the other at Avignon. But which of the popes was the true one and which the antipope has not yet been decided. Urban VI was a ferocious despot. He ordered six cardinals, whom he suspected of opposing him, to be brutally tortured. [134:7] Nor was his competitor, Clement VII, behind him in violence and crime. For fifty years they and their successors excited bloody wars and excommunicated one another. The schism, which cost thousands of lives, was ended by the deposition of John XXIII (1415), who was found guilty of murder and incest. He was accused before the Council of having seduced two hundred nuns. Theodoric de Niem informs us that he kept two hundred mistresses in Bologna, and he is described by his own secretary as a monster of avarice, ambition, lewdness and cruelty. [135:8] The same author says that an act of accusation, prepared against him, presented a complete catalogue of every mortal crime.Crimes of Christianity: Crimes of the Popes",

Not at all, but you still hold it us as if it matters in the real world of scriptural beliefs.\n\n You keep jumping around and failing to recognize what is REALLY going on here.\n If you wanted to get into a conversation on what is \"rational and consistent\", then I've got a WHOLE LIST of things about the Bible which aren't rational and consistent.\n \n Furthermore, I see it as completely IRRATIONAL and INCONSISTENT that conservatives want to insist on \"abstinence only\" education when it DOES NOT WORK. The STD and pregnancy rates are INCREASED with abstinence only education, yet the METHOD is more important than the end goal here to conservatives.\n That's not rational.\n \n Back on the subject of sodomy, this discussion is about THE HISTORICAL DEFINITION OF SODOMY.\n I have put forth that the historical definition of sodomy INCLUDES ORAL SEX.\n And I have proven that. 14th century Catholic church set the precedent.\n \n The fact that we may not like what they did is TOTALLY IRRELEVANT to the fact that THEY DID IT.\n If I were to agree with you that they were irrational, that would NOT CHANGE the fact that the Catholic church DID SET ORAL SEX as sodomy.\n \n And with you, I know you get lost easily so I'm sticking to getting you to realize \"Christianity set oral sex as sodomy in history\" (and I have faith that you can't do even that) before I'm willing to get in a discussion on \"is it rational\"...\n \n \n \nAnd I don't fail to recognize anything except that your warped and distorted opinion ...\n\n WOAH, woah, WoaH!\n This isn't my \"opinion\".\n I just PROVED to you what the Catholic church did in the 14th century.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I realize your dishonest side wants to kick in and obfuscate, but I have proven my point.\n I see no reason to quote your attempts to obfuscate the issue when you just complain and don't even address WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN.\n \n \n \nAnd we all know what the 14th century popes stood for, don't we. Also, why are you holding the 14th century catholic church up as a moral authority in any way, shape or form?\n\n And again, you're CHANGING THE SUBJECT.\n I don't hold a LOT of what they did up for \"moral authority\".\n I do not hold THE BIBLE as a real \"moral authority\", as it clearly has the Hebrew God commanding acts of genocide, slavery, misogyny, etc, etc, etc...\n \n This IS NOT ABOUT holding the popes up as an \"authority\".\n \n To recap, I made a pretty simple statement earlier which you are now running away from.\n I stated, QUITE CLEARLY, that it was the CHRISTIANS who established \"oral sex\" as included in the definition of sodomy.\n THAT is my point.\n \n I never said \"and the Popes were great moral leaders in doing that\".\n In fact, if you could stop and think without invoking strawman argument, you'd realize that I obviously would NOT hold that the popes were moral leaders.\n \n Since you are obviously trying to change the conversation to something COMPLETELY off topic, I recommend you start another thread and anybody interested can debate that with you.\n \n My point has been proven.\n I am not allowing you to change the subject to ignore that.\n \n Furthermore, you should be warned that any further attempts to change the subject will just result in me quoting the evidence you want to ignore...\n \n \nThe definition of sodomy was expanded in the 14th century by the Catholic church to include masturbation, oral sex, and any \"sex between the legs and from behind\" by same-sex male couples.

The program, Title V, \u00a7 510(b) of the Social Security Act (now codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 710b), is commonly known as Title V. It created very specific requirements for grant recipients. Under this law, the term \"abstinence education\" means an educational or motivational program which:[*]Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;[*]Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;[*]Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;[*]Teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;[*]Teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;[*]Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;[*]Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances, and[*]Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.Title V-funded programs were not permitted to advocate or discuss contraceptive methods except to emphasize their failure rates.[4]Abstinence-only sex education - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I bold-faced the item of concern.\n These programs ARE NOT PERMITTED to advocate OR EVEN DISCUSS contraceptive methods, except to emphasize their failure rates.\n And as another study showed, a lot of the times they mis-stated their failure rates.\n \n So what you know \"ever (sic) class they have question\"???\n It's not true.",
