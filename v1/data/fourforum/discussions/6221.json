   "I just randomly came across this and almost died laughing.\n \n http://www.family.org/docstudy/newsletters/a0021043.cfm\n \n \nMeanwhile, the boy's father has to do his part. He needs to mirror and affirm his son's maleness. He can play rough-and-tumble games with his son, in ways that are decidedly different from the games he would play with a little girl. He can help his son learn to throw and catch a ball. He can teach him to pound a square wooden peg into a square hole in a pegboard. He can even take his son with him into the shower, where the boy cannot help but notice that Dad has a penis, just like his, only bigger.\n\n \n What the hell kind of advice is this?\n \n So the way to keep your kid from being gay is to tumble around with him, pound pegs into holes, and show him your large adult penis!\n \n Should only the dad do these things or since it takes a village, should the neighbors all come over to show the son their penises?\n \n Should they all roll around tickling him before they show him their penises?\n \n I'm sorry, this is just too much for me.\n \n here's some more:\n \n http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000683.html\n \n \n\"My son couldn't care less about sports and the great outdoors. He's painfully shy and easily gets hurt. Other kids call him a sissy. I've tried everything. My boy even wimped out of Cub Scouts. What am I supposed to do?\"\n \n \"Our oldest daughter, Lisa, is starting junior high soon. She's a hopeless tomboy. If she had her way, she'd never wear skirts or dresses. She can't wait to sign up for the school wrestling team this fall. If I say no, she'll throw a fit. Where's the magic wand so I can turn her into a lovely princess?\"\n\n \n So what if your daughter wants to be on the wrestling team. If that's what makes her happy, then more power to her.\n \n And the top kid sounds pathologically lazy not gay.\n \n Besides, all these things sound like they are trying to address gender identity issues, not sexuality. I've known some guys before and when I found out they were gay I was quite surprised because they acted like typical males, except for the wanting females thing.\n \n Anyway, I thought this was funny, maybe you'll think it's sad.",

If the moral laws are still in effect, as our friend easyrider keeps telling us and I am sure Dobson still believes they are, then Dobson is encouraging people to commit a moral sin by showing their nakedness to thier children. KJV leviticus 18:6-18:17 Mentions 3 times this is a sinfull activity. KJV Leviticus 20:11 even spells this out a a sin punishable by death.

   "Dr. James Dobson and Gay Bashing ''101-201''\n By: David Palmer\n Independent Media TV\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n First and foremost, it should be noted that I am not an advocate for or against Gay people; however, I am an ardent and unapologetic believer that every person is entitled to be treated equally and fairly regardless of their ethnicity, race, religious beliefs, and/or sexual preference. To assert and/or publicly opine that one is a true Christian when one engages in name-calling and exhorting others to openly discriminate against another person or group gives Christian hypocrisy a bad name. \n The recent election results have surely taught us that Gay Bashing has turned into a &#147;successful&#148; Olympian sport by so-called Christian moralists like Dr. James Dobson and his cadre of enablers and opportunists. \n \n Well-known Focus on the Family founder Dr. James Dobson has spent a great deal of time, effort and money (none of which was his) in vilifying and viciously attacking the gay community. Dobson&#146;s vehicle for spewing forth his homophobic rant is aimed at amending the US Constitution to outlaw gay marriages. \n \n In October, Dobson spoke on behalf of Senatorial Candidate Tom Coburn of Oklahoma at a rally at Oklahoma Christian University in support of a constitutional ban on gay marriages. To prove that gay marriages led to fewer men and women getting married, Dobson cited countries such as Norway that have allowed same-sex couples to marry. \n \n Dobson said 80 percent of children are born out of wedlock in Norway. &#147;Homosexuals are not monogamous. They want to destroy the institution of marriage. It will destroy marriage. It will destroy the Earth, Dobson said.&#148; (The Oklahoman, 10-23-03) \n \n Not to be outdone by his mentor and political supporter, Tom Coburn told Rogers County Republicans last year, &#147;The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power&#133; That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That&#146;s a gay agenda.&#148; \n \n Lord have mercy, if these statements are true, and who would question the veracity of Christian stalwarts like Dobson and Coburn, then we (that&#146;s us so-called straight God-fearing folks) should be truly concerned about the power (Is that extreme power Mr. Coburn? Is there another kind, said Jack Nicholson, I&#146;m sorry, I mean Coburn) of the gay community that will (a) destroy marriages, (b) destroy the earth (whew, and I was worried about global warming), and (c) the greatest threat to our freedom (I guess so, now that Saddam&#146;s been captured). \n \n Oklahomans are lucky to have voted for a visionary (soothsayer) like Senator Tom Coburn who was able to perceive that abortion is a &#147;gay agenda.&#148; Whew, Dr. Tom must be blessed with ESPN, don&#146;t ya think? I don&#146;t know about you, but I find it laughable at best to claim that abortion is a gay issue. Ever heard of a gay couple seeking an abortion or lamenting over an unwanted pregnancy? Now, I don&#146;t mean to disparage Dr. Tom if ya know what I mean. After all, he&#146;s a gynecologist and I&#146;m not; however Dr. Tom should stop buying recreational drugs from street vendors in Tulsa who accept double off coupons. \n \n In 1998, Dr. Dobson gave a speech wherein he stated, &#147;You don&#146;t have to be taught that it&#146;s wrong to steal and to lie and to extort and to bribe and to oppress the poor and to express racial hatred and to be promiscuous, both homosexually and heterosexually. There&#146;s no difference between those two. Promiscuity it immoral, as is adultery. That law is eternal and it is written on the heart of man.&#148; \n \n It sees as though Dr. Dobson finds it convenient to tell &#147;lies&#148; while bashing the gay community. Dobson&#146;s statement that 80 percent of children in Norway are born out of wedlock is false and a total fabrication. According to Statistics Norway (government entity), which can be found at http://www.ssb.no/www-open/english/ the rate in 2003 was 50.5%, which isn&#146;t anywhere near 80%. I suppose this Christian lie is acceptable when bashing gays, right Dr. Jim? \n \n Dr. Dobson&#146;s fabrication in disabusing Norwegians to promote his gay bashing by claiming that gay marriages will destroy the earth, our moral fiber (values) and lead to destruction of marriage is not only absurd it is patently false. Put simply, Dr. Jim found Norwegians to be an acceptable target by claiming their liberal views on same sex marriage led to runaway abortions, out of wedlock marriages and destruction of marriages (divorces) and that America would face the same damnable fate if it failed to abide by his Christian values in bashing gays. \n \n Well, I&#146;m here to tell ya that Dr. Jim is a damn liar! The real truth according to US and Norwegian government statistics as to abortions, divorces and children born out of wedlock are as follows. \n \n - 2000&#151;Norway had 14,655 abortions&#151;population 4.5 million\n - Alabama had 13,830 abortions&#151;population 4.4 million\n - Tennessee had 19,010 abortions&#151;population 5.7 million\n - North Carolina had 37,610 abortions&#151;population 8.0 million\n \n - 2001-03&#151;Norway had 31,515 divorces&#151;population 4.5 million\n - Arkansas had 50,109 divorces&#151;population 2.7 million\n - Arizona had 71,206 divorces&#151;population 2.7 million\n - Alabama had 68,333 divorces&#151;population 4.4 million\n - Kentucky had 62,998 divorces&#151;population 4.0 million\n - Tennessee had 90,685 divorces&#151;population 5.7 million\n \n - 2001&#151;Norway had 28,515 out-of-wedlock birth&#151;population 4.5 million\n - Arizona had 33,475 out-of-wedlock births&#151;population 2.7 million\n - Louisiana had 30,980 out-of-wedlock births&#151;population 4.5 million\n Source: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/pdf/nvsr52_22_t3.pdf\n \n The factual statistics above prove beyond all doubt that Dr. Jim and his cadre of enablers and False Profits like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Robert Land and Senator Coburn and their ilk find it both acceptable to spew forth total fabrications in their lust and zeal to paint themselves as moral Christian-Value crusaders that are servants and spokesmen for Christ. \n \n When openly discriminating against African Americans (albeit it in a Christian way) no longer guaranteed political power and financial success, these vile men set out to find a new minority to target, which was and is the gay community. They then manipulated their flocks by spewing forth hateful and discriminatory claims under the guise that they were the guardians of Christianity. \n \n Senator Coburn&#146;s statement that the gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and that they wield extreme power&#148; is pure hyperbole (bs). I don&#146;t consider the local hair salon to be a &#147;center of power,&#148; do you? Of course the real centers of power are located in places like the Whitehouse or statehouse in Sacramento. Other than a few girly-men running amuck in Sacramento, I&#146;m not aware of any gay power brokers operating there or in DC, are you? \n \n The sad truth is that these kinds of zealots and ideologues are willing to do/say anything to obtain power and/or enrich themselves at the expense of those they falsely claim to represent. Setting into motion an agenda (scheme) to dupe their flocks in believing that minority gays deserve to be ostracized, humiliated and discriminated against for the betterment of the country and in the name of Christ is appalling. \n \n Who will these purveyors of hate target for the 2008 election? What group among us will they claim threatens our freedom? Will it be your group? Or will it be my mine? How many more lies and fabrications will they be willing to foist upon us in the name of Jesus? \n \n Finally, we all have an inalienable right to disagree with anyone&#146;s lifestyle; however, none of us has a right to impose our so-called values on our fellow brothers and sisters no matter how righteous we believe our cause to be. \n \n \n \n \n \n Original Link: http://www.independent-media.tv/item.cfm?fmedia_id=9988&fcategory_desc=Under%20Reported",

   "however, none of us has a right to impose our so-called values on our fellow brothers and sisters no matter how righteous we believe our cause to be.\n\n \n Ah, the predictable accusation and statement: 'you don't have the right to impose your beliefs.' It's a straw man accusation that is always fallen back on by the gay lobby, simply because it's the only way they have to put a seemingly play-the-victim face on their attacks. The truth is of course, they've never really proven how anyone is truly \"imposing\" on them, nor have they really shown that there is some huge conspiracy to impose morality on them. \n \n The accusation of imposing beliefs is nothing more than a way for gay rights lobbyists to distract from the real issue: that many people view homosexual behavior as immoral. It attempts to put a 'noble' face on a counter-cultural anti-society message, that at it's heart is really saying \"damn society--I'll do what I want regardless of consequences ON society.\"",

   "Dr. James Dobson and his Christian organization, Focus on the Family, recently released several articles telling parents how to identify homosexuality in their children. Though rife with error and harmful stereotypes, the articles give us insight into the fundamentalist Christian mind and prove to be extremely entertaining (though not intentionally).\n \n Focusing on young boys, Dobson's group says the first warning sign that one might become gay is if they show \"a strong feeling that they are 'different' from other boys.\" Going by this standard, almost every young boy (and girl) who feels \"different\" when they are young must be a \"flaming homo.\" And if that is the case, then Dobson is justified in his fear of the pink menace as almost every child in the world would have to be gay.\n \n Another warning sign is \"a tendency to cry easily, be less athletic, and dislike the roughhousing that other boys enjoy.\" In one of his newsletters, Dobson recommends to his followers the manuscript of \"A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality,\" an unpublished book by Dr. Joseph Nicolosi claiming that traits such as being \"bright, precocious, social and relational and artistically talented\" set young boys apart and contributes \"to a distortion in the development of their normal gender identity.\"\n \n Apparently Dobson wants all young boys to be boring, unemotional jocks so that one day they can grow up and do something wholesome such as become a policeman, do construction work, become a cowboy, join the navy, or maybe even become part of an Indian tribe.\n \n Nicolosi places great importance on father figures to prevent homosexuality in boys. In his book, he gives examples of activities a father can do with his son to foster a healthy gender identity, such as \"teach him to pound a square wooden peg into a square hole in a pegboard.\" Hopefully the common conception of fundamentalist Christians being \"square\" refers just to their attitude and not their anatomy, though I'm still not entirely sure by what a pegboard is. \n \n Nicolosi also suggests that a father \"can even take his son with him into the shower, where the boy cannot help but notice that Dad has a penis, just like his, only bigger.\" I tried to think of something witty to say here, but there really is nothing more that can be said which could make that statement any more tragically hilarious.\n \n The other warning signs deal mainly with boys showing various \"feminine\" traits or if they \"walk, talk, dress and even 'think' differently.\" Helpful as these pointers are, Dobson left out a few. For example, if your son feels \"different\" in school and is picked on by bullies and called names, then he is probably gay. If he is all these things and gets bitten by a radioactive spider then he is Spider-man, which consequently would also make him gay (just look at those tights).\n \n Another fun test would be to force your son to wrestle a wild bear. If the bear wins, the athletically-challenged son is gay. If the son wins, than he is a butch gay and probably enjoys being dominant. Regardless of the result, U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, R-Pa., will be vindicated in his belief that homosexuality leads to beastiality.\n \n James Dobson and his followers are, in truth, advocating parents to teach conformity to children. Their warning signs against homosexuality are really warning signs against being different. And when it comes to their attitudes on homosexuality, these Christian fundamentalists stubbornly cling to outdated stereotypes and believe in things that have long been proven to be wrong. Homosexuality is not a disorder that can be cured or prevented - it is simply a part of life. \n \n At the risk of sounding like a greeting card, our differences are what make us special. We must treasure what sets each of us apart unless we want to live in world full of James Dobsons. And if that happens, I can hardly imagine the damage all that old man smell will do to the environment. \n http://www.dailyillini.com/media/paper736/news/2005/08/22/Opinions/Column.Boys.To.Men-968106.shtml",

   "Dobson in my mind is no different from Phelps. Also Dobson dosen't mind throwing leviticus at gay people any chance he gets. If the moral laws are still in effect, as our friend easyrider keeps telling us and I am sure Dobson still believes they are, then Dobson is encouraging people to commit a moral sin by showing their nakedness to thier children. KJV leviticus 18:6-18:17 Mentions 3 times this is a sinfull activity. KJV Leviticus 20:11 even spells this out a a sin punishable by death. Dobson is a bigot and a hypocrit don't listen him and doesn't even uphold the standards of his brand of christianity.\n\n Sorry it's taken so long for me to reply.\n \n I actually don't see bathing as a sexual activity.\n Sure, it can be used for sex, but the dad and son thing isn't sexual in my opinion.\n \n I've heard that this is good for small children to see the difference between men and women, dad takes a shower with you and then mom does, just so the child sees the difference. I guess the shower is just an excuse to be naked, since nudity is discouraged in this culture.\n \n If nudity was more common, children would pick up on the differences a lot sooner.\n \n But I think I vaguely remember doing something like this when I was really little, 3-4, and IIRC, I didn't even notice anything about anatomy. I remember thinking that I was being taught how to use the shower, so that's what I was interested in.\n \n So all that being said LVT 3:16 says you shouldn't engage in sexual activity with your family members, and I don't think it's sexual to simply teach your children about la difference.\n \n But what's interesting about this chapter:\n \" 'Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father.\n \n \" 'Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere. \n \n \" 'Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.\n \n \n They are not under the assumption that a marriage consists of one man and one woman.\n \n This implies that men can have multiple wives.",
