   "It might be of interest that while Russia's membership in the Big Eight guarantees energy preparedness of Occidental civilization and the US finds it reasonable, American politicians and mass media proceed with the Russia exclusion campaign. As the Iraqi oil situation is uncertain, US national debt has been multiplied up many times and primary energy market is highly unstable, it becomes evident that President Bush' politics is at variance with national interests. \n \n However, in the present-day world that is reigned by transnational corporations, borders are notional and no national interests exist for the ruling clans. For some evidence, American journalists' propaganda and the rigid position of official Washington resulted into negotiations between chief executives of the largest American corporations Halliberton, Shevron, Exxon Mobil and Chinese partners who gave promise to abandon their projects in South America and concede part of their achievements at Central Asian energy market, in particular, Kazakhstan. \n \n Naturally, being aggrieved of deprivation of chairmanship or exclusion from the Big Eight, Moscow is to fully redirect to China, official Beijing expects, as Chinese ever more developing economy requires oil and gas. This turn of international politics will surely lead to destabilization of economic circumstances and - as a consequence - political situation in Europe. Yet, neither China nor American mega-corporations fuss about this. They've got enormous incomes cashed on high oil prices.",
