   "Every so often a medical report comes out stating that our chances of catching some horrible disease is 5 times more likely than it was if we continue to do such and such.\n \n Has any one heard or is there published what the original chances were ?\n \n For instance, say, after research has been done, that my chances of contracting cancer are 5 times more likely if I drink whiskey than if I stop.\n \n But what is the base figure ? If it were 1 in 10 then I might (might!) think about it. If the base figure is only 1 in 10,000,000 then I probably won't.\n \n How can one make a reasoned assessment if the original base isn't given ? Or is it the media doiung a bit of scaremongering ?",
