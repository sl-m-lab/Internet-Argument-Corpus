   "Do you believe in evolution? I mean i understand if you do but I would like to make some points about it.....there are also some points procing creation.\n \n 1. The unusual rock layers in the Lewis Range. The top layers should be farther down, if the evolutionary theory is correct. Evolutionists insist that tectonics squeezed the top layers out from below, even though there are no signs of this movement. Normally when tons of rocks move, they grind the rocks underneath and leave scrapes, buckles, and gravel. God formed these mountains to testify His own handiwork and to confound the theorys of men.\n \n 2. Evolutionists are always making assumptions. They assumed that the tonsils and the appendix were remnants of previous species from which humans had evolved and were totally useless. They were wrong about that. When the human genome was sequenced and it was found that only 5% of it was used in genes they immediately assumed that the 95% not in genes was 'junk'. They were wrong again of course. The now called 'non-coding' DNA is the source of what makes humans tick and a marvel of creation in itself. \n \n Evidence proving creation \n \n \n 1. The Fossil Record. \n The fossil record provides evidence for a complex, instantaneous creation. Why? A: The lower geologic layers reveal a sudden proliferation of complex life forms with every phyla represented. This Cambrian Explosion or \"Big Bang\" of life is preceded by no simpler forms. B: Today's living forms show no change from their supposed ancient ancestors. C: There are large and systematic gaps between the different kinds of fossils rather than gradual, evolutionary changes.\n \n 2. Irreducible Complexity\n Prepackaged, highly engineered systems exist in our bodies that are so complex they defy evolutionary explanations. These systems involve integrated multiple parts and reactions that work together only as a whole. If you eliminate any one piece, none of the system works at all. Evolution supposedly operates by natural selection perfecting less developed systems. However, natural selection requires something working and in place to perfect! Examples in the human body are the immune system, blood clotting, and any one of hundreds of biochemical pathways.\n \n \n 3. Gaps in the Living World\n If isolated members of a species change by evolutionary processes, the main population group can still continue. We should be able to read the history of the evolutionary progression right across the very top of the evolutionary branching tree. We can't! Just as the fossil record contains large systematic gaps, the living world does too. We see evidence for creation of distinct kinds - not one kind changing into another.\n \n 4. Laws of Probability\n The odds are enormously great against the successful occurrence of each of the myriads of needed evolutionary changes! Even the probability of 1 small protein occurring by accident is 1 chance out of 10260. Since we have thousands of even larger proteins, it is inconceivable they all happened by chance. Coupling that with intricate structures like eyes, wings, hearts, lungs, etc., the laws of probability scream out, \"Creation!\" \n \n 5. Law of Cause and Effect:\n The Law of Cause and Effect is one of the best documented principles of science and of everyday experience. Every event must have a sufficient cause. Since the origin of the universe and the origin of life are events, they too must have a cause. The physical universe consisting of time, space, energy, and matter must all have a cause outside themselves. Likewise, life must have a living Cause. Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, leads to an infinite, eternal, powerful, intelligent, living First Cause--our awesome Creator!\n \n 6. Chicken or Egg Principle\n Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This question has plagued philosophers for a long time. The question is even deeper, however. Chickens have many proteins. Each protein is coded for by the DNA/RNA system. However, many specific proteins are needed in order to manufacture DNA/RNA. So which came first: proteins or DNA/RNA? The logical explanation is that they were both created. \n \n 7. Intelligent Design\n Intelligent Design demands an Intelligent Designer. The airplane, computer, and digital camera originated not by random, undirected, chance processes, but by engineering genius. Such sophisticated acheivements however, pale in comparison to the extremely complex, systematically ordered, precision regulated systems of living tissue. The superior flight of the dragonfly, the mind boggling information mega-processor of the human brain, and the eye as a self-focusing, fully-automatic, high resolution, 3-D motion picture camera are the natural prototypes for our acclaimed tech marvels. It is scientifically inconceivable, unreasonable and illogical to credit blind, brainless chance as their maker. God alone is wise without limits, and deserves the Glory.\n \n 8. The Anthropic Principle\n The Anthropic Principle observes that the universe, including our beautiful, blue planet appears to have been specifically designed for man to inhabit (just as Isaiah 45:18 says). Without the delicate balance of multitudes of physical properties, life would be impossible. Examples include the strength of the four basic forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces), the size and shape of the earth, the distance from earth to sun, the tilt of the earth's axis, the concentration of atmospheric gases, and the presence of abundant liquid water. It couldn't just happen. \n \n 9. Information Theory\n Information has intelligence as its source, not haphazard chaotic chance. A computer programmer instills purpose, plan, and design by implementing and organizing recognizable bits of data into an understandable language framework. In biological systems, information is encoded as DNA, the programmed software of cells. As evolutionist Dr . Micheal Denton says in his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, \"The capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any other known system; it is so efficient that all the information needed to specify an organism as complex as man weighs less than a few thousand millionths of a gram.\" Since raw organic molecules have no intrinsic cognitive capacity, who injected the information into the DNA? God alone is able.\n \n 10. Extreme Complexity\n Complexity beyond comprehension characterizes all life forms, including the so-called \"simple cell.\" As Dr. Micheal Denton states referring to the cell, \"...we would find ourselves in a world of supreme technology and bewildering complexity...beyond our own creative capacities.\" Everything, from atomic structures to cells, organs, organ systems, and living creatures speaks of incredible order, balance, and unity as a whole.\n \n and God Said It!\n It is really hard to argue with the only One who claims to have been there when the universe and life began. He said He created everything to reproduce \"after its own kind\" - not one kind changing into another.\n \n \n \n \n \n Creation Evidence - The Great Debate of Origins\n Creation Evidence is sought by Creationists to discredit Evolution, not to validate Special Creation... \n \n It is agreed on all sides that there are only two possible solutions to the riddle of origins. Either Someone made the world, or the world made itself. A third option, the world is eternal and without origin, contradicts Natural Laws such as Thermodynamics and has been disproved with mathematical certainty in the 20th century. As the universe is obviously complex and seemingly well-designed, a Designer should be the scientific default. In everything we observe today, concept and design are the result of a Mind. Furthermore, Natural Laws such as Gravity, Inverse Squares, Cause and Effect, and Thermodynamics imply a Law-Giver. \n \n Famous British evolutionary anthropologist and anatomist, Sir Arthur Keith, is quoted as saying, \"Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the alternative is Special Creation, and that is unthinkable.\" However, this is not acceptable under general principles of science. Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law, by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process, is found, a Creator must be the theoretical default. It doesn't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" \n \n Creation Evidence - A Few Brief Examples:\n \n \n Lack of Transitional Fossils. Charles Darwin wrote, \"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed. But, as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\" (Origin of Species, 1859). Since Darwin put forth his theory, scientists have sought fossil evidence indicating past organic transitions. Nearly 150 years later, there has been no evidence of transition found thus far in the fossil record. \n Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as \"descent with modification.\" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since \"beneficial\" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, \"downward\" mutations thus far. \n Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a \"Young Earth\" than an \"Old Earth.\" Each discovery is a separate \"Limiting Factor\" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities. \n Unacceptable Model of Origins. The Big Bang Theory is the accepted source of Origins among the majority of Evolutionists, and is taught in our public schools. However, the Big Bang does not explain many things, including the uneven distribution of matter that results in \"voids\" and \"clumps,\" or the retrograde motion that must violate the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Furthermore, the Big Bang does not address the primary question at hand, \"where did everything come from?\" Did nothing explode? How did this explosion cause order, while every explosion observed in recorded history causes disorder and disarray? \n \n \n \n \n what are your thoughts?\n \n emoticon_love *~*Andrea*~* emoticon_love",

   "Not really the right forum for this...might want to repost it in the Creation vs Evolution forum if you want more of a response but hey...\n \n I partly agree with Easyrider, it is nice breath of fresh air to see a creationist doing things the right way round and presenting evidence for creationism rather than focusing on just problems with evolution.\n \n However you do accuse proponents of evolution of making assumptions and then go and make quite a few yourself, especially in the later sections (7-9 particularly I think).\n I would also disagree with a few (well, most) of the points you make too, but I'm not really all that familar with the various points linked to evolution you mention so I'll stick to the molecular biology side. \n \n Regarding evolution point 2 - there is a vast amount of random XXXX within the non-coding DNA ('Junk' DNA is not the real term for it), only a very small amount of it is actually useful or even used. \n \n Regarding irreducable complexity - its a lot more complicated than 'Evolution supposedly operates by natural selection perfecting less developed systems', its possible to change existing structures to become something else entirely unrelated (I assume you are familiar with what happened to bacteria flagella being an example of this). Pretty much all proteins in the body share a great deal of homology with other proteins of different functions, either in humans or other species. \n \n Regarding the 'chicken and the egg scenario' - modern organisms use DNA which is transcibed to RNA and mediated by proteins. However Ribozymes have been discovered which are RNA molecules that can catalyse their own replication. RNA came first, then RNA used as information storage with proteins, finally RNA was replaced with more stable DNA.\n \n As for intelligent design and information theory - other than human input, designating various selection critera, programs have been written on a computer using nothing but evolutionlike selection. You don't need intelligence for information to appear out of chaos.\n \n Just for the record, which sort of creationism are you going providing evidence for? The more open 'the universe was created by God' or the YEC's 'the universe was created by God the way the bible states'?",

   "Do you believe in evolution? I mean i understand if you do but I would like to make some points about it.....there are also some points procing creation.\n \n \n \n Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.\n \n \n\n \n 1. The unusual rock layers in the Lewis Range. The top layers should be farther down, if the evolutionary theory is correct. Evolutionists insist that tectonics squeezed the top layers out from below, even though there are no signs of this movement. Normally when tons of rocks move, they grind the rocks underneath and leave scrapes, buckles, and gravel. God formed these mountains to testify His own handiwork and to confound the theorys of men.\n \n\n \n Considering the fault line running right there it, this is just one piece of evidence of a massive earth quake. The mountains are formed by the slippage of two plates over each other.. and the younger plates went\n under the older plates. \n \n \n\n 2. Evolutionists are always making assumptions. They assumed that the tonsils and the appendix were remnants of previous species from which humans had evolved and were totally useless. They were wrong about that. When the human genome was sequenced and it was found that only 5% of it was used in genes they immediately assumed that the 95% not in genes was 'junk'. They were wrong again of course. The now called 'non-coding' DNA is the source of what makes humans tick and a marvel of creation in itself. \n \n\n \n Well, this is a strawman.. I am not really sure what you are trying to prove except maybe you think it sounds impressive?? The line 'they assumed that the tonsils and the apendix were rements of previous specious' is a total nonsense sentance, and renders the entire paragraph worthless.\n \n \n\n Evidence proving creation \n \n \n 1. The Fossil Record. \n The fossil record provides evidence for a complex, instantaneous creation. Why? A: The lower geologic layers reveal a sudden proliferation of complex life forms with every phyla represented. This Cambrian Explosion or \"Big Bang\" of life is preceded by no simpler forms. B: Today's living forms show no change from their supposed ancient ancestors. C: There are large and systematic gaps between the different kinds of fossils rather than gradual, evolutionary changes.\n \n\n \n That is the creationist claim. However, under examination, the claim falls apart under it's won weight. Yes, that is the age in which there was an increase in life forms that coudl fossilise, but there is evidence of multicelluar\n animals long before then. I will also point out this is during the timeframe that\n the iron in the water was finished being oxidized out, and there started to be\n a rise in atmospheric oxygen.\n \n We also see multiceluar life from 590 to 550 mya too. \n \n Some articles you can read (not cut/paste from creationist web sites) are\n Archean molecular fossils and the early rise of eukaryotes. Science 285: 1033-1036. See also Knoll, A. H., 1999. A new molecular window on early life. Science 285: 1025-1026. http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/285/5430/1025\n \n and \n \n Chen, J.-Y. et al., 2000.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA 97(9): 4457-4462. http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/9/4457\n \n \n\n 2. Irreducible Complexity\n Prepackaged, highly engineered systems exist in our bodies that are so complex they defy evolutionary explanations. These systems involve integrated multiple parts and reactions that work together only as a whole. If you eliminate any one piece, none of the system works at all. Evolution supposedly operates by natural selection perfecting less developed systems. However, natural selection requires something working and in place to perfect! Examples in the human body are the immune system, blood clotting, and any one of hundreds of biochemical pathways.\n \n\n \n Ah yes, the darling of the 'Intellidgent design' movement. Too bad that none of the systems ever brought forward as an example of being 'irreducible complex' has been shown to be indeed 'irreducible complex'. There is no reason to think that irredicubile complex means 'intelligent designer'. After all,\n irreducible complex structures can form in nature (although the examples are currently not biological). Consider the stone arch. There are a number of them that were formed due to water errosion, where the 'scaphalding' got worn away. According to the principles of \"I.C\" this can't happen. It did.\n \n \n\n 3. Gaps in the Living World\n If isolated members of a species change by evolutionary processes, the main population group can still continue. We should be able to read the history of the evolutionary progression right across the very top of the evolutionary branching tree. We can't! Just as the fossil record contains large systematic gaps, the living world does too. We see evidence for creation of distinct kinds - not one kind changing into another.\n \n\n \n From talkorigins\n \n\n The idea that gradual change should appear throughout the fossil record is called phyletic gradualism. It is based on the following tenets:\n \n 1. New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendants.\n 2. The transformation is even and slow.\n 3. The transformation involves most or all of the ancestral population.\n 4. The transformation occurs over most or all of the ancestral species' geographic range. \n \n \n However, all but the first of these is false far more often that not. Studies of modern populations and incipient species show that new species arise mostly from the splitting of a small part of the original species into a new geographical area. The population genetics of small populations allow this new species to evolve relatively quickly. Its evolution may allow it to spread into new geographical areas. Since the actual transitions occur relatively quickly and in a relatively small area, the transitions do not often show up in the fossil record. Sudden appearance in the fossil record often simply reflects that an existing species moved into a new region.\n \n\n \n \n\n 4. Laws of Probability\n The odds are enormously great against the successful occurrence of each of the myriads of needed evolutionary changes! Even the probability of 1 small protein occurring by accident is 1 chance out of 10260. Since we have thousands of even larger proteins, it is inconceivable they all happened by chance. Coupling that with intricate structures like eyes, wings, hearts, lungs, etc., the laws of probability scream out, \"Creation!\" \n \n\n \n The problem with that arguement is that it assumes that these proteins happen all at once. However, it does not. These complex protiens became\n complex one step at a time, with a filter of 'natural selection' applied. This\n basically eliminates the 'probably' arguement all togather. \n \n \n\n 5. Law of Cause and Effect:\n The Law of Cause and Effect is one of the best documented principles of science and of everyday experience. Every event must have a sufficient cause. Since the origin of the universe and the origin of life are events, they too must have a cause. The physical universe consisting of time, space, energy, and matter must all have a cause outside themselves. Likewise, life must have a living Cause. Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, leads to an infinite, eternal, powerful, intelligent, living First Cause--our awesome Creator!\n \n\n \n first of all, you are mistating the law of cause and effect. The law of cause and effect is the the cause must preceed the effect. You are incorrect in saying all effects must have causes. there is indicatoin in Quantum mechanics of non-causual events. Therefore, you are basing your logic on provably bad information.\n \n \n\n 6. Chicken or Egg Principle\n Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This question has plagued philosophers for a long time. The question is even deeper, however. Chickens have many proteins. Each protein is coded for by the DNA/RNA system. However, many specific proteins are needed in order to manufacture DNA/RNA. So which came first: proteins or DNA/RNA? The logical explanation is that they were both created. \n \n\n \n You must have been reading that book 'scientifc creationsim' by morris., and belived his nonsense. One way protiens might have formed, is the faces of chrystals. They found that amino acids will form chains on the surface of rock crystals. All that is needed to have been done is out of many billions of rock surfaces, just one or two chains form that were self replication.. and viola, we are in business.\n \n \n \n\n 7. Intelligent Design\n Intelligent Design demands an Intelligent Designer. The airplane, computer, and digital camera originated not by random, undirected, chance processes, but by engineering genius. Such sophisticated acheivements however, pale in comparison to the extremely complex, systematically ordered, precision regulated systems of living tissue. The superior flight of the dragonfly, the mind boggling information mega-processor of the human brain, and the eye as a self-focusing, fully-automatic, high resolution, 3-D motion picture camera are the natural prototypes for our acclaimed tech marvels. It is scientifically inconceivable, unreasonable and illogical to credit blind, brainless chance as their maker. God alone is wise without limits, and deserves the Glory.\n \n\n Thank you for pointing out that the so called 'science' of 'intelligent design' is religion, not science. You are also making the error of poor analogy, because airplane, compters, , etc etc, are not made up of self organizing, self replicating molecules. Yes, the designes that can come from random variation \n with a filter is mind staggaering. That is one of the reasons genetic algorethems (random variation with a filter) is often used in air plane design now. They use that same technique for a computer model to design how an aircraft wing can work. No 'intelligence' needed. Just random variation, and a filter (in the case of life, the filter is natural selection).\n \n \n \n 8. TheAnthropic Principle\n The Anthropic Principle observes that the universe, including our beautiful, blue planet appears to have been specifically designed for man to inhabit (just as Isaiah 45:18 says). Without the delicate balance of multitudes of physical properties, life would be impossible. Examples include the strength of the four basic forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces), the size and shape of the earth, the distance from earth to sun, the tilt of the earth's axis, the concentration of atmospheric gases, and the presence of abundant liquid water. It couldn't just happen. \n \n\n This is one of the sillier arguement otu there. If it was a idfferent universe, it is quite feasilbe a different kind of life would evolve. However, all this breaks down is the logical fallacy of personal incredibility, combined with the desire to feel 'special'.\n \n \n\n 9. Information Theory\n Information has intelligence as its source, not haphazard chaotic chance. A computer programmer instills purpose, plan, and design by implementing and organizing recognizable bits of data into an understandable language framework. In biological systems, information is encoded as DNA, the programmed software of cells. As evolutionist Dr . Micheal Denton says in his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, \"The capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any other known system; it is so efficient that all the information needed to specify an organism as complex as man weighs less than a few thousand millionths of a gram.\" Since raw organic molecules have no intrinsic cognitive capacity, who injected the information into the DNA? God alone is able.\n \n\n \n Michael Dention certainly underestimates the extent that random variation and natural selection can work to create complexity. A critique of his book\n can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/denton.html\n \n \n \n\n 10. Extreme Complexity\n Complexity beyond comprehension characterizes all life forms, including the so-called \"simple cell.\" As Dr. Micheal Denton states referring to the cell, \"...we would find ourselves in a world of supreme technology and bewildering complexity...beyond our own creative capacities.\" Everything, from atomic structures to cells, organs, organ systems, and living creatures speaks of incredible order, balance, and unity as a whole.\n \n\n \n See the above critique. Of course, this also is underestimating the power of natural selection and random varition, and includes the logical fallacy of personal incredibiltiy.\n \n \n\n and God Said It!\n It is really hard to argue with the only One who claims to have been there when the universe and life began. He said He created everything to reproduce \"after its own kind\" - not one kind changing into another.\n \n\n \n Where did god say this?? You quote a book that was written by a bronze age \n group that makes a claim. This is not 'god' saying anything, just some people who came up with a creation story, and tried to put their understanding of the world into their religion. You do not even have a good definition of KIND, nor does that say that one 'kind' can not gradually change form over generations to another 'kind'. Making a proclaimation for 'God' based on your interpretation of ancient writings is hardly evidence or proof of anything\n \n Let me finish the rest in anothe post\n \n \n Creation Evidence - The Great Debate of Origins\n Creation Evidence is sought by Creationists to discredit Evolution, not to validate Special Creation... \n \n It is agreed on all sides that there are only two possible solutions to the riddle of origins. Either Someone made the world, or the world made itself. A third option, the world is eternal and without origin, contradicts Natural Laws such as Thermodynamics and has been disproved with mathematical certainty in the 20th century. As the universe is obviously complex and seemingly well-designed, a Designer should be the scientific default. In everything we observe today, concept and design are the result of a Mind. Furthermore, Natural Laws such as Gravity, Inverse Squares, Cause and Effect, and Thermodynamics imply a Law-Giver. \n \n Famous British evolutionary anthropologist and anatomist, Sir Arthur Keith, is quoted as saying, \"Evolution is unproved and unprovable.

Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law, by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process, is found, a Creator must be the theoretical default. It doesn't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" \n \n Creation Evidence - A Few Brief Examples:\n \n \n Lack of Transitional Fossils. Charles Darwin wrote, \"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed.

Since Darwin put forth his theory, scientists have sought fossil evidence indicating past organic transitions. Nearly 150 years later, there has been no evidence of transition found thus far in the fossil record. \n [/quote]\n Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as \"descent with modification.\" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since \"beneficial\" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, \"downward\" mutations thus far. \n Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old.

   "2. Irreducible Complexity\n Prepackaged, highly engineered systems exist in our bodies that are so complex they defy evolutionary explanations.\n\n \n False, and misleading. \n \n Your statement is misleading in that it contains in it the very assumption it claims to show: it starts off by saying that there are \"prepackaged, highly engineered systems\". You have no evidence whatsoever that the systems were actually highly engineered.\n \n Your statement is false in that even Michael Behe - the very coiner of the term Irreducible Complexity - does NOT NOT NOT say that IC biochemical systemas defy evolutionary explanations. In fact, in his very own words, he says that they CAN evolve: they just can't evolve by the narrowly defined, very specific pathway his book addresses.\n \n \nGod_is_real: These systems involve integrated multiple parts and reactions that work together only as a whole.\n\n \n False. For example, Behe himself admits that the parts of his IC cilium are found in the cell and function perfectly fine in systems that aren't cilia. For example, microtubles, which are a main part of cilia, perform numerous functions in the cell, such as playing roles in cell division. And several proteins found in the bacterial flagellum - another of Behe's IC systems - function quite well in the Type III Secretory System. According to what you just said, none of these would be possible. \n \n \nGod_in_real: If you eliminate any one piece, none of the system works at all.\n\n \n Which has been shown to be false for one or more of Behe's claimed IC systems. For example, one of the proteins Behe claims is needed for either blood clotting or the immune system has been found to be missing in some species, yet their system still functions. Sorry, I can't remember the details off the top of my head, but if you read through the transcripts of the Dover, PA trial - where Behe made a fool of himself - you will find the testimony of Dr. Miller showing this.",

   "God_is_real: 3. Gaps in the Living World\n If isolated members of a species change by evolutionary processes, the main population group can still continue. We should be able to read the history of the evolutionary progression right across the very top of the evolutionary branching tree. We can't! Just as the fossil record contains large systematic gaps, the living world does too. We see evidence for creation of distinct kinds - not one kind changing into another.\n\n \n False. What we see IS evidence of evolution.\n \n Do birds have a notochord? Nope. Do humans have a notochord? Nope: but we do have slight remnants of it - small masses of connective tissue in our intervertebral disks. Do fishes - one of the more 'basal' vertebrates - have a notochord? Yep. Now, if birds don't have a notochord as adults, and humans don't have a notochord - but only very remote leftover remnants - as adults, then why do both humans and birds have a full, complete notochord during their embryonic stages? Because we share a common ancestor with fish: our embryos demonstrate this.\n \n During embryonic/fetal development humans also have aortic arches in their pharynx: again, structures that are no present in the adult form, because they are lost during development. Well guess what: fish embryos (and bird embryos) also have aoritc arches in their pharynx during embryonic development, and in fishes, they persist into adult forms. \n \n All vertebrates also have the unique embryonic feature of migrating neural crest cells: fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds have these, but squid, fruit flies, crabs, and so on do not. Again showin just how similar vertebrate embryos are to one another.\n \n Vertebrate embryos also form pharyngeal arches: what many loosely call \"gill slits\". In fact, it is in the pharyngula stage that the various vertebrate embryos - chickens, pigs, humans, etc. - show a great similarity to each other.\n \n The limbs of vertebrates are homologous. This is seen not just by the similarity in structure, but also in the genes and embryonic structures - like the ZPA and AER - that create them. \n \n And we can take a mouse's master eye gene and splice it into a fruit fly's genome in a region that specifies something other then the head region of the fly and that mouse gene will cause an ectopic eye to form.\n \n And from the fossil record we have the transitional fossils showing the evolution of the mammalian middle ear bones (the three ossicles) from bones of the reptilian jaw.",

   "Continued on\n \n \n [quote[\n Creation Evidence - The Great Debate of Origins\n Creation Evidence is sought by Creationists to discredit Evolution, not to validate Special Creation... \n \n It is agreed on all sides that there are only two possible solutions to the riddle of origins. Either Someone made the world, or the world made itself. A third option, the world is eternal and without origin, contradicts Natural Laws such as Thermodynamics and has been disproved with mathematical certainty in the 20th century. As the universe is obviously complex and seemingly well-designed, a Designer should be the scientific default. In everything we observe today, concept and design are the result of a Mind. Furthermore, Natural Laws such as Gravity, Inverse Squares, Cause and Effect, and Thermodynamics imply a Law-Giver. \n [/quote]\n \n Again, this is the logical fallacy of 'personal incrediblity'. It also is a logical fallacy of 'special pleading', because one can ask, quite legitimately, 'where does the creator come from'. The answer generally is that 'the creator is eternal' or 'the creator is outside time/space'. If the 'creator' can be outside time/space, or 'eternal' , why can't the conditions that gave rise to the universe be in the same state, without the added complexity of being a self aware entity? As such, it is just pure speculation, with adding a few pieces of complexity to match a religious belief. \n \n \n \n\n Famous British evolutionary anthropologist and anatomist, Sir Arthur Keith, is quoted as saying, \"Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the alternative is Special Creation, and that is unthinkable.\" However, this is not acceptable under general principles of science. Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law, by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process, is found, a Creator must be the theoretical default. It doesn't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not. As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" \n \n\n Well, creationists claim he said that. However, there is no real evidence he ever did. They give two sources.. one says it is was in the 100th edition of the 'origin of species), and the other one was on the centinial edition (which is a real trick, since that is 4 years after his death). No one seems to be able to find the primary source for that quote. Imagine that.\n \n \n\n Creation Evidence - A Few Brief Examples:\n \n Lack of Transitional Fossils. Charles Darwin wrote, \"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed. But, as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\" (Origin of Species, 1859). Since Darwin put forth his theory, scientists have sought fossil evidence indicating past organic transitions. Nearly 150 years later, there has been no evidence of transition found thus far in the fossil record. \n \n\n Now this quote is just plain and simply wrong... there are literallt thousands of transitional fossils. Here is a link to a large number of them.. \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html\n \n \n \n\n Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as \"descent with modification.\" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since \"beneficial\" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, \"downward\" mutations thus far. \n Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a \"Young Earth\" than an \"Old Earth.\" Each discovery is a separate \"Limiting Factor\" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities. \n \n\n You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies about\n science. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html\n \n \n\n Unacceptable Model of Origins. The Big Bang Theory is the accepted source of Origins among the majority of Evolutionists, and is taught in our public schools. However, the Big Bang does not explain many things, including the uneven distribution of matter that results in \"voids\" and \"clumps,\" or the retrograde motion that must violate the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Furthermore, the Big Bang does not address the primary question at hand, \"where did everything come from?\" Did nothing explode? How did this explosion cause order, while every explosion observed in recorded history causes disorder and disarray? \n \n\n \n The origin of the universe has nothign to do with evolution what so ever. While the 'big bang' is the theory that the vast majority of astrophysists accept, it really has nothing to do with biological evolution. The fact you find the 'big bang theory' unacceptable is more of the lack of knowledge on your part, and the unwillingness to look at the data. ..\n \n And no, the big bang does not address the quesiton of 'where everything came from'. That is a question beyond science, and in the realm of the philospher. Your comments do show a lack of understanding about science in general, 'the inflationary' model of the universe, and biology. The 'big bang'\n also was not an explosion, but it was an expansion. Your arguements against it is a strawman , based on a misunderstanding about what the theory thinks the big bang is.",

   "4. Laws of Probability\n The odds are enormously great against the successful occurrence of each of the myriads of needed evolutionary changes! Even the probability of 1 small protein occurring by accident is 1 chance out of 10260. Since we have thousands of even larger proteins, it is inconceivable they all happened by chance. \n\n \n Typical Creationist argument.\n \n Take hemoglobin, one of the Creationist's favorite protein. The probability that hemoglobin would form by accident is something like your 1 in 10^260. So surely everyone accepts that hemoglobin must have been created by an intelligent designer, and not by something as \"dumb\" as mere evolution .. right? \n \n Nope! Even Michael Behe - the Intelligent Design Creationist you have indirectly referred to above - says that the evidence for design is weak for hemoglobin. Why? Because he knows more than you do! Behe knows that there is another protein, called myoglobin, that is simpler than hemoglobin and yet also transport oxygen. So given myoglobin Behe acknowledges that evolution could produce hemoglobin all by itself ... no God needed!\n \n Another topic you appear completely ignorant of is exon shuffling. Many proteins share the functional domains coded for by the same exon. We can easily see how the shuffling of exons in the genome can create novel exon combinations whose translated products produce novel proteins ... proteins that perform useful biological functions! Each protein doesn't have to be created completely from scratch: nature has prefabricated modular protein domains that can be shuffled around by moving their exons around in the genome.\n \n \n \nGod_is_real: Coupling that with intricate structures like eyes, wings, hearts, lungs, etc., the laws of probability scream out, \"Creation!\" \n\n \n Our eyes are the end product of millions of years of evolution. Many simpler eyes exist in \"simpler, more primitive\" organisms. Ocelli are simple light senstive eye spots: they don't have the complex camera-type structure of our eyes. There are gradual improvements that can be made to ocelli that will lead to an eye with a lens and an aqueous humor. And going back to even simpler organisms, some bacteria - which clearly do not have eyes - actually have several of the proteins used in photoreceptors.\n \n Hears? Even in extant organisms there is a series of hearts, starting with simple contractile vessels, to single chambered hearts, to two chambered hearts, to three chambered hearts, to three-and-a-half chambered hearts, to four chambered hearts like we have.\n \n You are looking at the final product of millions of years of increasing complexity, then saying that it couldn't have happened by accident. Well, evolutionists don't claim it happened by accident!\n \n The biological evidence screams out \"EVOLUTION!\"",

And since then, scientists have been able to evolve in the lab a ribozyme that is capable of copying part of its own sequence.

   "8. The Anthropic Principle\n The Anthropic Principle observes that the universe, including our beautiful, blue planet appears to have been specifically designed for man to inhabit (just as Isaiah 45:18 says). Without the delicate balance of multitudes of physical properties, life would be impossible. Examples include the strength of the four basic forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces), the size and shape of the earth, the distance from earth to sun, the tilt of the earth's axis, the concentration of atmospheric gases, and the presence of abundant liquid water. It couldn't just happen. \n\n \n First of all, evidence would actually lead us to conclude that if the universe was designed to create anything, it's intended goal was black holes, not life! I believe it was Lee Smolin (spelling?) who concluded that our universe is essentially the best of all possible universes ... for the creation of black holes. And as far as life, something like 99.99...% of the universe is utterly hostile to life: radiation filled vacuum.\n \n Most of your other stuff just falls into the low probability category, which you also list as a separate evidence for creation. But you do realize that contemporary cosmology holds that ours is probably not the only universe, right? In fact, many theories hold that there is a near infinity of other universes, with different combinations of values for the masses of fundamental particles and strengths for the fundamental forcers of nature. In this case, there could be a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion universes out there that were \"stillborn\" - incompapatible with life because they did not have appropriate values for the constants of nature. But with enough universes to cover the odds, there would be at least one that would have just the right combination needed. And in which universe do you think life would find itself? Yep, the one (or the few) that just happened to get the right combination ... it could not be otherwise! So our finding just the right combination of values for the constants of nature needed for life to exist could be nothing more than a mere selection effect. No need for a God.",

Adaptation to a Low Phosphate Chemostat Environment by a Clonal Line of Yeast \n \n P.E. Hansche and J.C. Francis set up chemosats to allow evolution of a single clonal line of beer yeast in a phosphate limited (due to high pH) environment. (A chemostat is a device that allows the propagation of microorganisms in an extremely constant environment.) The yeast clones grew slowly for about the first 180 generations when there was an abrupt increase in population density. This was later shown to be due to better assimilation of the phosphate, presumably due to an improvement in the permease molecule. (Permease is an enzyme that controls what is allowed to come into the cell through the yeast's cell membrane.) After about 400 generations, a second improvement in cell growth rates occurred because of a mutation to the yeast's phosphatase (an enzyme that improves the cells ability to use phosphate). The phosphatase became more active overall, and its optimal pH (the pH where it is most active) was raised. Finally, a third mutant appeared after 800 generations that caused the yeast cells to clump. This raised the population density in the chemostat because individual cells were no longer being washed out of chemostat (which is one of the methods that the chemostat uses to maintain very uniform conditions) as quickly as they had prior to the mutation. (This is just speculation on my part, but I wonder if it wasn't under some similar conditions that multi-cellularity became favored over unicellularity - perhaps on a sea bed or river bottom.) \n \n This experiment was repeated, and the same mutations occurred, but in different orders. Also, in one replication, the processing of phosphate was improved by a duplication of the gene that produces phosphatase. This is experimental evidence of an extremely important mechanism in evolutionary history! It is also a particularly elegant experiment because not only was all of this adaptation shown to occur in clonal lines (descended from a single individual), but the authors also determined the exact mutations that caused the improved adaptations by sequencing the genes and proteins involved.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoMutations.html) \n\n \n \n \n \n\"Evolution of New Metabolic Pathways \n \n ...\n \n Xylitol is also not normally metabolized, but Mortlock and his colleagues were able to develop strains (generally through spontaneous mutations, but sometimes with u.v. ray or chemical induced mutations) that could use it because ribitol dehydrogenase (which is usually present in the cells to convert ribitol to D-ribulose) was able to slightly speed up the conversion of xylitol to D-xylulose, for which metabolic pathways already exist. The ability of the strains to utilize xylitol was increased as much as 20 fold when first production of ribitol dehydrogenase was deregulated (the enzyme was produced all the time, not just when ribitol was present), then duplication of the ribitol dehydrogenase genes occurred, then the structure of the enzyme was changed such that its efficiency at working with xylitol was improved, and finally, in at least one case, a line regained control of the modified ribitol dehydrogenase gene so that the enzyme was only produced in the presence of xylitol. Here we have a complete example of a new metabolic pathway being developed through duplication and modification of an existing pathway. \" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoMutations.html) \n\n \n \n Here's a breakdown.\n \n 1) ribitol deyhydrogenase, an enzyme whose primary substrate is ribitol, can slightly accelerate the rate of conversion of non-usable xylitol into a usable sugar, D-xylulose. \n \n Note that one enzyme being able to catalyze several related reactions is not unusual (despite what some anti-evolutionists would have us believe).\n \n \n 2) then one or more mutations in the gene(s) that control the expression of ribitol dehydrogenase cause it to begin being expressed continuously (not just in response to the presence of ribitol). This increased the cells' ability to utilize xylitol 20 fold\n \n 3) then a mutation caused the genes coding for the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase to be duplicated\n \n A common mechanism evolution employs is duplicate-and-diverge. After a gene duplication, having two copies of the gene allows one of them to accept mutations without harming fitness (the other one remains the same and continues to carry out its function). This way, the gene/protein can search through similar sequences and possibly find a new function, or, in this case, improve an existing function.\n \n \n 4) then one or more mutations in the genes coding for ribitol dehydrogenase increased it's ability to catalyze the xylitol-to-D-xylulose conversion \n \n 5) then one or more mutations linked expression of one of the ribitol dehydrogenase genes to the presence of xylitol\n \n \n Thus, a new, regulated metabolic pathway arising via a chain of beneficial mutations.",

   "Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a \"Young Earth\" than an \"Old Earth.\" Each discovery is a separate \"Limiting Factor\" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities. \n\n \n More Creationist BS.\n \n The Creationist arguments based on things like salinity of the oceans are bogus. They do not take into account all inputs and outputs. The magnetic field is decaying now, just as it has in past: the earth's magnetic field has reversed polarity many times over earth's history, and the magnetic field decays prior to these events.\n \n Each of the above you list are not independent scientific evidences for a young earth. What they are are instances of Creationist dishonesty. Their deceit in distorting of science to try to make it fit their preexisting and dogmatic religious position of a young earth. What YECs do is NOT science, as the following demonstrates.\n \n \n\"By creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of sudden, or fiat, creation. We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative process used by the Creator.\"\n (italics in original, Duane Gish, Evolution? The Fossils Say No!, 1978, p42) \n\n \n And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show.\n \n \n\"Thus it is obvious that one can logically reject the historicity of Genesis I - II only if he likewise rejects the rest of the Bible as well, and even the infallibility of Christ himself. Many modern-day religious liberals and even some supposedly conservative Christians have done exactly that. Most Christians, however, are unwilling to go this far. Some try to avoid the issue altogether, but this tactic almost inevitably is a prelude to compromise.\n \n The only Bible-honoring conclusion is, of course, that Genesis I - II is the actual historical truth, regardless of any scientific or chronologic problems thereby entailed.\"\n (emphasis added, Henry M. Morris, The Remarkable Birth of the Planet Earth, San Diego: Creation-Life Publishers, 1972, p82) \n\n \n \n Now, as for the evidence for an old universe/earth, let's look at a few.\n \n Physics\n \n 1) Radiometric dating.\n In some methods of radiometric dating, the starting number of the daughter nuclei is taken to be 0, and how many of the parent nuclei have decayed is based on the ratio of parent nuclei to daughter nuclei. For example, if the ratio of parent nuclei to daughter nuclei is 1:1 (i.e., equal numbers of both), then one half of the parent nuclei have decayed: and therefore, one half-life has elapsed. It also needs to be assumed that no parent or daughter nuclei entered or left the sample at any time between its formation and its being dated; if some did, then the ratio would be altered and the calculated date invalid. \n \n However, there are ways of eliminating these assumptions, such as the isochron method that uses internal checks. For example, a reported isochron-derived age has already passed a validation test because the method uses multiple data points, and checks that all points are collinear (for more details on how this validates the data, and eliminates the need to make a couple basic assumptions used in simpler radiometric dating methods, visit http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html#isochron). This built-in self-check helps ensure that even a single isochron-derived age is reliable. By using multiple parent-daughter isotope sets, each passing its own isochron internal validation, to date a single object, the consistency of the results establishes quite thoroughly the validity of the calculated age.\n \n Before moving on, let me dispel a common misconception many YECs have... radiocarbon dating is not used to measure the age of the Earth or the Universe. First, at just 5,730 years, the half-life of carbon-14 is far too short to calculate ages in the millions or billions of years. This particular radioisotope is good for measuring ages limited to several tens of thousands of years. Second, radiocarbon dating is used to date organic remains, not inorganic objects like sedimentary rocks. Rocks don't photosynthesize, nor do they consume plants or animals: rocks and other inanimate objects don't take in carbon-14 while \"alive\" and then cease doing so when they \"die\".\n \n How old does radiometric dating show the Earth and the Universe to be? Much older than 10 thousand years: about 4.5 billion years for the Earth, and therefore, at least that old for the Universe.\n \n For various reasons (subduction, erosion, volcanism, impact events, etc.), scientists cannot get their hands on the rocks that formed the Earth's original surface. But they do have access to rocks of great antiquity. Using a variety of different radioisotopes to calculate the age of one group of rocks gave consistent results of 3.7 billion year.\n \n \n\"The oldest rocks exposed on the surface of the earth are 3.5 to 3.8 billion years in age. Consider the various dating methods applied to the Greenland Amitsoq Gneiss: \n \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.70 +- 0.14 billion years\n Pb-Pb isochron 3.80 +- 0.12 billion years\n U-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.05 billion years\n Th-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.08 billion years\n Lu-Hf isochron 3.55 +- 0.22 billion years\n \n Note that all of the methods agree (3.68-3.70 is within all of their ranges of error). Isochron and discordia methods also have an internal check which identifies undateable samples. Similar formations which give similar ages can be found as well in North America, India, Russia, Australia, and Africa. This date therefore merits some confidence.\" \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/debate-age-of-earth.html) \n\n \n Again, it is important to stress that the dating methods represented in the above table have internal checks by their very design. This built-in self-check helps ensure that even a single isochron-derived age, such as the one based on Rb-Sr above, is reliable. Confidence in the correctness of that age is increased when a second isochron-derived age (based on a different parent-daughter set of isotopes, such as the Pb-Pb one above), which also has passed its own internal data-consistency check, is consistent with the first. And when a third isochron-derived age (using yet a third set of isotopes, such as the Lu-Hf isochron above), which also passed its own internal validation, is consistent with the other two isochron-derived ages, there is little doubt that confidence in the values is warranted.\n \n To get a better idea of how old the Earth itself (not just its' oldest exposed rocks) is, we need to switch to looking at other bodies in the solar system; ones that unlike the Earth are geologically and meteorologically dead. Two prime candidates are the moon and meteorites. Do the results of applying radiometric dating methods to them produce results consistent with the results obtained using the Earth's oldest exposed rocks? Yes. \n \n In order to determine the age of a class of meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites, several groups of scientists measured the age of CAIs (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions) found in them.\n \n \n\"In contrast to the relative age dating achieved with 26Al-26Mg radioactive decay, absolute formation ages of CAIs and chondrules may be measured with the 207Pb/206Pb chronometer. This lead-lead age is based on radioactive decay of two long-lived radioactive isotopes 235U and 238U. The uncertainties of 207Pb/206Pb dates can be as low as 0.5-1.5 My [million \n years], thus the 207Pb/206Pb chronometer may be suitable for resolving a potential 2-3 My age difference between CAIs and chondrules. \n \n C. All\u00e9gre, G. Manhes, and C. G\u00f6pel (Paris Geophysical Institute) report an impressively precise Pb-Pb age of 4566\u00b12 Ma for CAIs from the Allende CV chondrite.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Thus, the calcium-aluminum inclusions contained in the meteorites were radiometrically dated to 4.566 billion years (plus or minus 2 million years). And as science demands, the general results were repeatable.\n \n \n\"In our recently published paper in Science magazine, we report Pb-Pb isochron ages for two CAIs (E60 and E49) from the CV carbonaceous chondrite Efremovka and a similarly precise Pb isotopic age for chondrules from the CR carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 059. We also report the 26Al-26Mg systematics for the CAI E60. The Pb-Pb isochron age for the Acfer 059 chondrules is 4564.7\u00b10.6 Ma. The weighted average Pb-Pb isochron age for the Efremovka CAIs is 4567.2\u00b10.6 Ma.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Switching to a second candidate for undisturbed rocks, radiometric dating of the oldest lunar rocks produced ages remarkably consistent with the values for the CAIs from meteorites.\n \n \n\n Description Technique Age (billions of years)\n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.55 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.60 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.49 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.43 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.23 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.34 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.47 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.42 \n (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html)\n \n\n \n Sticking with the dating of moon samples for a minute, we can see the high degree of internal consistency produced by applying multiple dating methods to a single sample (note however, that it is not one of the oldest moon rocks). \n \n The following table is based on one at http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html (which itself lists as its reference for this data, \"Age of the Earth\", G. Brent Dalrymple, 1991). The data pertain to the dating of a single moon rock brought back by Apollo 11, sample 10072.\n \n \n\n Technique Age (billions of years)\n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.49 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.52 +- 0.04 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.57 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.56 +- 0.06 \n 40Ar/39Ar ilmenite 3.58 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar pyroxene 3.55 +- 0.05 \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.57 +- 0.05 \n Sm-Nd isochron 3.57 +- 0.03 \n \n\n \n Note the consistency across dating techniques (also keep in mind that this is a 'young' moon rock).\n \n So whether radiometrically dating (1) exposed rocks on Earth, (2) basaltic rocks retrieved from the moon, or (3) calcium-aluminum inclusions in meteorites, the results all point to an Earth that is about 4.5 billion years old. And not one of the age determinations is consistent, at all, with a Biblically young Earth. Further, not only were multiple objects dated, but multiple methods for calculating ages were used, and all results produced were found to be consistent.\n \n YECs do not accept such findings, of course; they attempt to dismiss them by challenging the validity of radiometric dating itself (note that, again, instead of supporting their own position, as real scientists do, the YECs attempt to attack the opposing position). \n \n While scientists openly admit that radiometric dating methods don't give absolutely exact ages, the relatively small error ranges are in no way compatible with the Creationists' claims. For example, the uranium-lead radiometric measurement of the Earth's oldest exposed rocks yielded an age of 3.65 billion years, plus or minus 50 million years; this spread in no way allows for the Earth to be just 10,000 years old. Thus these ranges in calculations (plus or minus a few million years) cannot be used by Creationists to reject the scientific conclusion, nor to support their own YEC position.\n \n Anomalous Radiometric Datings? \n According the Young Earth Creationist Henry Morris, attempts by scientists to date a single lava flow that was known to have occurred in 1801 in Hawaii failed. The researchers used the decay of potassium into argon but the resulting age was not a mere 100 or 200 years, but 160 million years! Worse, the upper limit was 3 billion years! As one might expect, YECs jumped all over these findings. Might these be legitimate Creationist concerns? No. \n \n First of all, a single anomalous dating of a recent Hawaiian lava flow, using a single radioisotope, would not invalidate the vast amount of consistent results everywhere else. For example, concerning the ages of the oldest exposed Earth rocks, in order to double check - no, triple check - no quadruple check - the results, a total of five different radioisotope decay sequences were employed for the same rock formations; and, all five methods produced results that were extremely consistent with one another. And of course, there is also the fact that radiometric dates were calculated using meteorites, and these too were consistent, both within themselves and with those based on the exposed Earth rocks. And, a slew of radiometric dates based on moon samples were also all internally consistent, as well as being consistent with the multiply checked dates based on meteorites and Earth rocks. The fact that so many different results are all internally consistent, as well as being consistent across the very different objects dated, tells us something to be sure: radiometric dating is reliable. Does a single anomalous result from a measurement of how old a Hawaiian lava flow is show that all of these multiply checked and consistent values are complete rubbish? Of course not. \n \n Second, the fact is that the results of interest were not anomalous: the Creationist just made them appear to be:\n \n \n\"Well, the first popular technique of creationists is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable. Henry Morris, in his 1974 book \"Scientific Creationism\" made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research? As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton - \"Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii\" published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the \"ages\" determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in \"air\" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this \"problem\" - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html) \n\n \n So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.\n \n \n Changing Decay Rates?\n Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument. \n \n First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?\n \n Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.\n \n \nA great many experiments have been done in attempts to change radioactive decay rates, but these experiments have invariably failed to produce any significant changes. It has been found, for example, that decay constants are the same at a temperature of 2000 degrees C or at a temperature of -186 degrees C and are the same in a vacuum or under a pressure of several thousand atmospheres. Measurements of decay rates under differing gravitational and magnetic fields also have yielded negative results.\n (Dalrymple, G. Brent. 1984. \"How Old is the Earth? A Reply to Scientific Creationism\" Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Pacific Division, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Volume 1, Part 3, edited by Frank Awbrey and William Thwaites, April 30, 1984, pages 66-131)\n \n\n \n \n The Centrality of 'Invalid Radiometric Dating' to Creationists\n Note the central importance of radiometric dating to the Creation vs. evolution debate. For example, when using a variety of independent genetic similarities between humans and chimpanzees to try to demonstrate descent from a common ancestor, some Creationists have been known to claim that such a conclusion can only be arrived at if one already assumes that something existed prior to God's creating man (and chimp) about 10,000 years go. To show there is reason to believe that such was the case, a scientist can point to fossils of Australopithecus anamensis, Australopithecus afarensis, Australopithecus africanus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and Homo ergaster as being potential ancestors of humans, all of which date back well beyond 10,000 years ago: some to millions of years. But, the Creationist can \"counter\" by claiming that those \"pre-humans\" didn't actually exist that long ago, because radiometric dating methods are completely worthless. Obviously, for those who know science, such an assertion is flawed, but, unfortunately, Creationists can still use that logic to persuade the general public.\n \n \n \n Geology\n \n The scientific theory of plate tectonics, and its associated millions of years of gradual change, nicely explains multiple geological phenomena. The following is an \"in a nutshell\" introduction to plate tectonics.\n \n The theory of plate tectonics holds that the Earth's crust is divided into a relatively small number of large, rigid, irregularly shaped slabs called tectonic plates that move about at rate that is imperceptible to the human senses (at least under normal conditions: earthquakes, for example, can surely be perceived). The tectonic plates \"float\" on top of the molten rock (not a free-flowing liquid like water, but rather an extremely viscous fluid, having more of a thick, taffy-like consistency) in the outer mantle, known as the asthenosphere. Slow moving convection cells occur in the mantle; the hottest materials at great depths rise and once they reach the top, spread out laterally under the plates and begin to cool; the cooler materials then descend to great depths where they are once again reheated to high temperature, and the cycling process starts over. The upper, laterally moving portion of such circulation currents probably helps produce movement of the plates.\n \n Continents are less dense than tectonic plates, and so, when present, \"ride on top of\" the plates. Hence, continents are carried, millimeter by millimeter, from place to place by the moving plates - a process known as continental drift. A single continent can span across multiple tectonic plates: Asia does, for example. But not all tectonic plates are associated with a continent: some have nothing but ocean above them. Because of their greater densities, tectonic plates can be subducted (explained below) whereas continents cannot.\n \n The points of contact between tectonic plates are called boundaries. Three types are possible: transforming, divergent, and convergent boundaries. At some boundaries two plates slide past each other laterally in opposite directions, grinding their edges and building up strain that eventually gets released as earthquakes. These are the transforming boundaries, a famous example of which is seen in California: the San Adreas fault. At divergent boundaries two plates move in opposite directions, away from one another. A prime example of a divergent boundary is the mid-Atlantic ridge. Here, new sea floor is continually formed by upwelling from below. The newly formed sea floor is carried, every so slowly, away from the ridge by plate motion. The overall process just described is known as seafloor spreading. Finally, at convergent boundaries two plates move towards one another. One possible outcome of the meeting is that one plate will be driven down into the mantle by the other one: the descending plate is said to be subducted. Subduction helps recycle the crust and therefore allows tectonic activity to continue. Another possibility when two plates converge is that the plates will remain \"on equal footing\" and their very slow movement into one another will force the crust to gradually fold, analogous to what happens if you push on a sheet of paper from both ends: it buckles. This process is important in mountain formation: a good example is the Himalayas, which were formed when two plates collided.\n \n \n 1) Formation of the Hawaii island chain.\n The Hawaii island chain was formed as a tectonic plate slowly glided in a northwestern direction over a hot spot, which remained stationary. The hot spot caused volcanic eruptions that slowly built up an island over it - as time went by, that first island eventually was carried past the hot spot and a new island began to form where the first once stood. This process recurred multiple times over millions of years, forming new island after new island. As each one was being built up, the older ones were gradually being worn down by erosion; the oldest islands would therefore have undergone the most erosion. \n \n Note that the most-active island currently is the \"Big Island\", which is - in agreement with the model - the last one in line (lies farthest to the southeast). Furthermore, the most active site on the Big Island is the southeast coast, again in line with the model. In addition, scientists can now see a new island being formed underwater. Where? To the southeast of the \"Big Island\". Finally, in general, the 'smaller' islands are those closer to the front of the chain (the northwestern ones). All these facts hang together very nicely and support the scientific explanation.\n \n What is the YEC explanation for the Hawaii island chain? Apparently, the cop out \"God just did it that way\". But why? Why would God purposefully create a chain of islands that so strongly shows that they were formed gradually over the course of many millions of years, if they weren't? Why didn't God just make one island there? Or why didn't God just make all the islands the same size and appear to be the same age? It seems God planted misleading evidence meant to make people draw the wrong conclusion. Deceit?\n \n \n 2) Continental drift has occurred over millions of years. \n The continents have shapes that would clearly fit together like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle if they could be brought back into contact with one another appropriately. The degree to which the pieces fit together is even greater if one looks at the continental shelves instead of the continents as they appear from air (after all, the contours of the continents' boundaries with the oceans as viewed from the air change as sea levels rise and fall). Furthermore, we know that continents - such as North America and Europe, and South America and Africa - are moving away from one another now, so clearly they were closer together in the past. Running the tape backwards for all continents indicates that they all were once merged together into one supercontinent called Pangaea. But how long ago was this? Scientists have accurately measured the rate at which the continents of North American and Europe are receding from each other today as sea floor spreading in the north Atlantic continues, and from that data and the nearly constant rate of seafloor spreading over time (see the section on Paleomagnetism below), conclude that it was roughly 180 million years ago that the continents were all joined.\n \n How do YECs respond to this evidence for an old Earth? Perhaps the same old lame copout, \"God just did it that way\". But why? Why would God create the continents to give the illusion that they were once all joined together? Is this just another in a long line of misleading evidences the Creationists' God intentionally planted to fool scientists into drawing a false conclusion: one that God would sentence them to eternal damnation for reaching?\n \n \n 3) Paleomagnetism - magnetic striping of the seafloor.\n About half way between North America and Europe, running from north to south for many thousands of miles, is the mid-Atlantic ridge. Here, new seafloor is slowly formed as magma gradually seeps up through the thousands-of-miles-long 'crack' in the ocean floor. Magma is a fluid, so tiny magnetic (iron-containing) particles suspended in it act like needles in a compass do - they are oriented in a north/south direction based on the positions of Earth's North and South magnetic poles. So when a given 'batch' of magma solidifies into new seafloor (because of its being rapidly cooled upon contact with the sea water), the tiny magnetic particles in it tend to be aligned uniformly in the same direction, according to the prevailing North/South orientation of the Earth's magnetic field. It was found that as one moved away from the mid-Atlantic ridge, whether traveling westward or eastward, the magnetic polarity of the particles changed regularly; there are repeating magnetic reversals on the sea floor generated by \"flip flops\" of the Earth's magnetic field over time. These magnetic seafloor stripes are numerous and indicate that many such reversals of the Earth's magnetic field have occurred. Yet, we have not observed even one full magnetic reversal in recorded history. This clearly suggests that the seafloor was formed over a vast span of time, far more than a mere 6 to 10 thousand years. Worse for the Creationists, field studies indicate that 'recent' magnetic reversals have occurred at an average rate of roughly of one every two hundred thousand years: so even just two magnetic reversals would completely destroy the young-earth model, and science has found as many as 400! \n \n How do YECs respond to this evidence for an old Earth? \"God just made it that way\"? If so, why? It would be just one more geological evidence God planted to trick scientists into believing a \"lie\"; and then He'd make them burn in hell for falling prey to his trap.\n \n Perhaps they might try to argue that the rate of seafloor spreading was vastly greater very early and then soon slowed to a snail's pace, where it has stayed ever since. But this attempt fails. Theoretical calculations based on an assumed nearly constant rate of seafloor spreading over the past four million years matches up nearly perfectly with measurements made of magnetic reversals on the seafloor.\n \n \n \n \nAn observed magnetic profile (blue) for the ocean floor across the East Pacific Rise is matched quite well by a calculated profile (red) based on the Earth's magnetic reversals for the past 4 million years and an assumed constant rate of movement of ocean floor away from a hypothetical \n spreading center (bottom). The remarkable similarity of these two profiles provided one of the clinching arguments in support of the seafloor spreading hypothesis. \n (http://www.usgs.gov/125/articles/plate_tectonics.html) \n\n \n The YECs must also somehow explain away the confirmed steady rate of seafloor spreading; the scientific model doesn't have to fight the evidence like the YEC model does. \n \n \n \n 4) Mountain formation - the Himalayas.\n As explained earlier, when two tectonic plates meet at a convergent boundary, one possible outcome is that they can buckle. The Himalayan mountains were formed in just this manner, from a 'collision' between two tectonic plates: the Indo-Australian and the Eurasian plates. Plate tectonics not only explains the formation of the Himalayas, but also their continued growth. The Indian plate is still pushing into the Eurasian plate, so the mountains continue to rise a few millimeters each year. The slowness of plate movements in general and of the current increase in height of the Himalayas indicate that they were formed slowly over spans of time approaching 50 million years: far greater than a mere 6 to 10 thousand years. Worse for the YECs is that they must compress the formation of the Himalayas into a much smaller window of time, considering that people have been living in Himalayas for some few thousand years without noting any instantaneous, mountain-chain wide, thousands-of-feet upward thrusts of land.\n \n I am not sure how YECs respond to this evidence for an old Earth. If it is once again the worthless copout, \"God just made it that way\", then why? \n \n \n \"Flood Geology\" not supported by geological observations\n Here is what one former prominent YEC had to say about how geology not only doesn't support \"the flood\" model, but actually counters it. Emphasis has been added.\n \n \n \"Why I left Young-earth Creationism \n by Glenn R. Morton \n Copyright 2000 by Glenn R. Morton. This may be freely distributed so long as no changes are made to the text and no charges are made to the reader. \n \n For years I struggled to understand how the geologic data I worked with everyday could be fit into a Biblical perspective. Being a physics major in college I had no geology courses. Thus, as a young Christian, when I was presented with the view that Christians must believe in a young-earth and global flood, I went along willingly. I knew there were problems but I thought I was going to solve them. When I graduated from college with a physics degree, physicists were unemployable since NASA had just laid a bunch of them off. I did graduate work in philosophy and then decided to leave school to support my growing family. Even after a year, physicists were still unemployable. After six months of looking, I finally found work as a geophysicist working for a seismic company. Within a year, I was processing seismic data for Atlantic Richfield. \n \n This was where I first became exposed to the problems geology presented to the idea of a global flood. I would see extremely thick (30,000 feet) sedimentary layers. One could follow these beds from the surface down to those depths where they were covered by vast thicknesses of sediment. I would see buried mountains which had experienced thousands of feet of erosion, which required time. Yet the sediments in those mountains had to have been deposited by the flood, if it was true. I would see faults that were active early but not late and faults that were active late but not early. I would see karsts and sinkholes (limestone erosion) which occurred during the middle of the sedimentary column (supposedly during the middle of the flood) yet the flood waters would have been saturated in limestone and incapable of dissolving lime. It became clear that more time was needed than the global flood would allow. (See http://www.seg.org/publications/geoarchive/1996/sep-oct/geo6105r1336.pdf for an article showing an example of a deeply buried karst. For a better but bigger (3.4 meg) version of that paper see http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/97/97ng/ng97_pdf/NG4-1.pdf\n \n One also finds erosional canyons buried in the earth. These canyons would require time to excavate, just like the time it takes to erode the Grand Canyon. This picture was downloaded from a site which is now gone from the web. It was \n http://ic.ucsc.edu/~casey/eart168/3DInterpretation/Deltain3d1.gif\n \n I worked hard over the next few years to solve these problems. I published 20+ items in the Creation Research Society Quarterly. I would listen to ICR, have discussions with people like Slusher, Gish, Austin, Barnes and also discuss things with some of their graduates that I had hired. \n \n In order to get closer to the data and know it better, with the hope of finding a solution, I changed subdivisions of my work in 1980. I left seismic processing and went into seismic interpretation where I would have to deal with more geologic data. My horror at what I was seeing only increased. There was a major problem; the data I was seeing at work, was not agreeing with what I had been taught as a Christian. Doubts about what I was writing and teaching began to grow. Unfortunately, my fellow young earth creationists were not willing to listen to the problems. No one could give me a model which allowed me to unite into one cloth what I believed on Sunday and what I was forced to believe by the data Monday through Friday. I was living the life of a double-minded man--believing two things. \n By 1986, the growing doubts about the ability of the widely accepted creationist viewpoints to explain the geologic data led to a nearly 10 year withdrawal from publication. My last young-earth paper was entitled Geologic Challenges to a Young-earth, which I presented as the first \n paper in the First International Conference on Creationism. It was not well received. Young-earth creationists don't like being told they are wrong. The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data! ...\" (http://home.entouch.net/dmd/gstory.htm) \n\n \n \n \n Astronomy\n \n 1) Why do astronomers detect light from stars billions of light years away?\n When astronomers \"look\" out into the night sky with their telescopes, they aren't just looking out across vast distances of space: they are also looking back in time. We must remember that although light - technically, all electromagnetic radiation - is the 'fastest thing' in the Universe, its speed is still finite: it still takes time for light to travel from one place to another. Since it is light from distant stars that strikes our retina or our CCDs (charge coupled devices) to create an image of the galaxy, and that light took some time to travel the intervening distance, the image formed here is actually out of date: the light we are just now receiving and perceiving left the distant stars some time ago, so we see the emitting object as it was in past (that is, as it was when the photons were actually emitted). The farther away the galaxy is, the longer it took the stars' light to reach us so the farther back in time we see when observing it.\n \n Because astronomers usually deal with such enormous distances they don't use Earthly measures such as miles or kilometers. Instead, they define astronomical distance in terms of light-travel time. A light year is the distance light travels (through the vacuum of space) in one year. Astronomers say that stars in a given galaxy are, say, 300 million light years distant. Such a distance also tells us something about time: since the stars are 300 million light years distant, and light travels at a rate of 1 light year per year, then it has taken 300 million years for light from those stars to travel to Earth. Hence, astronomers would be seeing 300 million years into the past when observing that galaxy.\n \n According to the Big Bang theory, our Universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. As their telescopes improved over the years, astronomers have been able to peer farther and farther back in time. Many observations have now been made of regions of space that are over 10 billion light years distant. Therefore, it has taken the light from those regions more than 10 billion years to reach us. But Young-Earth Creationists claim the Universe is only 6 to 10 thousand years old. If that were true, then how could astronomers be seeing objects that are 10 billion light years distant? How could light travel 10 billion light years in only 10 thousand years? YECs often use the same general logic as they do for other phenomena that contradict their religious views: \"God just did it that way\". Here, that means He created the Universe mature, with the appearance of age.\n \n Since science says that 6,000 years ago there were photons from the stars in \"galaxy X\", which is 10 billion light years away, headed towards Earth, YECs just claim that when God created that distant galaxy 6,000 years ago He also placed some of the stars' photons already en route to the Earth at various distances, making it falsely appear as though a continuous stream of photons has been leaving the stars for the past 10 billion years. In other words, for each one of the billions of stars in \"galaxy X\", God supposedly, just 6 or 10 thousand years ago, placed some divinely created photons at a distance of 9.999999999999 billion light years away from Earth, another batch of divinely created photons forming this same continuous stream at 9.999999999998 billion light years distant, and few more divinely created photons forming this same continuous stream 9.999999999997 billion light years distant, and so on down the line, all the way to the Earth's surface. So we are now supposedly seeing photons that were created just 6 thousand years ago (divinely created, not by the star) and placed perfectly to create the illusion that the stars in \"galaxy X\" have been emitting a continuous stream of photons going back in time 10 billion years. Actually, God's deceit would require more. For every one of the tens of billions of galaxies that are more than 10,000 light years distant, God would have to have fabricated (faked) a continuous stream of divinely created photons ending at the Earth's surface. Actually, for every star that God fabricated a continuous en route photon stream for, He would actually have to have created a billion or a trillion such individual streams so that astronomers all over the Earth would see the same false evidence, for each star, no matter from where they made their observations. Why would God go to all of this trouble of planting an astronomical amount of misleading photons all across the Universe, from all directions, making it falsely appear that the stars and galaxies that are billions of light years distant are billions of years old, when they're supposedly only 6 to 10 thousand years old? Deceit?\n \n Let's see if we can easily come up with a satisfactory explanation - besides deceit - that God would have done so. \n \n Could it be so that plants on Earth could photosynthesize? No, because the Sun is all plants need. They don't require any stars from outside our own solar system, let alone from outside our own galaxy, let alone from outside our own galaxy cluster.\n \n Could it be so that ancient travelers, like Moses, could navigate? No. First, stars and galaxies billions of light years distant are not even visible with the naked eye, so they could not possibly be used for navigation. Second, there are many stars within a 10,000-light-year radius from Earth - which would be visible to the naked eye - that could serve for navigation. Just to give an idea of how close some of the stars in a few main constellations are...\n \n Big Dipper: Those stars listed on a diagram are 68, 78, 88, 105, and 210 light-years distant.\n (http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99237.htm) \n \n Ursa Major: Those stars listed are 50, 65, 70, 80, 90, and 210 light-years distant.\n (http://www.geocities.com/~smalltelescope/constellations/ursamajor/ursamaj2.html)\n \n Draco: Those stars listed are 65, 93, 110, 215, and 400 light-years distant.\n (http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/draco.html)\n \n Draco: Those stars listed are 88, 99, 110, 188, 289, 322, 397, 1186, and 1500 - 3500 light-years distant.\n (http://www.kyes-world.com/DracoskyPRINTABLE.htm)\n \n Ursa Minor: Those stars listed are 110, 240, and 350 light-years distant.\n (http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/ursa_minor.html)\n \n Orion: Those stars listed are 300, 650, 800 (a total of 2 different stars), 1600, and 2000 light-years distant.\n (http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/orion.html)\n \n So there appears to be no easily ascertained satisfactory explanation for why God would intentionally deceive the world by planting trillions upon trillions of photons, throughout the entire known Universe, in exactly the arrangement needed, to mislead scientists across the globe into believing that stars billions of light years away are billions of years old. \n \n The YEC explanation is far more involved and complex, and requires far more and far greater assumptions, than does the straightforward scientific explanation. So both rational thought and Ockham's razor would have us jettison the religious explanation and accept the scientific one.\n \n \n \n 2) Why have astronomers detected quasars?\n The word quasar comes from \"quasi stellar radio source\" and refers to small (roughly solar-system size) but extremely energetic sources of energy (with outputs of energy as much as many large galaxies). The long-held consensus has been that all quasars lie many billions of light years distant from Earth. A recent interpretation of some new evidence suggests, however, that some quasars may be \"near\". But even the \"near\" interpretation (which is still rejected by many astronomers because it has yet to satisfactorily explain how the large redshifts would occur if the objects were so close) would put quasars millions of light years distant from us: some quasars potentially being \"near\" does not eliminate the light-travel-time problem for YECs. In fact, because a quasar in our own galaxy would be easily visible with the naked eye - assuming we could even live with one that nearby - and yet we don't see any, logic alone tells us that no quasar can exist within our own galaxy: and our Milky Way galaxy has a diameter of between 80 to 100 thousand light years, so we know quasars must be far more distant than that. The key is that all quasars occur at vast distances from the Earth, whether that distance is billions or \"mere\" millions of light years. Then how can we have received their light if the universe is only 6 to 10 thousand years old? This may sound like the same argument presented above that related to stars, but there is a key difference. Unlike stars, there are no quasars whatsoever within a 10 thousand light year sphere centered around the Earth. Thus, in His faking the appearance of age, God would have planted evidences that point to the existence of celestial objects that not only absolutely defy a 10 thousand year old universe but that also would have been completely unknown to us in the absence of His fabricated clues designed to trick us. It's not a matter of God creating stars close enough for us to see and also creating some far too distant, but of His creating something outside of our possible detection, then faking evidence to allow us to detect it - the very thing that makes the universe appear far older than 10 thousand years! This would take deceit to a whole new level.\n \n Quasars fit in nicely with the Big Bang and standard cosmological models that allow for billions of years, but not in the YEC model\n \n \n \n 3) Why is there a 2.73 kelvin cosmic microwave background radiation?\n Penzias and Wilson are credited with discovering the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). But they weren't looking for it, and, they didn't know what they had found when they did detect it. Completely independently, a group of physicists had calculated that there should be leftover radiation from the Big Bang and because of the vast length of time since its release, the radiation should be shifted down into the microwave region of the spectrum. This was a prediction based on the Big Bang theory and was made before any evidence had shown that the CMBR existed. Not until Penzias and Wilson happened to hear of the physicists' calculations did they realize what they had already found. So the prediction made from Big Bang theory turned out to very nicely match - within just a couple of \"degrees\" kelvin - what was found independently. The scientific explanation, with its old Universe, hangs together quite well.\n \n What's the Young-Earth Creationist's explanation for the cosmic microwave background radiation? Well, it's there: they can't deny that. But it must have been put there, purposely, by God just 6 or 10 thousand years ago. \n \n First, why did God put any microwave background radiation in space, in agreement with the Big Bang theory? It seems to serve no purpose, except to help confirm a very old universe.\n \n Second, why did God distribute the CMBR so evenly throughout space, in agreement with the Big Bang theory? He could have distributed it any way He pleased: why make it conform to a human theory, that didn't even exist yet?\n \n Third, why did God make the CMBR such that it would be about 3 kelvins when measured, in good agreement with the Big Bang theory? Why didn't He make it 10 kelvins, or 100 kelvins, or 1,000 kelvins, or 1,000,000 kelvins? Why did He choose just the right number to match the Big Bang theory's prediction?\n \n Why did God plant the CMBR evidence in such a manner - with three different properties that all point to the universe being over many billions of years old - as to deceive scientists? So that He could condemn them to eternal damnation for falling prey to His trap?\n \n Summary\n These are a few examples of evidence that support an old Earth, and how YECs might, or do, attempt to dodge them. As was seen in several examples, in trying to understand God's actions according to a Young Earth Creationist's time line, over and over God is seen to plant misleading information, fooling scientists into believing that the Earth and Universe (which He allegedly created just 6 to 10 thousand years ago) are billions of years old. Young-Earth Creationists basically turn their own God into the Great Deceiver, without realizing it.",

I'd ask you to explain, but you obviously can't: you simply copied and pasted the material and don't understand any of it.\n \n Since the quote doesn't tell us what retrograde motion is allegedly problematic, I'll quickly mention what was probably the main \"mystery\" of retrograde motion, which dealt with planets moving across the sky in one direction, but then occasionally stopping and backtracking for a bit of time, then resuming their normal forward direction. But this was explained hundreds of years ago when the Earth was moved out from being the center of the universe.\n \n \nGod_is_real: Furthermore, the Big Bang does not address the primary question at hand, \"where did everything come from?\"\n\n \n Science has in fact come up with hypotheses concerning that question. One is that our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time! Let me explain just a bit.\n \n Some have hypothesized that the sums of the positive and negative energies in our universe balance out: they negate each other so that the total energy is 0. If so, then our universe could pop into existence without violating the law of conservation of energy. And if all other conserved quantities - like electric charge - also net out to 0 in our universe, then our universe popping into existence would not violate any of those conservation laws either. That's fine: everything could total 0 so no conservation laws would be violated\" but how could something just pop into existence? Just as we know happens all the time today: quantum fluctuations. In this scenario, there is a preexisting superspace in which quantum fluctuations occur, which, from time to time, spawn off new universes. So our universe would just be the result of a quantum fluctuation, which produced a microscopic universe with 0 net energy and charge, that then inflated for a brief period, then continued to expand and develop over time.\n \n I'm not saying that above is fact and we are all forced to accept it as such, but it does show that cosmologists have attempted to answer this riddle ... a riddle that not even religion can satisfactorily answer.\n \n \nGod_is_real: Did nothing explode?\n\n \n The Big Bang was not an explosion: it was an expansion of spacetime itself.\n \n \nGod_is_real: How did this explosion cause order, while every explosion observed in recorded history causes disorder and disarray? \n\n \n Astronomers see the affects of gravity creating order from disorder all the time, in star formation.",

Jesus was telling a parable. You can't take the tail end of a story and say that Jesus was saying to have them killed in front of Him.\n \n \n[Jesus said:] \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters - yes, even his own life - he cannot be my disciple.\" (Luke 14:26)\n \n\n \n And for the other quote in Luke, in other translations, it says despise. Despise:To regard as unworthy of one's interest or concern. And that has to be what Jesus meant because John 13:34 says, \"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\" In other words, you have to love God more than you love your family.\n \n Here's how the message translation puts it (correctly): Luke 14:26 \"Anyone who comes to me but refuses to let go of father, mother, spouse, children, brothers, sisters - yes, even one's own self! - can't be my disciple.\" \n \n Mark 12:28, \"One of the teachers of the Law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked Him, 'Of all the commandments, which is the most important?' 'The most important one,' answered Jesus, 'is this: hear, oh, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.'\"\n \n \n[Jesus said,] \"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.

In the tradition of Judaism, the afterlife is resurrection and we are not fundamentally immortal.\n \n 1Cr 15:42-54\n \n So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, \"The first man Adam became a living being\"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual which is first but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven. I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: \"Death is swallowed up in victory.\"",

   "2. Evolutionists are always making assumptions. They assumed that the tonsils and the appendix were remnants of previous species from which humans had evolved and were totally useless. They were wrong about that.\n\n \n Others have eloquently answered most of your points, but I'd like to add a couple of observations.\n \n Biologists don't regard tonsils as vestigial structures. They are perfectly functional masses of lymphoid tissue, strategically located to sample and respond to antigens in inhaled air. The appendix is a different matter. Creationists are fond of pointing out that it, too, contains lymphoid tissue, and is therefore not non-functional. What they overlook is that the entire intestine has patches of lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches) all the way along its wall, and the idea that there had to be a specially created diverticulum at the caecum just to pack in a bit more is absurd.\n Consider an analogy. Some industrial archaeologists are investigating the history of a railway. Most of the railway still functions to carry freight, and at intervals alongside it there are sheds for storing tools. The archaeologists find one small branch from the main line that terminates after a few metres: it, too, has a toolshed alongside it. Evolutionary explanation: the branch once led somewhere and had a function, but became disused: we now see a remnant of a once functional track, though the toolshed can still be used. Creationist explanation: the branch line was created just as we see it, in order to build the toolshed alongside it. Which would you believe?\n \n \n6. Chicken or Egg Principle\n Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This question has plagued philosophers for a long time.\n\n \n Not many philosophers are plagued by it now, unless they're biologically illiterate. Reproduction via specialised sex cells was established early in the history of eukaryotic life. When the first vertebrates emerged, the adult-gametes-zygote-embryo-adult life cycle was already in place, and the whole package constitutes the animal as an entity in time. The chicken-egg question is meaningless.",

   "Hey PoohBear, have you heard the big news in evolution this week? Two articles were published in the journal Nature this week about the finding of several fossilized examples of a new \"fishapod\": a clear intermediate between fish and tetrapods. Some quotes from general sources:\n \n \nScientists have discovered fossils of a 375-million-year-old fish, a large scaly creature not seen before, that they say is a long-sought missing link in the evolution of some fishes from water to a life walking on four limbs on land. \n \n ...\n \n The skeletons have the fins, scales, and other attributes of a giant fish, four to nine feet long. But on closer examination. the scientists found telling anatomical traits of a transitional creature, a fish that is still a fish but has changes that anticipate the emergence of land animals - and is thus a predecessor of amphibians, reptiles and dinosaurs, mammals, and eventually humans.\n \n In the fishes' forward fins, the scientists found evidence of limbs in the making. There are the beginnings of digits, proto-wrists, elbows, and shoulders. The fish also had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's, a neck, ribs, and other parts that were similar to four-legged land animals knows as tetrapods.\n (Fossil Called a Missing Link from Sea to Land Animals, John Noble Wilford, Apr 06 2006, The New York Times)\n \n\n \n \n[The 'fishapod'] had the scales, teeth, and gills of a fish, but also a big, curved rib cage that suggests the creature had lungs as well. The ribs interlock, moreover, unlike a fish's, implying they were able to bear fishapod's weight - an unnecessary trait in a fish. It had a neck - most unfishlike. And, most surprising of all, its pectoral fins included bones that look like nothing less than a primitive wrist and fingers.\n (A Fish with Fingers?, Michael Lemonick, Time: Science and Health, Apr 05 2006)\n \n\n \n \nEspecially significant is the anatomy of Tiktaalik's [the 'fishapod'] pectoral fin, which contains the makings of a proper tetrapod arm. Thanks to the spectacular three-dimensional preservation of the bones - many of which were found still articulated - and the discovery of multiple specimens, the researchers were able to estimate the range of motion of the fin bones. \"Most of the major joints of the fin are functional in this fish,\" Shubin notes. \"The shoulder, elbow, and even parts of the wrist are already there and working in ways similar to the earliest land-living animals.\" \n (Newfound Fossil is Transitional between Fish and Landlubbers, Apr 06 2006, Scientific American (www.scientificamerican.com))\n \n",

The skull is believed to be between 250,000 and 500,000 years old.\n \"[This skull] shows the continuity of the evolutionary record, so in that sense it is a link [between Homo erectus and modern humans],\" said Scott Simpson, a paleontologist from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio; KAZINFORM cites Stefan Lovgren for National Geographic News.\n \n Rare Find\n \n Researchers discovered the skull five weeks ago at Gawis in Ethiopia's northeastern Afar region (map of Ethiopia). The area is rich in fossil and archaeological deposits ranging from 10,000 years to 5.6 million years in age. \n \n",

Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n \n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time.\n \n http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis.html",

Like all idioms, its meaning is nonliteral but clearly understood by native speakers. The phrase \"evening and morning\" can, like yom, denote a long and indefinite period. The Old Testament itself unambiguously uses the \"evening and morning\" phrase in just such a way. In Daniel 8 we read the account of Daniel's ram and goat vision and the interpretation given by Gabriel. The vision covers many years; some commentators believe the time has not yet been completed. Daniel 8:26 says, \"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that have been given to you is true, but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future\" (RSV). In Hebrew manuscripts, \"the evenings and mornings,\" is not in the plural but in the singular, identical to the expression we find in Genesis 1. Translated literally, the verse would red, \"And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been given you\" Here we have a clear indication from scriptural usage that this phrase does not demand a 24-hour-day interpretation and can refer to an indefinite epoch.\n One might raise the objection that during the many years between the writing of Genesis and the writing of Daniel, the Hebrew usage could have changed, making the extrapolation from Daniel back to Genesis questionable. My response to such a challenge would be to underscore the stability of the ancient languages (perhaps due to the lack of general literacy and the rigorous professional training of those who served as scribes.) I see no way to escape this example of flexibility usage.\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_helweg/eve-morn.html",
