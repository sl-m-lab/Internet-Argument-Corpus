   "I personally think it's very low to say that \"God supports Bush\" or for Bush to claim that \"I attacked Al Quadea because God told me to and then he told me to attack Iraq, so I did\". And I have heard many people say that if there was any ballot tampering or cheating by Republicans, then it was God's will and we shouldn't interfear. My question is, if these people are so confident that God will help Bush win the election, why don't they vote for Kerry? Would a little thing such as Kerry getting more votes stop God from fixing it? So then it would really be up to God, if he supports Bush he would cheat and get him to win, if he supports Kerry, doesn't care, or doesn't exist, then Kerry would win. Doesn't this seem like a plausible solution for all those Southern God-fearing Republican Christians?",
