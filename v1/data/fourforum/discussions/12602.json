   "The left's fear of firearms\n Phil Elmore\n \n With a socialist and would-be totalitarian in the White House and a Democrat majority in Congress, the forces of popular culture are marshaling, eager to accomplish several long-term socio-political goals that now appear to be within their reach. Among these goals are the restriction and elimination of technology that makes it easier for those Americans who dissent to do so. This includes the silencing of \"right-wing talk radio\" by infringing on free speech through the establishment of the euphemistically named \"fairness doctrine,\" not to mention various schemes to restrict, monitor, or otherwise control the Internet (up to and including shutting it down completely at times).\n \n It is not the technology of free speech, however, that concerns American leftists most. No, liberals reserve for their staunchest contempt the ownership of firearms by American citizens. They pour their derision and their outrage on the right to self-defense guaranteed you by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. They howl in disbelief when the Supreme Court holds that this right, like the other rights in the Bill of Rights, is an individual one.\n \n Most importantly, leftists fight their insidious battle to erode your constitutionally protected rights by poisoning popular culture against you, shifting the culture incrementally so that support for civil rights gradually dies. In the case of firearms technology, the liberals seek to redefine this technology as unknowable, unmanageable and inherently unsafe. They wish to create in the minds of our citizens the attitude and the presumption that firearms technology is simply too darkly magical, too deadly, for the average citizen, for mere mortals, to possess or to wield. In this way, they create ever-greater support for their extra-constitutional attempts to apply \"reasonable gun control\" &#8211; leftist code for gradual firearms registration and confiscation.\n \n Legendary firearms instructor and pundit Jeff Cooper put it best. \"In my opinion,\" he said, \"neither money nor greed ... is the root of all evil. The root of all evil is envy. The non-coper hates the coper, and thus the non-shooter hates the shooter. I see no other explanation for the pointless and irrational activism of the gun grabbers on the political scene. They know that their machinations can have no effect upon crime. Guns have no effect upon crime, but they do make all men equal, as the saying goes. This puts the coper on top, and infuriates the non-coper.\" This is the root of all liberal hatred for firearms. Liberals despise the idea that this technology enables the individual to stand up for and defend himself and his family. They loathe the notion that with a gun, a man is far stronger than a man without &#8211; and thus a much larger threat, a much louder dissenting voice, where their invasive, big-government, totalitarian, nanny-state power grabs are concerned. \n \n Also significantly, the average gun-hating liberal lives his life in ignorance. Leftist gun-grabbers possess almost no knowledge concerning the realities of the technology they so hate and fear. Their ideas about guns are informed almost completely by myth, misinformation and oft-repeated but falsified or flawed \"studies\" that purport to \"prove\" their worldview. They repeat, breathlessly and with wide-eyed credulity, the propaganda fed them by alarmist activist groups like the Violence Policy Center and Sarah Brady's renamed Center to Prevent Gun Violence (previously much more aptly named for Brady's desire to ban handguns). When not lying outright, gun-grabbers are furthering the myths their ilk have created and spread about the greatly terrible and unknowable technology of firearms. The goal is to convince you &#8211; or, more accurately and importantly, your children &#8211; that a private citizen simply shouldn't own a firearm because it is too dangerous and of no real benefit. The war for your children's hearts and minds is actively being waged in our media.\n \n ABC, for example, produced the \"20/20\" piece \"If I Only Had a Gun,\" the purpose of which is to establish, quite falsely, that firearms are next to useless for self-defense and that having a gun, well, simply won't help you if someone else has a gun. Not to be outdone, apoplectic reporters across the country have been covering the boom in gun sales, beside themselves that there exist in this country Americans who actually believe they have a right to self-defense. Why, guns kill people, the \"journalists\" tell us. If you leave firearms lying around in a pile on the coffee table, passing 6-year-old children will see the guns and want to play with them ... and nothing will stop them! The horror! \n \n A working knowledge of firearms technology and its application quickly dispels, utterly and with finality, all of this myth and misinformation. I've had the privilege of extensive force-on-force firearms training. It's hard work, but not impossibly so. Civilian shooters, in fact, are actually much more extensively trained than are members of law enforcement, on average, even though cops often are held up by liberals as the only people with the training and discipline required to wield a gun. The typical police officer is not a \"gun person\" and tends to treat that weapon like a cell phone &#8211; a tool carried on the job, for which he or she has no special affection. Guns in the hands of citizens, meanwhile, benefit everyone. There isn't a single liberal anti-gun talking point that hasn't been refuted.\n \n Guns are an old, relatively simple technology. One of the most popular handguns on the market was designed almost a hundred years ago. What has not changed in the last century &#8211; or the last two &#8211; is that we need these \"liberty teeth\" now more than ever. We need the technology of firearms because it secures freedom and defends your family. No matter how much Obama and his cronies try to convince you otherwise, firearms technology is not unknowable, it is not unsafe, and it is not unmanageable by private citizens. Firearms technology and the Second Amendment are the linchpin holding our Constitution together. If we remove either out of fear or ignorance, everything falls apart.\n \n http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=95770\n \n ",

Here's the article:\n Report: Pedophilia more common among 'gays'\n Research purports to reveal 'dark side' of homosexual culture\n Posted: April 29, 2002\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n By Jon Dougherty\n \u00a9 2009 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n Child molestation and pedophilia occur far more commonly among homosexuals than among heterosexuals on a per capita basis, according to a new study.\n \n \"Overwhelming evidence supports the belief that homosexuality is a sexual deviancy often accompanied by disorders that have dire consequences for our culture,\" wrote Steve Baldwin in, \"Child Molestation and the Homosexual Movement,\" soon to be published by the Regent University Law Review.\n \n Baldwin is the executive director of the Council for National Policy in Washington, D.C.\n \n \"It is difficult to convey the dark side of the homosexual culture without appearing harsh,\" wrote Baldwin. \"However, it is time to acknowledge that homosexual behavior threatens the foundation of Western civilization - the nuclear family.\"\n \n Though the homosexual community and much of the media scoff at such accusations, Baldwin - who chaired the California Assembly's Education committee, where he fought against support for the homosexual agenda in the state's public schools - says in his report that homosexual activists' \"efforts to target children both for their own sexual pleasure and to enlarge the homosexual movement\" constitute an \"unmistakable\" attack on \"the family unit.\"\n \n Baldwin's research is substantiated in a recently completed body of work written by Dr. Judith Reisman, president of the Institute for Media Education and author of numerous authoritative books debunking sexual myths, including \"Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences.\"\n \n In her thesis - also written for the Regent University Law Review - Reisman cited psychologist Eugene Abel, whose research found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. ...\"\n \n Abel also found that non-incarcerated \"child molesters admitted from 23.4 to 281.7 acts per offender ... whose targets were males.\"\n \n \"The rate of homosexual versus heterosexual child sexual abuse is staggering,\" said Reisman, who was the principal investigator for an $800,000 Justice Department grant studying child pornography and violence. \"Abel's data of 150.2 boys abused per male homosexual offender finds no equal (yet) in heterosexual violations of 19.8 girls.\"\n \n Jay Heavener, spokesman for PFLAG - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, counters that federal crime data refute claims that homosexuals molest children at higher rates than heterosexuals.\n \n \"According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), this claim is false,\" he told WND by e-mail. \"The gay and lesbian community calls into question any dubious research which flies in the face of our own experience.\"\n \n And Gary Schoener, a clinical psychologist who has been diagnosing and treating clergy abuse for 28 years, told Salon.com, \"There are far more heterosexual cases than homosexual.\"\n \n In terms of sheer numbers, that may be true. But in terms of numbers of children abused per offender, homosexuals abuse with far greater frequency; and boys, research shows, are the much-preferred target.\n \n Baldwin says evidence he examined disproves the assertion that child molestation is more prevalent among heterosexuals. Both he and Reisman found that media coverage of adult homosexual abuse of minors is also slanted.\n \n \"The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) recently boasted that although homosexuals are less than two percent of the population, three-fourths of the people who decide the content of the front page of the New York Times are homosexual,\" Reisman wrote.\n \n That one fact is especially noteworthy, experts point out, given the recent child sex scandals taking place within the American Catholic church.\n \n A survey by WorldNetDaily of recent news reports found that rarely did the media describe priestly sexual abuse as \"homosexual\" or \"gay\" activity - even though the worst incidents involved male-to-male contact, and a spate of investigative reports has revealed that the Vatican is concerned about an upsurge of homosexuals in seminary schools throughout the world.\n \n Gay press promotes sex with children\n \n Baldwin says his research not only \"confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,\" but it found that \"the mainstream homosexual culture\" even \"commonly promotes sex with children.\"\n \n \"The editorial board of the leading pedophile academic journal, Paidika, is dominated by prominent homosexual scholars such as San Francisco State University professor John DeCecco, who happens to edit the Journal of Homosexuality,\" Baldwin wrote.\n \n During his research, he also found:\n \n The Journal of Homosexuality recently published a special double-issue entitled, \"Male Intergenerational Intimacy,\" containing many articles portraying sex between men and minor boys as loving relationships. One article said parents should look upon the pedophile who loves their son \"not as a rival or competitor, not as a theft of their property, but as a partner in the boy's upbringing, someone to be welcomed into their home.\"\n In 1995 the homosexual magazine \"Guide\" said, \"We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual\" and \"deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. ...\" The article went on to say: \"Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children's sexuality ... we must do it for the children's sake.\"\n Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, \"Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist\": \"In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.\"\n In a study of advertisements in the influential homosexual newspaper, The Advocate, Reisman found ads for a \"Penetrable Boy Doll ... available in three provocative positions. She also found that the number of erotic boy images in each issue of The Advocate averaged 14.\n Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n Homosexuality 'youth-oriented'?\n \n \"Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.\"\n \n \"Some admit to focus on teenage boys,\" he said, \"some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.\"\n \n A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin's report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be \"gay.\" According to the study, \"Archives of Sexual Behavior,\" some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.\n \n When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.\n \n \"For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement's leaders liars,\" he said. \"Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.\"\n \n \"I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis - child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement - is a valid thesis,\" Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.\n \n Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.\n \n \"How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there's a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?\" writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH - the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality - a group that says it exists to \"provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.\"\n \n The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is \"a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,\" Baldwin said in his report.\n \n The group is often endorsed by \"many of the homosexual movement's most prominent leaders,\" he said.\n \n Advocacy moving to schools\n \n Promotion of the \"gay and lesbian lifestyle\" is increasing in the nation's public schools.\n \n A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to \"educate\" teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:\n \n GLSEN - the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network - bills itself as \"the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others\" specifically formed to end \"discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored \"training for teachers.\"\n A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to \"give voice\" recently to \"gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students\" at California schools;\n PFLAG has created a national campaign called, \"From Our House to the Schoolhouse,\" distributing to school officials - among other materials - a booklet entitled, \"Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, & School Personnel. [Editor's note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.]\n Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.\n \n \"What ... does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,\" he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: \"Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.\"\n \n The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 \"Psychological Reports\" article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.\n \n \"But this number is low,\" Baldwin says, \"due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.\"\n Now, consider that the vast majority of child molestation cases are against boys not girls and add to that the number of straight males to homosexual males which puts homosexuals at only 2% of the population in this article, (I thought it was more like 4%) and you have an extreme per capita imbalance in favor of homosexual molestation over heterosexuals. And I think this article proves that very effectively while giving the opposition side a hearing in explaining their side as reflected in the bolded.",

This column is part of a regular series that I write for WorldNetDaily called Technocracy  which appears every Thursday in the Commentary section.\n \n A lot of things have been written about me on the Internet; once in a while some of them are even true. I learned very quickly that when you state opinions with convinction and passion and you fight for a right-thinking worldview, you will make many enemies. Such people don't let little things like \"the truth\" or \"reality\" get in the way of their attacks, and that's fine, because these are easily dismissed and/or refuted.\n\n \n Hi phil, welcome to the forum. I'm pleased that you found this site, and the leftists condemning your opinion simply because they don't like WND. I think the content of its articles hits too close to home for their comfort so they just condemn it as biased, while never recognizing how biased the sources they rely on are.\n \n If you noticed Galileo's posted WND article which he posted to prove how biased it is. I showed in clear terms how it offers both sides of the issue while defending its perspective. Then I was so impressed with the content of the article that I reposted it here: http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12605-debate-about-homosexualitys-link-child-molestation.html for debate. Check it out and if you have any evidentiary sources which add to its content, or just an opinion, feel free to contribute. The militant homosexuals around here seem to be avoiding it so far. emoticon_rolleyes",

Let us consider any type of mass attack by one or more shooters on a larger group of peacefully assembled citizens. In any and every case we have read about, and seen how one armed whack job has converged on a large group of unarmed citizens and fired at will until they were either out of ammo, killed by the police, or trapped in which case they commit suicide.\n \n Can't you see that if we had a culture where carrying concealed weapons by at least 1 out of 3 citizens, that these out of control and mentally deranged whack jobs with a personal and irrational grudge against society for whatever reason, would be put down in short order by any one of the armed citizens before leaving a mass of dead defenseless human beings in their wake? \n \n That we allow gun ownership, but discourage gun owners to remain armed in the real world in their daily lives is the only reason these gun rampages occur so often and go unchallenged until so many innocents are left dead on the floor. Especially since so many of these victims of these rampages do or did own weapons which were packed safely away at home at the time they needed them most, TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OTHER INNOCENTS AROUND THEM.",

   "This goes to the fundamental problem with people who would deny the right of self-defense to their fellow citizens. Ultimately, we either see our fellow citizens' freedom of action as a threat, which must be controlled, or we see it as a benefit, which accrues to all.\n \n The left-wing mindset is of the former; left-wingers must control all those around them and constrain their behavior because those others cannot be trusted to make decisions for what the left-winger considerst the collective good. When the individual is ordered below the state, it stands to reason that there is no individual right to self-defense in the minds of such people.\n \n This is also why their wishful thinking (and their projection of weakness) is substituted for reality in their mindset. It doesn't matter what is actually true, to them; it only matters what they wish to be true. No amount of self-destructive behavior will satisfy them, unless and until their desires become reality (even when impossible). That is why they continue to support policies that usually create the opposite of what they intend to promote.\n \n Ultimately, the man or woman who believes you have no right to self-defense, and that you cannot be trusted with the tools of self-defense, is mentally and emotionally weak.

   "The question is, how can this collectivist type thinking which has inundated our society be changed when our children are not being given both fair and impartial perspectives regarding the great questions of our time in public schools, and then being taught to critically analyze the options and decide for themselves what they choose to believe? But are being indoctrinated to believe one way only, and that is that the State and the Left offers the only intellectually honest approach to these questions, while the spiritual, or conservative view is seen as ignorant, rebellious, disruptive and dangerous to what they perceive as a correct way of thinking.\n \n A good example of this change in the way the next generation is being indoctrinated rather than taught to think critically is the evolution/creationism issue. When I was in middle and high school during the 60s and early 70s, I'll be 56 in June. We were taught about the theory of evolution and also about Creation according to the Genesis account. And because I respected my teacher, I wanted to know her opinion of the two theories and which one she thought was more rational. Keep in mind I had no spiritual proclivities at the time which made me at all partial to the Genesis account.\n \n She very clearly told the class in response to my question that her opinion had nothing to do with the subject at hand and all that mattered was that we grasped and understood both theories so that we could decide for ourselves which made the most sense to us. She said do you accept the scientific explanation or the spiritual explanation as more rational? That is the decision you must eventually make when you have studied both enough to understand them to your satisfaction, so that you feel qualified to make that determination someday is my only concern here.\n \n Oh that todays teachers had that attitude as they taught young people to think critically for themselves while giving only the facts of both sides of what ever issue they are teaching about. Be it political, social, economic or scientific, they are trained today to promote a leftist and subservient philosophy which denies the young the right and empowerment to decide for themselves which perspective or ideology they want to embrace.

   "It should be noted that John Lott started out to prove what was his Anti-gun theories at the time, then when faced with the truth of his very own findings, he in honesty, changed his beliefs to face the facts that he had found. I called it integrity.\n \n Yep Phil. It is pretty much all smoke and mirrors when it comes to gun control. I have met very few gun controllers who deal with the truth of this subject honestly. When cornered by the inconvenient truth, they just want the gun control anyway. Just in case, is their usual reasoning. \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n The CDC gave what I though a weak apology and they did suggest more studies. \n \n Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation, and a few other anti-gun foundations, funded the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study. Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n The National Academy of Sciences also gave a apology for failing to find a link between gon control as crime control and violent outcomes, and also said more study was needed, but 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n People on the anti-gun side. Please feel free to state the apologies both anti-gun teams made if you wish, and then you can add any further apologies you want to make too, on why both teams failed to find the absolute proof link that many of you have been claiming was there, for all of the preceding years, of these two studies! \n \n However, the incontinent truth is that, Gun Control is NOT Crime Control! And even the Anti-gun CDC nor the predominantly anti-gun National Academy of Sciences can prove that is it. \n \n The correct question that needs to be asked is, doesn't our Constitution deserve proof before anyone starts stripping away any more of our Constitutional Rights?",

This is due simply to the bald reality that the facts do not support gun control. It's an impossibility.\n\n So you claim.\n \n \nEarlier this year, Lott found himself facing serious criticism of his professional ethics. Pressed by critics, he failed to produce evidence of the existence of a survey -- which supposedly found that \"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack\" -- that he claimed to have conducted in the second edition of \"More Guns, Less Crime\". Lott then made matters even worse by posing as a former student, \"Mary Rosh,\" and using the alias to attack his critics and defend his work online. When an Internet blogger exposed the ruse, the scientific community was outraged. Lott had created a \"false identity for a scholar,\" charged Science editor-in-chief Donald Kennedy. \"In most circles, this goes down as fraud.\".... \n \n The Stanford Law Review critique, authored by Yale's Ayres and Stanford's Donohue, analyzed more recent crime statistics, extending Lott's original 1977-1992 crime dataset to include data through the late 1990s. As it turned out, after 1992, partly due to the end of the 1980s' crack cocaine-related crime wave, crime rates dropped dramatically in states with large urban centers, many of which had not passed right to carry laws. This fact proves highly inconvenient to the \"More Guns, Less Crime\" argument. After testing Lott and Mustard's analysis with more years of data and different econometric tweakings, Donohue and Ayres conclude, \"No longer can any plausible case be made on statistical grounds that shall-issue laws are likely to reduce crime for all or even most states\"; their analysis even suggested such laws might increase violent crime. \n \n\n Double Barreled Double Standards | Mother Jones",
