   "The world's most arrogant CEO, Bill Gates, recently warned Asian governments that they may be sued if they use open source software, claiming they would be infringing on more than 100 patents that Microsoft owns (though Microsoft won't divulge any details of these patents).\n \n I predict this strategy will blow up in Gates' greedy face. He may be able to bluff smaller, weaker countries, but I don't believe for one minute that China will surrender to Microsoft. China will tell Bill Gates to shove it, which could send Gates running to the World Trade Organization. Such a move could have two possible results:\n \n 1. The WTO could find against Microsoft, which could have disastrous consequences for Bill Gates, Inc.\n \n 2. The WTO could find in Microsoft's favor, in which case China would tell the WTO to shove it. And if China refuses to let the WTO dictate its choice of software, other nations may follow in open rebellion, leaving Bill Gates with egg all over his face.\n \n So please continue with the threats, Bill.\n \n P.S. Why aren't the links in my signature displaying properly?",

   "I don't think those governments have anything to worry about. the linux community pretty much just came through a pretty serious smear campaign by SCO (I know it is still theoretically ongoing, but we all know its pretty much all over but the crying, and SCOs bankruptcy hearing). And Linux came through just fine.\n \n While I have no doubt that Microsoft means what it says, I don;t see there being any realistic way they take a patent infrngement case against linux. \n \n I also think that Chinas decision to run linux has microsoft running scared. As china ramps up to replace America as the numebr 1 comsumer nation on the planet, as well as the number one producer, companies in other nations are striving to make thier networks easily compatible with those of the chinese. \n \n I run linux on my home computer, and we run linux servers and many linux workstations at the office. I have foud the biggest hurdle to gettig people to make the switch is getting them to set down in front of a linux box and play for a while. Put them in front of a commercial distro like mandrake or redhat and it doesn't take long before they start wondering why they ar e paying hundreds of dollars per box for licenses from microsoft. \n \n The other big hurdle I see to widespread adoption of linux is that most techs seem to be against it. I think this is largely becuase any retarded monkey can understand and pass microsofts certification programs. Linux can be a little more difficult at the network administration level. Of course, even that is point and click now (remember the good old days of redhat 4 when EVERYTHING was based on text configuration files with no GUI front end??). The \"old hats\" don't want to have to go back and learn a new system. I have noticed, though, that a majority of the new kids I see applying for tech positions have Linux on their resumes.",

   "no, i think most regular pc users don't use linux because the hardware they have already bought is geared toward microsoft (and it does take a little know-how to do a linux installation)\n\n \n I loaded Mandrake 9.2 on my home machine this weekend (after winblows died another horrible, screaming death) and Lemme be the first to tell you, they have come MILES. I have been using the same old version of Redhat for years now (version 4.something I think) and the Mandrake install is a mind blower when you are used to that. Not only did I not have to compile my own kernel, I didn't even have to know what hardware I had installed. \n \n It had no problem with my network card, no problem with my modem (yes, it is a winmodem, though I can't say for sure how well it works in mandrake since I don't use it), I had no problem with getting it back on the home network when it was done (did it automatically). \n \n I owuld veture to say that it was probably actually EASIER than windows becuase instead of a command line fdisk, you have DiskDrake, which has a graphical front end and even a little \"Automatic Allocation\" button at the bottom for if you don't want to think at all.\n \n I got it loaded, booted up to KDE, and showed my wife how to use it in about 10 minutes (she had never used linux before). Truly a distrobution for even the most mentally challenged user!\n \n \n \nbut, to do so, I would have had to buy a new modem and maybe even a new motherboard. they were geared for some of their functions to be run through the software (eg a Winmodem, and things like that) \n \n if you are buying a new pc, i'd consider building one up from parts and not buying a commercial product (Dell, Gateway, Sony, etc) since microsoft has it's slimy fingers already in the hardware\n\n \n You make an excellent point. Dell will sell you a cheap computer. For the same money, you can get the parts and put your own together and have a GOOD computer, not just a cheap one. \n \n It is incredibly easy to put a PC together (really, everything just plugs in) and for the same money you spend on a dell, you can put together a machine of MUCH, MUCH higher quality. \n \n Is gateway still around?",
