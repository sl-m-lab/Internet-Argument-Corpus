   "\"Women are your fields; go then into your fields whence you please.\" (Sura 2:223)\n \n That is the official word from God on one aspect of a man's relationship with a woman. God made a number of statements (see the Quran) through Muhammad that does not bode well for women living under Islamic law.\n \n The words and deeds of Muhammad, written down in the official Hadiths, plus God's declarations in the Quran on the \"rights\" of women,continue to have a destructive effect on Muslim females throughout the world.\n \n Muhammad is reported as saying in one hadith that \"... the majority of people in Hell are women,\" He also said that he had \"... not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you.\"(women) FN1 He explained that, according to the Quran, the testimony of two women witnesses are equal to that of one man in a court of law. (Sura 2:222). FN2\n \n Sura 4:34 is one that will warm the hearts of women everywhere. \"Good women are obedient... As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to bed apart and beat them.\" FN3\n \n To this day, the proper way to beat a woman is still a matter of concern in the Muslim world. Spain's Muslim imam, Mohammed Kamal Mustafa, published a book in the year 2000 which included advice to men on the correct way to beat their wives.\n \n A good Muslim should strike \"... only the hands and feet, using a rod that is thin and light so that it does not leave behind scars or bruises on the body.\" The goal \"... should be to cause psychological suffering and not to humiliate or physically abuse his wife.\" FN4\n \n Another book, by Kemak Guran, says it's alright to beat your wife as long as you \"... do not strike the face and only beat them moderately.\" FN5\n \n Saudi TV has a family hour in which experts discuss family relationships. One episode had a professor and a cleric discussing proper wife beating. The professor was holding up a pool cue, one of several weapons recommended for the task. (Got to do it right)\n \n The most horrifying examples of Muhammad's legacy are in the Muslim nations of the Sudan, Saudi Arabia , Iran and parts of Nigeria. The former Taliban Islamic government of Afganistan, purveyor of physical torture, rape and public executions of women for minor infractions, should rate at the top of the list.\n \n Muhammad loved women. He no doubt believed that every man should own at least one. Some of his haram of thirteen were slaves who were captured on raids and jihads, Included was a beautiful Jewish woman whose husband, father and brother had just been beheaded by Muhammad's men, the result of a succesful jihad against Jews in the Medina area of Saudi Arabia.\n \n Today in the Sudan, Muslims from the north continue to conduct a similar campaign against the Christian/Animist south. As with Muhammad's jihad, the Sudanese Muslims kill the men and take the women and children as slaves to use for sex, torture, or to sell. Slaves are forced to walk north through harsh environments. Those who complain are beaten or killed.\n \n Muhammad, technically a pedophile, set the standard for marrying young girls. He wed his favorite wife Aisha when she was only six. However, he did wait until she was nine before consummating the marriage. Currently, in Muslim countries under sharia (Islamic law), that is the legal age for girls to marry. Muslim men often fly to Southeast Asia to buy young girls from cash-strapped parents.\n \n Under Islamic law, women are separated from men and many jobs are off limits so that women are not placed in compromising positions with men. They cannot apply for a passport or travel without written permission from their husbands or fathers. And under sharia, women are stoned to death for adultery.\n \n In Nigeria, some regional Muslim governments have invoked a form of sharia in which three women who had children out of wedlock were sentenced to death. One verdict has been overturned after worldwide protests. The other two women will be executed after weaning their babies. The women will be placed in pits up to their waists or necks and stoned to death by Muslim men. The men who impregnated the women have not been charged.\n \n Muhammad set the standard of proof for adultery by a woman when his youngest wife Aisha was rumored to have engaged in some heavy breathing with another man. Muhammad was greatly troubled until God told him that if no one could find four witnesses to verify that the act of adultery took place, then any claim of sexual misconduct was false. \n \n Such a ruling seems absurd to us, but since God was the author, it's obvious He works in mysterious ways.\n \n Except these days women who are raped in Muslim countries can't find four witnesses to the crime. Under Muslim \"logic\", then, she must be guilty of fornication or adultery and is punished for being raped.This could mean anything from 100 lashes to the death penalty.\n \n Then there is the insanity of \"honor killing.\" It happens in Muslim countries and, recently, in England to a Muslim girl. If a girl does anything to dishonor the family (the men of the family), she must be killed.\n \n A case in Jordan occurred after a young girl was raped by an older brother. Another brother had the task of reclaiming the family's honor. He did so by slashing the helpless child's throat. The killer received seven years in prison (unusual, often the killer goes unpunished-- example, Pakistan recently). The brother who raped his sister was not charged.\n \n If you happen to be a Muslim woman and you live under the sharia, you can thank or blame Muhammad. This \"most perfect\" role model is a guide for the behavior of Muslim men. And Muslim men who do good deeds, like killing unbelievers, go straight to Heaven where they are serviced by plenty of fine looking virgins.\n \n But what about women? What rewards do they receive for being good, obedient Muslim wives? The Quran doesn't say. Not exactly cause for joy.\n \n Any of you non-Muslim women out there might want to consider Muhammad's (and Islam's) view of women before hooking up with those fun-loving jihadists. Just remember, you can join anytime you want but you can never leave.\n \n NOTES\n \n 1. Robert Spencer, Islam Unveiled, (Encounter Books), 2002, p.79.\n 2. Ibid., p.79\n 3. Ibid., p.79.\n 4.

   "No invasions, no forced conversions to Christianity or any other religion. The invasion of Iraq has now tied our hands in other areas, such as Korea and Iran. It can easily cost us over a trillion dollars, not to mention lives lost. We (the non-Muslim world) are confronted with a new kind of enemy in which Muslim true believers are fighting to roll back the \"corrupting influence\" of the secular world. The enemy has no standing army to surrender and they have no rules of engagement. Also, all Muslims, including American Muslims, are required to support their fellow Muslims in a jihad against the unbelievers (us). The jihadists have declared a Holy War against America and its allies in a fight, where,eventually, winner takes all.\n \n We must respond in kind, with covert operations and the unrelenting destruction of the jihadists, without any diversions along the way.\n \n I have no interest in changing the insane world of Islam, as long as its followers leave us alone. However, the leaders of Islam and its true believers are steadfast in the pursuit of their goals.\n \n The Ayatollah Khomeini said:... those who study Islamic Holy War will understand why Islam wants to conquer the whole world... Those who know nothing of Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war. Those [who say this] are witless. Islam says; Kill all the unbelievers just as they would kill you all!\"(Spencer)\n \n Another example from an Al-Qaeda training manual affirms this. The jihadists know that \"... an Islamic government would never be established except by the bomb and rifle. Islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief, but rather confronts it.\"\n \n The young Muslim soldiers are \"... to prepare themselves for jihad[holy war], commanded by the majestic Allah's order in the holy Koran.\" They will \"... strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah...\" (UIC/BM-8 translation)\n \n Again, the jihadists have declared an Islamic Holy War against us and will do everything in their power (in shah allah) to destroy the Great Satan. They are, after all, on a mission from God.\n \n And no, everyone doesn't know this already.",

   "Yes, Muslims under sharia treat women horribly. I responded to the initial question, what do we do about it? \n \n No, we are not going where the terrorists are. We are holding back because of political considerations - for example, Iran, Western Pakistan and anywhere the trail takes us, including the U.S.\n \n My point is that Muhammad is Islam. He is the founder and the one who set the standard of behavior (or misbehavior) for followers. Muslim clerics and the true believers, although a minority, are the movers and shakers of Islam, whether in Bagdad, Manila, Indonesia, Spain, Malaysia, or America. They are the beheaders and bombers. With them there can be no reformation. These are the real Muslims. They are only doing their duty and carrying out the mandates of Islam.\n \n IF you could reform Islam you would have to call it something else because it would not be Islam.",
