The silence is deafening!\n \n Why shouldn't he do the right thing and let us see ALL of his military files. I mean, what could he possibly have to hide? He's been such a great war hero, you'd think he'd want us to read firsthand about it so the memory could be seared in our minds like his \"Christmas in Cambodia\".\n \n Where's Johnny?\n \n Anyone who can't see through John Kerry's staged war antics is legally blind.\n \n ...",

It's a side show. I don't see how the issue is an issue at all. I can't put it into a context in which it will in any way affect whoever wins the elections ability to govern. \n \n Personally I think it's a brilliant move by the Dems, they've got educated, interested folks like yourself and Jim so worked up about it, that everything else is lost on you. \n \n It's like the kid that just ate 15 cookies but wants the last one simply because his mom said he couldn't have it.\n \n Waxy",

I'd say his strategy is working like a charm. I'd continue to dangle the carrot too, it keeps you focused.\n \n You may want to check out the \"Conservatives Unite Against Bush\" thread. Not only does it contain a previous post of mine showing my disdain for all this side show stuff, but it contains a very good exchange on Kerry's voting record. You might find it very enlightening, or like some others, you may just bury your head in the sand and continue to parrot what you've heard from the pundits.\n \n Waxy",

You could easily end this by at least trying to explain the hypocrisy of Kerry though, and perhaps even the obvious slant the mainstream press has toward the Left for not reporting this.\n \n And may I ask, IF this exchange you speak of is a slam dunk against those who attack Kerry's record, why then would you want to continue to dangle the carrot and divert attention away from his record.

Afterall, IF it's so strong, why is there a necessity to divert our attention, HMMMMMMMMM?\n\n \n I'm not sure where I lost you. I think your mistake here is assuming that I support Kerry. Your tendency is to immediately become defensive and draw a line in the sand a la GWB's \"you're either with us or against us\" mentality. Like I did in the other post I directed you to, I challenge you to find a post on this board in which I have supported Kerry. \n \n I have no interest in Kerry's hypocrisy one way or another. Of course Kerry is a hypocrit, ALL POLITICIANS ARE HYPOCRITS, Bush included. What's your point?\n \n As for not revealing his records, I think I presented what I think his motivation for not doing so is pretty clearly. I don't care beyond that, never have, never will.\n \n I take it you didn't bother to read the exchange on his voting record. That's one of the problems, people will read mountains of info on Vietnam, but could care less about actual facts. They prefer to let the pundits talk for them with statements like \"the most liberal voting record of all senators\". It's simply BS. If you read the exchange impartially, I can't understand how anyone could come to a different conclusion.\n \n As to why the continued distraction? Easy. Appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's much easier to distract people with mudslinging than educate them on the issues. Kerry's voting record is just one issue, one that from what I've seen is a win for him (at least compared to the mud that's been slung at him regarding it), but there are others, and ones that likely aren't wins.\n \n Aside from that, not everyone agrees on all the issues, not even within their own party. The longer you can keep people walking around in the dark, the easier it is to get them to come toward your light when you want them to, and, you can use a dimmer light.\n \n Waxy",
