   "Put a fork in Charlie, he's done. It looks like even his Democratic pals have had enough trying to keep this greedy, lying old fool from the public wrath. \n \n\n Rep. Charles Rangel, Democrat of New York, leaves Ways and Means chairmanship\n By Paul Kane and Perry Bacon Jr.\n Washington Post Staff Writer \n Thursday, March 4, 2010 \n Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) stepped aside as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, bringing a wrenching period for House Democrats to a temporary close but also providing a new jolt of chaos to a party struggling to maintain its footing. \n \n Days after being admonished by the House ethics committee for accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean, Rangel announced that he was taking a \"leave of absence\" as chairman. The move came as Republicans prepared to force a symbolic floor vote on stripping Rangel of his post, and as his fellow Democrats were making it increasingly clear that they lacked the stomach to support him as difficult midterm elections approached. \n Still pending is the release of a potentially more damning ethics report about Rangel, expected to focus on his failure to declare income and assets and other financial matters in which he appeared to reap personal gain. \n On Tuesday night, Rangel, 79, had boasted \"you bet your life\" he would remain in his committee post. But little more than 12 hours later, in a hastily called news conference, the most powerful African American chairman in the history of Congress surrendered his gavel, saying he was doing so for the good of his party. \n washingtonpost.com \n",

   "From a recent news article.\n \n\n Ethics clouds over Rangel and Paterson are the talk of political Harlem\n 'Actually quite selfless'\n \n Lloyd Williams has known both Charlie Rangel and David Paterson for years; Sutton was his godfather. Williams worked in banking before joining the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, of which he is now president. He spent a good part of last week shuttling in and out of meetings where the discussions revolved around Rangel and Paterson. Williams himself had been in the Caribbean with Rangel, whose sojourn there has come under intense congressional scrutiny. \n \n \"No one has said, 'Can we look at Charlie's itinerary while in the Caribbean?' \" said Williams, sitting in a conference room at chamber headquarters. \"I had a problem with Charlie down there because he didn't take any breaks. Okay, that picture of him on the beach: They called him a whale! The things they say about people of color.\" \n He goes on: \"When we were in the Caribbean, Charlie would come in at 11 at night and be up at 8 in the morning for a meeting, then have another meeting at 11, then do a working lunch at noon. Then a early dinner and more work. Then a reception at night. That was his day.\" Ethics clouds over Rangel and Paterson are the talk of political Harlem - washingtonpost.com \n\n \n Now, a show of hands. Who here is gullable enough to believe this BS? LOL!!",
