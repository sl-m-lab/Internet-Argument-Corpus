Shiites have long been at the bottom of the country's economic ladder, with high unemployment and illiteracy rates.

Young Lebanese Shiite men went to Iran for military training.\n \n Hezbollah, which means \"Party of God\" in Arabic, was born in this milieu. Iranian leadership instilled impressive discipline among Hezbollah's ranks and a flair for the dramatic.

   "I wonder if they feel any personal lack of tolerance regarding our civilized air bombardment resulting in deaths in their civilian population and destruction of their infrastructure. Who is setting the example for extremism?\n\n Georged,\n If you can tell Israel how to conduct a military operation without civilian casualties then I'm sure they would love to hear it. \n \n Look a little deeper at the situation. Many of the losses of Lebanon are tragic and I wish they would not have occurred. Some of the people of Lebanon may feel that Israel is terrorist. Many of them may think that. But they are simply wrong. They are mistaken. Their perception is skewed. (I say all this with the expectation that Israel, like the United States does everything in its power to minimize civilian casualties). \n \n Why are they wrong? Here's the difference between Israel and Hezbollah. \n \n 1. Israel's military is readily identifiable with traditional uniforms. \n Hezbollah blends into the civilian population. Might that cause civilian casualties? Hezbollah doesn't care if Israel bombs or kills them within civilian populations because they don't respect others lives. They want civilians to be killed with them so that it can be used as a tool to turn sentiment against someone who is defending itself. \n \n 2.Israel conducts strikes on hostile, military targets attempting to minimize civilian casualties. \n Hezbollah intentionally targets civilians. In fact, they probably target civilians the majority of the time. Why? Terror. Civilians will waver and fear without a response to the attackers, whereas the military will do as they are trained--recover and answer with a response. (In one of the recent Hezbollah attacks on Nazareth, they killed two young boys 3 and 9 years old. They weren't even Jewish. They were Israeli arabs. 16 Israelis have been killed in rocket attacks since July 12). These missiles are fired anywhere that it is thought casualties will occur with no regard for who or how many will be killed.\n \n 3. Hezbollah is allied with people who set off suicide/homicide bombings in the middle of civilians with the intent to kill as many civilians and damage as much civilian infrastructure as possible. Note Iraq and its seemingly random yet purposeful endless parade of bombings on anyone and everyone possible.\n \n 4. I don't remember the last episode of violence in the north of Israel but someone more familiar with the region might be able to help me. However, the road map to peace was going relatively well, as I previously stated. Israel had even removed its people from some southern settlements as an effort to progress toward peace. Hezbollah then kidnaps two soldiers out of nowhere. Israel attempts to find and rescue its soldiers and legitimately defend itself. Keep in mind also what usually happens to the kidnapping victims of extremist muslims--death, decapitation, torture, etc.\n \n 5. The people should realize their error in perception and focus their disdain for Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been hanging around the border of Israel unrestrained for years amassing military armaments from Syria and Iran. Many of the Lebanese people know this and know Hezbollah started everything and their disdain is rightly placed. The Lebanese government has done nothing to restrain this, in spite of a UN resolution mandating they disarm Hezbollah. (Although I think the Lebanese government would have needed outside UN assistance to do this). Too many governments collude with terrorists. The Lebanese government and Hezbollah bear some of the responsibility--probably the majority of responsibility in this situation.\n \n The resolution of a suicide bomber who blows himself up and who wishes to kill as many as possible is immense and intense. The resolution of a kidnapper who would decapitate his victim is similar. The resolution of one firing missiles iinto civilian populations is similar. The resolution of one who would meet this threat must also be immense and intense. Israel has that. The United States has it (though I'm afraid not as strongly).\n \n Who is setting the example for extremism?",

The United States has it (though I'm afraid not as strongly).\n \n Who is setting the example for extremism?\n\n \n I think you're stuck on justification of warfare methodology in describing your rationalization of Israeli actions. Decapitation and suicide charges were widely used by the Japanese against allied military in WW2. Russian troops commonly used suicide charges against German military in WW2. Chinese troops commonly used suicide charges to deplete US ammunition and overrun US positions in the Korean conflict. Anti-personnel bombs against US troops in S. Vietnam that also killed civilians were very common. The allies used firebombing to purposely devastate civilian populations in WW2 Germany and Japan in an effort to remove civilian support for those governments. The US used atomic weapons against the Japanese civilian population to end WW2. Of all those actions, which one would you define as the most extreme and destructive against civilians in setting a precedent for extremism?\n \n Wars are political, nothing else. What weapons one force uses against another is generally determined by the resources of each participant without regard to the civilian population. I consider any bomb dropped on civilian infrastructure every bit as indiscriminate as a bomb set off in a crowd of civilians.\n \n Your political position is that Israel is justified in using any means to retain lands gained in past war victories. My position being that retention is merely continuation of those particular wars by government decree with the indigent population using whatever weapons come to hand in attempts to regain their lands. By definition, that would make you a supporter of neocon doctrine and me a libertarian decrying US big government and spending, Israel by proxy.

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/world/middleeast/22military.html\n \n July 22, 2006\n Weapons\n U.S. Speeds Up Bomb Delivery for the Israelis \n By DAVID S. CLOUD and HELENE COOPER\n WASHINGTON, July 21 - The Bush administration is rushing a delivery of precision-guided bombs to Israel, which requested the expedited shipment last week after beginning its air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, American officials said Friday.\n \n The decision to quickly ship the weapons to Israel was made with relatively little debate within the Bush administration, the officials said. Its disclosure threatens to anger Arab governments and others because of the appearance that the United States is actively aiding the Israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to Iran's efforts to arm and resupply Hezbollah.\n \n The munitions that the United States is sending to Israel are part of a multimillion-dollar arms sale package approved last year that Israel is able to draw on as needed, the officials said. But Israel's request for expedited delivery of the satellite and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers, and as an indication that Israel still had a long list of targets in Lebanon to strike. \n \n Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday that she would head to Israel on Sunday at the beginning of a round of Middle Eastern diplomacy. The original plan was to include a stop to Cairo in her travels, but she did not announce any stops in Arab capitals. \n \n Instead, the meeting of Arab and European envoys planned for Cairo will take place in Italy, Western diplomats said. While Arab governments initially criticized Hezbollah for starting the fight with Israel in Lebanon, discontent is rising in Arab countries over the number of civilian casualties in Lebanon, and the governments have become wary of playing host to Ms. Rice until a cease-fire package is put together. \n \n To hold the meetings in an Arab capital before a diplomatic solution is reached, said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel, \"would have identified the Arabs as the primary partner of the United States in this project at a time where Hezbollah is accusing the Arab leaders of providing cover for the continuation of Israel's military operation.\" \n \n The decision to stay away from Arab countries for now is a markedly different strategy from the shuttle diplomacy that previous administrations used to mediate in the Middle East. \"I have no interest in diplomacy for the sake of returning Lebanon and Israel to the status quo ante,\" Ms. Rice said Friday. \"I could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and started shuttling around, and it wouldn't have been clear what I was shuttling to do.\"\n \n Before Ms. Rice heads to Israel on Sunday, she will join President Bush at the White House for discussions on the Middle East crisis with two Saudi envoys, Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister, and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the secretary general of the National Security Council.\n \n The new American arms shipment to Israel has not been announced publicly, and the officials who described the administration's decision to rush the munitions to Israel would discuss it only after being promised anonymity. The officials included employees of two government agencies, and one described the shipment as just one example of a broad array of armaments that the United States has long provided Israel.\n \n One American official said the shipment should not be compared to the kind of an \"emergency resupply\" of dwindling Israeli stockpiles that was provided during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, when an American military airlift helped Israel recover from early Arab victories.\n \n David Siegel, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said: \"We have been using precision-guided munitions in order to neutralize the military capabilities of Hezbollah and to minimize harm to civilians. As a rule, however, we do not comment on Israel's defense acquisitions.\"\n \n Israel's need for precision munitions is driven in part by its strategy in Lebanon, which includes destroying hardened underground bunkers where Hezbollah leaders are said to have taken refuge, as well as missile sites and other targets that would be hard to hit without laser and satellite-guided bombs.\n \n Pentagon and military officials declined to describe in detail the size and contents of the shipment to Israel, and they would not say whether the munitions were being shipped by cargo aircraft or some other means. But an arms-sale package approved last year provides authority for Israel to purchase from the United States as many as 100 GBU-28's, which are 5,000-pound laser-guided bombs intended to destroy concrete bunkers. The package also provides for selling satellite-guided munitions.\n \n An announcement in 2005 that Israel was eligible to buy the \"bunker buster\" weapons described the GBU-28 as \"a special weapon that was developed for penetrating hardened command centers located deep underground.\" The document added, \"The Israeli Air Force will use these GBU-28's on their F-15 aircraft.\" . . .",

   "georged\n I think you're stuck on justification of warfare methodology in describing your rationalization of Israeli actions. Decapitation and suicide charges were widely used by the Japanese against allied military in WW2. Russian troops commonly used suicide charges against German military in WW2. Chinese troops commonly used suicide charges to deplete US ammunition and overrun US positions in the Korean conflict. Anti-personnel bombs against US troops in S. Vietnam that also killed civilians were very common. The allies used firebombing to purposely devastate civilian populations in WW2 Germany and Japan in an effort to remove civilian support for those governments. The US used atomic weapons against the Japanese civilian population to end WW2. Of all those actions, which one would you define as the most extreme and destructive against civilians in setting a precedent for extremism?\n\n Yes, there was a different acceptance of military inflicting civilian casualties in the past. But one must look at who was rightfully defending themselves and who were the original aggressors. Japan brought the United States into the war by an unprovoked attack. The U.S. had remained neutral until then. But warfare outside of a world war has moved past bombing civilians. Now most countries attempt to limit civilian casualties as much as possible. (If we ever get into another world war then the tactics may change back to what they were previously). Hezbollah and its kindred, on the other hand attempt to inflict as much civilian damage as possible. \n \n Nagasaki and Hiroshima were a tragedy in human death but these bombings did end the war--the only good that came of it. If no action is taken then eventually these muslim militants will gain more and more arms and more powerful arms and possibly even atomic weapons. Then we will see who is the most extreme.\n \n \nWars are political, nothing else. What weapons one force uses against another is generally determined by the resources of each participant without regard to the civilian population. I consider any bomb dropped on civilian infrastructure every bit as indiscriminate as a bomb set off in a crowd of civilians.\n\n The bombs dropped on civilian infrastructure were not an attack on civilians. The bombs dropped on civilian infrastructure were an attempt to prevent Hezbollah from being aided and resupplied by Iran and Syria (don't forget the Iranian president's statement that the nation of Israel should be wiped off of the earth)--bridges, airport, roads, leadership hideouts, etc. If the Lebanese did not want their civilian infrastructure bombed then the Lebanese should not allow their civilian infrastructure to harbor terrorists.\n \n \nYour political position is that Israel is justified in using any means to retain lands gained in past war victories. My position being that retention is merely continuation of those particular wars by government decree with the indigent population using whatever weapons come to hand in attempts to regain their lands. By definition, that would make you a supporter of neocon doctrine and me a libertarian decrying US big government and spending, Israel by proxy. Which means we're both wasting our time discussing this issue.\n\n I never stated that my position was to allow Israel to use any means necessary. I was never arguing a political position. I have no problem with a UN force buffering the two regions and the Lebanese government dismantling Hezbollah. I have no problem with concessions being made on both sides although I do have a problem with trusting Hezbollah to be sincere and faithful in their part. I have no problem with diplomacy. But I am simply stating that Israel has acted legitimately in self-defense up to this point, acting quickly and decisively when it needed to attempt rescue and defense. \n \n And you must not have been watching the news--Israel is not attempting to retake lands won in previous wars--their goal is the release of kidnapped soldiers and prevention of rockets firing into their population. Their goal in pushing Hezbollah back and occupying lands is to knock them out of range for firing their missiles. If the army pushes them back, occupies land, standing between the terrorists and Israel, then the terrorists cannot fire missiles into their country--only at the military. \n \n Finally, when the nation of Israel was created in 1948 by the United Nations the Arab population rejected the UN proposal. Shortly after Israel declared its independence it was attacked on all sides by Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq. As it has most often occurred, the Arabs were the original aggressors. Unfortunately for them, Israel whipped them. So you say lands won in war but the Arabs started the war, attempting to gang up on Israel.\n \n Start at \"1943 War of Indepence\" in this history and read onward:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Israel",
