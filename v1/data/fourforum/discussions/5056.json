   "Hi all,\n \n I just wanted to share this great website.\n \n http://www.re-discovery.org/\n \n \n I really love the New Periodic Table.\n \n I also love the anti-IUPAC sticker.\n (btw - IUPAC stands for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. It is the institution that standardizes chemistry nomenclature as well as other things.)\n \n \n This is from the Guanine page and is probably my favorite passage so far:\n \n \n Guanine (G), along with adenine (A), thymine (T) and cytosine (C), are the four bases of DNA, which is used in all biological systems (except some viruses) to encode genetic information. The stability and integrity of genetic information are of critical importance to all living systems.\n \n Incredibly, Guanine is chemically unstable. Guanine, in the oxidizing environment of a cell converts to 8-oxoGuanine. Guanine is so unstable that 100,000 Guanines convert to 8-oxoGuanines in an average mammalian cell each day (1). Cells have elaborate and multilayered systems to repair 8-oxoGuanine (2) in their attempts to maintain genetic integrity. Even so, 8-oxoGuanine causes spontaneous mutation, cancer and aging (3,4).\n \n Guanine is the most glaring and transcendental result of degeneration of the original optimal design. Gaunine has invaded biological systems, and is currently found to have assumed a variety of functions. It is a component of DNA and RNA. It is involved in cell signaling and metabolism. Guanine is everywhere.\n \n Is it conceivable that an intelligent and beneficent designer would use Guanine to encode genetic information in man, made in God's own image? Would you store important tax information in wax imprints? No, because wax is not stable. Duh! When it melts, important information is lost. Darwinists propose that Guanine was incorporated into living systems by a random, heartless and amoral process of evolution. Design Scientists believe Gaunine arose via degeneration of an optimal design. But here there is common ground. All agree that an Intelligent Designer would not use Guanine in the genetic code.\n \n Gaunine leads surely and inexorably to 8-oxoGuanine, which in turn causes cancer and aging. We can say with certainty that there was no Guanine in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve had C, A and T, but not G in their DNA. This conclusion is consistent with the expectations of many theologians who think, based on their understanding of Judeo-Christian doctrine and scripture, that the physical world was optimally designed but should show evidence of subsequent decay. Mr. Meyer suggests that we should deduce the noble aboriginal design. We have done so. It is The G-less Genome. We will expand on the concept of the G-less Genome in future publications.\n",

   "Oh, any of the bases can degrade. Guanine is just the most reactive.\n Some guy down the hall works on nothing but guanine adducts on oligonucleotides. The type of DNA lesion is also determined by the sequence right around the guanine, so there are sequence-specific lesions and adducts.\n \n I think once people realize that DNA is very easily mutated and that the cellular machinery needed to repair it is pretty complex and imperfect, then they will see that mutations happen all the time and there are so many that some of them will just turn out to be \"beneficial\" or at least not detrimental.\n \n Here's an example of 8-oxo-guanine actually inhibiting the DNA repair process.\n http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/24/21300",
