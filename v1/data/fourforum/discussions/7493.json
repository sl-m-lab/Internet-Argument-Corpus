After all, they are not there to see protests, they are there to gove a speech. Protesting at the speech is like talking over them i in a meeting.\n \n It is also pretty disrespectful to protest at trade conferences. Those people come from all over the world to attend those confrences. It is disrespectful to treat them rudely and disrupt their conference. Not only is it disrespectful, it is plain rude. \n \n A lot of things are disrespectful It is disrespectful to call the president a baby killing war monger with horse apples for brains, no matter how true it may be. It is disrespectful to refer to his speech tonight as shameless, pathetic, partisan cheerlewading that did not even make SENSE. \n \n Maybe that is the whole point of the \"protest\" thing, to be disrespectful, make a scene, disrupt traffic, and make yourself conspicous. It was pretty damn disrespectful tot he british to dump a bunch of their tea in boston harbor. \n \n On Monday morning, the 29th of November, 1773, a handbill was posted all over Boston, containing the following words: \"Friends! Brethren! Countrymen!--That worst of plagues, the detested tea, shipped for this port by the East India Company, is now arrived in the harbor\"\n \n That is pretty disrespectful. When British troops tried to break up the following riot in boston, they were spat on and pelted with rocks. Not only disrespectful, but disrespectful to men in uniform.

   "Here's a letter in response from her\n \n What Really Happened at the State of the Union \n by Cindy Sheehan \n Dear Friends,\n \n As most of you have probably heard, I was arrested before the State of the Union Address tonight.\n \n I am speechless with fury at what happened and with grief over what we have lost in our country.\n \n There have been lies from the police and distortions by the press. (Shocker) So this is what really happened: \n \n This afternoon at the People's State of the Union Address in DC where I was joined by Congresspersons Lynn Woolsey and John Conyers, Ann Wright, Malik Rahim and John Cavanagh, Lynn brought me a ticket to the State of the Union Address. At that time, I was wearing the shirt that said: 2245 Dead. How many more?\n \n After the PSOTU press conference, I was having second thoughts about going to the SOTU at the Capitol. I didn't feel comfortable going. I knew George Bush would say things that would hurt me and anger me and I knew that I couldn't disrupt the address because Lynn had given me the ticket and I didn't want to be disruptive out of respect for her. I, in fact, had given the ticket to John Bruhns who is in Iraq Veterans Against the War. However, Lynn's office had already called the media and everyone knew I was going to be there so I sucked it up and went.\n \n I got the ticket back from John, and I met one of Congresswoman Barbara Lee's staffers in the Longworth Congressional Office building and we went to the Capitol via the undergroud tunnel. I went through security once, then had to use the rest room and went through security again. \n \n My ticket was in the 5th gallery, front row, fourth seat in. The person who in a few minutes was to arrest me, helped me to my seat.\n \n I had just sat down and I was warm from climbing 3 flights of stairs back up from the bathroom so I unzipped my jacket. I turned to the right to take my left arm out, when the same officer saw my shirt and yelled; \"Protester.\" He then ran over to me, hauled me out of my seat and roughly (with my hands behind my back) shoved me up the stairs. I said something like \"I'm going, do you have to be so rough?\" By the way, his name is Mike Weight.\n \n The officer ran with me to the elevators yelling at everyone to move out of the way. When we got to the elevators, he cuffed me and took me outside to await a squad car. On the way out, someone behind me said, \"That's Cindy Sheehan.\" At which point the officer who arrested me said: \"Take these steps slowly.\" I said, \"You didn't care about being careful when you were dragging me up the other steps.\" He said, \"That's because you were protesting.\" Wow, I get hauled out of the People's House because I was, \"Protesting.\"\n \n I was never told that I couldn't wear that shirt into the Congress. I was never asked to take it off or zip my jacket back up. If I had been asked to do any of those things...I would have, and written about the suppression of my freedom of speech later. I was immediately, and roughly (I have the bruises and muscle spasms to prove it) hauled off and arrested for \"unlawful conduct.\"\n \n After I had my personal items inventoried and my fingers printed, a nice Sgt. came in and looked at my shirt and said, \"2245, huh? I just got back from there.\"\n \n I told him that my son died there. That's when the enormity of my loss hit me. I have lost my son. I have lost my First Amendment rights. I have lost the country that I love. Where did America go? I started crying in pain.\n \n What did Casey die for? What did the 2244 other brave young Americans die for? What are tens of thousands of them over there in harm's way for still? For this? I can't even wear a shirt that has the number of troops on it that George Bush and his arrogant and ignorant policies are responsible for killing.\n \n I wore the shirt to make a statement. The press knew I was going to be there and I thought every once in awhile they would show me and I would have the shirt on. I did not wear it to be disruptive, or I would have unzipped my jacket during George's speech. If I had any idea what happens to people who wear shirts that make the neocons uncomfortable that I would be arrested...maybe I would have, but I didn't.\n \n There have already been many wild stories out there.\n \n I have some lawyers looking into filing a First Amendment lawsuit against the government for what happened tonight. I will file it. It is time to take our freedoms and our country back.\n \n I don't want to live in a country that prohibits any person, whether he/she has paid the ulitmate price for that country, from wearing, saying, writing, or telephoning any negative statements about the government. That's why I am going to take my freedoms and liberties back. That's why I am not going to let Bushco take anything else away from me...or you.\n \n I am so appreciative of the couple of hundred of protesters who came to the jail while I was locked up to show their support....we have so much potential for good...there is so much good in so many people.\n \n Four hours and 2 jails after I was arrested, I was let out. Again, I am so upset and sore it is hard to think straight.\n \n Keep up the struggle...I promise you I will too.\n \n Love and peace soon,\n Cindy",

   "The thing that gets me is Cindy doesn't seem to consider that her son volunteered to serve.

   "Go Cindy! Take off your shirt! That would be a REAL protest.\n \n Oh yeah, lest I forget, great post Mainiac. I'm not with you 100% on it but it was very valid and very appropriatly delivered.\n \n Cindy is, in fact, a grieving mother. I imagine losing one of my sons to the Bush/Iraqi attrocity and I understand fully. But her son did volunteer. It's just a shame that his life was wasted on the Presidents folly. But that chance is always taken when joining the military. The Dogs of War, across the globe and across the annals of time, have established a thriving industry dependant on the blood and flesh of our young. \n \n The way that they, and their supporters appearantly see it, you signed on. If you valued your life that little to begin with, then what are you complaining about. You are a soldier. You are a brick in the wall. You are our flesh and bone and blood pool. You signed on to do the bidding of the Dogs of War. Do your job. Shut up. A good soldier follows orders. Quit your whining Cindy. Nobody put a gun to his head to enlist in the fodder tank.\n \n There have been good arguments for war. Hitler comes to mind. \n \n We are as dependant on oil as the Dogs of War are dependant on our children. But we can kick our oil dependancy with effort and action. Hollow words at a podium will not do the trick. Common sense tells me that if I truly wanted to make oil dependancy a thing of the past, the first thing I would do is make sure that the most powerful man in the country isn't so dependant on oil and it's revenues. (As well as his family and circle of associates getting rich off of it.)\n \n And after that, I would make sure the number two man wasn't oil tainted as well. \n \n So, remember that next election. I would try to see that no one with any Bush oil sludge on them, EVER sat in public office again. Unless, of course, you have no problem trading someone elses child for your gasoline.\n \n In these trying and turbulant time, when our children are getting blown up daily, and you are paying for gasoline, at the pump, with blood, remember...... Exxon set a new record for annual profits last year. But hey, ain't nothing wrong with making a lot of money. That's the new republican way. Coming to a war theatre near you soon.\n \n Yes. Cindy is a grieving mother. I think that her protest and the allure of the limelight might be a part of her healing. But it's really bigger than Cindy. It's what she represents. She's taken on being the symbol of millions of Americans who have had just about enough of Mr. Bush and his merry band of followers.\n \n Big brother will only be able to shut Cindy up for so long until the streets fill with thousands of moms and dads just like her, much like happened in the 60's. So, if Bush was wise, he'd let the ONE of her be as vocal as she wants to be. The alternative would be much harder to handle.",

Our thirst for oil is what put us there in the first place.\n\n \n The lady who cleans our house has a son, 19yrs, who joined the Marines and is on two-week notice for deployment to Iraq. She's sick about it and blames herself. The son graduated from high school, barely, and worked for about six-months at various minimum or near minimum wage jobs before joining the military. According to her, he doesn't have a clue about why we're in Iraq other than what he's been force fed by his new peer group, but likes the fact he's making more money than he could have in private industry and his new buddies. This woman voted for Bush and now hates him for exposing her son to possible death for no good reason.\n \n She knew nothing about politics or foreign affairs until her son joined the military. At that point she became keenly interested in why we're in Iraq and eventually realized all the government propaganda she had viewed on TV was just that, deception. She actually bought a computer and began to educate herself about our government using the Internet, with three children still living at home and working full-time. \n \n I'd think she's typical of most of the general public, including Sheehan. Until she had personal involvement, just making her way in life was an adequate challenge. I do know that if her son is unfortunate enough to become a casualty, this woman will become publicly vocal about her resentment of our involvement in Iraq and dislike for current administration.\n \n I watched the same type of personal situations develop as the Vietnam War progressed, the difference being those young men were drafted. What's wrong with a grieving mother realizing her son's death has been for nothing, and then protesting against the policies that killed him?",

   "The thing that gets me is Cindy doesn't seem to consider that her son volunteered to serve. He chose to place himself in a situation ( the military) where there was a chance he may be sent into combat. Uncle Sam didn't just show up on her door to drag her son away. He chose a dangerous profession. \n \n There are a lot of young soldiers that join up just to further their education, get a good paying job, or just to see the world. They don't consider their own mortality at the time. I'm sure Cindy was aware of the chance he may be placed in harms way. \n \n I wonder if she supported her sons enlistment? If she did, she has even less to complain about. If she didn't, maybe she should have tried harder to discourage him. Good luck to any parent who tries to change the mind of a young adult set on doing something, in this case, enlisting. I didn't seem to have any success in convincing my son not to enlist.\n \n I didn't blame Bush for my sons choice. I blamed myself. I felt I should have tried harder to encourage him to make other choices. Once he made up his mind, there was nothing I could say to change it.\n \n Cindy is barking up the wrong tree. Bush didn't kill her son, the freedom fighters did ( her words). Bush might have placed him in Iraq, but he didn't pull the trigger. She is acting more like a grieving mother than a war protester. I'm willing to bet she wasn't even a war protester before her son was killed. Would she have been proud of her son coming home with medals he recieved from killing people, some of which may have been innocent people caught in the cross-fire?\n \n She needs to focus her attention on the real reason we are in Iraq, our countrys dependence on foreign oil. Her son died because we refuse to make the tough choices that will allow us to be free of relying on ME oil. As American citizens we all played a part in her sons death. Our thirst for oil is what put us there in the first place.\n\n \n Yep, I agree with that. In fact I think she did meet with Bush and was very positive about it afterwards, thanking the President for meeting with them and making her feel like she wasn't so alone losing a son in war. I think the reason she got upset was shortly after that Bush made his meeting a political ploy, almost like \"look what I did, I met with the people who's sons died\". He also mentioned in that speech something like \"and they understand the noble cause for which their children died for\". That was when she got upset and demanded to meet with President Bush again so he could tell her what that noble cause was. This would have been a no-win situation for Pres. Bush to meet with her and I'm sure no President would have met with her. Many people act as if meeting with Sheehan would have brought her son back, but that's not true.\n \n But back on the topic, I don't care who she is, or for what reason she is wearing that shirt, that shirt she had on was not innappropriate. She went through security twice with it on, it wasn't like she was trying to hide it or cause an uproar. Is it wrong to wear a shirt expressing the question of whether all those deaths are worth it? This shirt was not disruptive (besides the fact that she was arrested for it), she was NOT asked to take it off, change, etc. and the other people, wearing \"support our troops shirts\" (who also should have been allowed to stay wearing those shirts) were simply told to leave. Do I feel sorry for Sheehan (any more than anyone who lost a son in a war)? Not really. He chose to serve, and he gave his life when he knew that was a possibility. But regardless of who it was, it's unacceptable to have security handcuff someone and take them to jail, only to release them later as a \"mistake\". This is security at the State of the Union address, with the PRESIDENT there. Don't you think they should be the best security they have and should at least know the rules of the event they are at?",

   "I have a son who is a senior in high school. He just turned 18. Last week, twice, the recruiters have called my home asking for him. It is illegal to telemarket here in my state. I wonder how my phone number got into the hands of the recruiter? Doe's registering, when you turn 18, give authority for the military to try to come and suck my son into the war grinder? He's 18. I still claim him as a dependant. The phone is in my name, not his. He still has pimples for crissakes. Do I have any right to try to protect him. Can I stop them?\n \n I have many questions. I am afraid of what the answers might be though.emoticon_cry \n \n I will be looking into it. I'm calling the school Monday.\n\n \n Unless you fill out a form to not give military recruiters your information, the school is REQUIRED to provide the military with your information including address, phone #, and all other information. Of course I found out about this form after it was due, so I guess they have all my information. But I haven't gotten any calls. The recruiters also seem to be respectful at our school. Sometimes they have a booth set up and I'm sure there's a fair bit of propaganda, but I'm thinking at 18 you should realize that you may have to fight if you join the army. As far as I can tell they don't actually approach anyone, but wait for people to come to them. But I agree that I will not join the military just because someone approaches me. I may join the military after college, but as said above, I will come to them, knowing full well the possible consequences.",

You go in as an officer and right now (and for the forseeable future) can pretty much pick your assingment. WE have heard about the enlistment shortage...that is nothing compared to the shortage of officers they are experiencing. \n \n IMO, doing so unless you want combat is foolish, though. They are rotating officers in and out of combat positions with some frequency. When they have an officer from the motor pool commanding infantry units, you KNOW they are hurting.\n \n Personally, I joined the military on the possibility I may want to someday pursue a career in politics. As such, my two priorities were to pull the highest security clearance possible and to see combat (combat vets do better in the polls generally). Unfortunatly after spending a little time shooting at people in defense of our foreign policy, I decided that I would rather not jump into the cesspool of American politics. BUT, if you go SF (which is not difficult if you are an officer with a high security clearance) you will find that the xperience and training you recieve is worth big bucks in the private sector...if you enjoy that kind of thing. Professional soldiers in parts of Africa are currently pulling in excess of $2000 per day plus plunder. 6 months or even a year of that is enough to net you a decent little cash pile for a good start in life.",

   "Hollow words at a podium will not do the trick.\n(my emphasis)\n \n Living up to your name there. \n \n I find it hard to believe that the SOTU address has spawned a thread of such length and serious debate. The SOTU address, every year, is THE number one opportunity for the President to spew forth as much rhetoric as possible, with a prime time audience and no one to counter or argue with a single thing he says.\n I have read the full transcripts of the last few SOTU addresses, and every single one has been severely if not completely (2002 is the best example) devoid of analysis, and flush with ideological rhetoric, factual distortion and warmongering. \n \n It is totally predictable that someone sporting an even slightly rebellious slogan would be ejected from this self-congratulatory orgy of false triumph. I can't believe that anyone is surprised or even offended by it.\n I mean, according to my principles, I am disgusted by this behaviour as much as I am by the banishment of one Walter Wolfgang from the 2005 Labour Conference here in the UK for criticising our foreign secretary. But given the \"free speech zones\" (possibly the most tragic irony perpetrated by humankind to date) imposed by the Bush administration, did anyone really think any kind of opposition would be allowed during the President's Holy of Holies, the State of the Union address?\n \n \nThere are times when making a public spectacle of yourself or detracting from the seriousness of the event is totally unwarranted. The SOTU address is one of them.\n\n \n Seriousness? Give me a break! No, wait, give me a thousand! Republican or Democrat, a SOTU address is simply an annual opportunity for the Big Man to waffle uninterrupted for a somnolent duration about essentially nothing at all. \n \n Everybody in the entire world KNEW exactly what Bush was going to say. That's the crux of the whole matter. It's his big moment, his grand visionary-leader-time where he tries to hypnotise as many gullible stars-and-stripes-eyed flag-wavers per televised second as he can, after which nothing changes, the economy stagnates, the wars inflate. \n \n The scriptwriters and White House Media Goons will have been beavering away on this for months, strategising, editing, polling, psycho-analysing and converging on the best combination of patriotism and realism guaranteed to harvest the maximum votes.\n \n \n *wipes self-righteous indignation from forehead*\n \n I don't mean to insult the profound arguments in this thread concerning the details of free speech, but to dignify the SOTU address with anything more than an acknowledgement that another one has taken place, and has been as predictable as every previous one, is to place a disproportionate amount of trust in the manipulative, public-relations-conscious weasels who write these speeches in the first place.",

   "Sorry to interrupt, but getting back to the original thread topic, I found this letter by Cindy Sheehan regarding the incident at the SOTU.\n \n Of course, truthout.org is not what some would consider a nonbiased site, but for what it's worth, this is what she has to say on that website:\n \n \n What Really Happened\n By Cindy Sheehan\n t r u t h o u t | Perspective \n \n Wednesday 01 February 2006\n \n As most of you have probably heard, I was arrested before the State of the Union address last night.\n \n I am speechless with fury at what happened and with grief over what we have lost in our country.\n \n There have been lies from the police and distortions by the press (shocker). So this is what really happened:\n \n This afternoon at the People's State of the Union Address in DC, where I was joined by Congresspersons Lynn Woolsey and John Conyers, Ann Wright, Malik Rahim and John Cavanagh, Lynn brought me a ticket to the State of the Union address. At that time, I was wearing the shirt that said: 2245 Dead. How many more?\n \n After the PSOTU press conference, I was having second thoughts about going to the SOTU at the Capitol. I didn't feel comfortable going. I knew George Bush would say things that would hurt me and anger me, and I knew that I couldn't disrupt the address because Lynn had given me the ticket, and I didn't want to be disruptive out of respect for her. I, in fact, had given the ticket to John Bruhns, who is in Iraq Veterans Against the War. However, Lynn's office had already called the media, and everyone knew I was going to be there, so I sucked it up and went.\n \n I got the ticket back from John, and I met one of Congresswoman Barbara Lee's staffers in the Longworth Congressional Office building and we went to the Capitol via the underground tunnel. I went through security once, then had to use the rest room and went through security again.\n \n My ticket was in the 5th gallery, front row, fourth seat in. The person who in a few minutes was to arrest me, helped me to my seat.\n \n I had just sat down and I was warm from climbing 3 flights of stairs back up from the bathroom so I unzipped my jacket. I turned to the right to take my left arm out, when the same officer saw my shirt and yelled, \"Protester.\" He then ran over to me, hauled me out of my seat, and roughly (with my hands behind my back) shoved me up the stairs. I said something like \"I'm going, do you have to be so rough?\" By the way, his name is Mike Weight.\n \n The officer ran with me to the elevators, yelling at everyone to move out of the way. When we got to the elevators, he cuffed me and took me outside to await a squad car. On the way out, someone behind me said, \"That's Cindy Sheehan.\" At which point the officer who arrested me said, \"Take these steps slowly.\" I said, \"You didn't care about being careful when you were dragging me up the other steps.\" He said, \"That's because you were protesting.\" Wow, I got hauled out of the People's House because I was \"Protesting.\"\n \n I was never told that I couldn't wear that shirt into the Congress. I was never asked to take it off or zip my jacket back up. If I had been asked to do any of those things ... I would have, and written about the suppression of my freedom of speech later. I was immediately and roughly (I have the bruises and muscle spasms to prove it) hauled off and arrested for \"unlawful conduct.\"\n \n After I had my personal items inventoried and my fingers printed, a nice Sgt. came in and looked at my shirt and said, \"2245, huh? I just got back from there.\"\n \n I told him that my son died there. That's when the enormity of my loss hit me. I have lost my son. I have lost my First Amendment rights. I have lost the country that I love. Where did America go? I started crying in pain.\n \n What did Casey die for? What did the 2244 other brave young Americans die for? What are tens of thousands of them over there in harm's way for still? For this? I can't even wear a shirt that has the number of troops on it that George Bush and his arrogant and ignorant policies are responsible for killing.\n \n I wore the shirt to make a statement. The press knew I was going to be there, and I thought every once in awhile they would show me, and I would have the shirt on. I did not wear it to be disruptive, or I would have unzipped my jacket during George's speech. If I had any idea what happens to people who wear shirts that make the neocons uncomfortable, that I would be arrested ... maybe I would have, but I didn't.\n \n There have already been many wild stories out there.\n \n I have some lawyers looking into filing a First Amendment lawsuit against the government for what happened tonight. I will file it. It is time to take our freedoms and our country back.\n \n I don't want to live in a country that prohibits any person, whether or not he/she has paid the ultimate price for that country, from wearing, saying, writing, or telephoning any negative statements about the government. That's why I am going to take my freedoms and liberties back. That's why I am not going to let BushCo take anything else away from me ... or you.\n \n I am so appreciative of the couple of hundred of protesters who came to the jail while I was locked up to show their support. We have so much potential for good. There is so much good in so many people.\n \n Four hours and 2 jails after I was arrested, I was let out. Again, I am so upset and sore it is hard to think straight.\n \n Keep up the struggle ... I promise you, I will too\n\n \n http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/020106Z.shtml",

   "Doesn't anyone know what Respect is anymore? \n \n Is this post political or what? How sad. \n \n Do you know how hard it is to get a seat to the SOTU? Cindy was invited to this event for one thing, and one thing only, in hopes that there would be some kind of political sabotage. Yelling from the seats...\"you killed my son\" or whatever else might come from her. Our politicians need to GROW UP.\n \n Simply wearing clothing is hardly an arrestable offense, even if it has a slogan on it. That's absurd.\n \n Really, Cindy was removed because they thought she was going to start yelling XXXX at this event.\n \n I'm for freedom of speech, but in the right manner. If Cindy started yelling stuff like \"you killed my son\", that would have been inappropriate, just like it would be inappropriate for me to yell in a court room...\"he did it, murderer, murderer, murderer\". I would be removed promptly, or arrested for being in contempt. If a student yelled out to a teacher while giving a lecture, \"you suck as a teacher, you're awful go to hell\", that person would be removed, maybe even disciplined.\n \n Come on, simply wearing a shirt with a slogan is not an arrestable offense. Even IF she would have disrupted the event with a verbal outbreak, that too should not be an arrestable offense.\n \n There are many things I like about Cindy and there are things, I don't and actually feel bad for her.\n \n I applaude anyone who wants to protest if they feel there is an injustice going on. I'm not upset at all with cindy and her protesting in Crawford and other places, I think we need more people like her, who are not afraid to protest for what they believe.\n \n On the other hand, as a mother, I feel sorry for her. Her son died and that is the worst thing that could happen to a mother and I can see where she is coming from. But Cindy is not seeing the whole picture. Her son apparently loved what he did, and in essence, Cindy is belittling her son's own choice to defend his country that he loved. If her son could hear her now, he probably would say...\"Mom, shut the :xcensored up. If I have a chance to do it again, I would. I love what I do and respect that.\" :) \n \n But IF he enlisted under \"false pretenses\" and was lied to, the son may be saying...\"go get em mom!! \" And that is why I think Cindy is protesting like this, because, she feels her son died because of a lie.\n \n So, let people speak freely, but don't be the \"wedding crasher\" or in this case a \"SOTU Crasher\". Protest in the proper forum, where your voice will be heard the loudest and in return that will give you a greater respect from others, on both sides, for your cause. If you have a political agenda, people can see right through that and your credibility and your cause will lose respect.",

   "How can a citizen of the United States be an SOTU gate crasher? An invited citizen?\n\n \n \n Like I said it comes down to respect.\n \n If a person is invited to a wedding, and a best friend of the groom stands up in the middle of the wedding and shouts...\"marriage is a dead end, don't do it\", well, this person was clearly \"invited\" so you think this person can't ruin the wedding?\n \n If the wedding was inside a church, someone can easily be offended and say \"satan is almighty, you're all going to hell\", sure this person was \"invited\" so you think simone, this person can't ruin the event?????\n \n A political plant like cindy at the SOTU also \"invited\"...hmm. It's all about respect, not ruining events, she was there in hopes a scene would happen, nothing more, nothing less. \n \n As far as I know, Lynn Woolsey, the one who invited her, is not in Cindys voting vicinity. Wow, how generous Ms. Woolsey is. Most politicians don't give a darn about you unless you can vote for them. You know, I scratch your back you scratch mine kind of thing. She will be the first I write when I want to go to a \"sold-out\" SOTU event. I'm in NY, she's in California, but I matter to her...right?",

Only until she makes an outburst then they should kick her out.\n \n But we all have to agree, democrats and republicans alike, need to stop playing these childish games. Cindy was a plant, in hopes to embarass the president on national and world television. I'm personnally tired of thier games.\n \n Trust me, I think no voice/expression should be silenced.

   "Sheehan made no outburst. The whole thing was just another power play by Bush. Sheehan left quietly with the officers.\n\n \n She made no outburst, and she \"claims\" she wasn't going to make any statement, and that is what we have to go by. \n \n I agree, she was mistreated. If she did nothing but sit there with a shirt on herself with a statement, in my mind, her conduct was \"okay\", sure a little insensitive as per the event, but its all about expressing, and assuming she wasn't going to have an outbreak, she should have been able to remain.\n \n Hey, I'm for the people and expression. I can see the \"whole\" picture. Its unfortunate, depending on your label R or D, most only see \"part of the picture\". \n \n As for the Vacaville region, it appears to be a different district, but I'm not a California resident, I don't know where the lines are drawn, nor do I know where she lives, so like I said I don't know who her congressperson is but I sure would like to know with a positive confirmation. But let's be real, the congresswoman clearly, in my mind, had alterior motives. Just because most of you are branded with the R or D into your minds, let's not be naive. Just like the Iraq veteran woman sitting next to her dog (both veterans) in the audience.\n \n Sure BOTH ladies Cindy and the Lady Veteran both have a right to be there, total opposites in their views, both should have their views known, but come on, why do you think I know about THESE stories... by sheer accident???? No, because both sides play it up...please enough with the drama, and I thought soap operas were bad.\n \n No wonder no one gets along.",
