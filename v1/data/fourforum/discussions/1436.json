They believe in Christ, but so do many other non-Christian faiths, such as Ba'hai.\n \n \n First of all, as for the example you used with buddhsit monks setting out their begging bowl, and your assumption that only buddhists make offerings to them, that is flatly wrong. It is very common practice for a monk (or laymen) to beg, either for food, or other materials such as clothing, bedding, medications... The generous spirit of those who are in societies where they commonly encounter such actions bring them to charitous acts of kindness. A japanese monk rarely goes hungry, although a very large percentage of the citizens have turned away from their religious roots (just like America) \n The same goes the other way around... a buddhist temple often commits a large share of it's funding to charitous works outside the temple in the surrounding community. They give aid to anyone in need, not just the buddhists. \n The practice of begging food stems directly from the buddha's own actions, himself coming to death because he ate rotten meat that was placed in his bowl. why he did that is a question for another time.\n \n And while mahayana buddhists strive to \"save all sentient beings\" you will not find a buddhist missionary easily, while christian ones are quite common. Mother Theresa and others of her ilk have done wonderful acts of kindness, but all the while they have been trying to woo people into their religion. I wonder if perhaps an act of kindness is even better if there is no ulterior motive, such as getting into heaven.",
