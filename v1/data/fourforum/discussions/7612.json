   "While I can certainly understand an individual's desire to earn as much income as possible, Delphi workers and their unions seem to live in a different universe with regard to wages and benefits. $26/hr for assembly line work, $76/hr when benefits are included? Those are $8-10/hr jobs in the real world.\n \n http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006602180315\n \n This is absolute insanity considering current US trade imbalance, US auto manufacturer loss of market share and US average assembly line wages. The longer GM holds Delphi back from allowing the courts to nullify Delphi's labor contracts to avoid a GM strike just deepens potential future losses for both companies from not biting the bullet. At the rate GM's management is stumbling around, Kekorian's patience could allow him to buy controlling interest in GM for peanuts.",

   "GM is pretty obviously afraid of a slowdown. After all, they have to get their new lined of SUVs out so they can sit on dealer lots and not sell. \n \n IMO, GM is really screwing the pooch here. If Delphi goes to the bankruptcy court and gets their UAW contracts nullified, the UAW looses a LOT of bargaining power with all auto makers. GM with a new cash flow strategy could theoretically push for bankruptcy next year and get their contracts nullified as well as being able to revamp their legacy labor programs to cut those costs. They could come out of it with a 40% reduction in production costs based on the numbers I have seen. \n \n It seems like they are jumping over a dollar to pick up a dime here.",

   "I agree that if GM would take the pressure off Delphi and Delphi has the courts nullify their labor contracts the US auto industry as a whole would benefit in future labor contract negotiations. Without that flexibility, all component manufacturing will eventually move offshore. Delphi didn't include their international operations in the BK filing. This reminds me of the US steel industry. Which no longer exists as other than specialty mills. \n \n 2006 US auto production forecasts are already below those of 2005. While GM is still pushing SUVs with higher sticker prices and higher interest rates. Is anyone actually at the wheel of GM?",
