   "What do yall think about American Idol 3? Is it as 'good' as the other seasons? \n \n I personally think that it's sliding downhill... I think the ratings are starting to slide. I guess some people just aren't intrested anymore. A lot weren't intrested in the FIRST place but some where. I think it might be losing some of it's fans. Also I think that the voting is rigged. \n Here's WHY I think it's rigged:\n American Idol Season 2 - Clay should have won, I don't remember HOW many times I voted for him but it was in the 100's ;)\n American Idol Season 3- I voted for Bri 103 times (haha yes I counted and YES I have a life... twas having fun... or maybe it was all that soda *shrugs*)\n \n Who do yall think will win the next American Idol? It might be 2 soon to tell but I love that red headed Dean Martin impersonator guy... also the \"pen salesman\" oh and the 16 yr old representing GA!!! \n \n -Sparks",

   "Reality TV in general has been over-abused and has no worth in my eyes.\n\n \n While I do agree with your statement, I don't consider American Idol as \"reality TV\" except that the people come from all over. It is a talent search- no less. Unfortunately, it is also turning into a popularity contest, too. That's is why Ruben won last season even though everyone knows Clay is a better singer. AT&T said that there is no 'conspiracy' as far as the voting goes. When 25 million are voting, 103 votes doesn't add up tovery much.\n \n As far as Simon being callous, he is just honest. He's the reason people watch the show! I think he may be a little over the top on occassion, but it beats the other two, who say things like, \"You didn't do this very well, and you sounded that way... but you got a lot of heart!!\" Why do they feel the need to sugar-coat it? And what is this thing with Randy and his \"YEEEAAH\" and \"Aaaaiiight?\"\n \n And last of all.

   "It's simple what's going on. A recent report on one of those evening Hollywood entertainment shows found a gambling ring using telephone voting rigging system set up to vote for whichever candidate they were betting on. \n \n The voting is set up unsecurely, allowing anyone to call as often as they wish. All it would take is for people to get their hands on a \"war dialer\" computerized phone system and program it to call a certain number and hang up a specified number of seconds after it answers. When you call one of the American Idol numbers to vote, you get a recording saying \"thank you for voting for contestant #_. Please watch tomorrow for the final blah-blah-blah.\"\n \n There are apparently only a certain number of answering lines for each contestant. Now think about this: if you listen to the recording all the way through before hanging up, you are hogging the line that extra number of seconds which prevent someone else from calling in - and casting another vote for that candidate. So, if you really want your desired candidate to win, you should hang up before the recording finishes to free the line.\n \n If you were one of the riggers with a 'war dialer' system, you would program the computer to call the number, and upon answering, hang up right away. The quicker it hangs up, the quicker the line is free to get another vote in.\n \n It's very simple. All it takes is some simple thinking it through and anyone can logically conclude all this.",
