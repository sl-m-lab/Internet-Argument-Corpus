Where are you going to, John?\"\n \n \"Oh, I'm going to Rio.\"\n \n \"What the hell are you going to Rio for?\"\n \n McCain, a married father of three, shrugs.\n \n \"I got a better chance of getting laid.\"\n \n ...\n \n If heroism is defined by physical suffering, Carol McCain is every bit her ex-husband's equal. Driving alone on Christmas Eve 1969, she skidded out on a patch of ice and crashed into a telephone pole. She would spend six months in the hospital and undergo 23 surgeries. The former model McCain bragged of to his buddies in the POW camp as his \"long tall Sally\" was now five inches shorter and walked with crutches.\n \n By any standard, McCain treated her contemptibly. Whatever his dreams of getting laid in Rio, he got plenty of XXX during his command post in Jacksonville. According to biographer Robert Timberg, McCain seduced his conquests on off-duty cross-country flights &#8212; even though adultery is a court-martial offense. He was also rumored to be romantically involved with a number of his subordinates.\n \n ...\n \n \"I'll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital,\" he later admitted pleading with his captors. McCain now insists the offer was a bluff, designed to fool the enemy into giving him medical treatment. In fact, his wounds were attended to only after the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a Navy admiral. What has never been disclosed is the manner in which they found out: McCain told them. According to Dramesi, one of the few POWs who remained silent under years of torture, McCain tried to justify his behavior while they were still prisoners. \"I had to tell them,\" he insisted to Dramesi, \"or I would have died in bed.\"\n \n Dramesi says he has no desire to dishonor McCain's service, but he believes that celebrating the downed pilot's behavior as heroic &#8212; \"he wasn't exceptional one way or the other\" &#8212; has a corrosive effect on military discipline. \"This business of my country before my life?\" Dramesi says. \"Well, he had that opportunity and failed miserably. If it really were country first, John McCain would probably be walking around without one or two arms or legs &#8212; or he'd be dead.\"\n\n \n \nShow me something significantly bad about him...like maybe his long friendship with a known terrorist\n\n Done-Liddy.\n \n \nor his respect and admiration for a racist preacher,\n\n We'll just let his own words speak for him:\n McCain: racist, bigot & homophobe\n \nor his friendship and working with a radical like Louis Farakhan.\n\n Farakhan is about as radical as any of the \"religious right\" that McCain courts.",

   "G. Gordon Liddy is a saint compared to most of those listed in Obama's list of radicals.\n\n From Wikipedia link:\n \n At CRP, Liddy concocted several plots, some far-fetched, intended to embarrass the Democratic opposition. These included firebombing the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. (where classified documents leaked by Daniel Ellsberg were being stored), kidnapping anti-war protest organizers and transporting them to Mexico during the Republican National Convention (which at the time was planned for San Diego), and luring mid-level Democratic campaign officials to a house boat in Baltimore where they would be secretly photographed in compromising positions with call girls. Most of Liddy's ideas were rejected, but a few were given the go ahead by Nixon Administration officials, including the break-in at Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office. Ellsberg had leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times.\n\n Worse than the behavior of Ayers? Perhaps not, but nobody deserves to be called a saint in any context if they promote ideas like those mentioned above. \n \n \nMcCain is certainly not a perfect man. Show me something significantly bad about him...like maybe his long friendship with a known terrorist or his respect and admiration for a racist preacher, or his friendship and working with a radical like Louis Farakhan.\n\n I could bring up McCain's direct involvement with the U.S. Council for World Freedom:\n \nThis branch has generated controversy, as it has been found to have illegally supplied firearms to guerillas in the Iran-Contra Affair and, in 1981, the USCWF was placed under watch by the Anti-Defamation League, which noted the organization had increasingly become a point of contact for extremists, racists and anti-Semites.\n\n I could bring up McCain's courting of controversial pastors John Hagee and Rod Parsley, or that the preacher Thomas Muthee, who blessed Sarah Palin, was responsible for leading an actual witch hunt that drove a woman from her home:\n \n...they came to believe that a witch known as \"Mama Jane\" was the cause of crime and spiritual oppression in the area. Muthee alleged that \"top government and business leaders [were] afraid to do anything without her approval,\" that at least one person per month would die in a car accident in front of her \"divination house\" (otherwise known as Emmanuel Clinic), and that she harassed his congregation. Muthee made a public demand that either Mama Jane convert to Christianity or leave town, declaring, \"Mama Jane either gets saved and serve the Lord, or she leaves town! There is no longer room in Kiambu for both of us!\". Soon after his followers began to pray that God would either save or oust Mama Jane, three young people died in another apparent accident in front of Mama Jane's clinic, according to Muthee's account. The angry townsfolk wanted to stone her in retaliation, and when the police entered Mama Jane's home to intervene, they were apparently startled by what they believed to be a demon and shot her pet python to death. Mama Jane was then questioned by police, after which she left town. Since then, Muthee has frequently referred to this event as an example of successful spiritual warfare.\n\n \n But when it comes down to it, I really don't care about these connections either way. They have no impact on who I want to vote for, and I think that most people who are more worried about their savings really don't care about this stuff either. Frankly, I believe Bill Ayers did some despicable things in decades past, but he is elderly and irrelevant now. I would have no problem with anybody serving on a board with that man (as many Republicans have without reservations about his past), especially one like the Chicago Annenburg Challenge, a clearly non-political group dedicated to funding education.\n \n I would like to address the link you posted about Obama's \"associates\". Unfortunately, I do not use Internet Explorer so I can't see specifically what it says about each of those individuals. I am inclined to believe, however, that the page as a whole is a product of inaccurate propaganda, as one of those photos is labeled \"Odinga.\" I assume that is Raila Odinga, who some have attempted to link to Obama and shady political dealings in Kenya. This link has been shown to be false.",

CLINTON DENIED AN INNOCENT MAN HIS FREEDOM\n \n By Steve Dunleavy\n New York Post\n Saturday, June 2, 1996\n \n The bombshell Whitewater convictions that may be President Clinton's darkest\n hour gave a middle-aged Arkansas housewife her brightest moment.\n \n \"Now that the Clinton people are going to jail, maybe my husband will go \n free,\" Mary Lou Dumond told me.\n \n Her husband, Wayne Dumond, 49, has just spent his 11th year in an Arkansas \n jail. Many say Dumond is the victim of one of the most bone-crunching and \n infuriating examples of Clinton-era justice the country has ever seen. And \n now, because Clinton's alleged bagman, Gov. Jimmy Guy Tucker, is going to \n jail, Dumond is set to see freedom.\n \n \"The new governor, Mike Huckabee, has assured me Wayne will be a free man,\" \n Mrs. Dumond said Thursday. \"He is not one of the Clinton crowd. He is a \n very fair man. He has always been disturbed about the way the Clinton \n people never wanted my husband free,\" she added.\n \n And there was a very good reason for the Clinton people not wanting her \n husband to go free.\n \n THE CHARGES\n The story of Wayne Dumond is not for the innocent eyes of the young -- but \n every adult of voting age should read closely.\n \n These are the cold facts as an Arkansas court saw it:\n * A 17-year-old girl says she was kidnapped and raped on Sept. 11, 1984, \n in Forrest City, Ark.\n * Dumond, father of six, Vietnam veteran, churchgoer, was convicted in \n August 1985 of the rape. He was sentenced to life plus 20 years.\n * An appeal by Dumond, under Gov. Clinton, got a response of \"No merit.\"\n \n What the public did not see, while Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, \n were the following very unpretty facts -- which Clinton, despite countless \n personal appeals, ignored:\n * The victim identified two other men as her rapist but they had ironclad \n alibis and were set free.\n * She failed to pick Dumond as her rapist when presented with a lineup.\n * A genetic expert stated unequivocally that sperm found on the girl's \n jeans could not \"in a million years\" belong to Dumond.\n * The father of the girl is a millionaire and one of Clinton's biggest\n contributors.\n \n But guess what? The girl is Bill Clinton's cousin. And her mother worked \n as part of Clinton's inner circle when he was governor.\n \n The worst was yet to come.\n \n THE HORROR\n On March 7, 1985, while Dumond was awaiting trial, two masked men with guns \n and knives burst into his house. They hog-tied him. They raped him. And \n then, with surgical scalpels, they castrated him. The two monsters acted on \n the orders of local Sheriff Coolidge Conlee.\n \n The sheriff retrieved Dumond's testicles from Dumond's blood-spattered house. \n \n The sheriff then placed the body parts in a jar that he displayed on his desk\n with the admonition: \"That's what happens to people who fool around in my\n county.\"\n \n The sheriff actually took that jar to \"a good-ol'-boys wedding.\"\n \n That is a fact.\n \n No reaction whatsoever from Gov. Clinton.\n \n The sheriff would later be nabbed by the FBI for unrelated extortion and \n drug-dealing and sentenced to 160 years in jail, where he died of natural\n causes. [sic]\n \n Dumond's attackers were never picked up even though one of them confessed to \n a state cop.\n \n All this and Dumond still rotted away in prison. And Clinton, both as \n governor and president, ignored facts that surrounded the case of the rape \n of his cousin.\n \n \"Bitter? Hell yes, I was at first,\" Dumond told me from prison at Varner in\n Arkansas. \"But now, I think, I hope, things will change around. With Jimmy \n Guy Tucker gone as governor, one of Clinton's men, and Mr. Clinton running \n for cover, maybe the new man will have another look.\"\n \n \"But, strange as it may seem, it hasn't been all that bad these days. I have\n got a very good education in here. I think I am becoming a computer nut. I \n just miss my family, my kids.\"\n \n \"That girl? Well it's pretty ridiculous. Sad, but ridiculous. She told the\n police that a man in a new red pickup truck, with no tailgate, drove to her \n house, burst in, forced her into her car, drove in her car to some woods, \n tied her up, committed a pretty terrible act, drove her back in her car and \n took off in her car and dumped it nearby.\n \n \"Well I drove a very old dirty brown pickup truck with a tailgate. Now, if I\n took her car, what happened to the pickup I drove to her house in? She \n changed her story, how many times? I mean, many times.\n \n \"She was with this guy driving through town and suddenly, out of nowhere, \n months after, she saw me driving my old pickup truck. She told the guy out \n of nowhere: `That's the man that did it.'\n \n \"She said I had raped her. When it came to the lineup. She couldn't \n identify me. Suddenly she disappears into a room with her father and a cop \n who showed her a picture of me. She came out and immediately identified me.\"\n \n THE CONVICTION\n This outrageous identifying scam was exposed by a local cop who witnessed it \n all. Deputy Sheriff Henry Leary had the guts to go against his own and told \n the world of the scenario. Dumond was still convicted.\n \n \"Oh, yeah,\" Dumond said, \"she identified two other guys who were the rapists. \n They had an ironclad alibi. Then it came to me.\"\n \n Dumond was still convicted. Gov. Clinton remained silent. But of course at \n that time nobody knew that the girl was Clinton's cousin. The governor \n didn't mention it.\n \n After 4-1/2 years, with his freedom gone, his manhood gone, a five-person \n parole board recommended that Dumond go free for time served.\n \n John R. Steer, managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, records the \n following reaction from then-Gov. Clinton: \"Clinton had a romping, stomping \n fit. The victim was a distant cousin and St. Francis County [where all this \n took place] had a lot of votes and he deeply resented being under pressure \n to free Dumond.\"\n \n Clinton refused to sign a release. And Dumond rotted.\n \n Dumond has since been before the parole board twice.\n \n \"They ask me: `Do you have any remorse? Well, I tell them straight. How \n can I have remorse for something I didn't do? No sir, I will stay here until\n I die before I say I am sorry for something I haven't done.\"\n \n The day of the castration is not something that should be dealt with in \n detail.\n \n \"My two boys, Michael and Joey, found me there after coming home from school. \n \n They cut me loose and got help.,\" he said. \"Sure I remember it, but do you \n really want to know the details?\"\n \n Dumond's life was miraculously saved after he lost three-quarters of his \n blood. As he lay near death, Sheriff Coolidge Conlee displayed Dumond's \n testicles in a jar.\n \n Still no reaction from Gov. Clinton.\n CLICK HERE FOR LINK:\n NOW THAT'S ABUSE OF POWER!!!",
