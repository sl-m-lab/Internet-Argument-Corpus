The supposition that you might as well believe whatever it is they do believe because there is no disproof of it has to be one of the weakest of such attempts.

   "actually, jyoshu is right in the definition of atheists. an atheist is one who believes that there is no god. one who does not have a belief about the existence of god, or believes that the existence of god is unknown, is an agnostic. if you cannot say that you believe god does not exist, you are wrongly labelling yourself as an atheist\n\n \n Well, let's not get into semantic fights about precise definitions -- English is just not that precise a language, and there is usually plenty of room for slight difference of opinion on a meaning. Suffice it to say that my understanding of atheist encompasses a range from people who assert a strong, positive belief that a deity does not and cannot exist; through people who simply have no belief in a deity or think the evidence for a deity is so non-existent, and the reasoning so flaccid, there is no point in believing in one; to people who are philosophically agnostic but functionally atheist. A \"true\" philosophical agnostic is someone who professes a belief that there isn't enough evidence for or against the existence of a deity, so no opinion may be legitimately held either way. To an agnostic, the existence of a deity is not only unknown but possibly unknowable.\n \n In practice, I find most people who insist on being regarded as agnostics are functional atheists in everything else. Maybe it boils down to how strongly people feel about a belief, and so I often find it helpful to talk about strong vs. weak atheists, depending on the dogmatism and certitude with which they assert their beliefs. And of course, if you define non-belief as a belief of sorts, then I suppose everyone would be a believer in something, but that doesn't really help us much in distinguishing between various types of belief, if everything humans think (or don't think) is classified semantically as a belief. \n \n I tend to regard \"belief in\" something as a considerably stronger, more positive statement than \"non-belief in\" something, which is weaker again than \"disbelief in\" something; and non-belief is also (IMO) a differentiable state from a formal agnostic position asserting lack of evidence but willingness in principle to go either way. (For example, I am a strong disbeliever in Creationism, a mild-mannered agnostic with respect to the real-world, physical implications of quantum theory, and a non-believer in alien visitations to earth -- I value the nuances here.) But maybe that's just me, and it really isn't worth arguing semantics too strenuously, just so long as folk understand where everyone else is coming from.",

Atheists often agree on many basics, but there is simply no atheistic cannon of beliefs that atheists are expected to hold. \n \n To imagine the full richness of any individual atheist's philosophy can be summarised in a pithy dictionary definition which attempts to encapsulate as briefly as possible the lowest common denominator of atheism, is dismissive at best, and contemptuous at worst. There's a lot more to every atheist's philosophy than just the absence of belief in, or even the stronger denial of deities; but there is no such thing as a unitary philosophy of atheism.\n \n Unless, of course, in this reprehensibly modern age, sound bites have turned into philosophies.",

I use the word atheist as a shorthand to classify myself for others who might want to know which general direction I'm coming from, but they shouldn't read too much into that. I have some sympathy with Shermer here, but I suspect most folk will not see the nuances he's talking about.\n\n \n Part of the problem is that 'atheist' as a term has come to carry a certainly amount of negative baggage in our society. There is an unfair perception out there about the term, and religious people at times have contributed to it by vilifying the term and unnecessarily associating it with things like communism. Then again, people like Hitchens and Dawkins have contributed as well over the last few years with the pro-active \"attack\" approach.\n \n I can see how the issue of \"atheist\" being a too-limited term could be troublesome and frustrating--I think religious people sometimes have to deal with the same problems in terms of terminology. I think Shermer has a good idea there. There's no reason anyone has to consider themselves in a linguistic box limited only by the terms society thinks should be prescribed, in terms of self-description.\n \n Still, when someone's statements line up much more with agnosticism than what is generally defined as atheism, it seems appropriate to call it agnosticism. Perhaps it's splitting hairs, but there's nothing wrong with trying to get to accurate terminology.",

When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.\"\n\n Maybe not a perfect solution, but the event would have to be so extraordinary that no ordinary explanation would suffice. For example, if god should appear and mix a bunch of chemicals together and create a man in front of our eyes, I'd probably accept that science would be extremely unlikely to come up with a natural explanation for it.

Well, it might be evidence for some technology so far advanced it might as well be god compared to us, especially if someone came along and explained to us why they'd stopped the earth from spinning.

That's a stretch.\n\n \n I'm saying that my premise was always that God is real. Look, like many people, I was raised with that understanding. You too may have started with that early in life. But over the years I've certainly questioned it (as I think most people do), and concluded that God is real based on answered prayers and the way things have happened in life over the years that can't possibly be coinicidence, as well as knowing other people who have had similar experiences.\n \n \nThe atheist starts with no such assumption.\n Well, actually, this atheist started with the same assumption that you did, that god exists. I questioned that assumption when it didn't make sense.\n\n \n Right; and the difference therefore, is that we came to different conclusions.\n \n \nThere are plenty of reasons to think that the god of the bible does not exist, what are you saying?

I'm sure there are people out there that do substitute prayer for medical care, but from what I've seen they are enough of the exception that it's very much of a peripheral issue. \n\n I'm sure you've heard of the Christian Scientists? They're all about healing through prayer, and in fact are often in trouble with the law over child neglect when they refuse to bring their sick children to see a doctor.\n \n \n\n With that in mind, we should not seek to discourage prayer if that's what people want to do, but rather encourage people to also take steps to solve a problem on their own in cases where that's a problem. The solution doesn't have to be \"prayer is bad.\" The issue there is that they should be seeking medical care, not that they shouldn't be praying. \n\n No one is saying that prayer, in and of itself, is bad. But belief that something can help you when it really can't? That can be harmful if you rely on it too much. No one here is trying to stop people from praying, we're just trying to put prayer in the proper perspective; something that doesn't work in any reasonable sense of the term.",

No worse than a lucky rabbit's foot.\n \n But there can be problems from counting on prayer or superstition to solve problems. I have a friend who escaped kind of a crazy family of fundamentalists. They are intensely nuts. They have disowned my friend as he doesn't align himself with their beliefs. The parents and one brother are always giving money to the church and are broke. They barely scrape by. They spend huge amounts of time volunteering for the church. They have no financial plans for the future. My friend is truly concerned about their impoverishment. They are, however, quite confident the Lord will provide as long as they pray. They are likely not alone in this behavior.\n \n Now these might just be stupid, incompetent people who happen to be religious, but there can be some harm if faith in prayer inhibits someone from trying to address their problems themselves.",

I ran to the bathroom, the source of the sound, and saw her sitting in the tub with her hair dyed purple. A moment's deep breath and I realized her hair was not purple. She had slipped and fallen into the tub and cut her forehead. I saw the blood and my brain somehow parsed this as dye, and filled in the color on her hair.\n ( The injury wasn't serious, by the way)\n \n My point? Brains don't work well when we've just woken up. They often make erronious connections, make leaps that don't really follow, or miss the obvious. If you want a mundane explanation, that's it. You woke up from a dream bad enough that you shook the bed, and it being 2 in the morning both you and your wife weren't parsing things well. The shaking of the bed freaked you both out enough, and you were both groggy enough, that you didn't quite catch on that you were causing it. If you're looking for a mundane explanation, that seems the most plausible to me. If you want something beyond the mundane, that you already have. But simply put, I wouldn't trust my recollection of something weird that woke me up at 2 in the morning; anything that didn't make sense I would chalk up to my brain not being up to speed yet. But that's just me, without sitting down with you and talking this over with you in depth I don't think I could come up with anything else.",
