   "America has been consuming on borrowed and inflated money, essentially taking consumption from the rest of the world, especially China. Industries around the world relying on this artificial American consumption have collapsed.\n \n As we return to a normal state of affairs, the Chinese will be able to spend this money on themselves. But what will they buy?\n \n A few things immediately come to mind:[*]Cars[*]Houses[*]Electronics\n but they can produce these things themselves, cheaper than they could be made overseas, regardless of Our Lord and Saviour Obama's fascisation of the automobile industry. The idea that the US will be a major producer of these goods for China strikes me as a joke.\n \n There are two things the Chinese will want that they themselves can't produce in sufficient quantities, or cheaply enough, that represent export opportunity for American producers.\n \n 1) Food. The average person in China eats far less calories than the average person in a developed nation, and that intake will certainly rise. Their current consumption is also disproportionately grain-heavy, and as disposable incomes rise, they will consume vastly more\n a) Meat\n b) Oils\n c) Sugar\n d) Premium food products such as Cocoa & Coffee\n e) Alcohol\n f) Fruit\n \n 2) Oils and Minerals - everything from petrol for fuel to copper and steel.\n \n I'm sure there will be countless more minor industries riding on the backs of these two (eg, heightened agricultural development driving biotechnology), but I'm sure if the US is to recover, it will be through these two giants.\n \n That doesn't mean the US needs to return to an agrarian society, full of small community farmers and crusty fossickers striking black gold with their pickaxes, of course, I'm sure it will all be highly corporatised.\n \n If I were confident the US government wasn't going to crush what was left of the economy there entirely, I would love to be in a primary industry in the US right now, there's one of the biggest opportunities for growth and profit in the history of the world shown up on their doorstep.\n \n Instead I'm sure the America's supply of capital will be diverted into pointless make-work projects, and countries like Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and Russia will be the main beneficiaries, but the opportunity is there.",
