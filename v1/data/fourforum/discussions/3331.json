   "aaargh, I messed up when I voted.\n \n I wanted to vote \"It needs to be more complicated than that.\"\n \n It's basically a yes, but here's my proposal:\n \n 1.Can only be considered an option one week before brain activity starts (unfortunately, we don't know when brain activity starts yet)\n 2.A doctor may recommend the option of abortion, but it's still the potental mother's choice\n 3.If a potential mother requests an abortion, she must have a valid reason to have it. I think doctors should go through this in their training.\n 4.If the potential mother requests an abortion, and the doctor thinks it's a valid reason, she needs to get some counciling about the psychological and physical symptoms. Don't know how long (means that the mother should determine if she wants to have that baby way before that one week)\n \n Why?\n \n Some mothers need abortion. Like if they are being drained of nutrition. Or she's dying because of the baby, she's not providing enough for the baby (can't get the nutrition needed for it). And other various reasons\n \n It's technically not killing. Killing means making it dead. For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition).

This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.",

However, as the debate about wild possibilities existing goes, there are the more threatening dangers of abortion. Which, by the way, are much more likely than a flying pig.:) \n \n Whether the abortion is early or not, the procedures can do multiple things. For instance, her fertility and conception cycles can be messed up, preventing conception later in life when she does want to get pregnant. She could be psychologically damaged by this for life, not counting the rape experience. Month-long lasting pains. Severe depression, guilt and the possibility that she will feel guilty and blame herself for her baby's death.\n \n Carrying the baby to term may be painful, but once she has given birth, she may find herself much better off bearing a new life. This has happened before, though I'm not sure if it's as likely to happen as abortion damages. But if not, she may give the baby up for adoption. I don't believe she should be charged with its total care considering her age, her own parents would have to take care of that. But considering how we can tract rapers, that man should be forced to help support it.\n \n To answer the question \"Should she be forced to carry the baby to term\", I don't think that's quite the right way of asking it. A 13 year old girl is not going to automatically think of killing her baby. Her parents and friends and other family relations may persuade her (and force her sometimes) to have an abortion against her will. (She is not getting the support she would want during such a time, and the girl would give in to them since she's only getting prods toward the clinic. She has nobody to help her.)\n \n The question should rather be this: \"Should she be prohibited from carrying a baby to term.\" A girl so young will not think of killing her baby, the family will try and force the procedure on her. They're more concerned for their own reputations more than they are for her. You should try a different scenario, Ooaman.",

They're more concerned for their own reputations more than they are for her. You should try a different scenario, Ooaman.\n\n Let me just say that the scenario was based on a slight possibility. While a 13 year old more than likely wouldn't think of killing the baby, there are already certain dangers that would come from a 13 year old being pregnant in the first place. While she may be biologically ready, she may not be mentally ready. Or she could be. Technically, she is going to be ridiculed by almost everyone being in middle school or around that age no matter how she handles it. If she got an abortion, she would be ridiculed for murdering an innocent child. If she carried it to term, she would be ridiculed for being pregnant while in middle school/out of wedlock/at the age of 13 (you get the idea.) That is one reason why I used the word \"forced.\"\n Now predominately I would consider myself pro life. If you have questions about the word predominately, it's because I think there are some occasions where it is a necessity. For example, if the woman's life is in danger because of where the fetus is located or what ever other problem, I don't think that she should be ridiculed. By the way, there is a specific word for that and it does happen often where the egg fertilizes in the wrong place. But with a rape, there is a difference between rape and consensual sex. (Of course with the 13 year old girl, it's a rape anyway by default unless the guy was no older than 14.) Consensual means that it was chosen by both. In a rape, the girl didn't choose anything. I just wanted to get a response on that idea. Myself, I don't think anything should be forced upon her. If she is able to carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption, that would be great. I personally don't know about adoption agencies though (trust wise; but that's another story.)\n But in all honesty, I was a little disturbed by this quote...\n \nBut considering how we can tract rapers, that man should be forced to help support it.\n\n Since this guy would probably already have one warped mind, I don't think I would want him any where near the child at all. It would be bad enough for the child that the child would have his genes. (But once again, that's another issue.)\n I have another scenario but for another thread.",

   "Here is a real scenario:\n \n San Jose, February 2003- A nine-year-old girl who is pregnant after being raped on a coffee plantation in Costa Rica will not have an abortion, her doctors have decided.\n \n Dubbed \"Rosa\" by her physicians to protect her identity, the girl - whose family came here as migrant labourers from poorer neighbouring Nicaragua - is under observation at a San Jose public hospital in this small, predominantly Roman Catholic Central American country.\n \n After medical exams and psychiatric care, doctors decided abortion was out of the question given her condition and under Costa Rican law, which bans abortion after 12 weeks.\n \n Allegedly raped by a 20-year-old farmhand in Turrialba, east of the capital, \"Rosa\" is now 12 weeks pregnant.\n \n \"From three months into the pregnancy, the law does not allow for abortions, and in any case it would not be prudent,\" said Henry Troper, one of her paediatricians, without addressing the fact that her pregnancy would be close to mandated deadlines for abortion here.\n \n \"Her pregnancy is proceeding normally. We are going to monitor her and the fetus very carefully. It is a very delicate situation,\" allowed Gerardo Escalante, the director of the maternity unit at the hospital.\n \n \"This girl does not know what has happened to her, and does not know what is ahead of her. She is going to need very special attention,\" so psychological care will be key in coming months, said Eliseo Vargas, head of the Costa Rican Social Security network that runs the hospital.\n \n Escalante said doctors had recommended that she go home with her parents, since remaining in the hospital would be even more traumatic than the close follow-up care she will require.\n \n But that may not be easy because her parents - mildly alarmed by the media frenzy her case has stirred in this normally quiet country - want to go back to Nicaragua to escape the media spotlight.\n \n And the parents have cast doubt on the supposed suspect in the rape case, telling reporters on Friday \"nobody is to blame\".\n \n The key suspect maintains he is innocent and has said he will take every test possible to prove his point.\n \n In Nicaragua, the Women Against Violence Network has urged the government to get involved, arguing the girl effectively is being held in Costa Rica for migration reasons.\n \n After condemning the rape, the Costa Rican Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference said in a statement \"no child can be killed, even if it is to save the life of the mother\".\n \n In the end, the girl fortunately had an abortion.",

   "1) - The two points are unrelated. In the first instance, it appears we can agree that knowing an outcome is possible does not mean we consent to that outcome. \n\n \n Yes it does. You have sex, you know you run the risk of pregnancy, you get pregnant, you live with it. Nobody forces another person to walk down an alleyway where you can get mugged. You can still charge the mugger with a crime anyway, no police officer would say the mugger didn't do something wrong. In sex, nobody did anything wrong. Both were aware of the consequences, both had a chance to decide not to run the risk and both went ahead anyway. That is called consent, no matter how you look at it.\n \n \nKnowing it is possible to become pregnant does not mean we choose to become pregnant every time we have sex. The second point is seperate, since whether we chose it or not, we now have a situation to deal with. \n\n \n Well let's look at the first point again.\n \n If you don't want to become pregnant, and if it is so horrible to be pregnant, why have sex? The risk is too great to go through something like pregnancy. This is, at least, what a lot of people make it out to be. They really only make themselves look stupid when they try to defend the irresponsible person's involved.\n \n The two points are linked, and both should be discussed before sex. Sex is not a wood-dee-doo playtime for men and women to have a few minutes of pleasure and then kill the baby because they didn't want it. \n \n \n2) - I'm of the opinion that (a) the caregiver should take all reasonable steps to care for the person recieving care, and that if the caregiver wishes to cease providing that care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure another caregiver takes up that responsibility, and that (b) being pregnant for nine months is in no way a reasonable step. \n\n \n A - That makes sense. Though, in an abortion, that does not seem like care. (let me know if I read that the wrong way)\n \n B - It's more reasonable than killing in any case.\n \n \nTo translate, if a woman becomes pregnant and wishes to no longer be pregnant, then she can get an abortion if she wishes, as it is the only possible way to remove the unborn baby from her care. It would be unreasonable to expect her to carry the baby to term, and it would be positively draconian to force her to do so. I am in support, however, of C-section deliveries being required before an abortion can be considered, where applicable. \n\n \n I'm in favor of C-Sections too. They're pretty dangerous, but at least the baby has a better chance to live.\n \n If the woman has a baby, than it is draconian to think that she should be allowed to kill just because she doesn't feel like putting up with it. You be irresponsible, you bear the consequences. That just sounds like applauding irresponsibility and selfishness to the point of killing to me.\n \n \nHow would you make them? It would certainly be a good idea to encourage it (consideration for possible outcomes) but it is impossible to make it a requirement before having sex. \n\n \n No it isn't. It wasn't that way before Roe V. Wade when the majority of women who had abortions were rape victims and abortion was (for the most part) illegal. More people thought about that sort of thing then because the penalties for doing so were in plain view. Now, with this free pass to life without responsbility, people can have sex as much as they want, and they don't have to bear the consequences of their actions. Making it illegal would certainly make the numbers drop, and it would make more people think before having sex willy-nilly.\n \n \n And even then, as we discovered above, considering and acknowledging an outcome does not mean we consent to it. We put on a seatbelt every time we get in a car, because we know it's possible we will have an accident. That doesn't mean we consent to getting T-boned at an intersection. \n\n \n A good driver who takes care of himself is safe. But another person coming along and hitting him is the other man's fault.

You live with it.\n \n \nboth had a chance to decide not to run the risk and both went ahead anyway.

After all, there is no distinction.\n \n \nIf you don't want to become pregnant, and if it is so horrible to be pregnant, why have sex?\n\n \n That is not relevant to the first point. Does acknowleding an outcome is possible (any outcome, any outcome at all) equate to consent for that outcome? You say yes for pregnancy, but not for mugging. What about a skydiver whose parachute fails to deploy? He knew it was a possibility when he jumped, so he just lives with it? What about someone who has their credit card number stolen by a dodgy waiter at a restaurant? The customer knew it was possible, so he consented to the theft?\n \n It is patently ridiculous to insist that knowing one could become pregnant equals consent to that pregnancy. It simply doesn't hold water. You yourself said that logic was completely faulty, until you realised that meant your own argument was faulty, and now you've done a backflip.\n \n Acknowledging something does not mean you consent to it.\n \n \n \nA - That makes sense. Though, in an abortion, that does not seem like care. (let me know if I read that the wrong way)\n \n B - It's more reasonable than killing in any case.\n\n \n This is where the conversation with most pro-lifers and myself ends. Forcing someone to go through nine months of pregnancy to save another persons life is, to me, completely unreasonable.\n \n \nIf the woman has a baby, than it is draconian to think that she should be allowed to kill just because she doesn't feel like putting up with it. You be irresponsible, you bear the consequences. That just sounds like applauding irresponsibility and selfishness to the point of killing to me.\n\n \n As I said above, once she no longer wishes to care for that baby, and has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that someone else can care for it which, in the case of an early pregnancy, is impossible, then there must exist the option for her to cease caring for that baby. The only decision that then remains is how best to humanely kill the baby and remove it from the mothers body.\n \n The only point of argument between us will be our definitions of 'reasonable'. I consider it completely unreasonable to force a woman to go through a pregnancy for nine months to save another persons life, especially when she may not have consented to that pregnancy.\n \n If that same woman were to come across a car accident, she has no legal or moral obligation to do anything for the victims, even if through her inaction one or more of them dies. She isn't required to care for them for nine months just because she happened to find them. There was an instance recently where mountain climbers on Mount Everest encountered another climber in distress. Rather than abandon their climb, they left him to die. Granted, it was extremely unlikely they would have been able to save him, but applying your logic universally, those climbers should have been charged and tried for murder. \n \n Following on from that, if a nine month pregnancy is 'reasonable' to save one persons life, surely it is 'reasonable' for everyone in the western world to donate 50% of their entire estate to buy polio vaccines for third world children? That would be much less risky than a pregnancy, and save many more lives.\n \n If someone who doesn't want a pregnancy to save one life is murderer, what is someone who'd rather buy petrol (gas) for their car, or dog food, than spend the money on food and medicine for starving and sick children? A mass murderer?",

With the upmost and sincere respect Prototype, there is great joy to be found in sex and perhaps one day your rigid views on sex will become a little more flexible. You may wish to have sex solely to connect with someone and the idea that you may have a child as a result of that act will not be at the forefront of your mind nor will it be an idea that you embrace.\n \n I read with interest some of the sites you have posted links to and the commentaries by women who regret their abortions. I am very saddened by their stories. However, many of the women do not seem like they were able to make the decision to have an abortion healthily.(did I just make up a word?) Outside influences, lack of finances, shame, age, parents (get an abortion or move out!) all kinds of terrible reasons led many of these women to regret their abortions.\n \n I hate these reaons women get abortions, but they are true nonetheless. I know you certainly don't think any of these \"justifies killing someone\" but it's still happening. This is why we need to respond to these reasons in a better way than outlawing abortions. Women will still have these problems, and they will continue on after their pregnancy and effect the children. If you were broke before the pregnancy, you will be afterwards. If you are very young before the pregnancy, you are still afterwards. If you are shamed by family, you will still be afterwards. If you ...well, you get the idea.\n \n So you say adoption. Yes, adoption is a great alternative to parenting. But that's not helping mom and ultimately baby during pregnancy. If you want the best chances for baby, how will you help mom (and dad)?\n \n I say, free and abundant birth control. People aren't all of a sudden going to go bonkers and have \"wood-dee-doo playtime\" because they aren't going to get pregnant. There's a whole lot more reasons to not have sex than getting pregnant. :)",
