   "There is no need for the ALDS, ALCS, NLDS and NLCS. They clutter baseball and cheapen the World Series. The World Series is no more than a postseason tournament. A team may finish 20 games in front in their league and not make it to the World Series. Another team may play under .500 ball during the season, get hot and win the World Series. It is screwed up. Let's go back to the way it was, the best team from the American League playing the best team from the National League in the World Series after a 162 game season.",

Let's go back to the way it was, the best team from the American League playing the best team from the National League in the World Series after a 162 game season.\n\n \n The point is you play very different teams than teams in other divisions do. What happens when you're in the AL East where you've gotta play the Red Sox and Yankees and the AL Central with the Tigers and the White Sox several times a year compared to the AL West where they play Oakland as their toughest divisional opponent. The playoffs make the regular season mean something (8 out of 30 make it, so you still have to do well in the season) but also offer a little excitement, do-or-die baseball. It's whole other game when there's that much pressure. When it's a must-win game, the pitchers' leashes are tighter, and there's much more managerial skill involved. While it is somewhat of a pity that for example who goes to the World Series will be determined by who plays best in the next 3 innings (if there are no extra innings), there's also a bit of excitement to playoff ball. Even though the world series is soon, both teams are playing like there is no tommorrow.",

   "How could you think that baseball would be better without playoffs?! Teams live for the playoffs! The Series doesn't even matter until halfway through the playoffs. Like zachvac said, only 8 out of 30 teams make it to the playoffs to begin with, and the best two will go to the Series. \n \n The whole basis of excitement during the playoffs is thinking that the worst team will get hot and go all the way! How many times in baseball history have the underdogs won the whole thing? When you watch baseball on t.v., you naturally pick which team you want to win. The suspension of the game, and the fact that momentum could change at any second is so exciting!\n \n As a baseball player in high school, I live to go to the playoffs in May. The teams don't think about the State Championship from their first tournament. It's all about getting to \"play in May\". Major League Baseball is the same way. Those guys don't want to think about the Series on Opening Day. They only want to play well enough during the 162 season games so that they can play in October. Baseball should keep the playoffs, so that the game can stay exciting!",
