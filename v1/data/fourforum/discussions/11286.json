There's a lot of it in the EU. Ask the Irish, the Scots, the Basques, the the the.... Or, there is very little of it. Depends on perspective. The state always oppresses, even when it just oppresses you by fining you for driving too fast.\n \n Me, I see two possibilities: one big state that oppresses to a certain measure or two dozen smaller states that also oppress, each in its own way. I prefer one big state. At least then, you don't get the other big states playing the smaller states one against the other to protect their own interests.\n \n With the EU, we see that the original idea was: prevent European wars. It managed to do that rather spectacularly. However, as it was formed on such a free and voluntary basis, it is as a result very inefficient. The inefficiencies arise from partial interests protected by members, like the French farmers.\n \n And I think that if these inefficiencies were removed, that'd be a good thing.\n \n Since oppression was opened: I want someone to oppress the nationalists who want to break everything up so they can finally get to fight each other. I want to oppress idiot masses who would rather listen to the prettiest bastard that stands in front of the microphone yelling which minorities we must oppress next. I want to oppress the traditionalists who force young girls to wear head scarves, and I want to oppress those who want to stop the girls from wearing the scarves if they themselves want to. My, what an oppressor I must be.\n \n Amazingly, I think there's a lot less oppression to be had from a single great state. You see, the great EU has not so many things in common. Those that are require relatively little oppression. It's the other ones, the ones that essentially put one part of the EU against the other, that I see as dangerously oppressive. And it's the people who believe in these that are opposed to the Lisbon treaty. Paradoxic indeed.\n \n P.S. Please, not Napoleon.

After WW2 these squables were supressed by the opresssion of eastern europe by the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the USSR those squabble have again broken out and we are again getting sucked into the quagmire.

This objective predates the rise of Hitler as can be seen if you look at the actions of the Weimar Republic to rearm and defy the Versailles Treaty before Hitler ever came onto the scene. Ideas of supremacy of one \"race\" over another remain rife throughout the Continent as has been repeatedly demonstrated by the Spanish, Italians and numerous Eastern European countries.\n The restablishment of the \"Roman Empire\" is the stated theme of the EU as declared unashamedly in the Treaty of Rome. However a more accurate description would be the Carolingian Empire under Charlemagne.\n \n By that point the primary military resource was as now oil, not coal, not steel which remained in excess of requirements throughout WW2 for both sides.\n \n Coal production for Germany was: \n 332800000 metric tons 1939\n 364800000 metric tons 1940\n 402800000 metric tons 1941\n 407800000 metric tons 1942\n 429000000 metric tons 1943\n 432800000 metric tons 1944\n 50300000 metric tons 1945\n In excess throughout.",
