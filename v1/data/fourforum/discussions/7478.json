   "http://www.truthtree.com/religdrlaura.shtml\n \n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them. \n \n Leviticus 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Indonesians, but not New Zealanders. Can you clarify? Why can't I own New Zealanders? \n \n My uncle, a farmer, blatantly violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). I have also heard him curse and blaspheme. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Leviticus 24:10-16). Couldn't I just smite them? \n \n When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this? \n \n I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? \n \n I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. \n \n I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself? \n \n A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? \n \n Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?",

People tend to \"pick and choose\" whatever scripture suits their lifestyle and positions and avoid those that don't. It's a common trait amongst people who use scripture to validate themselves.

People tend to view news programs that compliment their viewpoints and ostracize the ones that don't.

   "The problem that I see with James Kaufman (the author) is very simple. He is ignorant and he tries to make fun of something that he clearly doesn't have any clue about. For him to have any clue about the Torah commandments, he would first have need to read it and then study it, as well as the very large body of Jewish law interpreting the Torah commandments. Example: the Talmud and commentaries. However, if I were to make a guess about Mr. Kaufman, I would guess that he doesn't even read hebrew nor Aramaic which he would need to know in order to read the Talmud. Thus, Mr. Kaufman would do better to start learning the Hebew alphabet before asking idiotic questions. Nevertheless, here are the answers (not my own) to them. They contain some hebrew terms, which any serious student of Torah laws would know. I assume neither Mr. Kaufman nor Truthsayer is familiar with those terms, but I really don't feel like translating them or explaining them, since it would be a waste of my time anyway. \n \n \nAll that being said.....\n \n Can anyone address the questions posed in the opening post ...\n\n Sure. emoticon_xgood \n \n \n\n Leviticus 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Indonesians, but not New Zealanders. Can you clarify? Why can't I own New Zealanders? \n\n Selling people into slavery was put under gezerah at least in the times of Rabbi Yosef Caro who's Shulchan Aruch makes the ownership of slaves halachically impossible. The question, though well intendtioned, is today meaningless. Which you would know, if you had any minimal education about the Torah. \n \n \nMy uncle, a farmer, blatantly violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). I have also heard him curse and blaspheme. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Leviticus 24:10-16). Couldn't I just smite them? \n\n \n Before answering the first point, we must know: (1) Is your uncle Jewish? and (2) Is your uncle's farm in the Land of Israel? If the answer to (1) and (2) are both 'yes' then there is indeed a problem. In such a case, your uncle should (1) regret his previous mistakes and (2) till up the zerayah [seeds] (TB Zerayim]. Otherwise, the prohibition of kilayim does not apply to your uncle, his farm, or his produce. As for the wife's garment, there's no halachic problem with it on the sounds of it. The Torah prohibition of shatnez applies only to garments made from material of different biological kingdoms. For example, wool [animal] and linen [plant.] Cotton and polyester is not a problem. Cursing and blaspheming a lot can be equally remedied by the farmer regretting his past deed, and stopping. Plain and simple. \n \n \nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this? \n\n If you are Jewish, you shouldn't be offering any sacrifices outside of the Beis Hamikdash; so the question doesn't get to the real root of the problem. Otherwise, you're a Ben Noach and fully entitled to offer free will offerings anywhere within reason. In such a case, perhaps a mutually pleasant arrangement could be made between the two of you in a civil, and law-abiding manner. \n \n \nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? \n\n For the same reason that you can't sell New Zealanders as slaves. Because a gezerah exists on slavehood. \n \n \nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. \n\n Perhaps the laws of tacharat hamishpacha; which observant Jews have observed for at least 3,315 years, would help here. That is, of course, if you're Jewish. But if you're not Jewish then the law in question does not apply to you and so the question becomes meaningless. \n \n \nI have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself? \n\n First off, we have to know if you're neighbour's Jewish. If he is, there could be a problem. If he isn't, then his not keeping Shabbat is actually in compliance with Torah which forbids Gentiles from keeping the Sabbath. However, assuming that your neighbour was indeed born to a Jewish mother, Tractate Shabbat clearly states what process must happen before a person who is desecrating the Sabbath is to be punished for the desecration. First, the witness must be informed that what they are doing is an act of melocha [scecific act prohibited to be performed on the Sabbath], they must then continue to perform the act. Then, they must be brought to the attention of the Sanhedrin, etc. Since there is no Sanhedrin at this time, you cannot and should not do anything beyond reminding them that their actions are an act of creative work prohibited on the Sabbath. \n \n \nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? \n\n An abomination is an abomination is an abomination. Refer to the Jewish dietary laws which do not allow the consumption of shellfish. Then look up the laws of family purity (if you haven't already [refer 2 questions up]) and see that homosexual behaviour is equally prohibited and is equally 'not done.' \n \n Of course, as far as Gentiles are concerned, they are not prohibited from eating shellfish. They are, however, prohibited from engaging in homosexual activity, as laid down in the Sheva Mitsvoth B'nei Noach affirmed in TB Sanhedrin 59b and ratified as halacha in the Mishne Torah: Hilchot Melachim u'Milchamoteichem 9:7. \n \n \nLev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\n Why don't you try reading Leviticus 21:20, and the verses surrounding it, and answer this one for yourself. Keep in mind, that those verses only apply to Kohanim. So unless you are a descendant of Aaron, there is really no wiggle room for you. \n \n \n I know you're trying to be funny. Next time, though, try to find some questions that haven't been answered in three thousand years.",

Paul himself is considered an apostle both in the scriptures and by the Church because of his direct encounter with Christ in a special way. It is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like Paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.\n \n \nHe did no such thing.

That was God's choice. Simon (weak as a reed) was called to be Peter (strong as a rock), which prophetically was fulfilled in the Seat of Peter of the Church. Today, the Catholic Church is the only church that does not bow down to comply with the present unethical and immoral standards of worldly powers, and the lone voice constantly pointing to the truth and a beacon of light.\n \n \nThe longevity of the church is not a point to base on argument.

Buddhists, Taoism, Hindu and even Confucianism managed to survive without the corruption, persecution, stealing, murder and blatant disregard for the tenets of their religion. \n\n \n It is not merely time of longevity or existence just like any religion, but an apostolic succession, a claim of an uninterrupted and continuous line of succession extending from the twelve apostles through the bishops they ordained right up to the bishops of the present day. The apostles appointed the first bishops as their successors, granting to them their own teaching authority, which continues until the end of the age\n \n \nThe church has done a lot of good, but it has also done just as much evil. \n\n \n Like I said, the Church is holy because of Christ, but its body, the members are weak, sinful, and unreliable just like any one of us. But, this does not destroy the Church, which should be the case, therefore, a wonder.\n \n \nThere were very few Jews who followed Paul, most were gentiles who then taught Gentiles. It wasn't until the sack of Jerusalem that Jews having no place to worship God are told exposed to Christianity as being Judaism. \n\n \n This is true, because Paul's ministry was among the Gentiles, while Peter's among the Jews. Both Jews and Gentiles who were granted the apostolic authority by the apostles, had the same authority to teach and build communities.\n \n \nJames and Paul were both aware of the difference between the covenant and the law.

He intended for there to be his people and then those that were not. \n\n \n Covenant included laws that had to be obeyed by God's people to keep the covenant unbroken. Circumcision was just an external sign of belonging to such a group. Laws were broken and covenant was disregarded; therefore, the new covenant had to be established through Christ's blood on the cross.\n \n \nJames and Paul both deeply religious, Paul as you know persecuted those who strayed from the Jewish God and James is thought to have been incredibly righteous. They would have thought it proper and wise that everybody should worship their God. Being surrounded by Gentiles and watching the influence that they could do nothing about being a conquered nation it makes sense that they would resort to the only thing left to them to try and safeguard their faith. Notice how only gentiles were to be excused from the Law and the conditions of the covenant.\n\n \n All these are human conclusions that are baseless, to explain something you cannot reconcile.\n \n Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised (Rom.2:25). If the covenant is broken what use is the circumcision. If you are thrown out from the army for anti-national activities, what use is in wearing the army uniform?\n \n [/QUOTE]God made it very clear that those who were not were to be cut off from the people and that it was an everlasting sign. Paul tries to establish the Gentiles as being included by a kind of adoption by Jesus, but even if that were the case God made it clear any who came into the house of Jacob was to be circumcised, yet Paul makes sure that is not part of Christianity[/QUOTE]\n \n This is true, but only for a Jew within the confines of the Jewish law until the new covenant came into being. Since new covenant is more of a more superior kind (does not depend upon the mere observances of laws), the sign was also more of a spiritually symbolic type of belonging to the new covenant, namely, baptism, instead of circumcision of the flesh.\n \n \nSo you have never done something and afterward thought that was a good or bad thing? \n\n \n The \"afterward thought\" after a bad deed results from your inbuilt conscience, not simply flowered up. It was already there.\n \n \nMorality is primarily learned behavior that has evolved over the last 8 - 10,000 years. \n\n \n Morality cannot evolve upwards automatically, but can only go down. Just look at the world around you? Where has morality evolved? It has gone down to almost nil.\n \n \nWisdom is the passed on experience of one generation to the next building upon what was learned prior to our births. Wisdom will not sink us to many people who are incapable of compromise and cooperation. \n\n If understand it right, you are right here.\n \n \nWhat is he waiting for? \n\n \n Preaching of the good news.\n \n \nOr vice versa \n\n \n This is also correct.\n \n \nAs I have explained briefly no he didn't. Can you offer something to support that he did? \n\n \n In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\" Lk.22:20\n \n With new covenant comes the whole set of new things. Old cannot mix with the new, but there is no compromise of the divine laws. New wine cannot be put in old wineskins without bursting it, and a new patch of cloth to an old tear cloth makes the tear more worse.\n \n \nI am sure you have read Genesis. He states his regret at making man and then proceeds to drown the world. To regret something is to desire that it had never been done, a mistake. \n\n \n Genesis writer is a primitive author whose spiritual experience of God is partial and his human language is limited. When he received divine inspirations, he put it down the genuine inspiration mixed with emotions of a human kind, which is quite permissible. It is like, \"If I were in the God's place as a human\" what would I felt. Consequences for one's evil actions were put down as God actively drowning and destroying humans. It is just human language and emotions coloring the passage thus. The Church interprets everything faithfully and correctly according to the Spirit; therefore, not confused about what is divine and what is human.\n \n \nYou cannot simply go and decide to change an agreement without consent from the other party to disregard the old and accept the new, but I have given evidence that there really is no new covenant. \n\n When the other party has broken the covenant multiple times, where is need for a consent? You have not any given evidence, but I have given evidence for the new covenant.\n \n \nIf is a big worf in religion. If God had not permited Satan to entrap man, if God would not punish the children of the sinners, if God would walk among us as he used to, if we stopped thinking we we not worthy, if we acted in a manner that would make God proud if if if. If there is a new covenant why are you so sure it wasn't given to Mohamed?\n\n \n What God does is a mystery, but love and trust is enough to accept everything from God. When you trust Him, everything needed becomes clear in his light. Mohamed's covenant is move or an attempt to seduce back the children of Grace back to the curse of the old law with a double combination of food and sex and/or a threat of death and destruction. It is not in keeping with the fully revealed nature of God, especially after the coming of Christ.",

We have a Pope who had the prior Pope exhumed so his dead body could stand trial, one who went from lay person to Pope in a week, one who in effect became the biggest pimp in human history when he imposed a tax on prostitutes and the list continues from there.

Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas.

This is how the Church developed and progressed.\n\n \n Allowing different views and beliefs to enter into what was taught. The division amongst the Gentile Christians was severe. Just as was the removal of the groups named heretic by the the group calling themselves orthodox or Catholic.\n \n \nThat was enough, since Peter was Prince of the apostles and unanimous leader of the apostles.

It is not hard to think that Jesus could have been referring to the trek through the desert and the rock that was the source of life for their time there. \n \n The Church has had many times when it has lost its way even today they continue to fall short. They have bowed to worldly powers a number of times. Recently they have excluded from world politics because of their corruption and abuses of power.\n \n \n \nIt is not merely time of longevity or existence just like any religion, but an apostolic succession, a claim of an uninterrupted and continuous line of succession extending from the twelve apostles through the bishops they ordained right up to the bishops of the present day. The apostles appointed the first bishops as their successors, granting to them their own teaching authority, which continues until the end of the age\n\n \n Which has been broken numerous times and there exists only tradition that Peter named a succusor if he was named himself.

Peter is the Rock or you can try and say Jesus was the rock in the desert that gave the Jews water. \n\n \n Jesus the Rock\n \n PHILOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n \n By this we mean the considerations based upon the language used in setting forth this truth. In the text \"Peter\" in the Greek is petros, while \"rock\" is petra. These both come from a common root, but they are diverse in meaning as the following authorities show. Liddell and Scott's Greek English Lexicon is the standard work on classical Greek, and has been for many years the standard lexicon in most colleges. This work says of petra: \"A rock, crag, Lat. Rupes, scepulus; petros being a stone, Lat. Saxum: a ledge or shelf of rock (in the sea).\" But this work under a separate entry says of petros: \"A piece of rock, a stone.\"\n \n Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, which is the standard work on New Testament Greek, remarks on the word petra: \"A rock, ledge, cliff; a. prop.: (Matthew 7:24 sq.; 27:51, 60; Mark. 15:46; Luke 6:48; 1 Cor. 10:4) (on which see pneumatikos, 3a); a) projecting rock, crag, (Rev. 6:15 sq.); rocky ground, (Luke 8:6, 13). b). a rock, large stone: (Rom. 9:33; 1 Pet. 2:6 [7]). c). metaph. A man like a rock, by reason of his firmness and strength of soul: Matthew 16:18 [some interpp. regard the distinction (generally observed in classic Greek; see the Comm. and cf. Schmidt, Syn. Ch. 51, 4-6) between petra. the massive living rock, and petros, a detached but large fragment, as important for the correct understanding of this passage;].\" Here are two standard works, one on classic and the on New Testament Greek, and they agree.\n \n The word of the Lord in Isaiah 28:16 is especially appropriate at this time for our consideration. \"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.\" None but outright unbelievers can doubt the applicability of this to the Lord Jesus, when both Paul, (Rom. 9:33-10:4) and Peter, (1 Pet. 2:6-8) quote it in relation to Christ. Note from this prophecy that the purpose of God is: (1) To lay this Stone in Zion, the place where the Church was founded. (2) The laying of this Stone was for a foundation. (3) This foundation was not to be such unstable materials as constitutes all mankind, but was \"tried. . .precious. . . sure\" as a foundation. \n \n And what of the numerous times that David makes mention of the Lord as \"The Rock of my salvation,\" and other expressions, such as: \"Who is God save the Lord? Or who is a rock save our God?\" (Ps. 18:31). \"Be thou my strong rock, for an house of defense to save me. For thou art my rock and my fortress,\" (Ps. 31:2-3). \"He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved,\" (Ps. 62:2). \"And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God was their redeemer,\" (Ps. 78:35).\n \n \"And again, what of Psalm 118:22: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head stone of the corner,\" which is quoted in the New Testament in reference to the Lord Jesus, (Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11). Or of Isaiah 8:14: \"And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\" which is also quoted by both Peter and Paul in reference to the Lord. Here the word translated \"rock\" is the Greek word petra both in the Septuagint, (Greek version) in Isaiah 8:14, and in the New Testament quotations of it in Romans 9:33 and 1 Peter 2:8.\n \n The Lord Jesus is very commonly pictured in the Old Testament as the \"Rock,\" and so, any Jew who was familiar with His Scriptures would have recognized Jesus' words in Matthew 16:18 as a reference to Isaiah 28:16, and so, He it is upon whom the Church is built. \n \n We may certainly expect that the apostles would know upon whom the Church was built, and if the \"rock\" mentioned in Matthew 16:18 were Peter, he would certainly be recognized and honored as such by the other apostles.\n \n Yet such is manifestly not the case, for Paul quotes a portion of both Isaiah 8:14 and 28:16 as referring, not to a mere man, but to the Lord Himself, (Rom. 9:33). And he goes further by saying, \"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ,\" (1 Cor. 10:4). He refers to the Rock that gave forth water to the Israelites in the desert during the forty years of wandering, but he uses the same word-petra-as is found in Matthew 16:18.\n \n But as to the foundation, he dogmatically says, \"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which Is Jesus Christ,\" (1 Cor. 3:11). Is this not clear enough for anyone? It should be, but apparently is not for some. The Church is founded upon a Rock, \"and that Rock is Christ,\" \"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" Not only is Christ set forth as the rock that is laid for a foundation, but Scripture declares that there is no other foundation that has been, or can be, laid. Who will controvert this? To even endeavor to do so is to reveal one to have a deep-seated prejudice against the truth that results in knowing rebellion.\n \n \"For who is God, save the Lord? And who is a rock, save our God,\" (2 Sam. 22:32). See also Psalm 18:31 which quotes this. \"The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation,\" (2 Sam. 22:47). \"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me,\" (2 Sam. 23:3). \"Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock,\" (Ps. 28:1). \"For thou art my rock and my fortress,\" (Ps. 31:3). \"I will say unto God my rock,\" (Ps. 42:9). \"He only is my rock and my salvation,\" (Ps. 62:2). And many other such passages could be cited.\n \n CHAPTER 2: Is Peter The Rock?\n \n Even the language of Matthew 16-18 suggests Jesus. \"Upon THIS ROCK..\"\n Or did you forget when Jesus used similar language to in John chapter 2 to refer to himself? \n \n 19 Jesus answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.\" \n \n 20 They replied, \"It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?\" 21 But the temple he had spoken of was his body. \n \n \"THIS ROCK\"......\"THIS TEMPLE.\"\n \n \n\n Did you convert to another religion and lose all your Christian mojo?\n\n \n You might could get saved someday if you weren't so lost in your own folly.",
