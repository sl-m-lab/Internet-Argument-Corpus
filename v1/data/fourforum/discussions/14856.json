Its editorial content has a diverse range of viewpoints, though predominantly from a right wing or conservative perspective.[1][11][12] Besides providing articles authored by its own staff, the site links to news from other publications. Notable staff includes Jerusalem Bureau Chief Aaron Klein, White House Correspondent Lester Kinsolving, and Staff Writer Jerome Corsi. Its commentary pages feature editorials from the site's founder, Joseph Farah and other social conservative authors such as Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, David Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Chuck Norris. It also features weekly columns by libertarians Walter Williams, Vox Day, and Ilana Mercer, as well as liberal Bill Press and pro-life moderate Nat Hentoff.[13] WND also offers products for sale, advertising these products alongside related news stories. Typically these are products sold by its related book service, WND Book Service, by its publishing house, WND Books, or by its retail operation, ShopNetDaily. The site also contains advertisements for WND's printed magazine, Whistleblower, and other companies. WND also operates the G2 Bulletin, a subscription-only website described as an \"intelligence resource\" for \"insights into geo-political and geo-strategic developments.\"\n \n WND has published articles that have created controversies and criticism of the site by other media outlets.\n [edit] 9/11 attacks\n \n On September 13, 2001, WND published a commentary by Anthony C. LoBaido regarding the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., two days earlier. In his column, LoBaido outlined what he regarded as the moral depravity of America in general and New York in particular, asking whether, \"God (has) raised up Shiite Islam as a sword against America.\"[19] Commentators Virginia Postrel of Reason magazine and James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal criticized LoBaido and Joseph Farah for the piece and called for columnists Hugh Hewitt and Bill O'Reilly to sever their ties with WND, prompting Farah to respond with a column of his own explaining that the article did not reflect the viewpoint of WND, and that it, like most other commentary pieces, had not been reviewed before being published.[20]\n [edit] Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories\n Main article: Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories\n \n WorldNetDaily has emerged as a leading outlet publicizing claims about Barack Obama's citizenship status, claiming that President Obama is not a natural-born citizen and is thus not eligible to serve as president. Such claims are considered unsubstaniated or unreliable by most news sources. After the 2008 presidential campaign, WND began an online petition to have Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate released to the public. The website also unsuccessfully urged Supreme Court justices to hear several lawsuits aiming to release Obama's birth certificate.[21] In May 2009, WND began collecting money to erect billboards asking, \"Where's the Birth Certificate?\", the first three of which appeared in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles.[22] Several WND commentators have written columns demanding that the birth certificate be released, including Farah; Corsi; Christian TV host Hal Lindsey;[23] Faith and Values Coalition co-chair Janet Porter[24][25] and talk radio host Barbara Simpson.[26]\n \n In an August 23, 2008, article about one of the lawsuits, WND reported it had investigated FactCheck.org's proffered image of the \"Obama Birth Certificate\" utilizing forgery experts and \"found the document to be authentic.\"[27] On December 20, 2008, in a WND column, Joseph Farah claimed that an examination of the original Obama Campaign proffered image by forgery experts could not \"report conclusively that the electronic image was authentic or that it was a forgery.\" [28] After MSNBC's Keith Olbermann named Farah the \"Worst Person in the World\" on his show, Countdown, for his alleged reversal,[29] Farah defended himself, claiming, \"the veracity of that image was never the major issue of contention. Rather, the major issue is where is the rest of the birth certificate &#8211; the part that explains where the baby was born, who the delivery doctor was, etc...I can tell you WND has done its part to find out the truth.\"[30]\n [edit] Libel lawsuit\n \n On September 20, 2000, WND published an article[31] claiming that Clark Jones, a Savannah, Tennessee car dealer and fund-raiser for then-Vice President Al Gore, had interfered with a criminal investigation, had been a \"subject\" of a criminal investigation, was listed on law enforcement computers as a \"dope dealer,\" and implied that he had ties to others involved in alleged criminal activity. In 2001, Jones filed a lawsuit[32] against WND; the reporters, Charles C. Thompson II and Tony Hays; the Center for Public Integrity, which had underwritten Thompson and Hays' reporting on the article and related ones[33] and various Tennessee publications and broadcasters who he accused of repeating the claim, claiming libel and defamation. The lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial in March 2008;[34] but, on February 13, 2008, WND announced that a confidential out-of-court settlement had been reached with Jones.[35] A settlement statement jointly drafted by all parties in the lawsuit states in part:\n \n Discovery has revealed to WorldNetDaily.com that no witness verifies the truth of what the witnesses are reported by authors to have stated. Additionally, no document has been discovered that provides any verification that the statements written were true. Factual discovery in the litigation and response from Freedom of Information Act requests to law enforcement agencies confirm Clark Jones' assertion that his name has never been on law enforcement computers, that he has not been the subject of any criminal investigation nor has he interfered with any investigation as stated in the articles. Discovery has also revealed that the sources named in the publications have stated under oath that statements attributed to them in the articles were either not made by them, were misquoted by the authors, were misconstrued, or the statements were taken out of context.[35]\n \n [edit] Feud with LGBT conservatives\n \n WND has also come out against LGBT participants in the Republican party and their associates. In 2010, when writer and pundit Ann Coulter accepted the invitation to attend and speak at GOProud's Homocon 2010 event, Farah announced the withdrawal of Coulter's name from the list of speakers at the company's Taking America Back conference.[36] Coulter responded by saying that speaking engagements do not imply endorsement of the hosting organization's ideology; however, after Farah published private emails between himself and Coulter, Coulter lashed out by calling him a &#8220;publicity whore&#8221; and a &#8220;swine&#8221; in an email to the Daily Caller blog[37]",

   "Crikey! Paul Cameron, \"redefining the definition of marriage\" and now Scott friggin Lively??\n \n These guys are truly, TRULY desperate if they're hauling out these Oldies But Moldies...\n \n Anti-Gay Conspiracy Theories Debunked by Christian Professor | Hatewatch | Southern Poverty Law Center\nScott Lively has made a ministry career that spans two decades and three continents, in part by preaching that the Nazi Third Reich was helmed and orchestrated by gay men. That's the central thesis of his book The Pink Swastika, and it played a pivotal role in Lively's co-founding of the international anti-gay hate group Watchmen on the Walls. For years now, historians, watchdog and gay civil rights groups have called Lively out on his slander. But now, the anti-gay crusader faces a formidable new critic on his own home turf. Warren Throckmorton, a well-respected conservative Christian psychology professor, has been exposing Lively's false claims in evangelical Christian magazines and blogs.\n \n What set Throckmorton off was Lively's March appearance at an anti-gay rights conference in Uganda, where homosexuality is already a crime punishable by life in prison. In the capital city of Kampala, Lively rehashed his gay Nazi stump speech and called for Ugandan gays and lesbians to be forced into so-called \"conversion therapy.\" Since then, as Throckmorton notes, \"lists of people suspected to be gay have been included in tabloids, various ministers have accused other ministers of being homosexual, and Christian groups are calling for the government to create a commission to eliminate homosexuality - all supported by American Christian ministries.\"\n \n \"[T]here is a disturbing parallel with the Nazis, but it is not with the homosexuals,\" Throckmorton writes in the Christian web magazine Crosswalk. \"In Uganda among Christian groups and government leaders, and encouraged by Mr. Lively, homosexuality is considered the root of society's evils.\" In response, Throckmorton has launched an ambitious project to discredit Lively's books and analyze how the anti-gay rights leader came to formulate his idea that \"the Nazi Party was entirely controlled by militaristic male homosexuals throughout its short history.\"\n \n Throckmorton says Lively's obsession with linking gay men to Nazi fascism began in 1992 with Oregon's Ballot Measure 9, which would have mandated that public schools teach that homosexuality is \"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse.\" The ballot measure was drafted and supported by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, whose communications director was Scott Lively. As gay rights activists drew comparisons between Measure 9 and the Nazi treatment of homosexuals, Lively and his Pink Swastika co-author Scott Abrams sought to make, in Throckmorton's words, the \"massive leaps of logic and fact required to make National Socialism an invention of a cohesive homosexual plot.\"\n \n Engaging Lively in his own shaky logic, Throckmorton posed this question to Lively: \"If homosexuality was so associated with National Socialist ideals and aims, then shouldn't the current Nazis be dominated by homosexuals?\" Throckmorton then digs up several websites from the National Socialist Movement, the largest and most high-profile neo-Nazi group in the U.S. He finds that all NSM chapters ban non-white and non-heterosexual members; one of the chapters, in fact, puts it explicitly: \"Homosexuality is a social degeneracy that must be expunged from our society.\"\n \n Taking it a further step, Throckmorton invited Grove City College history professor Jon David Wyneken to analyze the claims of The Pink Swastika. Wyneken, a scholar of German history between 1933 and 1955, picks apart Lively's distorted and cherry-picked quotes to conclude that \"Lively's book is simply not good history and is, in fact, not really history at all.\" The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum notes that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexual men were forced into Nazi concentration camps where they were beaten, castrated and killed.\n \n Throckmorton may seem like an unlikely person to confront Lively's ideas. In 2004, he produced the video \"I Do Exist,\" profiling teens and young adults who claim to have become \"ex-gay\" - a \"conversion\" idea that is also embraced by Lively. (Most medical and psychological professional associations say that homosexuality is not a pathology and cannot, in any event, be \"cured.\") But Throckmorton has also been a vocal critic of several therapies pushed by the ex-gay movement and has an audience among conservative and evangelical Christians. He has also called on schools to prevent bullying of gay students. Throckmorton cautions that his video should not be purchased by anyone \"looking for a way to express to gay people that they should change their sexual feelings to be acceptable to God.\"\n \n As for Lively and those who believe his revisionist allegations, Throckmorton warns fellow believers: \"When Christians make spurious comparisons to the Nazis, they should not be surprised when the targets of those comparisons lash back and consider them hateful. There should be little wonder why they don't feel the Love.\"\n \n",

Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character, rather than criminal acts, and the \"gesundes Volksempfinden\" (\"healthy sensibility of the people\") became the leading normative legal principle.[332] In 1936, Himmler created the \"Reichszentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Homosexualit\u00e4t und Abtreibung\" (\"Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion\").[333] Homosexuality was declared contrary to \"wholesome popular sentiment,\"[266] and homosexuals were consequently regarded as \"defilers of German blood.\" The Gestapo raided gay bars, tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbours.[266][332]\n \n Tens of thousands were convicted between 1933 and 1944 and sent to camps for \"rehabilitation\", where they were identified by yellow armbands[334] and later pink triangles worn on the left side of the jacket and the right trouser leg, which singled them out for sexual abuse.[332] Hundreds were castrated by court order.[335] They were humiliated, tortured, used in hormone experiments conducted by SS doctors, and killed.[266] Steakley writes that the full extent of gay suffering was slow to emerge after the war. Many victims kept their stories to themselves because homosexuality remained criminalized in postwar Germany. Around two percent of German homosexuals were persecuted by Nazis.[332]",

   "I lol'd so hard cause I'm a RR conductor. And if I saw this I think I would have easily XXXXXX myself laughing...\n\n \n Really JJ? You're a RR Conductor? Cuz just a couple of weeks ago you said you were in training to become one, which I also question. I googled the job requirements and look what I found: Education and Training Requirements\n \n It takes several years for conductors to get their positions because they must be promoted from other railroad jobs. Almost all are high school graduates. Helpful high school courses include electronics and manual arts, such as wood and metal shop. Part-time work on railroads during the summer and holiday seasons may be available and is valuable experience.\n \n [Zorba asks] Note the bolded; what job within the Railroad were you promoted from?\n \n Many employers require aspiring conductors to complete training programs administered by either railroad companies or community colleges. Employers usually require job applicants to pass physical examinations, drug and alcohol screening, and criminal background checks.\n \n Those who want to become conductors are tested on their knowledge of signals, timetables, operating rules, and other subjects. After passing these tests, potential conductors are made temporary conductors until full-time positions are available. Temporary conductors, also called \"extra-board conductors,\" fill in for regular conductors who are sick or on vacation.\n \n Railroads usually keep separate seniority lists for road service and yard conductors. However, depending on the railroad, some yard conductors may advance to freight work and eventually to passenger trains.\n \n Getting the Job\n \n Job seekers can apply directly to railroad employment offices or talk to the superintendents of railroads' local divisions. Newspaper classified ads and Internet job sites may provide employment leads.\n \n Advancement Possibilities and Employment Outlook\n \n Conductors are already at the top of their field. However, those who show special ability with people may become train masters or passenger agents.\n \n The employment outlook for conductors is poor through 2014. The demand for railroad freight service will grow as the economy and transportation of goods expand; however, employment will decline because of technology that allows road service conductors and other workers to make more runs per day. In addition, new rules allow trains to travel with smaller crews. As a result, the industry is eliminating positions vacated by workers who retire. The number of yard conductors will also decline because coupling and uncoupling of cars is automated, and the amount of supervision needed for yard workers is being reduced.\n \n Read more: Railroad Conductor Job Description, Career as a Railroad Conductor, Salary, Employment - Definition and Nature of the Work, Education and Training Requirements, Getting the Job Railroad Conductor Job Description, Career as a Railroad Conductor, Salary, Employment - Definition and Nature of the Work, Education and Training Requirements, Getting the Job",

   "\n \n [B][I]It takes several years for conductors to get their positions because they must be promoted from other railroad jobs\n\n \n Wrong. it used to be this way. They eliminated the previous jobs and condensed essentially four years of railroading into 15 weeks.\n \n \n \n \nMany employers require aspiring conductors to complete training programs administered by either railroad companies or community colleges.\n\n \n Umm... the railroad company trains the people..\n \n \n \n Employers usually require job applicants to pass physical examinations, drug and alcohol screening, and criminal background checks.\n \n Those who want to become conductors are tested on their knowledge of signals, timetables, operating rules, and other subjects.\n\n \n Yeah this is true. And not just any little pee in the bottle. They take hair samples and are very strict. They don't want XXXXXX potentially ruining 12 million dollars worth of cargo and equipment on a Z train doing 70 mph.\n \n \n After passing these tests, potential conductors are made temporary conductors until full-time positions are available. \n\n \n Not true. It depends on the board, the staff, and the jobs available. Your not temporary, your on call.\n \n \nTemporary conductors, also called \"extra-board conductors,\" fill in for regular conductors who are sick or on vacation.\n\n \n Wrong again. Not temporary. If they mean by unassigned then true. However these conductors tend to make more money especially on the road or main line where your income can triple easily depending on mileage.\n \n \nRailroads usually keep separate seniority lists for road service and yard conductors. However, depending on the railroad, some yard conductors may advance to freight work and eventually to passenger trains.\n\n \n Oh jeez... Yeah and even if you work a yard job you'll be called to run the main line if shorthanded... \n \n \n \nThe employment outlook for conductors is poor through 2014. \n\n \n LMAO!!!! Yeah right... As of right now the projected growth for Conductors system wide will be 1500 more by the end of 2011. Which means by the end of this year I'll have 1500 people under me in seniority including even more so guys that retire which free up vacancies.\n \n \n \nThe demand for railroad freight service will grow as the economy and transportation of goods expand; however, employment will decline because of technology that allows road service conductors and other workers to make more runs per day. \n\n \n This is utterly stupid... You can only make one run per crew per interchange point with a maximum on duty time of 12 hours per FRA regulation. Going over is dead on the law and is strictly forbidden... \n \n You also need 3 people regardless of a road crew and a minimum of two for yard service with RCO. This article is talking out it's XXX.\n \n \n \nIn addition, new rules allow trains to travel with smaller crews.\n\n \n WRONG.\n \n \n As a result, the industry is eliminating positions vacated by workers who retire.\n \n\n \n LOL.... man these people don't know jack about railroading...

Conway and many other historians it is beyond doubt that Hitler held a \"fundamental antagonism\" towards the Christian churches.The various accounts of Hitler's private statements vary strongly in their reliability; most importantly, Hermann Rauschning's Hitler speaks is considered by most historians to be an invention.",

If you can't agree with that, you're just trolling.\n\n \n There are those who simply refuse to admit that Hitler was driven by religion. Here's a few choice Words from the man himself.. This pretty much shows it was indeed a religious war.. whether you choose to believe it or not is up to you....\n \n \nThe Government, being resolved to undertake the political and moral purification of our public life, are creating and securing the conditions necessary for a really profound revival of religious life.... The National Government regard the two Christian Confessions as the weightiest factors for the maintenance of our nationality. They will respect the agreements concluded between them and the federal States. Their rights are not to be infringed.... It will be the Government's care to maintain honest co-operation between Church and State; the struggle against materialistic views and for a real national community is just as much in the interest of the German nation as in that of the welfare of our Christian faith. The Government of the Reich, who regard Christianity as the unshakable foundation of the morals and moral code of the nation, attach the greatest value to friendly relations with the Holy See and are endeavouring to develop them.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech to the Reichstag on 23 March 1933\n\n \n \n\n National Socialism has always affirmed that it is determined to take the Christian Churches under the protection of the State.... The decisive factor which can justify the existence alike of Church and State is the maintenance of men's spiritual and bodily health, for it that health were destroyed it would mean the end of the State and also the end of the Church.... It is my sincere hope that thereby for Germany, too, through free agreement there has been produced a final clarification of spheres in the functions of the State and of one Church.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, on a wireless on 22 July, the evening before the Evangelical Church Election \n\n \n \n \nWe were convinced that the people needs and requires this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in a speech in Berlin on 24 Oct. 1933\n\n \n \n\n While we destroyed the Centre Party, we have not only brought thousands of priests back into the Church, but to millions of respectable people we have restored their faith in their religion and in their priests. The union of the Evangelical Church in a single Church for the whole Reich, the Concordat with the Catholic Church, these are but milestones on the road which leads to the establishment of a useful relation and a useful co operation between the Reich and the two Confessions.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in his New Year Message on 1 Jan. 1934 \n\n \n \n \nWe have experienced a miracle, something unique, something the like of which there has hardly been in the history of the world. God first allowed our people to be victorious for four and a half years, then He abased us, laid upon us a period of shamelessness, but now after a struggle of fourteen years he has permitted us to bring that period to a close. It is a miracle which has been wrought upon the German people.... It shows us that the Almighty has not deserted our people, that He received it into favour at the moment when it rediscovered itself. And that our people shall never again lose itself, that must be our vow so long as we shall live and so long as the Lord gives us the strength to carry on the fight.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in a speech to the \"Old Guard\" of the Party at Munich on 19 March, 1934 \n\n \n \n \nNational Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious, but on the contrary it stands on the ground of a real Christianity.... For their interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of to-day, in our fight against a Bolshevist culture, against atheistic movement, against criminality, and in our struggle for a consciousness of a community in our national life... These are not anti-Christian, these are Christian principles! And I believe that if we should fail to follow these principles then we should to be able to point to our successes, for the result of our political battle is surely not unblest by God.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech at Koblenz, to the Germans of the Saar, 26 Aug. 1934 \n\n \n \n \n\n God the Almighty has made our nation. By defending its existence we are defending His work....\n \n Only He can relieve me of this duty Who called me to it. It was in the hand of Providence to snuff me out by the bomb that exploded only one and a half meters from me on July 20, and thus to terminate my life's work. That the Almighty protected me on that day I consider a renewed affirmation of the task entrusted to me....\n \n Therefore, it is all the more necessary on this twelfth anniversary of the rise to power to strengthen the heart more than ever before and to steel ourselves in the holy determination to wield the sword, no-matter where and under what circumstances, until final victory crowns our efforts....\n \n In the years to come I shall continue on this road, uncompromisingly safeguarding my people's interests, oblivious to all misery and danger, and filled with the holy conviction that God the Almighty will not abandon him who, during all his life, had no desire but to save his people from a fate it had never deserved, neither by virtue of its number nor by way of its importance....\n \n In vowing ourselves to one another, we are entitled to stand before the Almighty and ask Him for His grace and His blessing. No people can do more than that everybody who can fight, fights, and that everybody who can work, works, and that they all sacrifice in common, filled with but one thought: to safeguard freedom and national honor and thus the future of life.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in a radio address, 30 Jan. 1945\n\n \n \n \n SOURCES:\n \n Baynes, Norman H.

   "Exactly. You hit the nail on the head.\n\n \n Your just burying your head under the sand once again Jyoshu. Typical when religion is involved. \n \n Adolf Hitler's religious views - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n Adolf Hitler's religious views have been a matter of dispute, in part because of apparently inconsistent statements made by Hitler, and those attributed to him. The relationship between Nazism and religion was complex and shifting over the period of the Nazi Party's existence and during its years in power.\n \n \n According to historian Bradley F. Smith, Hitler's father Alois, though nominally a Catholic, was somewhat religiously skeptical,[1] while his mother was a practicing Catholic.[2] According to historian Michael Rissmann, young Hitler was influenced in school by Pan-Germanism and began to reject the Catholic Church, receiving Confirmation only unwillingly. A boyhood friend reports that after Hitler had left home, he never again attended a Catholic Mass or received the Church's Sacraments.[3] Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer's writings and the written legacy of his Pan-German Away from Rome! movement, which agitated against the Catholic Church at the end of the 19th century, may have influenced the young Hitler.[4] At the Benedictine monastery school which Hitler attended for one school year as a child (1897-98), Hitler became top of his class, receiving 12 1's, the highest grade, in the final quarter. He also sang in the choir at the monastery.[5]\n \n \n According to an interview with a British correspondent years after the Great War, Hitler claimed a mysterious voice told him to leave a section of a crowded trench during a minor barrage. Moments after he left the area, a shell fell on that particular spot. Hitler saw this experience as a message that he was a uniquely illuminated individual who had a special task to fulfill.[6] This story did not, however, appear in Mein Kampf.\n \n \n Something of Hitler's religious beliefs can be gathered from his public and private statements; however, they present a conflicting picture of a man who is somewhat spiritual and yet against organized religion. Some private statements attributed to him remain disputed or unsourced.\n [edit] Public statements\n \n In public statements, especially at the beginning of his rule, Hitler frequently spoke positively about the Christian of German culture, and his belief in the \"Aryan\" Christ. In a proclamation to the German Nation February 1, 1933 Hitler stated, \"The National Government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to revive in the nation the spirit of unity and co-operation. It will preserve and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built. It regards Christianity as the foundation of our national morality, and the family as the basis of national life.\"[7]\n \n Historian Joachim Fest wrote, \"Hitler knew, through the constant invocation of the God the Lord (German: Herrgott) or of providence (German: Vorsehung), to make the impression of a godly way of thought.\"[8] He used his \"ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity,\" according to biographer Ian Kershaw. Kershaw adds that Hitler's ability also succeeded in appeasing possible Church resistance to anti-Christian Nazi Party radicals.[9] For example, on March 23, 1933, he addressed the Reichstag: \"The National Government regards the two Christian confessions (i.e. Catholicism and Protestantism) as factors essential to the soul of the German people. ... We hold the spiritual forces of Christianity to be indispensable elements in the moral uplift of most of the German people.\"[10]\n \n According to Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer, Hitler remained a formal member of the Catholic Church until his death, although it was Speer's opinion that \"he had no real attachment to it.\"[11] According to biographer John Toland, Hitler was still \"a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite detestation of its hierarchy, he carried within him its teaching that the Jew was the killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of conscience since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God-so long as it was done impersonally, without cruelty.\"[12] However Hitler's own words from Mein Kampf seem to conflict with the idea that his antisemitism was religiously motivated. From childhood onward, Hitler seems to have continued to reject antisemitism or anti-Judaism based on religious arguments like the deicide claim:\n \n There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews who lived there had become Europeanized in external appearance and were so much like other human beings that I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only external mark which I recognized as distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As I thought that they were persecuted on account of their Faith my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. I did not in the least suspect that there could be such a thing as a systematic anti-Semitism.\n \n Then I came to Vienna.\n \n Confused by the mass of impressions I received from the architectural surroundings and depressed by my own troubles, I did not at first distinguish between the different social strata of which the population of that mammoth city was composed. Although Vienna then had about two hundred thousand Jews among its population of two millions, I did not notice them. During the first weeks of my sojourn my eyes and my mind were unable to cope with the onrush of new ideas and values. Not until I gradually settled down to my surroundings, and the confused picture began to grow clearer, did I acquire a more discriminating view of my new world. And with that I came up against the Jewish problem.\n \n I will not say that the manner in which I first became acquainted with it was particularly unpleasant for me. In the Jew I still saw only a man who was of a different religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea that he should be attacked because he had a different faith. And so I considered that the tone adopted by the anti-Semitic Press in Vienna was unworthy of the cultural traditions of a great people. The memory of certain events which happened in the Middle Ages came into my mind, and I felt that I should not like to see them repeated....[13]\n \n According to historian Richard Steigmann-Gall, much is known about Hitler's views on religion through Hitler's book, Mein Kampf.[14] In Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote neither as an atheist, an agnostic, nor as a believer in a remote, rationalist divinity. Instead he expressed his belief in one providential, active, deity:\n \n \"What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and the reproduction of our race...so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe...Peoples that bastardize themselves, or let themselves be bastardized, sin against the will of eternal Providence.\"[14]\n \n In an attempt to justify Nazi intolerance he recommends militantism, which he associates with Christianity's rise to Roman state religion, as a model for the Nazis in their pursuit of power, while simultaneously lamenting the demise of Pre-Christian Roman Religion,\n \n The individual may establish with pain today that with the appearance of Christianity the first spiritual terror entered into the far freer ancient world, but he will not be able to contest the fact that since then the world has been afflicted and dominated by this coercion, and that coercion is broken only by coercion, and terror only by terror. Only then can a new state of affairs be constructively created. Political parties are inclined to compromises; philosophies never. Political parties even reckon with opponents; philosophies proclaim their infallibility. [15]\n \n Elsewhere in Mein Kampf Hitler speaks of the \"creator of the universe\" and \"eternal Providence.\" He also states his belief that the Aryan race was created by God, and that it would be a sin to dilute it through racial intermixing. Hitler writes:\n \n The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated. For God's will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will.[16]\n \n According to Steigmann-Gall, Hitler's reference to God as the \"Lord of Creation\" and the necessity of obeying \"His will\" along with several references to Jesus, reveals the infusion of Christianity into his thinking. Other sources also show Hitler's Christian thinking, according to Steigmann-Gall. He notes an unpublished manuscript where Hitler sketched out his world-view with similar Christian references, and he gives as an example a speech on April 1922 where Hitler said that Jesus was \"the true God.\" Finally, Steigmann-Gall gives another example where in a private Nazi meeting Hitler again stated the centrality of Jesus' teachings to the Nazi movement.[17]\n \n Derek Hastings sees Hitler's commitment to Christianity as more tenuous. He considers it \"eminently plausible\" that Hitler was a believing Catholic as late as his trial in 1924, but writes that \"there is little doubt that Hitler was a staunch opponent of Christianity throughout the duration of the Third Reich.\" [18]\n [edit] Private statements\n \n Hitler's private statements about Christianity were often conflicting. Hitler's intimates, such as Joseph Goebbels, Albert Speer, and Martin Bormann suggest that Hitler generally had negative opinions of religion, although the historical validity of some remarks has been questioned, particularly the English translation of Hitler's Table Talk. Historian Ian Kershaw remarked upon the questionable nature of Table Talk as a source, stating \"the `table talk' monologues of the last months (the so called 'bunkergespr\u00e4che') of which no German text has ever been brought to light must be treated with due caution.\"[19] Atheist activist and historian Richard Carrier goes further, contending that certain portions of Table Talk - especially those regarding Hitler's hostility of Christianity - are poor mistranslations.[20] Carrier states that Hitler was criticizing Catholicism in particular, while remaining entirely religious.[21] Albert Speer confirmed the authenticity of Henry Picker's German transcripts, which was published in 1951 as Tischgespr\u00e4che im F\u00fchrerhauptquartier.[22] Carrier states, \"It is clear that Picker and Jochmann have the correct text and Trevor-Roper's is entirely untrustworthy.\"[21] An example from the Table Talk includes Hitler's statement that, \"Our epoch will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.\"[23]\n \n Goebbels notes in a diary entry in 1939 a conversation in which Hitler had \"expressed his revulsion against Christianity. He wished that the time were ripe for him to be able to openly express that. Christianity had corrupted and infected the entire world of antiquity.\"[24] Albert Speer reports in his memoirs of a similar statement made by Hitler: \"You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?\"[25]\n \n In 1941, Hitler praised an anti-Christian tract from AD 362, neo-platonist and pagan Roman emperor Julian the Apostate's Against the Galileans, saying \"I really hadn't known how clearly a man like Julian had judged Christians and Christianity, one must read this....\"[26]\n \n In 1941, according to the diary of Nazi General Gerhart Engel, Hitler stated \"I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so.\"[27]\n \n Author Konrad Heiden has quoted Hitler as stating, \"We do not want any other god than Germany itself. It is essential to have fanatical faith and hope and love in and for Germany.\"[28]\n [edit] Positive Christianity\n \n Some scholars maintain that, in contrast to other Nazi leaders, Hitler did not adhere to esoteric ideas, occultism, or Nazi mysticism, and even ridiculed such beliefs in private and possibly in public. Hitler stated: \"We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. Such folk are not National Socialists, but something else-in any case something which has nothing to do with us.\" [29] Other scholars believe the young Hitler was strongly influenced, particularly in his racial views, by an abundance of occult works on the mystical superiority of the Germans, like the occult and anti-semitic magazine Ostara, and give credence to the claim of its publisher Lanz von Liebenfels that Hitler visited him in 1909 and praised his work.[30] Indeed, evidence indicates Hitler was a regular reader of Ostara.[31] Drawing on higher criticism and some branches of theologically liberal Protestantism, Hitler for a time advocated for German Christians a Positive Christianity, traditional Christianity purged of everything that he found objectionable and with certain, particularly racist, additions. Hitler never directed his attacks on Jesus himself,[32] but viewed traditional Christianity as a corruption of the original ideas of Jesus, whom Hitler regarded as an Aryan opponent of the Jews.[33] In Mein Kampf Hitler writes that Jesus \"made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross.\"\n \n Hitler was not opposed to and, in fact, made use of calling on references to traditional symbols of Christianity. One example often used to indicate Hitler's Christianity (or at least his public profession of such beliefs), is in actual truth, Hitler rejecting some central tenets of traditional Christian beliefs regarding love and compassion and calling on any listeners who might adhere to such beliefs to fully reject them as well. Count Hugo Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld auf K\u00f6fering und Sch\u00f6nberg (1871-1944), Prime Minister of Bavaria (1921-1922) stated in a speech before the Landtag of Bavaria, in reaction to growing Anti-Semitism spurred on by the fledgling Nazi Party, that his beliefs \"...as a man and a Christian...\" prevented him from being an Anti-Semite or from pursuing Anti-Semitic public policies. The text may be interpreted[by whom?] as Hitler mocking the Christianity of Lerchenfeld, or it may be interpreted[by whom?] as a statement of Hitler's own brand of Christianity. With either interpretation, Hitler skillfully drew a parallel between himself and Jesus and turned Lerchenfeld's perspective of Jesus on its head for the purposes of furthering National Socialism. At the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller on April 12, 1922, Hitler said:\n \n I would like here to appeal to a greater than I, Count Lerchenfeld. He said in the last session of the Landtag that his feeling 'as a man and a Christian' prevented him from being an anti-Semite. I say: My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. .. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison.[34][35]\n \n Perhaps for the above reasons, Hitler demonstrated a preference for Protestantism over Catholicism, as Protestantism was more open to reinterpretations, especially Positive Christianity, and a non-traditional re-reading of sacred scripture, and because some of its liberal branches had similar views.[36][37] These views were supported by the German Christians movement, but rejected by the Confessing Church. According to Steigmann-Gall, Hitler regretted that \"the churches had failed to back him and his movement as he had hoped;\"[38] and he stated according to Albert Speer: \"Through me the Protestant Church could become the established church, as in England.\"\n \n Not all the Protestant churches submitted to the state,[39] which Hitler said in Mein Kampf was important in forming a political movement. Hitler supported the appointment of Ludwig M\u00fcller as Reichsbischof over the Protestant churches, hoping that he would get them to adhere to Nazi positions. After 1935 Hitler was advised by the newly-appointed Reich Minister for Church Affairs Hans Kerrl. Many Protestants who were not persuaded by argument were arrested and their property and funds confiscated. Hitler said of the Protestants \"you can do anything you want with them, they will submit...\"[40]\n \n By 1940 it was public knowledge that Hitler had abandoned advocating for Germans even the syncretist idea of a positive Christianity.[41]\n \n Historian Richard Overy maintains that Hitler was not a Christian, nor was his ideology influenced by Christianity,[42] but believed in Arthur de Gobineau's ideas of struggle for survival between the different races, among which the \"Aryan race\" - guided by a pantheistic \"providence\" - was supposed to be the torchbearers of civilization. In Hitler's conception, Jews were enemies of all civilization, especially the Volk; this idea was rooted in an ideology based on Social Darwinism and antisemitism.[43][44] His understanding of Darwinism was incomplete and based on the theory of \"survival of the fittest\" in a social context, as popularly misunderstood at the time.[45][46]\n \n In 1998 documents were released by Cornell University from the Nuremberg Trials,[47] that revealed Nazi plans to eliminate Christianity entirely. The documents cover the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis and demonstrate the deliberate genocide of Jews during the Holocaust, in which some six million Jews were killed. One senior member of the U.S. prosecution team, General William Donovan, as part of his work on documenting Nazi war crimes, compiled large amounts of documentation that the Nazis persecuted Christian Churches.[48]\n \n Donovan's documents include almost 150 bound volumes currently stored at Cornell University after his death in 1959; these documents state\n \n \"Important leaders of the National Socialist party would have liked to meet this situation [church influence] by complete extirpation of Christianity and the substitution of a purely racial religion,\" said an OSS report in July 1945. \"The best evidence now available as to the existence of an anti-Church plan is to be found in the systematic nature of the persecution itself.\n \n They also show the different steps involved in the persecution,[49] including the campaign to suppress denominational and youth organizations, denominational schools, and the use of defamation against the clergy, orchestrated to start on the same day over the Reich and supported by the press, Nazi Party meetings and by traveling party speakers.[50][51] The documents show that the Nazis early on wanted the churches neutralized because they feared that the Churches would oppose Nazi plans based on racism and aggressive wars. The Nazis planned to infiltrate churches and use defamation, arrest, assault and/or kill pastors, and \"re-educate\" church congregations. They also suppressed denominational schools and Christian youth organizations.\n [edit] Hitler's public reaction to atheism\n \n Hitler often associated atheism with Germany's communist enemy.[52] Hitler stated in a speech to the Stuttgart February 15, 1933: \"Today they say that Christianity is in danger, that the Catholic faith is threatened. My reply to them is: for the time being, Christians and not international atheists are now standing at Germany's fore. I am not merely talking about Christianity; I confess that I will never ally myself with the parties which aim to destroy Christianity. Fourteen years they have gone arm in arm with atheism. At no time was greater damage ever done to Christianity than in those years when the Christian parties ruled side by side with those who denied the very existence of God. Germany's entire cultural life was shattered and contaminated in this period. It shall be our task to burn out these manifestations of degeneracy in literature, theater, schools, and the press-that is, in our entire culture-and to eliminate the poison which has been permeating every facet of our lives for these past fourteen years.\"[53]\n \n In a speech delivered in Berlin, October 24, 1933, Hitler stated: \"We were convinced that the people needs and requires this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out.\"[54]\n \n In a radio address October 14, 1933 Hitler stated \"For eight months we have been waging a heroic battle against the Communist threat to our Volk, the decomposition of our culture, the subversion of our art, and the poisoning of our public morality. We have put an end to denial of God and abuse of religion. We owe Providence humble gratitude for not allowing us to lose our battle against the misery of unemployment and for the salvation of the German peasant.\"[55]\n \n In a speech delivered at Koblenz, August 26, 1934 Hitler states: \"There may have been a time when even parties founded on the ecclesiastical basis were a necessity. At that time Liberalism was opposed to the Church, while Marxism was anti-religious. But that time is past. National Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious, but on the contrary, it stands on the ground of a real Christianity. The Church's interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of to-day, in our fight against the Bolshevist culture, against an atheistic movement, against criminality, and in our struggle for the consciousness of a community in our national life, for the conquest of hatred and disunion between the classes, for the conquest of civil war and unrest, of strife and discord. These are not anti-Christian, these are Christian principles.\"[56]\n \n During negotiations leading to the Nazi-Vatican Concordat of April 26, 1933 Hitler argued that \"Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith.\"[57]\n [edit] Islamic and eastern religions\n \n Among eastern religions, Hitler described religious leaders such as \"Confucius, Buddha, and Mohammed\" as providers of \"spiritual sustenance\".[58] In this context, Hitler's connection to Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Mufti of Jerusalem - which included asylum in 1941, the honorary rank of an SS Major, and a \"respected racial genealogy\" - has been interpreted more as a sign of respect than political expedience.[59] Hitler expressed admiration for the Muslim military tradition and directed Himmler to initiate Muslim SS Divisions as a matter of policy. According to Nazi-era Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer, Hitler stated in private, \"The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?\"[60] According to Speer, when discussing with Hitler events which might have occurred had Islam absorbed Europe:\n \n \"Hitler said that the conquering Arabs, because of their racial inferiority, would in the long run have been unable to contend with the harsher climate and conditions of the country. They could not have kept down the more vigorous natives, so that ultimately not Arabs but Islamized Germans could have stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire.\"[60]\n \n Hitler's choice of the Swastika as the Nazis' main and official symbol, was linked to the belief in the Aryan cultural descent of the German people. They considered the early Aryans of India to be the prototypical white invaders and the sign as a symbol of the Aryan master race.[61] Thus, high caste Hindus such as Brahmins, were considered to be pure Aryan due to their genealogical connection to the ancient Aryans. However, despite the Roma's Indian origin, they were considered a threat to German racial hygiene because they were in fact, descended from Aryans, but were of poorer classes that had mingled with the various \"inferior\" races they encountered during their wanderings.\n [edit] Role of religion in the Nazi state\n \n Hitler was opposed to state atheism, which for example was part of the political system of the Soviet Union. He issued a statement saying that he wished to avoid factional disputes in Germany's churches.[62] Hitler feared the political power that the churches had, and did not want to openly antagonize that political base until he had securely gained control of the country. Once in power Hitler showed his contempt for non-Aryan religion and sought to eliminate it from areas under his rule.[63][64] Within Hitler's Nazi Party some atheists were quite vocal, especially Martin Bormann.[65] Hitler often used religious speech and symbolism in his propaganda to promote Nazism to those that he feared would be disposed to act against him.[66][67] He also used religion as a pretext in diplomacies. The Soviet Union feared that if they commenced a programme of persecution against religion in the western regions, Hitler would use that as a pretext for war.[68]\n \n In 1985 the Austrian author Wilfried Daim published a photograph of an alleged document signed by Hitler in 1943, which proposed the:\n \n \"Immediate and unconditional abolition of all religions after the final victory ('Endsieg') not only for the territory of Greater Germany but also for all released, occupied and annexed countries ..., proclaiming at the same time Hitler as the new messiah. Out of political considerations the Muslim, Buddhist and Shintoist religion will be spared for the present. The 'F\u00fchrer' has to be presented as an intermediate between a redeemer and a liberator, yet surely as one sent by God, who has to get godly honour. The existing churches, chapels, temples and cult places of the different religions have to be changed into 'Adolf-Hitler-consecration places'. The theological faculties of the universities have to be transformed into the new faith. Special emphasis has to be lain on the education of missionaries and wandering preachers, who have to proclaim the teaching in Greater Germany and in the rest of the world and have to form religious bodies, which can be used as centres for further extension. (With this the problems with the abolition of monogamy will disappear, because polygamy can be included into the new teaching as one of the statements of faith.)\"[69][70]\n \n [edit] Hitler's marriage\n \n In the F\u00fchrerbunker on April 29, 1945, the day before their suicide, Hitler and Eva Braun married in front of a civil servant of the city of Berlin, in a cramped map room without a religious service or blessing ceremony.\n [edit] God, racism and anti-Semitism\n \n To the extent he believed in a divinity, Hitler did not believe in a \"remote, rationalist divinity\" but in an \"active deity,\"[71] which he frequently referred to as \"Creator\" or \"Providence\". In Hitler's belief God created a world in which different races fought each other for survival as depicted by Arthur de Gobineau. The \"Aryan race,\" supposedly the bearer of civilization, is allocated a special place:\n \n What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and the reproduction of our race ... so that our people may mature for the fulfilment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe. ... Peoples that bastardize themselves, or let themselves be bastardized, sin against the will of eternal Providence.[71]\n \n The Jews he viewed as enemies of all civilization and as materialistic, unspiritual beings, writing in Mein Kampf: \"His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine.\" Hitler described his supposedly divine mandate for his anti-Semitism: \"Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.\"[72]\n \n In his rhetoric Hitler also fed on the old accusation of Jewish Deicide. Because of this it has been speculated that Christian anti-Semitism influenced Hitler's ideas, especially such works as Martin Luther's essay On the Jews and Their Lies and the writings of Paul de Lagarde. Others disagree with this view.[73] In support of this view, Hitler biographer John Toland opines that Hitler \"carried within him its teaching that the Jew was the killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of conscience since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God...\" Nevertheless, in Mein Kampf Hitler writes of an upbringing in which no particular anti-Semitic prejudice prevailed.\n \n According to American historian Lucy Dawidowicz, Anti-Semitism has a long history within Christianity, and that the line of \"anti-Semitic descent\" from Luther to Hitler is \"easy to draw.\" In her The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945, she writes that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the \"demonologized universe\" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz states that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern Anti-Semitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of Judenhass, which can be traced to Haman's advice to Ahasuerus, although modern German anti-Semitism also has its roots in German nationalism.[74]\n [edit] Hitler and Catholic ritual\n \n In his childhood, Hitler had admired the pomp of Catholic ritual and the hierarchical organisation of the clergy. Later, he drew on these elements, organizing his party along hierarchical lines and including liturgical forms into events or using phraseology taken from hymns.[75] Because of these liturgical elements, Hitler's Messiah-like status and the ideology's all-encompassing nature, the Nazi movement is sometimes termed a \"political religion\".[76]\n [edit] Adolf Hitler and Ariosophy\n \n Hitler's contact to Lanz von Liebenfels makes it necessary to examine how far his religious views were influenced by Ariosophy, an esoteric movement in Germany and Austria that flourished from the 1890s to the 1920s. (Whether Ariosophy is to be classified as Germanic paganism or Occultism is a different question.) The seminal work on Ariosophy, The Occult Roots of Nazism by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, devotes its last chapter the topic of Ariosophy and Adolf Hitler. Not at least due to the difficulty of sources, historians disagree about the importance of Ariosophy for Hitler's religious views. As noted in the foreword of The Occult Roots of Nazism by Rohan Butler, Goodrick-Clarke is more cautious in assessing the influence of Lanz von Liebenfels on Hitler than Joachim Fest in his biography of Hitler.[77] A Hitler biography by John Toland that appeared in 1992 reprints a poem that Hitler allegedly wrote while serving in the German Army on the Western Front in 1915.[78] This poem includes references to magical runes and the pre-Christian Germanic deity Woden, but it is mentioned neither by Goodrick-Clarke nor by Fest.\n \n While he was in power, Hitler was definitely less interested in the occult or the esoteric than other Nazi leaders. Unlike Heinrich Himmler and Rudolf Hess, for example, Hitler had no interest in astrology. Nevertheless, Hitler is the most important figure in the Modern Mythology of Nazi occultism. There are teledocumentaries about this topic, with the titles Hitler and the Occult and Hitler's Search for the Holy Grail.[79]\n \n Comparing him to Erich von Ludendorff, Fest writes: \"Hitler had detached himself from such affections, in which he encountered the obscurantism of his early years, Lanz v. Liebenfels and the Thule Society, again, long ago and had, in Mein Kampf, formulated his scathing contempt for that v\u00f6lkish romanticism, which however his own cosmos of imagination preserved rudimentarily.\"[80] Fest refers to the following passage from Mein Kampf:\n \n The characteristic thing about these people [modern-day followers of the early Germanic religion] is that they rave about the old Germanic heroism, about dim prehistory, stone axes, spear and shield, but in reality are the greatest cowards that can be imagined. For the same people who brandish scholarly imitations of old German tin swords, and wear a dressed bearskin with bull's horns over their heads, preach for the present nothing but struggle with spiritual weapons, and run away as fast as they can from every Communist blackjack.[81]\n \n It is not clear if this statement is an attack at anyone specific. It could have been aimed at Karl Harrer or at the Strasser group. According to Goodrick-Clarke, \"In any case, the outburst clearly implies Hitler's contempt for conspiratorial circles and occult-racist studies and his preference for direct activism.\"[82] Hitler also said something similar in public speeches.[83]\n \n Older literature states that Hitler had no intention of instituting worship of the ancient Germanic gods in contrast to the beliefs of some other Nazi officials.[84] In Hitler's Table Talk one can find this quote:\n \n It seems to me that nothing would be more foolish than to re-establish the worship of Wotan. Our old mythology ceased to be viable when Christianity implanted itself. Nothing dies unless it is moribund.\n \n According to an online article from the Simon Wiesenthal Center,[85] the influence of the anti-Judaic, Gnostic and root race teachings of H.P. Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, and the adaptations of her ideas by her followers, constituted a popularly unacknowledged but decisive influence over the developing mind of Hitler.",

   "As the first sentence of your link said: \"inconsistencies\". He was all over the map. \n\n \n Yeah. Like alot of religious people. However it does state he was in fact religious.\n \n \nIt goes to show that the association doesn't equal causality. \n\n \n Actually it does.\n \n 1. Adolf Hitler: Faith is the Only Basis for Morality\n \n This human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief. The great masses of a nation are not composed of philosophers. For the masses of the people, especially faith is absolutely the only basis of a moral outlook on life. The various substitutes that have been offered have not shown any results that might warrant us in thinking that they might usefully replace the existing denominations. ...There may be a few hundreds of thousands of superior men who can live wisely and intelligently without depending on the general standards that prevail in everyday life, but the millions of others cannot do so.\n \n - Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Vol. 1 Chapter 10 \n \n \n 1. Adolf Hitler: The Nazi Party Represents Positive Christianity\n \n \"We demand freedom for all religious confessions in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or conflict with the customs and moral sentiments of the Germanic race. The party as such represents the standpoint of a positive Christianity, without owing itself to a particular confession....\"\n \n \n - Article 20 of the program of the German Workers' Party (later named the National Socialist German Workers' Party, NSDAP) \n \n \n \n 1. Adolf Hitler: Religion is Not a Means of Doping the People\n \n But all that I heard had the effect of arousing the strongest antagonism in me. Everything was disparaged--the nation, because it was held to be an invention of the 'capitalist' class (how often I had to listen to that phrase!); the Fatherland, because it was held to be an instrument in the hands of the bourgeoisie for the exploitation of' the working masses; the authority of the law, because that was a means of holding down the proletariat; religion, as a means of doping the people, so as to exploit them afterwards; morality, as a badge of stupid and sheepish docility. There was nothing that they did not drag in the mud.\n \n - Adolf Hitler, on listening to Social Democrats, Mein Kampf, Vol. 1 Chapter 2 \n \n \nNo one is arguing Hitler wasn't religious in some sense; most people are, after all. \n\n \n OK. So then you acknowledge religion was part of Hitler's life then yes? You are stating that Hitler was influenced by religion in some way no matter how small...\n \n \n \n \n \n That doesn't mean his religion caused the atrocities.\n\n \n Your sugar coating the issue here Jyoshu. Look at the quotes above from Hitler himself. Do you think that religion played a part in his thinking? the answer is yes.\n \n \n \n Really, it's pretty ridiculous that religious people are even having to defend against this offensive tactic of yours. \n\n \n Offensive tactic? Every single time you open your mouth against gays it's an offensive tactic! You cry \"movement\" \"pride\" your \"culture\" you \"people\" and you don't think for a second that's not offensive?\n \n You snub your nose at homosexuals and attempt to put your religion on a pedestal for all to see. Do not portray me as a man of tactics when speaking truth Jyoshu. History in bold black above screams to the attention of the reader just how devout this man was to faith.\n \n \n \n You of all people should know better, Jason, given your outrage over the assertion that homosexuality was a cause for Hitler's atrocities. \n\n \n Actually not quite. You see history is nothing but truth. You cannot skew history the way Easy does. It shows holes in logic and he only posts bogus links to try and inflame others to enact a response.\n \n I however am posting actual quotes from Hitler himself. Read what you want into them, they are fact.\n \n \n \nShame on you.\n\n \n Oh please. Don't even try to flip flop and put the ball in my court on this. You play the wounded puppy whenever your faith is called out as having ANY consequence on the outcome of humanity and civilization as it stands.\n \n \n \n Don't complain about people playing the Hitler card and then turn around and play it yourself--that's hypocritical of you.\n \n \n I'm playing nothing Jyoshu. You choose to ignore fact. You choose to downplay influence into Hitler's consciousness. You choose to try and wiggle out of the hard truth that is staring back at you. \n \n \nParticularly in the wrong forum.\n\n \n Perhaps you should read into history and get your facts strait before you call me a hypocrite. If you cannot see the difference between my posting and that of Easyrider then perhaps you shouldn't be on this forum.",

   "If you want to understand what the NAZI party and Hitler were about read ominous parallels. Of all the documents I have read on the nazi's only that book repeatedly uses the original quotes and source material. Other people just comment on what the nazi's wanted but rarely give you anything but little snippets of what they said. That is because the truth is uncomfortable to them.\n \n The truth is a lot worse than either religious nuts or leftist try to paint it as. The nazis were not about specific goals nor did they ascribe to any other particular tradition. Their revolution was the essence of irrationality, the concept of logic was erased from their vocabulary so that they could believe in absolute principles in one minute but drop them the next. They were nearly completly distilled collectivism. They praised components of existing social elements when they wanted to. They praised the faith and mysticism of religion (all religions) because they were irrational and a german was expected to be mystical and full of faith (what didn't particularly matter) as the nazis were primarily pragmatist and would literally say or do anything to acquire loyalty to the state. The only standard of good for a nazi was the race or the class. They were 'religious' but in a totally unique and novel sense. They worshiped, had faith in, had rituals for, and indoctrinated with the volk. The racial collective they believed in. You are trying to judge their actions by what they said of other religions? No, they judged other religions by how they helped the aryan collective. Contradiction and inconsistency is the standard policy of collectivist, not this imaginary comprehensible position everyone looks for. They both condemned Christianity and praised it. They wanted peace and war. They wanted free trade and government control. Hitler was a jew and a jew hater. They locked down the vatican but they called a crusade back in the homeland to get what catholics that were left to accept them. I have no trouble believing both that they had homosexuals in high office and that they murdered them in concentration camps because their standard is that which cannot be understood. They were trying to build big brother on earth and they were going to do it by killing everyone who could not or would not be confused and illusioned.",
