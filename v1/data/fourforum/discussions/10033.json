   "Some interesting facts about abortion. Found at The Encyclopedia of Death and Dying, the Abortion entry http://www.deathreference.com/A-Bi/Abortion.html. Never heard of this site. This article is referenced and they seem like reasonable sources. I think this particular excerpt showed me a worldwide perspective I had not be aware of. I think the information is presented dispassionately, implying neither favor nor oppostion to abortion legalization. The title of this section is the title of this thread.\n \n \n\n Unplanned and unwanted pregnancies are common, and this fact fuels the controversy in every region of the world. Globally, more than one in four women who become pregnant have an abortion or an unwanted birth. In the developed countries of the world, including those in North America and Western Europe, where average desired family size is small, an estimated 49 percent of the 28 million pregnancies each year are unplanned and 36 percent of the total pregnancies end in abortion. In the developing countries, including parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, where desirable family sizes are larger, an estimated 36 percent of the 182 million pregnancies each year are unplanned and 20 percent end in abortion.\n \n Women worldwide commonly initiate sexual intercourse by age twenty, whether they are married or unmarried. In the developed countries, 77 percent have had intercourse by age twenty. This compares to 83 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and 56 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. Couples in many countries have more children than they would like, or have a child at a time when they do not want one. The average woman in Kenya has six children, while the desired family size is four; the average Bangladeshi woman has four children but desires three.\n \n From a global perspective, 46 million women have abortions each year; 78 percent of these live in developing countries and 22 percent live in developed countries. About 11 percent of all the women who have abortions live in Africa, 58 percent in Asia, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean; 17 percent live in Europe, and the remaining 5 percent live elsewhere in the developed world.\n \n Of the 46 million women who have abortions each year in the world, 26 million women have abortions legally and 20 million have abortions in countries where abortion is restricted or prohibited by law. For every 1,000 women of childbearing age in the world, each year 35 are estimated to have an induced abortion. The abortion rate for women in developed regions is 39 abortions per 1,000 women per year; in the developing regions the rate is 34 per 1,000 per year. Rates in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada are 10 to 23 per year.\n",

   "Like they say the objective should be to make abortion legal, available, and rare. You make it rare by birth control, contraception, morning after pill availability, sex eductaion, economic improvement, and when all those layers of \"defense\" fail resort to abortion at the choice of the woman or not as the case might be. All the methods and techniques are needed including abortion, but that should be a last resort for the mother. Regardless it must be available.",

Those pills aren't. They just keep hormones in the body from reaching the uterus or from being excreted in the first place. If anything, the morning after pill is more like a coathanger operation.",
