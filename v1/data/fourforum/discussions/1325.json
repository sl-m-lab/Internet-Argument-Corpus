HIV however, is a virus, so you might be able to make the argument that it has living qualities. And like Charchuck has stated, HIV originated in Africa, and all scientific evidence points to oral / vascular transmission through a bite from an infected primate.

   "Here, I found some statistics and posted them for you. \n \n This is blood transmission:\n \n2) Direct contact with infected blood, this remains a very efficient method of transmission with over 90% of persons exposed to HIV infected blood becoming infected. In the general population, this risk remains primarily within the population that shares needles and/or syringes for drug administration. Also, there is a direct correlation to the amount of virus in the blood and the rate of transmission. The second method of transmission with direct blood contact is through blood transfusions. In the US, this method of transmission has decreased drastically to a rate of 1:1,125,000 transfused products. In comparison, the estimated rate for the transmission of hepatitis in blood products is 1:200.\n \n \n http://www.endlessedu.com/HIV.htm \n \n And this is male/male anal intercourse transmission:\n \nResearchers found that the per-contact risk of acquiring HIV from unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a partner who was known to be HIV-infected was 0.82%. When partners of unknown serostatus were included, the estimated per-contact risk was 0.27%. In comparison, the estimated per-contact risk of protected receptive anal intercourse with an HIV-infected partner or an unknown serostatus partner was 0.18%. The authors suggest that this finding is probably due in part to condom failure that may be under-reported or under-recognized. \n \n \n \nThe study confirmed that the risk of HIV infection is lower for unprotected insertive anal intercourse. The estimated per-contact risk of this behavior with an HIV-infected partner or an unknown serostatus partner is 0.06%. \n \n \n http://www.siecus.org/pubs/shop/volume4/shpv40042.html",

The parts I posted about sexual contact shows rates of transmission per contact with a known HIV positive person. It seperates these into receptive intercourse (where a person receives the penis of an infected partner), and insertive intercourse (where a person places his penis into an infected partner). The links I posted show nothing of the rate of transmission while using a barrier contraceptive, but the rate of transmission is much lower when they are used. The quote that you pulled out and pasted from the 2 paragraphs was saying that you have less risk if you place your penis into an infected partner than if an infected partner places his penis in you. \n \n \nAnd what so special about the anus that one can dig in toxious feces/blood and come up squeaky clean?
