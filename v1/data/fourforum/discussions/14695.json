And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. \n \n Now this Clearly states that God Created Man and Woman at the same time, and that he told them to \"Go Forth, and Multiply\"..

Once he realized that man should have a helper he then introduces him to all the animals then makes woman. \n \n 18 The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\" \n \n 19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. \n But for Adam [h] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs [i] and closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib [j] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. \n \n And now beastiality is forbidden. \n \n Also the order is reversed in 1 compared to 2. \n Why would they care about Gold and Onyx.\n Last time I checked men and women came out of woman\n Oddly woman is the one who leaves her family, not man\n I wonder if God had to explain exactly how they were to multiply. That would be an interesting conversation. \n \n Also it seems perfectly clear to me that God from the very begining intended for man to be his gardener and nothing more.",

I'd like to hear some legitimate explanations if you will.\n\n \n \n You belch and your yahoo cohorts lap it up. You folks are true novices.\n \n It is often claimed that Genesis 1 and 2 contain two different creation-narratives. In point of fact, however, the strictly complementary nature of the &#8220;two&#8221; accounts is plain enough: Genesis 1 mentions the creation of man as the last of a series, and without any details, whereas in Genesis 2 man is the centre of interest and more specific details are given about him and his setting. There is no incompatible duplication here at all. Failure to recognize the complementary nature of the subject-distinction between a skeleton outline of all creation on the one hand, and the concentration in detail on man and his immediate environment on the other, borders on obscurantism (1966, pp. 116-117, emp. in orig.).\n \n Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis?\n \n As for Cain finding a wife elsewhere, that isn't what the Bible says.\n \n Some claim that the passage in Genesis 4:16-17 means that Cain went to the land of Nod and found a wife. Thus, they can conclude there must have been another race of people on the earth, who were not descendants of Adam, who produced Cain's wife.\n \n &#8220;And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and he called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.&#8221;\n \n From what has been stated previously, it is clear that all humans, Cain's wife included, are descendants of Adam. However, this passage does not say that Cain went to the land of Nod and found a wife. John Calvin, commenting on these verses, states:\n \n &#8220;From the context we may gather that Cain, before he slew his brother, had married a wife; otherwise Moses would now have related something respecting his marriage.&#8221;[13]\n \n Cain was married before he went to the land of Nod. He didn't find a wife there, but &#8220;knew&#8221; (had sexual relations with) his wife.[14]\n \n Where did Cain get his wife? - ChristianAnswers.Net\n \n You really need to study the Bible instead of butchering it. Your superficial expectoration of it is clearly sophomoric.",

Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.\n 35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. \n \n \n \n Ephesians 5:22 - 25*\n \n  22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\n 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.\n 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\n \n \n \n 1 Timothy 2:9 - 15*\n \n  9. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;\n 10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.\n 11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.\n 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\n 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.\n 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\n 15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. \n \n \n 1 Peter 3:1 -3\n \n  1. Likewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;\n 2 While they behold your chaste conversation [coupled] with fear.\n 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward [adorning] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; \n \n \n Leviticus 12:2 *\n  \n 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. \n \n Leviticus 12:5\n \n  5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. \n \n \n \n Esther 1:22\n  \n 22 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people. \n \n Job 25:4 *\n \n  4 How then can man be justified with God? or , how can he be clean [that is] born of a woman? \n \n \n Deuteronomy 22:5 *\n \n  5.
