   "\n Brutus: BO wants to socialize health care, Republicans oppose and want to repeal. Jefferson and modern Republicans want a Balanced Budget Amendment to cut liberal government down to size. Democrats opppose. Its stuff in the papers everyday\n\n \n Ne, he doesnt. Look up the definition of \"socialist\" and stop listening to Rush. Requiring that every american purchase a health insurance policy form a private company certainly reeks of fascism, but has no relationshiop whatsoever to socialism.\n \n Also, very few modern republicans want a balanced budget amendment. The last time they made a run at that, Newt was leading the charge. Since then republicans had total control of the government for 8 years....boht houses of congress and the white house...and not only was a balanced budget amendment not proposed, we saw the fastest growth of government since WWII.\n \n Maybe you have missed this little factoid, but for the last 50 years the government has typically grown FASTER under REPUBLICAN administrations than democrat ones. It looks like Obama is going to buck that trend, and be the first democrat in over 50 years to increase the size of government faster than the republicans, but we cant actually make that determination until the end of his first term. \n \n Frankly the government is as big as it is because the REPUBLICANS, starting with Reagan, made it that big. \n \n \n \nBrutus: it is not that they are different it is that they are anti American. America stands for freedom, not government!! Is that really so hard to understand? The purpose of the Constitution was to make liberals illegal!! America stands for something, not everything!!\n\n \n The purpose of the constitution was not to make liberals illegal. The purpose of the constitution was to provide a framework for self rule. \n \n \n \nBrutus: Republican founders stood for freedom and liberty from government exactly as modern Republicans do, particularily as Tea Party Republicans do or as National Review Republicans do.\n\n \n There is no such thing as a \"republican founder\". That term is silly. The republican party was started in 1854. All the founders were dead by then. Second, the founders did not stand for freedom and liberty from government. They CREATED a new government. \n \n As far as tea baggers are concerned, some of them are not bad, but a lot of them are stoopid. Our founding fathers believed in, above all else, responsible governance. Most of them advocated running balanced budgets and not running up debts. Every single one of the founding fathers at one time or another supported LARGE tax increases to pay for our government. \n \n \n Tea baggers are not that good. They talk about fiscal responsibility, but at the same time advocate tax cuts, which right now is the most irresponsible thing we could possibly do. \n \n \n \n \nBrutus: according to Republican theory, since Aristotle, there is nothing new under the sun, politicially. There is only freedom or government. Jeffefrson gave us freedom from all forms of new government becuase he had studied history and learned that all government was bad government. That is why he gave us freedom from all of it.\n This is political philosophy 101 at best. \n\n \n Actually, political philosophy 101, and the basic principals of jeffersonian democracy, would tell you that government is what PROVIDES the freedom you are talking about. Citizens abdicate power to the government and in return the government provides security and infrastructure so that the citizen may thrive. Without government you have anarchy. Nobody of any intelligence wants that. \n \n Franky your claim that jefferson \"gave us freedom from all forms of new government\" is completely nonsensical. The guy was one of the authors of the constitution. He is primarily known for creating a new form of government. If not for that, nobody would know who the guy was. \n \n \nBrutus: well, for example, they do claim Jefferson as a Democrat despite the exact opposite philosophy.

The liberals spied for Stalin because they like the statist philosophy more than the freedom philosophy. BO voted to the left of Sanders( open socialist) for the same reason but still lies about it.\n\n \n And you are pretending Jefforson was a republican, which is just silly since the republican party was not founded until 1854 (jefferson died in 1826).",

It is always oppressive.\n \n -I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.\n \n -My reading of history convinces me that bad government results from too much government.\n \n -Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.\n \n -Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.\n \n -The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.\n \n -Most bad government has grown out of too much government.\n \n -Were we directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread.\n \n -Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms [of government] those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.\n \n -I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious.\n \n \n Brutus: now then, wouldn't you be happier in Cuba?",

Any way you look at it, 100% of the incentive to make deficits and debt illegal is Republican regardless of what some Republicans do to get elected by independents. Is that really over your head? \n\n \n It is an absolute FACT that over the last 50 years, the government has expanded MORE under republicans than democrats. That is not even debatable, it is simply a fact. \n \n It is an absolute fact that until Nixon, a republican, took us off the gold standard, the US was the nations biggest creditor nation. It is an absolute fact that Nixon had to take us off the gold standard due to massive, irresponsible spending by Eisenhower, also a republican, and Nixon himself. \n \n It is an absolute FACT that by the end of Johnsons administration, also a republican, we had gone from being the worlds biggest creditor to being a debtor nation.\n \n It is an absolute FACT that due to Reagans MASSIVE deficit spending, we became not just a debtor nation, but the worlds biggest debtor nation.\n \n It is an absolute FACT that during the Bush administration, when the republicans controlled both congress and the white house and could have passed anything they wanted, what they passed was the biggest expansion of government since WWII. \n \n Maybe you could find a kiddie forum somewhere to frequent.

The first welfare program in this country was actually created during Jeffersons presidency and it was to help support widows of the American Revolution.\n \n Second, time have changed. Through most of this nations history, there was free land to be had. All you had to do was be willing to work hard. There were always frontier areas and, contrary to a lot of peoples beliefs, there were not strong property rights when it came to land in this country. It benefited the nation more to get as much land into production as possible as opposed to letting it just sit. For example, for most of this nations history if a house had been empty for 5 years, you could just move into it and claim it as yours. The same went for land that was not being actively worked.\n \n This changes during the depression. Suddenly you had banks coming into possession of massive amounts of land and real estate. If the old laws had remained in effect, they would have lost most of it because it was not being kept productive, and squatters would have taken it over. He who has the gold makes the rules, so the banks had the laws changed.\n \n That is also where property taxes started coming into play. In changing the policy they were essentially allowing wealthy individuals to hold huge amounts of land and keep it non productive. Property tax was essentially created to make up the revenue shortfall that was created by allowing that land to be fallow. \n \n Today we have a completely different system. A hungry man does not have the option of just finding some unused land and planting a garden. Somebody who is unemployed and cannot find a job does not have the option of becoming a market hunter, or catching fish in the local river to sell. \n \n The fact that in 1802 they did not really need any kind of social welfare programs is completely irrelevant to today.

In your world it is all about the rich powerful corporations and to hell with the people at the bottom who have to suffer. \n \n The reason the great recession was not turn into the 2nd great depression was because of the safety net, and fail safes put in place after the 1930's.

Do you want to live by Nazi Communist fascist monarchical rules or the 10 Commandments???? Are you insane???\n\n \n \n I want to live by what is set out in the constitution. The problem is you have a view that the 10 commandments are a good thing, and in our nation, that is a patchwork of many cultures, only 3 have anything to do with the common good. The fact that you would ask me that is telling of your position.\n \n Wake up and understand that Nazism is on the right, reactionary,side of the of the political spectrum and Communism is on the left, radical, side of the political spectrum. The republicans are moving towards the fascist or Nazi right and the democrats are center right and moving in that direction also. Only the Greens remain on the left.
