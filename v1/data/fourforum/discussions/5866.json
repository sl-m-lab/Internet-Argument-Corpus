When the first combat divisions landed in Vietnam, evacuation and field hospitals, fully staffed and equipped, landed with them. \n \n There was a resolve to provide the best possible support for the troops. Medical supplies, food, water, fuel and safe transportation were supplied by the military, not by profit-motivated, politically connected private contractors.\n \n If we truly support our troops in Iraq, it's time for some answers: Why were we unprepared? Where has the money gone that was supposed to support our troops? Why hasn't Congress corrected the tax law inequities so that all Americans share the cost? \n \n And most important, why have some in the media been reluctant to report the facts? Ultimately, the media reported on Vietnam, and the truth made us a better nation.\n \n Franklin M. Schall -- Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. -- June 27, 2005\n The writer was an Army supply officer, 1964-66.",

   "I just read where the vehicle armor issue has become secondary to what's becoming a 'learning' Iraqi resistance. Shaped road charges are now being used to direct explosive energy to penetrate even the most heavily armored personnel carriers such as Humvees. And additional armor reduces the evasive capability (performance) design of those vehicles by as much as 40%.\n \n Oddly enough, our tank development reached such mammoth proportions using conventional open field warfare as a base requirement (cold war mentality) that most are unable to use conventional roads or operate in cities due to weight and bulk.",

IT is a trade off....speed and agility for limited protection. The hummer is not a fast vehicle (45-50 MPH down hill with a tail wind). If you add armor, you end up slowing it down and making it even less maneuverable. You CANNOT armor a hummer enough to make it a good fighting vehicle.\n \n Teh American public fails to realise that you have fighting vehicles, which are hevy enough to sit in while the world explodes around you, and you have transport vehicles, which are designed to move. Adding armor to a transport vehicle does not tranform it into a fighting vehicle, it just reduces its capacity as a transport vehicle.\n \n The biggest problem with body armor is getting the men to wear it. It does not take long for them to figure out that the odds of it saving their life is negligeble, but the odds of it getting them killed due to added bulk and weight are pretty good.",
