You have an agenda and a perspective when you invent a word, so does anyone else. Orwell foretold that language can be used as a means of social control in general, and if you'd really read 1984 you would know that Orwell would have disagreed with any attempts to criminalize sex.\n \n The word homophobia or homophobic came from popular gay culture, not clinical nomenclature. The prefix homo has become so much associated in American English with homosexuality that it was used as shorthand for homosexual in the word homophobic (probably originally in a joking way). Phobia is obviously not the same thing as bigotry, but phobia has become popularized as an exagerrated way to describe fear or dislike. The word homophobia, despite being kind of a misnomer, is the term commonly used to describe anti-homosexual sentiment, so that's what people will call it.\n \n People still insist on saying \"reflexes\" when they mean \"reaction time\", and \"weary\" instead of \"wary\" or vice versa.
