A right is not an entitlement to a good or service, much less a job. That is the exact opposite of a right.\n \n \n4. abolishment of slavery\n\n \n LOL I really honestly do not see the difference between the slavery in America prior to 1865 and the Feudalism of sharecropping later imposed under the military dictatorships in the Southern states established by America.\n \n \n5. public education\n\n \n Public Education was introducted in the United States to indoctrinate and brainwash the public, especially in the South in the aftermath of the Civil War.

   "A representative democracy may or may not be a plutocracy, but it IS a step up from anything else we've managed to do. Liberalism isn't about achieving ideals, that's impossible. It's about striving towards them, and a representative democracy was an important step.\n \n Minimum wage: first of all, your conservative collegues at the CATO institute will tell you that the only way to bring a minimum wage to places such as mexico is to liberalize trade laws so it becomes economically viable to do so. Once the Mexican economy is stablized and strong, reformist and labor groups will be able to exert enough pressure to get the laws passed. In any case, your logic is fallacious, because liberal legislators in the US got US minimum wage laws passed, and I'm sure liberal mexican legislators are working for the same thing their. We can't blame american liberals that minimum wage doesnt exist down south, and we can't blame NAFTA for establishing a system that already existed, nor can we say that NAFTA supports anti-min. wage reforms in mexico past that it overall benefits the mexican economy.\n \n Civil Rights: If you've noticed, both me and falling oppose aff action. But that wasn't what civil rights was about. It was about equal justice, rights, and treatment by government entities and programs. That was a liberal movement. Can you stop making straw man arguments.\n \n Slavery: how is it liberals fault that conservatives managed to make clever end runs around the abolishment of slavery? at least we TRIED to fix the problem.\n \n Public School: Regardless of the motives of public school education, I'd say that it is doing fine right now as a whole. Example: In Student Congress debate, quite possibly the greatest compititor ever was a public school kid from Ft. Lauderdale Florida. Congress debate, which requires research skills and political and law knowledge rivaling anything a private school would require, is a good indicator of the strength of public schools. Also, regardless of what pub. schools are doing now or then, the fact is the principle of the matter is an essential reform to progressing the nation.\n \n Constitution: Does anyone bother to look at this old scroll? Well, I do, as a centerpiece of my committment to furthering a civil rights and human rights agenda.\n \n \nLOL \"freedom of the press.\" Whatever, more like the freedom to choose between the Likud or Labour media of the Jews.\n \n And with that, your credibilty is shot. That has to be the most anti-semetic comment uttered on this board. Do we control those global plutocracies too (and the money, and banks, and hollywood...)",

   "American neo-liberalism offers a horrid prospect\n \n It is evident that liberalism has done nothing but hurt the health of our nation. American liberalism has degraded the very fabric of our nation through whatever means necessary. Almost any aspect of life in the United States can be evaluated by how much liberalism has done to hurt it. Health Care, minimum wage, entitlement programs, the justice system, morality, free speech, and national defense all provide examples of liberal corruption.\n \n First of all, health care costs have risen to exorbitant levels. This is called the 'cost disease' in the service sector, which has effected health care more than most other services provided by our economy. Why? Some would say this is due to greedy capitalists who are gouging the public. Reasonable people understand that a large reason that the health care sector is tremendously effected is due to the bureaucracy. For the most part people in this country our covered by health care, many of them on Medicaid and Medicare. Both are institutions created by liberals. Flooding the market with government subsidies for health care has increased the damage done by this 'cost disease'. Manufactures of health care products look to exploit the 'free money' in the market and charge more for their merchandise. Along with entitlement programs come laws that demand treatment of people who are illegal aliens or not covered by insurance. Hospitals much make the cost up somewhere so they tack it to the bills of people who pay for insurance. This is why premiums have increased drastically. Of course, these examples are simplistic and require further investigation. The topic is too broad for this post, however it demonstrates the damage socialism has done to this aspect of American life. \n \n Next, look at minimum wage. Personally, I don't know a single person who works for minimum wage. At one time, I did. It was my first corporate job and I was 14. Anyone with any skill would not be required to live of such a small wage. People act as if minimum wage were some sort of liberal triumph. In reality it is a joke and so is anyone who would agree to work for peanuts. Any economics course will demonstrate the problem with price floors and ceilings. When you play with Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' the results can be catastrophic. In this case, I believe that many \n teenagers are being paid less than the market would allow, since the government decrees that the minimum wage is fair. In reality, they would have been paid more if the market system had decided fair price for unskilled labor. Congratulations, liberals have helped the small business owner stiff high school kids. \n \n As far as entitlement programs are concerned, refer to Medicare and Medicaid above. We could also look at the ridiculous retirement program that was set up for America's seniors. Barely a 3% return on investment, a profit that is smaller than the rate of inflation. Personally, I would never choose such a poor investment for myself. Unfortunately, I don't have a choice, since my investment is going to pay for today's retired citizens. That is why politicians remain in politics rather than business, simply because they are terrible with money. It is easy to see how the consumer gets screwed on this deal. Money that would be better served in other investments is being deferred to a failing system, which will leave all Americans without a serious retirement budget. \n \n ...The justice system is being rapidly eroded by the deterministic perspective, a hallmark to liberal idealism. It is no longer meant to serve justice, but is seen as a system meant to rehabilitate. \"Poor guy, he was a product of his environment, it is no wonder that society forced him into the position to commit murder\". \n \n .....Morality. The relativist perspective has allowed for anyone's perversions to be justified by his or her culture, and has inhibited anyone from deciding what is right and what is wrong. \"So the Taliban treats women so poorly, that is just the way of their culture. One must not pass judgment on another person's culture\". \n \n .....Free speech. \"Hate crime!\" \"Sexual Harassment!\" These are disguised as methods of insuring everyone's comfort levels, but they are truly designed to silence others. If you don't like the cut of somebody's jib, simply shout out either of the two phrases and people will cower for fear of a lawsuit. Beware the man who\n want's to silence anyone for any reason.\n \n .....National Defense. Too easy. Look at the fallout eight years of liberal disruption has had on our society. The intelligence and military communities have been downsized to a level that leaves us vulnerable to a bunch of troglodytes. If we didn't have such a liberal view on immigration, we would not be asked to endure possible homicide bombings on U.S. soil. We were contenders with the world's superpowers, now we are being terrorized by the MiddleEastern equivalent of our hillbillies. \n \n Rest assured most of the ridiculous policy and trivial matters, which are the focus of today's media, results from the rise of liberalism in America. When you hear something that makes your blood boil, when you think that something is too stupid to be reality, there is probably a liberal behind it. Although it makes great material for the stand up comic, the joke is on you. You are digging your own grave. It is up to all of us to educate ourselves and extinguish this horrible disease, known as liberalism, once and for all.",

   "cutting and pasting other peoples ideas\n\n \n I find that to be very insulting. The ideas that I espouse are my own. Would you care to explain why you would suggest otherwise? Furthermore, the responses that I have seen coming from you are hardly note worthy.\n \n The claim that today's neo-liberalism is responsible for democracy is a joke. It's true that those who sought to change the nature of government during the American Revolution were liberals in the true sense of the word, but even the most uneducated person could deduce that my question concerns today's illiberal mindset. The type of person who believes they have the right to spew out any garbage they like without ever having to defend that freedom. Most anyone can see the distinction between the great men who founded our constitution, and the whining worms who wish weaken every pillar that supports our system. It's easy to see how the conservatives are the ones trying to protect the principles that were developed by the framers, while the liberals wish to hand American citizens over to the whims of a brutal dictator. The comparison you made was foolish, at best. I find it laughable that anyone would equate those vile anti-war protestors that are in the streets fomenting garbage to those who gave them the right to do it. There is no comparison when it comes to bravery, character, and intelligence. The classic liberal represents the best of humanity, while today's American \"liberal\" represents the worst of the entire animal kingdom. In fact, I am not so sure that they have been accurately labeled as human. To me, they seem to exhibit more of the characteristics that belong under the virus category.\n \n Any other points that you would like me to address specifically, or are you only interested in attacking me personally?",

   "You said, \"public education\", and the question I asked concerned America, not Europe. Therefore, what you are trying to do now is a very disingenuous. You listed off many things that applied to America; but now you expect me to believe that you were referring to some generic idea about the value of education that applied to Europe during the enlightenment era, and not the system of public education that was advanced here in America by a conservative need to protect the status quo.\n \n Besides, if you liberals were such advocates for public education, why is it that the left has largely been in control of the education system in America, but we have graduates from the public school system that can not read? Why are the inner city schools so deplorable? How has the left's socialistic system, largely free from competition, advanced the education level of our children? Why is it so common to hear about high school seniors doing absolutely horrendous on these general history exams? If the liberals cared about anything other than indoctrinating our children with perverse notions of the anti-American, anti-religious, pro homosexual order, then our schools would be second to none. However, this is not the case and we are losing our technical and competitive edge to countries like Japan. Like I said in my earlier post, what liberals have done to our education system should be recognized as one of the more harmful effects that today's liberal has caused. It is yet another example of the erosion of our institutions that is largely a concerted effort on the part of liberals. The extent of such damage never ceases to amaze me. How the American people allowed such termites to infest the bureaucracy, I will never understand.",
