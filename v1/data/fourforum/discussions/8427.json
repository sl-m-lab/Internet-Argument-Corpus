   "LOL. The title of this should hvae been \"Bush shoots US in foot again\".\n \n Note that these sanctions primarily consist of prohibitions against investment in IRanain oil infrastructure by US companies. The chinese just signed a deal with Iran that includes 300 billion in oil infrastucture investment over the next 5 years, and they are just itching to sign more. \n \n The iranians want the sanctions lifted so they can buy spare parts for their aircraft (civilian). As the iranians have pointed out, with the new influx of wealth from the Chinese, they can order nice new planes....from airbus.\n \n I certainly understand that a certain amount of hate and fear mongering is required to mobilize the mildly retarded folks that make up George Bushs base (and Bushs base is NOT the same as the republican base as a whole). If he coudl learn to do it without screwing the entrie country, I think it would be a MAJOR step up. \n \n At least he was honest enough to mention foreign policy and economy as opposed to sticking with the singular \"national security\" threat.",

   "\n \n At least he was honest enough to mention foreign policy and economy as opposed to sticking with the singular \"national security\" threat.\n\n \n Considering the public interest span, I think Rove finally decided he was beating a dead horse with the national security and war on terror blather. Why would Al Qaeda waste resources on us as we're still doing a number on ourselves from an incident five-years ago and Iraq? Maybe if Bush loses his congressional majority in November, but otherwise why bother?",

   "I think it is fair to say that our descent into paper tigerdom is complete, and the American public has still not caught on. Bush has been jumping up for months and saying that we were going to bring all kinds of vile sanctions and possibly even militry action against Iran. Condi was saying not long ago that we had the Russians and the Chinese on board not only for economic sanctions, but for military action if needed. Now the Russians are selling the Iranians more and better weapons and the Chinese just signed a new oil deal with them. \n \n A little further around the world, the North Koreans have run their missile tests, despite the fact that \"Bush warned them\" not to. And now it looks like the Chinese, who Bush and Co swore were standing with us on that one, helped the N Koreans track their missiles.\n \n When are these folks, and Americans in general, going to figure out that WE are the ones that have become isolated from the international community, not the Koreans, not the Iranians. Apparently othe countries have decided that if their people wanted the US government to run them, they surely would have seen petitions to drive for statehood by now. \n \n The arrogance is mind boggling.",

Instead of \"Speak softly and carry a big stick\", it is now \"Speak loudly and be told to stick it\". We are up to our armpits in problems at home and the successful efforts to divert our attention is making the superpower look like a super clown.\n Dono",
