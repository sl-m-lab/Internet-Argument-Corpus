   "This sounds like a madman at the end of his limit talking. He is saying that he is going to track down all the internet file sharers (which is probably 2/3 people that have internet.) There are too many people to sue for this to work. Even with the first couple hundred, it will become too complex. \n There are two more reasonable things that they can do:\n \n 1. They should go to the source and try to stop the actual program makers. \n \n 2. They should work with the existing program makers and work out a deal where there is a fee for each song, so the companies can get their royalties. \n \n With either of these, there will still bo rogue programs where you can still get the files you want for free, but they will still be getting more money than before with #2.",

   "I agree with you completely Burnout. When I first heard about this, my first taught was that this is no more than a scare tactic and that it is not a solution to anything at all other than to drive more people away from buying anything from the record industry. Anything that the record industry does to try and stop Internet sharing will end up in failure simply because people will find a way around it.\n \n People are only downloading songs of the Internet because it is convenient. People would pay for this convenience at a reasonable cost if the record industry would provide a standard way of doing so. Launching an attack on consumers is not the way to end file sharing. Infact, it is completely insane to think they are even threatening this much less trying to carry it out.",

Had they simply bought out Napster and made it a pay service right away, perhaps they would have accomplished something. But right now they have nothing that can compete with the reliability, speed, and selection of the Bearshares and Kazaas of the P2P world.\n \n Note: Why did you create another thread for this issue when I already adressed it earlier in the General Forum?\n Although maybe it should be in a diffrent forum this just seems like waste...\n \n * Made this in a response to a current event",

   "i own a mac with a program called itunes. this is the 99 cents per song you speak of. it is 99 cents per song, but you can buy entire albums, with cd art, for $9.99 (or more, depending on the number of songs; example: 15 songs is probably $9.99 and any more would probably be a couple of dollars more). i have spent $15 already and i will tell you, this beats kazaa and bearshare, by far. i have braodband, but i can get a song in the new aac format (better than mp3) in about 5 seconds. i would usually have to wait 5 minutes in kazaa. i know, i know, what is 5 minutes? not much, but i like the fact that one, i am not stealing, two, i have fast downloads every time, and three, the song files always sound good.\n \n itunes is coming out for linux and windows soon, i hope to see more itunes subscribers.\n \n about this issue, this is childish of them. they punish people for doing what is NOT considered a crime in today's society. it is like suspending the entire senior class on skip day. it just doesn't work like that.\n \n p.s. you have a 30 sec preview of every song in itunes. you can listen to it before you buy (you can tell i am a little biased towards mac :) ).",
