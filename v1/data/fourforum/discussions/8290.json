   "BYU prof. let go for gay marriage stance\n \n THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \n PROVO, Utah -- Brigham Young University has decided not to rehire a part-time instructor because he publicly opposed the Mormon church's stand against marriage for same-sex couples.\n \n Jeffrey Nielsen, a philosophy instructor at the church-owned university, said in an op-ed piece for the June 4 edition of The Salt Lake Tribune, \"I believe opposing gay marriage and seeking a constitutional amendment against it is immoral.\"\n \n Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have spent millions of dollars campaigning against gay marriage and on May 28 called on members to support a constitutional amendment banning it.\n \n Nielsen, a Mormon, said he learned of the school's decision regarding his employment in a June 8 letter from Daniel Graham, chairman of the Department of Philosophy.\n \n \"Since you have chosen to contradict and oppose the church in an area of great concern to church leaders, and to do so in a public forum, we will not rehire you after the current term is over,\" the letter said.\n \n BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins confirmed that Graham decided not to rehire Nielsen because of the op-ed piece.\n \n Nielsen said he is sticking by his views - and his religion.\n \n \"I have no desire to be anything but a member of the church,\" he said Tuesday.\n \n http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Mormons_Gay_Marriage.html",

   "I've never understood why any gay man or woman would willingly go to a Christian/religious school or church. You know exactly how they feel about you WAY before you get there.

I will not attend any weddings, funerals, or any other function that is held in a church (of any denomination). I do not go where I am not wanted. I would never think of worshiping god, why bother since he thinks we're abominations while people that murder are simply sinners? God hates us more than people that murder and actually hurt others. It so irrational, that I have no pity on gay people that willingly subject themselves to religious abuse. You went there willingly knowing how they are and think. So stop complaining! Nobody likes a drama queen.\n \n There are plenty of places for us gay people to go that don't hate us and welcome us. Religion is absolutley the last place any gay person should turn to because that is exactly the source of the hate we face every day.

All I was really trying to say was that the professor had ample opportunity to understand the consequences of making such a view public. I am not judging the legality of the situation at all. My point was that the professor knew what could happen, and knowingly brought it upon himself. \n \n It's like if I were gay, and decided to join the Army. I know going in that they have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. I think it is a rediculous policy, but I am aware of it all the same. 1 year after joining, I walk into the CO's office, and tell him I'm gay. Now if I get kicked out, should I really be surprised or upset? After all, I was completely aware of the policy going in, yet chose to to ignore it. \n \n I simply solve situations such as this by doing 1 simple thing. If I don't agree with the policies, ethics, or code of an organization, I do not become involved in it.",
