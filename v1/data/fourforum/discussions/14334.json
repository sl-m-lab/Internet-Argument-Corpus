BP will pay a criminal fine of $50 million and serve a three-year period of probation.....\n \n The catastrophic explosion at the refinery occurred when hydrocarbon vapor and liquid released from a blowdown stack and reached an ignition source, believed to be a pickup truck with its engine running. The 15 contract employees killed at the BP Texas City refinery were located in temporary trailers approximately 150 feet from the blowdown stack. The deceased were Glenn Bolton, Lorena Cruz-Alexander, Rafael Herrera, Daniel Hogan, Jimmy Hunnings, Morris King, Larry Linsenbardt, Arthur Ramos, Ryan Rodriguez, James Rowe, Linda Rowe, Kimberly Smith, Susan Taylor, Larry Thomas and Eugene White. The explosion also caused the injuries of more than 170 other workers at the Texas City refinery.\n\n \n Very likely there are other felonies...",

You need to remember that a corporation involves many everyday working-class employees. We don't need to let outrage over-ride reason and jump to something that will ultimately hurt even more people who are vulnerable.\n Obama has been trying to avoid political fallout from this and come out looking clean, and now more Americans are just going to lose their jobs--and if BP goes bankrupt none of these fishing companies, restaurants, etc. will get their money.\n Obama was getting desperate because his approval ratings have plummeted and needed to do something to help himself politically, so he rushed into this.",

   "GOP congressman apologizes to BP for '$20 billion shakedown'\n By David Edwards\n Thursday, June 17th, 2010 -- 10:55 am\n .... Barton, who was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee when the Republicans held a majority in the House and is now its ranking member, is well known for his close ties to the energy industry. According to OpenSecrets.org, over the course of his career Barton's top industry donor has been the oil and gas industry, for a total of nearly $1.5 million in contributions.\n \n Barton has almost always stuck by his donors. A profile at Texans for Public Justice states, \"Barton stuck provisions in the 2003 energy bill to give the Dallas-Fort Worth region more time to flunk clean-air standards. The bill failed because of another Barton-championed provision to shield the petrochemical industry from liability for the carcinogenic gasoline additive MTBE. ... Westar Energy got Barton to insert special provisions into 2002 energy legislation to let Westar split off its regulated utility from its heavily indebted other businesses--a split that would facilitate saddling ratepayers with $1 billion Westar's non-utility debts.\"\n \n Barton was also an early global warming skeptic. In July 2005, the Washington Post's David Ignatius commented, \"I can't remember anything quite as nasty -- or as politically skewed -- as Rep. Joe Barton's recent attack on scientists whose views on global warming he doesn't like.\"\n\n GOP congressman apologizes to BP for &#8216;$20 billion shakedown&#8217; | Raw Story\n \n A bought and paid for congressman.\n \n Um, what do they call that?\n \n Oh yeah, political whore.",

   "Disagree. \n \n So far I have not seen anything to indicate that the fund is going to be used for anything but compensation for those whose livelihoods were impacted and clean up costs. If they changes I may change my opinion.\nBut they were already doing that...very well. I know you read some articles out there about unfilled claims and people upset but from interviews I've heard with those representing victims and are way anti-BP they concede the claims processing is both logical and fast. They also stated most of the complaints are from people who had a lot of off the books money which BP won't pay since they can't prove what they actually got in the previous year.\n \n \nWhat the government is having them do is SOP for smaller operators who are faced with environmental clean up costs that may threaten their survival (more on that in a minute). It is not a slush fund and it is not a shakedown. It is a straight up cash bond in an escrow account. Both parties have to sign off on any money going out of the fund. \nI get what it is trying to do but it is substituting you doing one thing for you doing the exact same thing with the only difference being Obama gets to claim he got tough on BP and forced them to set aside money for the victims. Sorry but you don't get credit for something they were doing anyway. \n \n \nIMO there is some debate on whether or not the clean up sums in question are enough the be considered \"threatening BPs survival\". The figure I keep seeing as an \"upper end guideline\" is about $40 billion, which is about 2 years profits to BP.\nThey aren't threatened. Exxon is still around aren't they? And I'm not sure on the legal details but just because you set aside 20b is escrow doesn't always mean the money is protected should a firm go bankrupt...I could easily be wrong on this but I seem to recall that from somewhere. Then again the most secure creditor is the federal government in a bankruptcy.",
