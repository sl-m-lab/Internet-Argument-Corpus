It's as if they are in denial, and hope that this relatively small blip in the gun fatality statistics will go away.\n \n Would anyone care to explain how more guns would help?\n\n \n \n \n I c/p a old post of mine below, that may give you some insight on your post here. I will not say it speaks for all, but I know a few that feel this way. I posted this, \n \n \n One can debate the gun , no gun issue, until the moon turns to sand and to me , it is quite a moot debate . I am a gun owner, I grew up way out in the country with guns behind every door in the old house I was raised in . I was taught gun safety the old fashion way and with the simplest of instruction regarding the handling of a firearm. That one line instruction was: DO NOT point the muzzle , loaded or not, at ANYTHING you do not want to DIE. One sentence of instruction, and it lasted me 42 years without a gun mishap yet. \n \n I hunted game from the time I was 9 , stop killing animals when I reached 30, and started shooting paper competively, and found that to be more fun. I dont shoot anymore, but have most of my guns still in the house, and I am very passionate about them and the privilege of getting to own them in my home country (USA) . ..\n \n At 52 years old now, I will say this about guns . IF FOR THE SAKE of not one more person ever being hurt or killed by a firearm , and IF ALL the guns in the whole WORLD could be tossed in to the ocean tommorrow, and NEVER again another one could be made, I would load all of my guns on that gun dumping boat today. But people, that scenario is NOT EVER going to happen in this world, SO in light of that, I prefer to remain armed in a society that has deemed money and self imposed power, more sacred than human life. all jmo\n \n \n On edit today: Take my reasoning above and instill it in every one that comes in contact with a gun. Then REMOVE all of the people in society that have within them the intent to harm people, the mentally imbalanced, those that were never taught proper gun safety and how to use them, THEN one would see guns all of sudden become just another collection of inanimate objects, capable of producing harm , only thru their misuse, NOT because of its very existence in society. This scenario cannot, and will not, ever come about, so I stand by my old post above. jmo",

   "I can understand the rationale behind wanting a gun, at the moment, I'm just looking for some sort of pro-gun input into this particular event.As I see it,a democratically significant section of society has deemed that there are dangerous elements out there that need to be contained, and guns are the solution.\n This young student has unlawfully taken the 'solution', killed the two people that the guns were intended to defend, taken the 'solution' to school, killed and wounded as many people as he wanted to, and then turned the 'solution' against himself. Now, like it or not, those guns did not serve their owner in the manner that [greg 79 f150  describes.Had the child in question been his,he would have handed the right to decide his life or death to a minor.\n \n What I can't understand is the logic of the comments attributed to the NRA's first vice president on this issue.The victims died, not because the school failed to protect them against criminals with guns, but because society failed to protect them against an angry child with easy access to lawfully-held firearms. For a firearm to be effective, it has to be ready to use.The idea of teachers carrying loaded firearms in the classroom would only increase opportunity for this kind of tragedy to happen again. Whilst armed police are a neccessary evil, events have shown that there is potential for even the most legitimate of firearms to be wrongly and wilfully used. \n \n I suspect that the story has been selectively reported to focus on the single option of putting more guns into the equation. I'm sure that some gun owners can see merit in other options for reducing the likelihood of this happening again, and want their lobby group to protect their rights by promoting workable solutions to the issues that the anti-gun lobby use to argue for the removal of firearms.\n The NRA,after all, promotes itself as an organisation concerned with gun safety.I would suspect that it takes a person of some intelligence and eloquence to speak effectively on such an emotive issue.This particular piece of journalism adds nothing to the debate.I'm hoping that someone can help me find the full and unabridged version of the NRA official line of the role of guns in homes being used illegaly by minors.",

An attribute in people that I have watched slowy erode, as the younger generations make a voice in our society. No, I am not the authoritative figurehead speaking for the NRA on guns used by minors. I dont think if Wayne Pierre himself called you , you would hear what you WANT to hear. And that is, \" We are gathering up ALL the guns in the world and destroying them tommorrow, so kids cannot get one \" . That idealology doesnt fit, because for one , it will NEVER happen, and two, if it did, only the criminal element would get them back again illegally. I dont care much for that scenario, \n \n \n Even with my simpleton explanation of guns in the home, you still do not get it. When will grown adult people ever get it that , young people need to monitored for their actions in this world, and notice that when their child has a problem, that it is THEIR responsibility to do something about it, and not the whole SOCIETY ? ...\n \n The gun could have laid in that Minn. childs home for ages, and never harmed anyone, UNTIL guess what ? as a disturbed unbalanced teen, he picked it up and killed with it. Were there NO signs of this childs mental problem coming to the notice of the parents or authorities ? Any warnings, YES, controlled ? NO, the rest is history. People young or old, will find a way to harm others, when they WANT to, because they can pick any thousands of ways to do so. Sadly the most convienient way is the gun, but read my original post on that one. STOPPING the reason WHY people want to harm is the clue, not what they choose to use as a weapon. jmo",

   "I think that both sides will likely remain fairly quiet on this one. In this particular case, thee is little or no doubt that an armed teacher int eh school could have stopped him early on. The antis are not going to say anything because they alreadys know what the pro gunners response will be. Most likely something along the lines of \"You wanted gun free school zones, background checks, age restrictions, the works, and we gave it to you. When are you XXXXXX going to figure out that you cannot legislate problems like this away.\"\n \n The kid broke laws by the dozens. Maybe it is time for people to take a long, hard look at the definition of the word \"criminal\" before we pass more expensive to enforce laws that attempt to control a criminals behavior. \n \n All in all, I think the gun control debate is about over. The pedulum is swinging the other way. Common sense has finally started to win out against the lies and fear mongering of the anti gunners. The gun issue cost gore the election, cost the democrats congress and cost kerry ohio, and thus the election. The assault weapon ban is dead, concealed carry is allowed in the vast majority of the united states, and nobody is jumping up and down at this latest school shooting and calling for more gun bans. Instead, they are taking the common sense approach and saying \"maybe laws that require that everybody inside the school be defenseless are not the best plan\".",

   "Now I'm really confused.\n \n I'm sitting here trying to figure out how I'd resolve this issue, looking for a few rational poins of view on a seemingly respectable debating site, and it is interpreted as demanding more legislation.Ten people died because of inadeqacies in the system.Now if you think that putting more guns into the system will solve the problem, feel free to make a case, but I'd like the courtesy of a hearing without you getting in my face simply because I haven't decided to agree unconditionally with you.\n \n Daewoo... you suggest that \"there is little or no doubt that an armed teacher in the school could have stopped him early on\". There is doubt, and plenty of it,that an armed teacher would have.Simply having a weapon of equal firepower does not automatically mean that you will win a firefight because you are the good guy, and he is the bad guy.This is real life, not Hollywood.\n \n The police officer who left these guns available to misuse was trusted to carry a gun for the sake of public safety.Because he failed to secure his weapons, ten people died.While arming every teacher in the country might prevent some violence, it's just as possible that one of those very guns could be used to duplicate this tragedy.Daewoo also fails to recognise that if the offender intends shooting himself as the finale to his spree, the fact that someone might kill him before he gets the chance to do it himself is unlikely to deter him. \n \n Daewoo thinks that those of us who want gun free schools are ,quote, XXXXXX. Thanks for that,Daewoo, I will bear it in mind.FYI, my kids go to a gun-free school, as does every other kid in my country.I wouldn't have it any other way, because in this part of the world,schoolkids have never committed mass murder.If that makes me an idiot in your eyes, all I can say is, you need an eye test.\n I'm trying to figure out why this kind of mass killing happens regularly in the States, but not in my part of the world.Granted, there are not so many guns in circulation here, but even so, the number of incidents vs the number of guns is also much lower.\n \n Greg also chose to have a go at me for daring to be different to him.\n \n \"Some people never get the crux of a thought, for trying to see the \"logic\" of the issue and not factoring in the basic common sense.

   "If all you want is a link, type NRA in your browser, there is a link on Yahoo at this minute about NRA and school shootings. I am not sure what you are searching for will ever have a answer. There is no \"solution\" to gun violence, especially in schools. The implementation of metal detectors and security officers being in the school full time , has helped in our state. ... \n \n If a school student has the rage within them to make a \"point\" by killing their teachers or fellow students, they will do it, somehow. Yes, with all gun owners keeping their guns in a safe will deter that action, but will not stop it. If someone wants a gun bad enough , they will be able to get one, mostly by illegal means. Violence , with guns or butter knives, is a sad element in our society, one not understandable by any means....\n \n In the 60's , if we school kids got depressed , our fathers would have us put up hay or set fence posts. After a day of that, we were not depressed anymore for a while. If we got mad at our teachers, that was tough, there was nothing we could do about it, they were our parents for that day of class, and if we even mentioned harming a teacher, our parents would discipline us.

Even places where kids pass through metal detectors manned by armed guards, people still get caught with weapons in schools. \n \n \nDaewoo... you suggest that \"there is little or no doubt that an armed teacher in the school could have stopped him early on\". There is doubt, and plenty of it,that an armed teacher would have.Simply having a weapon of equal firepower does not automatically mean that you will win a firefight because you are the good guy, and he is the bad guy.This is real life, not Hollywood.\n\n \n By all accounts, this guy just kind of wandered around shooting people. Several time he stopped to smile and wave at friends. It is difficult to imagine any trained person with a decent pistol being unable to take down this teenage kid. How much training do you think this kid had in building clearing techniques? Unless high school has changed pretty drastically since I was there, the answer is probably between zero and none. With an armed teacher, or even if the security guard had been armed, the odds of being able to stop a 16 ur old kid with a shotgun are pretty darn good. The odds of an unarmed teacher or security guard being able to stop that same kid are negligeble.\n \n \nThe police officer who left these guns available to misuse was trusted to carry a gun for the sake of public safety.Because he failed to secure his weapons, ten people died.While arming every teacher in the country might prevent some violence, it's just as possible that one of those very guns could be used to duplicate this tragedy.Daewoo also fails to recognise that if the offender intends shooting himself as the finale to his spree, the fact that someone might kill him before he gets the chance to do it himself is unlikely to deter him. \n \n \n Deterrance is something that needed to take place years before. When he is walking down the hall of the local high school blowing people away, you STOP him. It is too late for deterrance. The idea is to shoot him after his first or second or third victim, not to stand off and wait for him to shoot himself after the sixth man drops. \n \n Is it possible that a teachers gun could be used for such a tragedy? Of course. It is also possible that a police officers gun could be used. IT is possible tyhat na abrams tank could be used, or a nuclear missile. So, you want to gaurantee that everybody in a school is defenseless, so when something like this DOES happen, the killer gets to kill as many as they feel like, rather than providing a proactive defensive capability? \n \n \nDaewoo thinks that those of us who want gun free schools are ,quote, XXXXXX. Thanks for that,Daewoo, I will bear it in mind.FYI, my kids go to a gun-free school, as does every other kid in my country.I wouldn't have it any other way, because in this part of the world,schoolkids have never committed mass murder.If that makes me an idiot in your eyes, all I can say is, you need an eye test.\n\n \n Yet. Give it some time. These type of things tend to start in the US then spread. I am sure that in the next 10 years or so, you will have your very own school shooting to lament about. Until 1999 we had never had anything like this, either.\n \n \nI'm trying to figure out why this kind of mass killing happens regularly in the States, but not in my part of the world.Granted, there are not so many guns in circulation here, but even so, the number of incidents vs the number of guns is also much lower.\n\n \n I am guessing you are in new zealand?\n \n I will agree that these incidents certainly seem to start in the US, but they do seem to spread, though not on so great a scale (thats the good news....when it finally gets around to you, it might just be a 16 yr old with a sword who will only kill 4 people). You are correct as far as the number of incidents vs. number of guns. That has been the bane of the american anti gunners for years now. They point at other countries and say \"they don't have this problem\", which looks very reasonable until you point out that when you look at incidents vs. number of guns, we actually trail most of the world.\n \n I am afraid I am going to have to cop out on this one and just say \"sociological differences so vast that they would require pages and pages just to touch on\".\n \n I have been to New Zeland once, and one thing that I noted was that no matter where you are, there does not seem to really be a \"bad\" part of town. I never saw anywhere I would feel uncomfortable walking through after dark. There are precious few US cities that do not have a \"bad side\" anymore, and wandering through a strange town at night is a fools game here.\n \n Sorry if I kind of jumped your case there. I should have paid a little better attention to your handle and realised you were not here in the US. Gun owners in the US are almost constant assault by the anti gunners, with their ill concieved, moronic, expensive plans to end gun violence. So, we pass foolish and expensive laws in order to placate them, study the effects of the laws for several years, and when we find waht any thinking person would recognise to begin with, that their great new law does not affest crime, it is simply an expensive pain int he butt to law abiding citizens, we still don't get to be rid of the rediculous and expensive pain in the butt. I, for one, am tired of the whole thing.",
