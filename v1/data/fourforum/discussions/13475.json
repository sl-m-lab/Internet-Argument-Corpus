That's right - twenty two senators from eleven states voted nay! That's what I'm talking about, XXXX yeah! This is the real America that we were all talking about in 2008.\n \n In honor of this fact, I've modified the Our Legislators page to highlight the Senators from these great American states.\n\n Republicans for Rape - Blog - The REALAmerica\n \n The eleven states:\n \n Alabama\n Arizona\n Georgia\n Idaho\n Kansas\n Kentucky\n Mississippi\n Oklahoma\n South Carolina\n Tennessee\n Wyoming\n \n I think I'd call these states the UnAmerican states.",

While you are bashing the right, you might want to look into the numerous false rapes being prosecuted by far laft DA's. Start with ADA Kellert in Maine.
