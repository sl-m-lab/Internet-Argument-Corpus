   "Don't you think Chechen refugees in Europe are asking too much? I wonder how they dare sound their demands after they were allowed in and even given new homes! And they start protesting as they believe the housing they have been provided with freeby doesn't suite their sorrowful status of refugees. In Matrei, (Tirol, Austria) Chechen refugee families were granted with apartments of 17 square meters per family. Of course it's not very roomy, but how could they expect more? I think they should be grateful they have at least this and they don't need to stay in the open. However, five Chechen families said they would go on hunger strike unless the authorities start to respect their human rights. I think it was absolutely right of the authorities to find the demands of the Chechens absurd and out of place and reject them. Those Chechens and Georgians simply went out of hand, I guess. They will soon start settling in our homes and still feel dissatisfied. I think that will do it! OUT! Kick them out back to Poland, Czechia and Slovakia from where they came from!!",
