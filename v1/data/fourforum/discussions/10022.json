Nice try but America does not embrace hockey like Canada does. This is where the NHL should do some tweaking.\n\n \n Actually, I thought it was some of the best playoff hockey I've seen in years. Fast paced, offensive minded, rough and tumble, and overall, the officiating was pretty good. There are ALWAYS a few bad calls, but one bad call does not a series decide. \n \n A series doesn't have to go seven games to be a good series. There was some good hockey played in those 5 or 6 game series that could have gone either way at any time. There was also some teams that were simply outmatched.\n \n I'm no Bettman fan, but you're laying it at his feet is completely misguided. The NHL, NHLPA, and the fans have all acted to revise the game, and it sorely needed it.\n \n As to no hard nosed hockey - you saw Anaheim win because they played hard nosed hockey. Hard nosed doesn't have to mean dirty.\n \n In 10 short years the number of Europeans available, from quality hockey programs every bit as good as our junior hockey system, has stepped up to fill that void. You may not like it, but the fact is that hockey, and the NHL, more than any other popular North American sport (with the possible exception of baseball) has now become a global sport. I would agree that 10years ago immediately after the expansion there was far too many lunch pail players in the league, but talent levels have risen significantly. If the NHL sticks to its guns with the current enforcement of the rules, it will lead to the elimination of the lunch pail guys and the continued increase in skilled players.\n \n I love the no red line, IMHO, the redline was a ridiculous rule to begin with. Nothing has done more to increase the speed and flow of the game than the removal of the redline.\n \n The shootout are great for the fans. I love them. I think the majority of players have come to embrace them as well. I'm not sure on the rewarding of a point, but compared to the old system where everyone would simply play for the tie, it provides motivation to win the game in OT. Perhaps using the teams shootout record as a tie breaker would be a better system than awarding a point?\n \n The rule changes are making hockey a better game, even Don Cherry will tell you that.\n \n I agree that some of the US markets are dogs. I think with time they'll be weeded out, but the fact remains that NHL franchises, especially the Canadian ones, are essentially uneconomic. The biggest problem is the lack of TV revenue. The current NHL deal is a joke, but it's hard to hammer out a favourable deal when reruns of poker kill the Stanley Cup finals in the ratings.\n \n I tihnk the league needs to push Fantasy Hockey, and that is where Bettman is truly holding the league back with his opposition to it. IMHO, the booming \"gambling\" side of the NFL is where the true drive comes from. Just watch an NFL telecast these days and note the dedication they put in to the stats and fantasy numbers, they aren't shy about it, they fully endorse it. There's no reason the NHL can't do the same.\n \n Waxy",
