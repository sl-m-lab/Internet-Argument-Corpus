   "*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK AT STOMACH :*NOTE*\n \n Just read...\n \n Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, \"Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me.\" Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, \"Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels.\" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful. \n \n Love,\n Your Baby Girl\n \n \n http://wajclan.topcities.com/abortion/abortion.html",

   "There are many states that have fetal homicide laws on the books. Check this out:\n \n http://womensissues.about.com/cs/parentingfamily/a/aafetalhomicide.htm\n \n \n You keep saying \"the life of the mother\". In cases in which the mother would clearly die, I don't think that many would argue against the mother's choice. But, the choice we're discussing is the mother's convenience vs the fetus' life. BIG difference.\n\n \n Sorry, computer on the fritz, been out for a while. Not sure what it is, possibly a defective hard drive. Keep getting BSOD with a IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. Very interesting.\n \n Anyway, back to the discussion. I'm glad you admited that abortion can be justified in some cases, in this case, when the life of the mother is at risk. I mention it for a few reasons, one of which that the ban on late term abortion (D&X procedure or \"partial birth abortion\" as pro-lifers call it) did not contain an exception for the life of the mother. Regardless on my opinion on the subject, I think this was a gross oversight, as I think you'll agree. Regardless of how rare it is, we should allow doctors to do their jobs and save their patients.\n \n \nPro-choice people use the \"life of the mother\" argument since everyone has sympathies in that situation, and those sympathies get used to convince people to be pro-choice when the reality is that in only a tiny percentage of abortions is the mother's life at stake. It is a distortion to talk about abortion in general in these terms. It hoodwinks people.\n\n \n Galton, you acuse me of emotional blackmail when it is you and JP which say that I, and thus by extention all those who are pro-choice, want to \"kill babies\". The life and health of the mother is a real problem in some cases, while the term \"fetus\" is the appropriate medical term, and \"baby\" is only used to evoke emotional response.\n \n That article is interesting, jp. I like \nSome of these laws do not contain exceptions for the woman or her doctor, which could possibly allow criminal proceedings for measures taken as a course of treatment (radiation treatment for cancer or antibiotics) or for abortion.\n\n \n This seems very irresponsible to me. The woman cannot have a necessary medical procedure because being pregnant makes it illegal. To me, the woman should at least have the choice between having the child and saving her own life. With these laws, there is no choice (This is the essence of what being pro-choice is, having choices)\n \n \nFetal homicide laws have been described as supporting and protecting women who decide to carry their babies to term. Those supporting these acts, most often pro-life advocates, say that both the lives of the pregnant woman and the fetus should be explicitly protected. They declare that fetal homicide laws justly criminalize cases and provide the opportunity to protect unborn children and their mothers. Some pro-lifers hope fetal homicide laws will establish a precedent that fetuses are human beings, thereby fueling efforts to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.\n\n \n I have no problem with this, really, since it protects those who decide to carry their babies to term. My only problem is that pro-lifers will want to extend this to prosecute doctors who perform a desired medical procedure.\n \n \nThose against these laws are also concerned as to whether they could be interpreted to apply to a woman's behavior during her pregnancy, such as smoking, drinking or using illegal drugs. Instead, they prefer to criminalize an assault on a pregnant woman and recognize her as the only victim. \n\n \n This also concerns me. I am against smoking, but I don't mind what others do in their own home generally. Illegal drugs are obviously illegal whether or not you're pregnant :P This is a hard subject, and I'll have to think about it before I can give an informed opinion.\n \n I like the \"food for thought\" at the end.\n \nIf a woman can choose to have a late-term abortion, should the father have the same right to kill the baby before it is born? \n \n If a woman is scheduled to get an abortion, but the baby is killed in-utero by an outside person the day before that abortion, should that person be charged with murder?\n\n \n Both points are really laughable. The first, ignoring the emotionaly blackmail in calling it a \"baby\", the father doesn't have *any* rights in this sense. He cannot decide whether to have an abortion or not at any time during the pregnancy, and I see no reason to change that.\n \n The second, shouldn't that be the woman's choice whether or not to charge the ouside person? It also doesn't clarify if that outside person intended to cause a miscarriage. If I trip and accidently knock down a pregnant woman and cause a miscarriage, should I be charged with murder? If I had accidently killed an adult, the most I would get is an involuntary manslaughter charge, since murder includes intent (as I understand it).\n \n I won't be on for a while probably, while I try and fix my computer, or more likely buy a new hard drive :P",

The two combined is a special event that creates a new life. \n \n \n\n As for sugar coating, you are no different from any other religous extremist, wanting to enforce your view of the world on people who want to think for themselves rather than follow others blindly. \n \n\n \n I think it's a common trend for pro-fetal homiciders to call everyone who is against killing religious fanatics. I feel that the sad thing is that so many pro-fetal homiciders say they are for womens rights. I just haven't heard them say they are against the rights of the weakest members of society for some reason.\n \n As for the women's rights, sure, equality is awesome, something worth fighting for, but when you use the name of something noble and right to justify the killing of innocent humans beings, that is just wrong.",

The 'natural' consequence in my example is for the woman to be burned, but she does not have to endure that consequence, even if some people might wish them to. Such as yourself.\n \n \n\n To place responsibility (the way I described it in my post) you would take your examples to their logical completion: The ambulance workers treat her (it is their job), send her a bill and the Insurance company refuses to cover the cost making it her responsibility to cover it. Or, the home owner left their keys in the lock - the police work to find the burglar (it is their job) but the insurance company refuses to replace the lost items due to negligence - the responsibility is on the owner.\n\n \n Thank you for making my point for me :D Yes, there are consequences for every action. However, what consequence these people wish to go through is a personal decision. If the woman does not wish to pay for the care, she may indeed stay burned. If the person does not wish to involve the police, he or she does not have to call them. The people involved choose what consequence they wish to endure, not you.\n \n Now, bringing that back to abortion, if a woman falls pregnant she can indeed carry the entity she carries to completion and bear it. If she chooses, she can also have an abortion. Both of these choices are consequences. Abortion is a consequence, and women may choose this consequence instead of remaining pregnant.\n \n \n\n ummm...at least you used a lower case 'r'. You have NO RIGHTS in a criminal case in which you are found liable or negligent...you go to prison.\n\n \n ...\n Sex is not a crime. You may wish it to be, but it is not. The gov't should not violate a woman's rights.\n \n \"Do the crime, do the time\" is a horrible way of looking at motherhood. It should always be a choice.\n \n \n\n Comparatively, it is no longer \"just your body\" if a woman gets pregnant, and therfore a DIFFERENT set of governing 'rights' is involved.\n\n \n It is always the woman's body. Nothing changes that. The gov't does not have a deed to it to hand over to another, not even the fetus. The fetus should never have the right to use her body over her right to her own body. If the gov't enforces the fetus' right to use her body, then it is violating her right.\n \n \n\n You chose to commit an act that could possibly change the status of your body, guess what - it worked..there are now two people you are responsible for.\n\n \n Disease can also \"change the status of your body\". That hardly matters whether or not you chose to engage in the act for this. You can change it anyway. Remember my examples? Whether or not you chose to do that does not change whether or not you can choose a different consequence, if you can.\n \n Besides, consenting to sex is consenting to sex. It is not consenting to anything else.\n \n \n\n Your 'rights' are not reduced at all...your responsibilities are dramatically increased.\n\n \n Why did you put 'rights' in quotes? You do not believe in individual rights?\n \n Our society believes in individual rights as paramount. It is a fascist gov't that puts the interests of the State as superior to individual rights. The State does not exist to make us moral. \n \n \n\n Pregnancy isn't a punishment, it is a natural result of a process of events that the woman chose to initiate, it is also a result of events that may not be of her chosing (rape, incest, etc...) but that is a slightly different topic - and my previous post allows that this is only relevant to CHOICES that we make.\n\n \n Oh boo hoo. \"It's natural so it has to be good!\" I see that **** a million times spewed by pro-lifers.\n \n Disease is also natural, and is also a possible consequence to sex. That does not mean we must \"deal with it\".\n \n \n\n It is a utopian fantasy that a child and a pregnancy should always be wanted.\n\n \n Well excuse me. I prefer to work towards a world where children are wanted. Making abortion illegal will certainly not do that. Forcing women to have children against their will and without their consent will certainly not do that. I don't particularly like abortion, but I know that it is immoral, demeaning and disrespectful to believe I should choose for women whether or not they should carry a pregnancy.\n \n \n\n The woman had the CHOICE to not have sex - if that particular need is that great, there are a multitude of alternatives that are GUARANTEED to not result in pregnancy.\n\n \n You know what, I agree. Women and men should not have sex irresponsibly. Guess what? They do anyway. And women should never be forced into carrying a pregnancy and birthing a child. \n \n \n\n Further mine is not a Pro-Life position - mine is a realist.\n\n \n lol. You remind me of creationists who try and dress up their old beliefs in new language to make it more acceptable. \n \n Your arguments are typical of pro-lifers.

Your example is idiotic.\n \n \n\n If pro-choicers who resorted to this sort of rhetoric only had a sense of how unbelievably self-centered it sounds.\n\n \n Truly told, asking to be able to choose what we do with our own lives is self centered. What does it matter? The gov't does not exist to make us \"better people\" (according to whom?), it is up to ourselves to be moral and to be generous, kind and wonderful people. That some people do not live up to your standards does not justify making laws to make them live up to your standards. \n \n \n\n It's not that the pro-choice stance is necessarily a bad one on paper.\n\n \n er, ok emoticon_confused\n \n \n\n It's just that some of it's supporters use the pro-choice mentality as a way to justify their selfishness and desire to thumb their noses at others.\n\n \n If you say so.\n \n \n\n All people are asking for is a sense of respect and acceptance of how precious life is, espcially a life that can grow into a child, a teenager, an adult, and live a full life.\n\n \n And yet you pro-lifers have little or no respect for the adult that is already here! Respect is allowing her to make her own decisions regarding her own body. Respect is not forcing her to follow your morals, but allow her to follow her own. \n \n You respect nothing but your own ego. Your arrogance in assuming that you know what is best for a pregnant woman is demeaning and exteremly disrespectful.\n \n \n\n I don't understand why the pro-choice movement can't take their stance in way that is not so disrespectful of life and sound so hateful. There has to be a better way.\n\n \n There is no disrespect to life. It is hateful on both sides, I agree.\n \n \n\n There is no doubt that the pro-choice movement would have a lot less opposition today and would have gotten a lot farther if they would only stop acting so self-centered in their rhetoric, such as the way you have responded here. I really think it is possible to argue the pro-choice position in a respectful and kind way, even in a way that respects life. Unfortunately, your posts don't do that at all, and are the sort that probably hurts the pro-choice movement as much as anything, because it just turns more people against you. \n\n \n Blah blah blah. Truly told, I don't care much what you think. I could be nicer about it, but I don't have the patience for ... people... such as yourself. There, I was nice :)\n \n \n\n I can't help but feel sorry for you, not because you are pro-choice, but because of the way you argue from the standpoint of what appears to be total disregard for the life of an unborn child.\n\n \n I do not disregard the life of the \"unborn\"(this term always amuses me... makes me think of \"undead corpse\" to refer to people who are alive). I do not believe that life is more important than the life, dream and goals of the woman. I do not believe that that life is more important than a woman's rights.\n \n \n\n There has to be a better way for pro-choicers than this.\n\n \n If you would take your blinders off, then it would be perfect.",

   "\"You don't think that killing a life that would grow up just for the comfort of a woman is selfish? It's one of the most selfish acts I can think of!\"\n\n \n Not at all because you haven't proven how the woman's abortion - for whatever reason - has interfered with the fetus's own demands. Do yourself a favor and drop this unsightly argument. It has nothing to do with pro-life ideology and nor do real pro-lifers use it. Did a fetus gain the right to life because it is a human being or because the woman has some sort of responsibility towards its fictional demands posed by pro-lifers?\n \n \n \n\"In what way do most pro-lifers view the life of the fetus precious \"conditionally?\" I don't think you can back that one up.\" \n\n \n I don't think you are informed. \n Let's start talking about pregnancies due to rape or incest. \n Let's start talking about the woman's physical/psychological health during pregnancy.\n Let's start talking about stem cell research.\n Let's start talking about the legal use of IUD devices.\n Now the majority of those aligned in the pro-life movement would have already approved of one or more of these situations that destroy \"unborn babies\" while only about less then 5% would have actually condemned the use of all of the above. According to pro-life ideology only this 5% is technically pro-life and thus most pro-lifers believe that the fetus's right to life is conditional...not ever absolute. \n \n \n \n \n\"Most people, by far (including pro-lifers) are not out to take your right to abortion away for ANY reason as you claim.\"\n\n \n Then you are confused. A good portion of support for the pro-life movement here in America is foreign born. \n \n \n \n\"And what you call terrorism is a drop in the bucket compared the very act of abortion itself which has killed millions of babies by now--terrorism at its worst.\"\n\n \n And you condemn me for using over the top messages? Abortion isn't terrorism but pro-life ideology sanctions the use of terrorism. \n \n \n \n\"And I would think that the last election, about values, would be a wake up call for your movement.\"\n\n \n The American people voted for a president who promised to keep Roe v Wade the status quo and despite his promise to keep this practice legal he still received millions upon millions in campaign contributions from major pro-life organizations like the NRTL. \n I think it would be very advantageous for you pro-lifers to reevaluate your position before getting into bed with every politician who easily seduces you with their token gestures. \n \n \n \n\"You aren't winning anymore--soon enough the vicious and horrible practice of partial-birth abortion will be outlawed.\"\n\n \n And will only be replaced with another method of abortion. Did you seriously think Bush outlawed late-term abortions? Hardly...only a procedure because pro-life backed politicians for twenty years felt they knew medicine better then doctors. \n \n \n \n\"Again, the main problem with your message is simply the pro-choice attitude, which seems to often be about spite and hate toward others, and callous disregard for unborn babies.\"\n\n \n Hardly, the pro-life movement is the most hateful out of the two factions because it's own historical roots are soaked in racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry. It is only pro-life logic that has lead the deaths of many innocent people and it is pro-life ignorance that has disregarded the lives of unborn babies. Abortion wasn't even an issue with your kind until the 1960s and it wasn't because \"unborn babies\" were dying but because the demand of legal abortion had grown due to your incompetence. \n There has to be a better way than that. The pro-life movement is dying due to a lack of vision, reality, coordination and appeal.",

Apparently also impervious to fully thought out concepts... but hey - ignorance is bliss, and really conducive to self-centered emotional foundation of a persons self-esteem and world view apparently.\n \n \n \nOriginally posted by jakeCJB\n ...\n The fetus simply hasn't reached that point yet, so it has not achieved personhood. It only has potential, like an zygote, or like a sperm or egg. Is the morning after pill a killer's weapon? I don't think so. Are the two-thirds of all human conceptions that the body itself spontaneously aborts, \"deaths\" like the death of a person? Perhaps involuntary manslaughter? No on both counts. Is a sperm that doesn't make it to fertilize the egg, for whatever reason, death or deliberate killing, because the potential for becoming a person is there? No. No one has the right to use a part of my body against my will, because of what is merely a potential.\n \n \n \n Sperm and Egg carry only half the genetic code of a given indivitual and do not have, in isolation, the ability to create life.\n \n Zygote :[n] the cell resulting from the union of an ovum and a spermatozoon\n \n The demands of a zygote are simple, merely an environment friendly to it's continued existance until implatation (thus a test tube works nicely for fertilization clinics) and further development. Given an environment conducive to its existance, but not to implantation and further growth, it eventually becomes defunct and is reabsorbed or flushed from the body.\n \n Fetus :[n] an unborn or unhatched vertebrate in the later stages of development showing the main recognizable features of the mature animal\n \n The demands of the fetus are dramatically different. It needs not only the environment, but sustenance from the host. Thus once established the fetus does have, innate, demands.\n \n One might argue they are no different than the demands of an intestinal fluke, or heart worm, or any of a myriad of other parasites that require sustenance from a host. One would also have to argue then that the fetus is not a mere parasite. In the case of a true parasite, it merely continues its existance. A fetus on the other hand, evolves into a more advance vertabrate and eventually become a self-suporting being with self-awareness - provided its demands are met.\n \n Technically then, \"the morning after pill\" is a grey area at best, if taken in time it merely prevents a Zygote from moving to the next stage. There is then a stage open for debate (that I would place in the Zygote end of the spectrum) where a Zygote has implanted and is becoming a fetus - still a vaible period of time for \"the pill\" in my book. If taken later, it causes the body to abort a fetus. Can we determine at what point the pill was taken? No. Therefore, IMO, the pill is no different than pennyroyal, or shepard's purse, both emmenogouges that - in proper doses - instigate shedding of the uterine lining. My issue is with the point at which these are taken. At one point you are disposing of a Zygote - a amalgamation of cells that - while they have potential - cannot become a human without implatation (causing additional hormaones to be produced) and further growth to become a fetus. Taken later you are intentionally aborting a fetus that has considerably more potential provided its demands for sustenance are met.\n \n We know, scientifically, at what point a zygote becomes a fetus. This is relatively early in the development process and a considerably short period of time after implantation. So - once the entity has reached fetal status, IMO, you have abrogated the choice of preventing it.\n \n Soooo... back to my original statement: If you choose to have sex, you choose to endure the consequences. Not withstanding Sigma's childlike and emotional understanding of the point, responsibility falls to the mother to NOT abort at the time the fetus exists. There exists a window of likely up to a week after intercourse where many methods may be implemented to ensure a fetus is not allowed. If you have sex, protected or otherwise, you enjoin the responsiblity to have RESPONSIBLE sex. If, for you, that means doing everything possible to prevent pregnancy - do so. But should you become pregnant (viable fetus) you are also responsible for living with that consequence. To do other wise is selfish :) (I looked up the definition...at the point the cells become a fetus it has demands, selfishness is placing those demands - however feeble - above your own.)",

What rationale are you utilizing? \n \n Were you not aware that there is a stage between implantation and the 'fetus' stage? Why is implantation your point of no return? Were you not aware that about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in natural abortion anyway? If certainty is what you require, you won't find it.\n \n \n \n If you have sex, protected or otherwise, you enjoin the responsiblity to have RESPONSIBLE sex.\n\n \n I believe the form you are looking for there is \"are enjoined the responsibility\".

   " \"You know good and well there are plenty of women out there who would do that.\"\n\n \n Christ, you people are lost. I have spent seven years doing research in abortion on both sides and I have never read a single account of a single woman having an abortion because her belly would get big. You need a reality dose instead of feeding yourself with these fictional scenarios. No woman has an abortion out of fear of her belly size. Has it ever occurred to you that women take their pregnancies seriously and see them as a life altering events? I think so and I am a male. \n \n \n \n \"It is abortion for convenience and comfort that pro-lifers find most unethical.\" \n\n \n Actual pro-lifers find all abortions unethical. If you are conditionally pro-life then you have no business calling yourself such or speaking on behalf of those who are pro-life. \n \n \n \n\"People have risked their lives for a lot of things in history that turned out to be bad causes.\" \n\n \n This isn't about \"bad causes\" but whether abortion is a frivolous right. It isn't. Abortion rights are nearly viewed as a human right in the world because of how important they are. \n \n \n \n \"But when woman are wanting to have abortions because they just don't want the discomfort of a pregnancy or as an easy way out of having to raise a son or daughter that they don't want...\"\n\n \n So how many abortions did you have in order to come to the conclusion that it is an easy way out? It isn't an easy way out. It isn't easy being faced with an unwanted pregnancy and faced with the decision between childbirth or abortion. It isn't easy finding someone who performs abortions. It isn't easy finding a place that can perform them. It isn't easy finding the money to pay for it. It isn't easy taking yourself to the clinic when an angry shouting crowd of pro-lifers screaming and threatening you guards the doors. It isn't easy living with an abortion when you know a good portion of Americans do not support your access. It isn't easy living in fear questioning whether your family, friends, community and etc. will accept you. Abortion is never an easy way out. In fact it is one of the most difficult choices to make during a pregnancy. \n \n \n \n \"...(that many people would love to raise and show love to)...\" \n\n \n That isn't the woman's responsibility or problem. Her pregnancy isn't a raw material to be exploited for the sake of childless couples. If pro-lifers really felt these childless couples or individual's circumstances were critical they would be producing children for them instead of exploiting their unfortunate situation for their agenda. \n \n \n \n \"Regardless of whether or not you have the law on yor side, you don't have the moral high ground on your side, and you never have.\"\n\n \n Pro-lifers do not have the legality, morality or reality on their side. You people do nothing and are incompetent. For little more then 70 years your side had a chance to prove how effective laws against abortion were here in America but instead you choose to do nothing except sit on your hands. And for 70 years people continued to have abortions. By the 1920s it was America's \"open secret\" and statistics show that nearly one in four American women were having abortions. By 1930 it was demanded due to the Great Depression and more women suffered from blotched back alley abortions then any other decade before. By 1940 it was practically legalized for the upper and middle class and twenty years latter did the pro-life movement really rally. But against what? Certainly not over the poor aborted \"unborn babies\" because there movement was nowhere to be found in the 1920's \"open secret\". Certainly not because women were being hurt by the very criminalized abortion laws they supported...they were nowhere to be found by the 1930s. There wasn't even a National Right to Life Committee until after 1965! So what were you guys protesting? Legal abortion. Not the legal abortion that was provided to those in the middle and upper class through \"therapeutic abortions\" in the 1940s and beyond but instead legal abortion that was available to the masses. \n Reality doesn't support your position because not a single law against abortion has ever proven to be successful. Instead what happens it that abortions go underground, women travel to countries where it is legal, women start to die, the legal system becomes more totalitarian and the pro-life movement is completely AWOL. \n Laws do not support you because the American legal system has never said abortion was murder.\n Morality doesn't support you because your entire argument is either based on a religion that worships a child killing God or you are too busy personifying what a fetus wants based on your own demands instead of the fetus's. \n And you think appear hateful? The pro-life movement is too busy attacking itself to make a collective effort. You have social republicans condemning pro-life homosexuals to hell and refusing to cooperate with them. You have extremists condemning the moderates and moderates condemning the extremists. You have major pro-life organizations like the American Life League and the National Right to Life Committee that call one another \"pro-abortion.\" Your side cries how abortion is the \"holocaust\" but you are too busy attacking each other to do anything about it. \n It is only the pro-choice position that has offered a realistic and moral solution. It is only those who fought for abortion rights that changed things for the better. \n \n \n \n \"Anytime you want to right to kill for the sake of comfort, that is going to be the case.\" \n\n \n But that isn't the case...as much as you try to pretend that it is.",

The point is that there is no definition of \"conditionally pro-life\" any more than there is a definition of \"conditionally pro-choice.\" Pro-life people vary in their stances just like pro-choice and no one is getting kicked out of the movement for it as you seem to think they would. For that matter, there is no more room for diversity of opinion in the pro-choice movement than there is the pro-life one. \n \n \n\"\"I am not looking for sympathy from the pro-life movement. To do so would be looking in the wrong direction.\"\n \n pro-lifers proliferate the social stigma of abortion and hence increasing such a risk.\"\n \n \"Pro-lifers only care about what they can exploit from post-abortive women.\"\n \n \"pro-lifers demand that women who are planning to have abortions need to have more information that will scare them from having an abortion.\"\n \n - Pro-lifers don't want you to know about childbirth linked breast cancer is far more lethal.\n \n - Pro-lifers don't want you to know that childbirth is that far psychology trauma are more common then trauma linked to abortion.\n \n - Pro-lifers don't want you to know that childbirth is far more lethal then abortion. \n \n - Pro-lifers don't want you to know anything about psychological trauma to adoption.\n \n \"pro-lifers never cared about women or even about empowering them. \n\n \n These anti-pro-life statements are downright comical, they are so inaccurate and biased. Your tendency to portray your movement as angelic and then obviously try to demonize the pro-life movement at all costs comes across as ridiculous. I could care less about which movement \"one-ups\" the other--the thing I care most about is saving lives which is why I identify with the pro-life stance. But there is no card-carrying membership plan in the pro-life movement and there is no leadership in the movement. People identify with it depending on their views. Pro-life is an ideology, not a club.\n \n Again, the pro-choice movement has lost touch with women--they are more interesting in bashing other people and than they are giving genuine support for women as your posts have demonstrated. The bottom line is that you are are not pro-women, you are only interested in bashing pro-lifers. And if it were true that the pro-choice movement were all about the needs of women, you would never limit yourself to helping them in the issue of abortion only. You can't claim to be all about women and only 'be for them' in the area of abortion choice. And you would be trying to find ways to help them in all matters related to childbirth and family planning (such as adoption) instead of just helping them get out of pregnancies via abortion. Obviously you don't really care about the women who do want children and would adopt, in a heartbeat, to have one. And again, your tendency to be much more passionate about giving them the right to abortion rather than a balanced approach which would help ALL women with reproductive issues including those not wanting abortions betrays you. This issue is not about which group or organization wins as in some rhetorical ballgame--this isn't a game. This isn't about groups trying to one-up the other or bash the other. This is about people, both women and their children, and you would do well to realize that. Lives are at stake.\n \n It's obvious you aren't about women at all. The gig is up.",

However they do not follow suit with the movement's ideology.\n \n \n \n \"Pro-life people vary in their stances just like pro-choice and no one is getting kicked out of the movement for it...\"\n\n \n Sure they can. The American Life League gave George W Bush the boot in 2001 over the stem cell issue. In fact many pro-lifers don't even accept him as pro-life. McCain proved this back in 2000 under the primaries. Bush is far too supportive of abortion rights to be considered so. \n But don't worry...you can continue to pretend being pro-life all you want.

No but it could be seen that way in comparison to the pro-life movement. If reality just happens to demonize the pro-life movement then that isn't my problem.\n It appears to be more of your problem...no matter how ridiculous you think it is.\n \n \n \n \"Pro-life is an ideology, not a club.\" \n\n \n Yeah and you don't follow either of the two. \n \n \n \n\"Again, the pro-choice movement has lost touch with women...\"\n\n \n Proof of this would be where? On the other hand the pro-life movement is so out of touch with not only women but also Americans. By the early to mid 1990s there were female pro-lifers screaming that the previous firebrand rhetoric of the movement was scarring women. \n It appears your movement has already lost touch. \n \n \n \n \"...they are more interesting in bashing other people and than they are giving genuine support for women as your posts have demonstrated.\" \n\n \n If you believe this then that is fine. However beliefs are not reality. Reality shows the pro-choice movement and legal abortion helping women. Meanwhile your policy of coercion childbirth hasn't helped anyone. \n \n \n \n\"The bottom line is that you are are not pro-women...\"\n\n \n Did I say I was?\n \n \n \n \"...you are only interested in bashing pro-lifers.\" \n\n \n Hardly...I am more interested in bashing the ideology itself. People like you only provide ammo for my stance. \n \n \n \n \"And if it were true that the pro-choice movement were all about the needs of women, you would never limit yourself to helping them in the issue of abortion only.\" \n\n \n The pro-choice movement is limited to reproductive rights...access to contraception and abortion rights. Just like the pro-life movement is limited to fetal rights. \n \n \n \n\"You can't claim to be all about women and only 'be for them' in the area of abortion choice.\" \n\n \n Is this what your argument is reduced to? Criticizing that we don't do enough for women when your movement only chooses to exploit them? Very sad...you must be marked with so much jealously over our success. \n It must be sad being pro-life because you hold no substance for your existence. You can't claim to be all about women because you let them die from criminal abortions or fetuses because you let die under your noses.

   "Then you are saying a lot of major health journals are ridiculous, because the points are cited.\n\n \n Let's examine those citations, shall we?\n \n Lets go down the list of your site:\n \nAccording to the best record based study of deaths following pregnancy and abortion, a 1997 government funded study in Finland, women who abort are approximately four times more likely to die in the following year than women who carry their pregnancies to term. In addition, women who carry to term are only half as likely to die as women who were not pregnant.(16) (Click here for more details on this important study.) \n\n and\n \nThe Finland researchers found that compared to women who carried to term, women who aborted in the year prior to their deaths were 60 percent more likely to die of natural causes, seven times more likely to die of suicide, four times more likely to die of injuries related to accidents, and 14 times more likely to die from homicide. Researchers believe the higher rate of deaths related to accidents and homicide may be linked to higher rates of suicidal or risk-taking behavior.(16) \n\n \n Ok, first off listen to what they're saying. Women who have abortions are more likely to die in the next year because they had abortions. They also say that women who have abortions are more likely to die from homicides! That's absurd on the face of it! Next, how suspicious is it that their \"click here for more info\" links to another page of their own site instead of the study itself.\n \n Now, let's look at the study itself. \n \n Exerpt:\n \nOnly in 22% of the death certificates was the pregnancy or its end mentioned\n ...\n The maternal mortality rate depended greatly on which of these 281 cases were defined as maternal deaths. The early maternal mortality rate varied between 5.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 live births, and the late maternal mortality rate between 0.6 and 2.5 depending on the definition used. The classification of other than direct maternal deaths was ambiguous, especially in case of late cancers, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, and early suicides\n ...\n The current official classification of maternal deaths as indirect, direct and fortuitous is arbitrary and allows much variation in defining a maternal death\n \n\n *emphasis mine\n \n The study itself says that the linkage between maternal death and the end of the pregnancy within the last year cannot be correlated, because anything besides direct maternal deaths are ambiguous as to their cause. Not only that, but their source mentions NOTHING about \"14 times more likely to die from homicide\", or anything like that. My goodness.\n \n Let's take another claim, shall we?\n \nThe leading causes of abortion related maternal deaths within a week of the surgery are hemorrhage, infection, embolism, anesthesia, and undiagnosed ectopic pregnancies. Legal abortion is reported as the fifth leading cause of maternal death in the United States, though in fact it is recognized that most abortion related deaths are not officially reported as such.(2) (Click here for more details on the underreporting of abortion related deaths in the U.S.) \n\n \n Again their \"click here\" directs you to their own site, not the study itself.\n \n In the study itself, we see something interesting:\n Exerpt:\n \nAmong 2475 maternal deaths that occurred in the United States from 1974 to 1978, 408 were related to pregnancies with abortive outcomes, and 2067 were related to other causes. Ectopic pregnancy was the most frequent cause of death in the former group. Embolism, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, obstetric hemorrhage, and obstetric infection were the most common causes of death in the latter group.\n\n \n Former means the first one, meaning the abortive outcomes. Latter means the last one, meaning the \"other causes\" including child-bearing. So, actually, this study shows exactly the opposite of what your pro-life site said it showed. Apparently, \"abortive outcomes\" are safer by a margin of 1/5 than \"other outcomes\" which includes childbearing. Further, \"hemorrhage, infection, embolism\" are in the \"other\" group, not the \"abortive\" group.\n \n Shall we go on, hm?\n \nThe risk of breast cancer almost doubles after one abortion, and rises even further with two or more abortions\n\n \n This one I don't even have to contend with their source, as the breast cancer link with abortion has already been covered in this forum. Go here. \n \n I'll finish with the rest later, as my lunch is running out. As you can see so far, your site is ... bad.",

   "\n \"And before you automatically assume these are pro-life rantings...\" \n\n \n Because that is what they are...just rants. Again, pro-lifers cry and moan about the dangers of legal abortion but keep the public in the dark about the dangers of criminal abortions. Remember these are the same people who did nothing when women were dropping like flies from self-induced abortions...where were they then?\n They also keep you in the dark about the risks in adoption and childbirth. Of course there are risks with everything but the pro-life movement wishes you'd never find out about them. \n \n \n \n\"...note that everything in this list is cited from well-known journals.\"\n\n \n Or made to seem so. Look at citation 16. The Acta Obsetricia et Gynecolgica Scandinavica never made such a link but instead the Elliot Institute; a pro-life made, funded and pusher of the ideology. It is a failed study because it is about comparing post-abortive women in the lower classes of Finland to those of all classes that either had a miscarriage or gave birth. In logic, we call this fallacy of logic post-hoc. \n But then again the pro-life movement loves to keep you in the dark. The last thing it wants you to know is about is how biased and problematic their studies are. These people cannot afford to be honest because their movement is dying.",

   "Outside your imagination when did I ever avoid such a question? So far it is you who has avoided addressing the stark incompetence of the pro-life movement.\n\n \n You've failed to prove any 'incompetence' of the pro-life movement. All you've been able to do is offer your conjectural opinions, which are so steeped in feminist bitterness they are hard to take seriously. Like I said earlier, I actually feel sorry for you. You'll have to do better than feminist bitterness and rage.\n \n \nSure there is. A conditional pro-lifer/pro-choicer is one who accidentally aligns him or herself to one movement or the other over confusion or ignorance. However they do not follow suit with the movement's ideology.\n\n \n Again, your idea that 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' are soundly defined is ridiculous. There is no step-by-step criteria to be \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" People just identify with the one they feel best describes them. I don't know how many times you have to hear it for it to sink in, but people can be pro-life and and still be for abortion in some cases (such as when the woman's life is in danger and very early in the pregnancy, as I hold to). \n \n \nSure they can [be kicked out of the pro-life movment]. The American Life League gave George W Bush the boot in 2001 over the stem cell issue. \n\n \n LOL!!! You don't know much about this issue if you think one lobbying organization defines the pro-life movement and could kick out it's members. People can't be kicked out of an ideology. What you are claiming is just as silly as someone saying that Planned Parenthood could kick someone out of the pro-choice movement. Come back to reality.\n \n \nIn fact many pro-lifers don't even accept him as pro-life. McCain proved this back in 2000 under the primaries. Bush is far too supportive of abortion rights to be considered so.\n\n \n So? He's still pro-life regardless of what one organization says he is, because that's what he identifies with. No one leads either the pro-life or pro-choice movement.\n \n \nSo what is so biased and inaccurate about them? \n\n \n Everything you offered is mere opinion. You showed no proof of anything you said.\n \n \nAngelic? No but it could be seen that way in comparison to the pro-life movement. If reality just happens to demonize the pro-life movement then that isn't my problem.\n\n \n The only ones demonizing the pro-life movement are the ones who hate it and it's members, which includes you.\n \n \nProof of this would be where? On the other hand the pro-life movement is so out of touch with not only women but also Americans.\n\n \n At one time your movement was unified and would not even consider being open-minded enough to stopping late-term abortions. Now you all can't even agree on that, as many in your movement have found that knee-jerk feminism just doesn't do anyone any good and there is plenty of science that suggests a fetus is viable after about 24 weeks. At least some in your movement have grown a conscience, much to the frustration of stalwarts such as yourself, I'm sure.\n \n \nThe pro-choice movement is limited to reproductive rights...access to contraception and abortion rights. Just like the pro-life movement is limited to fetal rights.\n\n \n And you don't think its a reproductive issue when a woman can't have a baby? Again, you aren't out to help women--if you were you would put just as much effort into making sure women had other 'choices' as well (other than abortion) and you would be just as passionate about helping women who can't have babies as you are to help those who don't want a baby (even though they've already gotten pregnant).\n \n \nwhen your movement only chooses to exploit them?\n\n \n There it is again, opinion with no proof. This is getting to be a serious habit for you.\n \n \nYou can't claim to be all about women\n\n \n That's right; that's the difference between your movement and the pro-life one: Pro-lifers don't claim to be ALL about women, but also about the baby as well. The best the pro-choice movement can seem to do is give no respect for the baby's life that could grow into a person, and claim to be for women when in fact they obviously really aren't. (Shrug)",

Keep it up...you only prove to make my side look good. \n \n \n \n\"Again, your idea that 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' are soundly defined is ridiculous. There is no step-by-step criteria to be \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\"\" \n\n \n Whether you like it or not there is a set definition for being pro-life and you do not fit it. However this isn't my problem. You can pretend to be pro-life all you want but in the end you are just another pro-lifer who supports abortion and thinks fetal rights are ridiculous. Your consistency aids me and makes your own movement \"ridiculous\" because you think they should accept your embracement of abortion. Keep it up because I couldn't ask for a better opponent. \n \n \n \n\"People just identify with the one they feel best describes them.\" \n\n \n I am sure they do...just like there are people who identify themselves with religious movements let do never follow the dogma.

He isn't pro-life and approves of Roe v Wade. \n \n \n \n\"People can't be kicked out of an ideology.\" \n\n \n Sure they can. In fact it is people who align themselves with an ideology and never follow it who kick themselves out of it. But this isn't my problem...I am not going to keep arguing with someone who is aiding my own arguments against the pro-life movement. Keep it up...I encourage you. \n \n \n \n\"So? He's still pro-life regardless of what one organization says he is, because that's what he identifies with.\" \n\n \n So just as long as someone identifies themselves with something then that is what they are. I suppose a Hindu can claim to be a Christian when it suits them, a capitalist can claim to be a communist when it fits their means and a social democrat can be a social republican when it helps their agenda...however none of the three would follow the beliefs they claim to have. Such a foolish thing you believe in but then again it helps me. \n George W Bush is the first president in American history that I know of who made money off of dead, born children but he is pro-life because that is what he identifies with over what he does. LOL!\n \n \n \n\"Everything you offered is mere opinion. You showed no proof of anything you said.\" \n\n \n So because I didn't offer any source that means it is pure opinion? Please, if you need a source specifically tell me which one of them you need information for. \n \n \n \n\"The only ones demonizing the pro-life movement are the ones who hate it and it's members, which includes you.\" \n\n \n Me hate the pro-life movement? Why hate something that only reinforces my own beliefs? Why hate something that amuses me? Hardly, it is pro-life ideology that should be hated because it is a tool of oppression and destruction. The people behind it are just confused and uninformed. They are innocent.\n \n \n \n\"At one time your movement was unified and would not even consider being open-minded enough to stopping late-term abortions. Now you all can't even agree on that...\"\n\n \n I don't recall this historical event ever happening in history...mind to prove it? The pro-choice movement collectively offers a plan to stop it by making first trimester abortions easily available but unfortunately pro-lifers such as you have fought tooth and nail against this by adding more and more restrictions and hence more late-term abortions. Even according to a member of the NRLC, in one of the many issues of Newsweek in 2000 that covered the hot button issues within the presidential race, claimed that they wanted more late-term abortions in order make abortion itself more unpopular. This was their strategy and they have been doing it successfully as studies have proven. http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/newsrelease3201.html\n Late-term abortions are only a problem in America...in other abortion-liberated countries, where abortion is offered early and accessible, it isn't a problem and nearly ten times more rare. If pro-lifers would only let us do our job instead of interfering then late-term abortions wouldn't be such an issue but unfortunately your people choose to make it an issue. Besides, even you favor late-term abortions. \n \n \n \n\"...as many in your movement have found that knee-jerk feminism...\"\n\n \n What knee-jerk feminism? I appreciate you calling us feminism but I think you over use because you do not understand it. \n \n \n \n\"At least some in your movement have grown a conscience, much to the frustration of stalwarts such as yourself, I'm sure.\" \n\n \n Grown a conscious over late-term abortions? Hardly...many of either collapsed in by pro-life disinformation or threats. I can understand their position but then again I do not support it simply because late-term abortions have a purpose when needed. I am sure more pro-lifers would agree with the use of late-term abortions before an early one.\n \n \n \n\"And you don't think its a reproductive issue when a woman can't have a baby?\" \n\n \n Not to our ideology. You have to understand that the pro-choice movement triumphs in a woman's rights to their ability to control their fertility. For decades upon decades women have been subjected to the coercion policies of reactionaries and sexists. This means the access to contraception and if all else fails then abortion. \n However, adoption is more of an issue with child's rights activists...not reproduction since the woman is not reproducing and it has nothing to do with controlling it. \n \n \n \n\"Again, you aren't out to help women...\"\n\n \n We aren't helping women? The pro-choice movement has assured that the 1.5 million criminal abortions being performed before Roe v Wade would be performed in sterile climates, inside clinics or hospitals and performed by registered doctors or nurses that would be held accountable for what they did. \n What have you done? Nothing except complain and belly ache about how we do not help women while hundreds of thousands of women die needlessly on your watch. \n \n \n \n\"--if you were you would put just as much effort into making sure women had other 'choices' as well (other than abortion) and you would be just as passionate about helping women who can't have babies as you are to help those who don't want a baby (even though they've already gotten pregnant).\" \n\n \n How can we put more effort into making sure women have other \"choices\" when those choices are far easier to attain in the first place? Crisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion clinics and there are countless couples waiting to adopt. The resources and availability to these areas is very easy and accessible. There are no waiting periods, there are no protesters blocking and harassing them and they can be found in any county here in America. How can pro-choicers make such choices easier and more accessible when they already are? \n It is abortion that is made inaccessible and held in a very unfair level to these choices. You pro-lifers cannot be seriously boo-hooing about us giving choices. You only provide no choices. \n \n \n \n\"There it is again, opinion with no proof. This is getting to be a serious habit for you.\" \n\n \n Don't call the kettle black Mr. Pot. You haven't offered any yourself. \n \n \n \n\"That's right; that's the difference between your movement and the pro-life one: Pro-lifers don't claim to be ALL about women...\"\n\n \n Wrong. You appear to be completely ignorant of your own movement. You should pay attention more to your spin master Reardon. \n \n \n \n\"The best the pro-choice movement can seem to do is give no respect for the baby's life...\"\n\n \n Neither do you or the majority of pro-lifers. You are the one who proudly says you are pro-life but for abortion.",

   "So the massive illegal abortion rates in the pre-Roe days and the countless women who died from criminal abortion do not highlight your massive incompetence? Does the fact that not a single law against abortion has ever been successful in deterring the rate of abortions also prove so?\n\n \n WHAT \"massive\" illegal abortions, and \"countless\" women? There have most likely been far more abortions performed since it became legal than before. There is no way to obtain the data that would be necessary for you to back up your assertions.\n \n \nI am not the one becoming bitter and when did I align myself as a feminist?\n\n \n You're not a feminist???\n \n \nMy, why are you becoming so hostile and bitter in your comments? Personal attacks are the refuge of someone who is hollow of substance and conviction.\n\n \n Then you lost those traits long ago here. You've been using personal attacks since I first saw your posts and I've seen you use them with others here.\n \n \nWhether you like it or not there is a set definition for being pro-life and you do not fit it.\n\n \n Nope--no set definition. If there were you would undoubtedly link to it. There is no one \"in change\" of the pro-life movement that could set such a definition.\n \n \nI am sure they do...just like there are people who identify themselves with religious movements let do never follow the dogma. You simply amuse me and acknowledge the decay within your own movement.\n\n \n Why do the members of a religious group or political ideology have to follow everything that you think they should? You have a VERY black and white view of the world. There are plenty of Catholics who don't hold to every Catholic tenet. (John Kerry was one.) But in the case of the pro-life movement, there isn't even a centralized pro-life 'doctrine.' Pro-lifers are united only in their respect for life. Face it, you've lost on this one. Pro-lifers and well as pro-choicers have varying views. That's the nature of people.\n \n \nSure they can [be kicked out of an ideology].\n\n \n This is just ridiculous. By your logic I guess someone who is for tax cuts could be 'kicked out' of that ideology as well. Or someone who was for 'free trade' worldwide. Funny though, I don't know who could kick them out. No one can kick you out of your own thinking. \n \n \nSo just as long as someone identifies themselves with something then that is what they are. I suppose a Hindu can claim to be a Christian when it suits them,\n\n \n Bad analogy--though there are Jewish Christians, and probably Hindu ones as well--who are you to say they can't identify that way? A better analogy would be to say that a Hindu (or Christian, for that matter) might hold to many of the traditional Hindu views, but maybe not all of them.\n \n \nEven according to a member of the NRLC, in one of the many issues of Newsweek in 2000 that covered the hot button issues within the presidential race, claimed that they wanted more late-term abortions in order make abortion itself more unpopular.\n\n \n They don't favor abortions any more than you do--you are using the same false thinking as people who call pro-choice people \"pro-abortion.\" And I seriously doubt this is true anyway. It would, of course, seem true to someone determined to see something bad in the pro-life movement even when there was nothing bad to see.\n \n \nBesides, even you favor late-term abortions.\n\n \n Only in the extremely rare cases where the life of the mother was in definite danger.\n \n \nWhat have you done? Nothing except complain and belly ache about how we do not help women while hundreds of thousands of women die needlessly on your watch.\n\n \n You seem to operating under the false understanding that the pro-life movement was around and somehow 'in-charge' when all these supposed countless women were dying. \n \n \nCrisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion clinics and there are countless couples waiting to adopt. The resources and availability to these areas is very easy and accessible. There are no waiting periods, However this isn't my problem.\n\n \n I wish it were that simple. The adoption process is in terrible shape in this country. It NEEDS to be reformed badly. The system sometimes keeps kids in place (minority kids anyway) for long periods of time and charges exorbitant amounts of money before adoption can even happen. Right now it is far easier to have an abortion than it is to adopt. That's why I would love to see your side do more for the rights of women this THIS area as well--abortion doesn't have to be the only choice.\n \n \n\"But this isn't my problem . . . but this isn't my problem . . .\"\n\n \n You keep saying that, like you are trying to wish it away. It's the sound of someone in denial who doesn't want to deal with his/her problems. Frankly, I don't think I've ever met anyone in a discussion forum as angry as you--mad at the world it seems. I mean this--I really do hope that someday you can experience some joy and happiness in your life and lose some of your deep bitterness. Life is too short for that! I wish you well.",

I realized that respect was allowing others to make their own decisions.\n\n I interpreted that as you saying that when you were young you found it fundamentally wrong but as you \"matured\", you saw shades of gray and began to see possible execptions based on \"desperate situations\". That is a classic example of situational ethics. A belief that something is fundamentally wrong but it's still OK to do in certain instances.

It should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavor.\n \n \n\n Pro-choice people want to say \"it's OK that you acted irresponsibility, we'll just suck the extra life out of you and you can go back to being irresponsible\".\n\n \n No, pro-choice people do not want to say that it's ok to act irresponsibly. Pro-choice people say that pregnancy and motherhood should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavior. Pro-choice people do not want people to act irresponsibly, pro-choice people want women to desire their pregnancies.\n \n \n\n The statistics on abortions are very revealing. \n There are many repeat abortions and there are many abortions performed on \"mothers\" who have already given birth to children in the past. I don't believe in abortion as a means of birth control. If they don't want kids, or any more kids, then they should get their damn tubes tied and be 100% responsible.\n\n \n I agree, women who do not want any more children should have their tubes tied. I do not want women to use abortion as birth control any more than you. None of that changes the fact that pregnancy and motherhood should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavior.\n \n \n\n I interpreted that as you saying that when you were young you found it fundamentally wrong but as you \"matured\", you saw shades of gray and began to see possible execptions based on \"desperate situations\".\n\n \n When I was young I had, as many young people have, conviction that my belief about right and wrong trumped things like compassion and empathy and other \"touchy feely\" things. As I matured, I saw that compassion and empathy were more important than right and wrong. More than that, compassion and empathy became part of my ethics.\n \n People also have pesky things called \"rights\". Whether or not I agree with them.\n \n \n\n That is a classic example of situational ethics. A belief that something is fundamentally wrong but it's still OK to do in certain instances.\n\n \n Like you and the other fellow? It's ok in the case of rape?\n \n \n\n Hence my comment \"So you sold out your principle for pragmatism\". Was it your principle that abortion was wrong when you were young or not? They were your words, not mine. \n\n \n When people mature, generally their view of the world changes, as do their morals and ethics. My view on abortion changed when I matured. \n \n If you wish to call maturing a \"flip flop\", then you're more than welcome to. \n \n \n\n I'd say that young kids can have a keen idea of what is right that is unencumbered with grown-up \"spin\".\n\n \n They have a self-centered view of what is right, and they generally lack empathy.\n \n \n\n If a three year old knows that it's fundamentally wrong to prevent a birth, why don't many adults? The answer is because many adults have bought into the idea of situational ethics.\n\n \n A three year old might \"know\" that it is wrong to hunt, might \"know\" capital punishment is wrong, might \"know\" that the war in iraq is wrong, etc. Generally, three year olds do not know the issues involved.\n \n Adults generally see that the world is not black and white, and that, in this country, others are not forced to conform to a single individuals morals.",

   "If that view is there, it is probably because many pro-lifers can't imagine someone who would not be excited and joyful over the chance to bring a young child into the world. Except in a case of something such as a rape, a very difficult pregnancy, or the mother's life at risk, how could the miracle of a child being brought into the world not be a wonderful thing?\n\n \n That's probably true. All kinds of humans with all kinds of views have difficulty seeing things from a life experirence/perspective not their own. They probably can't see it, because they have never been in that place. For example I would not see a pregnancy at this juncture as a wonderful thing. I am a a single mother who has spent the better part of ten years raising a kid 100% alone - and although I love him and would not trade him for anything - the idea of another child, at my age, to not be done until my mid-fifties, to be raising it alone (I don't trust men to pull their weight) - that is a friggen nightmare. But I also have taken steps to mitigate the chances of that ever happening (tubes tied, birth control, steer clear of dating, etc.)\n \n \nI seriously doubt that. Maybe that's what you read into their statements.\n\n \n Oh I have seen it - mostly by severe tight wads and fire and brimstone ministers (you know the ones that leave out the parts in the Bible about forgiveness and love.)\n \n \nThat's what I suspected--'implied.' and it sounds like you were probably talking to some who were pretty extremist in their views anyway if they really said that. I've heard pro-choicers who said some very inhumane things about the fetus as well. Luckily I know that neither extremist group represents the mainstream in their movement (pro-life or pro-choice).\n\n \n Agreed.

It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\"\n \n Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: \"Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.

   "Yes, we know. That is one reason why pregnant women are often treated with respect and sympathy all the time in our culture.\n\n \n A single mom is also often NOT treated that way. Trust me - I have some ten years experience on this - and most the snubbery has come from conservatives who also happen to be pro-life (not all pro-lifers mind you - just some - but never have I got it from choicers.)\n \n \nBut you are basically arguing that people accept ANY circumstance of the mother as grounds for abortion, and that's not going to happen.\n\n \n ONLY if circumstances can't be addressed or aren't addressed in other ways. But too often the attitude of too many lifers is \"you got pregnant - you get to be pregnant - now deal with it\" - and THAT isn't going to happen either.\n \n Help find ways to make it work for both mother and baby and you will have better success, not to mention happier, healthier - moms and babies. \n \n \nYou are wrong there about many women.\n\n \n What are you talking about? My best friend is a pro-life woman. I know there are women who are pro-life. Why are you telling me this?\n \n \nMy wife is more pro-life than I am--she would do everything in her power to have a baby (and has) and can't stand it when women put their own health over their unborn son or daughter. She has said that a good mother won't do it after they are born, so why should they do it before they are born.\n\n \n So many fallacies in her thinking.\n \n 1 - the idea that she, a complete stranger, gets to determine whose health is more important - mom or unborn baby. What if mom already has three kids and she is their only support? Does one unborn baby matter more than four people?\n \n 2-Not every pregnant woman will be a mother - or should be (due to number three).\n \n 3-Not every woman is a good mother. (or can be)\n \n \n(For what it's worth, I discouraged her from reading your posts simply because I know it would make her so angry towards you, or people with your mindset. If she wants to though, that's her prerogative.)\n \n Trust me, be glad it's me you are discussing this with, because you don't want to go head to head with her on this issue.\n\n \n Tell her to bring it on. It infuriates me that she can't step outside of her own loving world long enough to see that not everyone has one AND that she has the absolute arrogance to get infuriated with women who won't risk their lives for her cause.\n \n And why would I not want to go rounds with her? I can hold my own. And I am well-practiced. I don't even have anyone to screen my fights for me.",

   "I'm sure that's true, and we as a society should find ways to do better with that; but it still doesn't justify abortion.\n\n \n Would you please pay attention to what is being discussed. Where did I use this as justification for abortion? What exactly was it that I was responding to? hmmm?\n \n You said the pro-life side doesn't demonize women and that pregnant women are always treated with respect - I told you from personal experience that is not necesarily the case when the mother is single.\n \n \nI'm already in favor of this, and I don't know too many pro-lifers who aren't. The mentality that pro-lifers in general hate women and mothers is just not true.\n\n \n I never said they did. I said some do demonize women and cited personal experience. I am glad you favor finding ways to help moms. Favor it big time and abortion rates go down. The Clinton years saw an increase in sex education and family planning assistance for women - and abortion went down. The current monkey in cheif is reversing all that and rates are going back up.\n \n You can't protect that baby without her. No law in the world will change that.\n \n \nWould it be an issue if the 'unborn baby' were in fact already born?\n\n \n What? In the example I cited we are talking about a women risking the her health/life and the livlihood for a pregnancy. Of course it would be different if the child were already born. What kind of lame question is that?\n \n Why is the baby more important than the mother?\n \n Or more than that - why do YOU or YOUR WIFE get to decide that for strangers?\n \n \nProbably not. For many pro-lifers, the delemma shouldn't even be there. For a loving mother, she would never look at the situation as a choice among her 3 living children, so why would she do the same if one was unborn? \n\n \n Bacause in few other situations would it have to be. If a pregnancy will change her ability to provide for her children - it's not just some vague notion of having to choose - it is having to choose the life of one child, not yet born, over everyone else.\n \n The life and welfare of myself and my son would not play second fiddle to a child not yet born. (Not that I really need to worry with these hips and my tubes being tied.) I also would not keep a child from rape. Those are the only sitauations in which I would abort.\n \n Being pregnant is vastly different than being a parent. They are not mutually exclusive. \n \n And just how does a pregnant mother considering her own health different once a child is born? I am aware of no law that demands a parent put their health or life on the line for their child. You can't be forced to run into a burning building, or give up your internal organs, or stop taking medicine you need because of your child, yet you think it ought to be compulsary for pregnant women?\n \n Every living already born person in the life of an unborn person does not take second place to the unborn. You don't know the circumstances of these people. How dare you and your wife judge them? Just who in the hell do you think you are?\n \n And just so I am clear - the paragraphs above are in regard to the example I set - not all abortion.\n \n \nFor some reason that one issue of one the children being unborn changes the whole equation for pro-choicers, to the point where suddenly the baby is not a baby, but irrelevant.\n\n \n And you and your wife seem to think that once pregnant a woman is irrelevant along with anyone else in her life. There is nothing but the unborn. Your rage at women considering their own health makes that pretty obvious.\n \n \nMy wife doesn't think it should be that way and in most cases neither do it. Your response to this has been \"not all women are loving, though.\" But that is exactly the point. In my opinion, aborting a baby in most cases IS an very unloving thing to do. That is why pro-lifers are generally against abortion.\n\n \n And forcing them to go through a pregnancy they hate will magically make them loving, good mothers? Oh yes, all women just naturally want to be pregnant and mothers - they just may not know it.\n \n \nAgain, you have not shown how this justifies abortion.\n\n \n Wasn't arguing that. Was arguing against the idea that women can't do this because that's not what good mothers would do. What a good parent would or would not do is pretty irrelevant. Abortion is about pregnancy, not parenting. If a woman isn't looking to be a mother, telling her that an abortion will make her a bad mama is pretty meaningless.\n \n \nCome on now, be honest. You know good and well that is not the reason she gets infuriated with other women. Pro-lifers aren't looking for someone to \"join a cause\", they are looking to save lives from the one issue that has taken more lives than the holocaust, all because of the futile reasons you listed above. None of them can really justify a woman killing her own son or daughter.\n\n \n That is their narrow vision then. If they can't see why a woman might be compelled to make the choice, they will never be able to reach her or help her, and they will never be able to alleviate this problem.",

   "Allegations without proof are not real allegations.\n\n \n Of I have read it in a million places - I will dig Wednesday night when I have more time. Face it monkey head is no friend of women or children - he just has his nose up the XXX of the religious right.\n \n \nOf course not--that is why it is important to help some women realize the worth and joy of the miracle growing inside them.\n\n \n And you have to realize you can't demand or create that emotional response. There will be women who do the right thingand never find joy in the pregnancy - and have no intention of being a parent to the child that is born. You will also not suceed in demanding a certain emotional response.\n \n Face it - not all broads are born moms. \n \n \nWhat you call a \"pregnancy\" is really a life that will grow into a toddler, a teenager (like your son), and an adult.  You can keep trying and reduce it to terms like \"pregnancy\", but that doesn't change the fact that every time an abortion takes place, that life is ended.\n\n \n I am not going to continue this if you can't bother to actually read what I write.\n \n I have told you that I know it's ending a life. Have you always had this knack for prattling the obvious like a parrot?\n \n \nWhy should a woman view a baby that is about to be born as so much less important than a child already born?\n\n \n First of all I would like to thank you kindly for completely ignoring the fact that I was referring to specifically to a situation where a woman's health and/or life may be at risk - even tho I SPECIFICALLY said that was what I was talking about.\n \n Now with that in mind I will tell you. Sick and dead moms can't love or provide for themselves or their children. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out. If she is single mother and the sole support for her family and her health is at risk due to a pregnancy - the family needs to come first. If you can't see that - I can't help you and I would have to question if you ever notice all the born people on the planet at all. \n \n \nThe point is, the only reason it's a either/or scenario is because the mother considers it so based on the fact that she doesn't view the baby about to be born as important, as if somehow magically it suddenly becomes worthy of her love the minute it leaves her birth canal. It's a child too, just like her others.\n\n \n I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH / LIFE RISK SCENARIO. Quit twisting what I say out of context - or can't you manage honest debate?\n \n \nThe argument that she should abort because she can't afford to raise the extra child is no different than an argument she should kill one of her own children already born for the same reason. Both things are terribly wrong.\n\n \n SEE ABOVE. I am talking about her being able to continue to support her family WHILE pregnant. If risks to her health mean she can't then her, the already born kids and the baby inside are not likely to make it. Of course - she may lose her children for being neglectful - as you feel she should per your comments below.\n \n \nThen you don't know the law very well. If a mother lets her child die out of neglect, even if she claims it's for her own health, she can be charged for murder. (as she should be.) \n\n \n Neglect and purposely putting yourself at risk aren't the same thing.\n \n \nThis is so ridiculous. Why is it that anytime a person thinks for the unborn child and not just the mother, they are accused of something like \"rage at women?\" You are out of control, get a grip.\n\n \n I am not out of control. You said that it infuriates you and your wife that a pregnant woman would consider her own helath circumstances. Need I shoe you where? Are you now denying that? \n \n \nThis is where you are terribly wrong, to draw a dichotomy between the pregnancy (which involves the mother and baby) and parenting (which involves the mother and baby.) Here's the deal: The ONLY substantial difference between a baby a week before birth and after birth is that the baby hasn't exited the birth canal. Oh sure, there's a cord attached and a placenta. But the mother (unless she's giving it up for adoption) still has the responsibility of giving it the nutrients it needs even after birth.\n\n \n No I am not. Most states will allow you to drop off a newborn with no questions asked (at hospitals/fire station/police station), etc., you can give up a child for adoption, you can lose custody because you are a loser, you can sign away your parental rights, kids get abondonded in my neighborhood all the time. A ten year old boy was left in my friend's brother's back yard in his underwear - his parents did not want him anymore. And let's not even begin on dead beat dads - the number of jails needed to round those losers up would break the American tax payer. Parents walk all the time and nobody has to be a parent. Kids should be wanted and aren't. Especially special needs kids. There are around 100 waiting for adoption just in my county alone at any given time. Most them aren't infants. Kids are hungry, abondonded and abused all the time. We are killing them by the thousands over seas. This world does not need to be littered with more unwanted kids. You aren't gonna turn pregnant women into momies who love by sheer will.\n \n \nTry telling an expectant mother who is singing to her unborn baby, avoiding alcohol, even reading aloud to the unborn baby (which many expecting mothers do) that she isn't being a parent. Go ahead, I dare you. Tell her what you told me--that having or killing that baby is not about parenting.

   "*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK AT STOMACH :*NOTE*\n \n Just read...\n \n Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, \"Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me.\" Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, \"Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels.\" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful. \n \n Love,\n Your Baby Girl\n \n http://wajclan.topcities.com/abortion/abortion.html\nConfucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured.",

   "Confucious, that letter was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. Not only do the factual errors make it completely worthless but it's far too overly sappy. I'm about to have an abortion (and I realize this thread is old and nobody will probably read it) but that still did not make me \"sad\" for my unborn child. I don't need a letter like that to tell me that I should be sad. I'm deeply saddened by what I have to do and was in a depression for several days before I came to terms with what is to be done and realized that I cannot live my life in saddness but must move on. Furthermore, I believe that my 5 1/2 week old fetus is very much alive. I think that people need to STOP ARGUING about whether or not a fetus is alive. It is growing into a potential human being, of course it is alive. THIS IS A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT THAT NEEDS TO STOP!!!!! I'd like to know how many people have actually had abortions here. \n \n BTW, Carla, you're sorely misinformed. Abortions do have an effect on a womens pysche, look up on it.
