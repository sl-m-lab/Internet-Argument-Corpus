   "Remember, this is not a poll about whether Muslims, as people, are good or evil. It's just about the book.\n \n I'm not making any statements with this poll, I am just interested in seeing the result and the replies. \n \n Personally, I'm an agnostic.\n \n Anyway, I know that somewhere in that book justifications must have been made to support polygamy. The practice is awful, but the symbolism is far worse. Polygamy exists solely for the man--- it is a purely sexual practice. Clearly the Kuran asserts one people (men) as superior to another (women). It is a fundemental belief that, according to Islam's tennants, \"Allah intends for all human beings to be Muslim\". Incidentally, infidels are considered inferior to the superior Muslims.\n \n The most obvious conclusion is that Islam is a violent religion and highly susceptible to fascism.\n \n I think this is one of those instances where you have to look at the middle east today and make a judgement. Consider Saudi Arabia and the former, taliban-controlled Afghanistan. I'm forced to doubt whether the impact has been a 'good' one.",

Incidentally, infidels are considered inferior to the superior Muslims.\n \n The most obvious conclusion is that Islam is a violent religion and highly susceptible to fascism.\n\n \n I'm not sure how those two facts point to that conclusion. A little googling seems to suggest that polygamy is only permitted in Islam when it would improve the lot of the women involved:\n http://members.aol.com/silence004/gamy.html \n Polygamy is not a universal evil, it depends greatly on the circumstances in which it comes about and the rights permitted to each party within it.\n \n As for the latter, that does not necessarily infer violence any more than Christ's \"go and make disciples of all nations\" does. Indeed, Islam has specific provision for non-Muslims to live with Muslims, subject to Muslims rule. This was a pretty advanced concept for the day. I disagree that Islam is inherently violent, a lot of its tenets were designed to control violence, such as the oft condemned rules on husbands beating their wives, and amputating the hands of thieves. In the context of the time these were humane and emancipating rules, it's just that, like the rules of the Torah, we have moved beyond them.",

   "Edit: I have read parts of the Koran (in translation or 'interpretation' and attended a lecture course on Islam, particularly law.)\n \n Polygamy was seen by Native Americans as an act of charity: if your friend died, then you married his wife so you could support her and she could continue family life. The rules, in cases of polygamy, punishment and marital roles are probably more liberal than the Torah - for example, the stoning of adulterers practised in some Muslim countries is actually based on a case where Mohammed allowed the Jewish law of stoning in a case between Jews in Muslim lands, not a Muslim rule.\n \n Islam says its the best and its followers are best: so does every relgion and most political or philosophical positions.\n \n More generally: the question is unclear. It seems to ask about the text itself, and then asks about its impact. Which do you mean? On the question of impact, its worth remembering that Islam preserved texts which Christians destroyed, contributing massively to the Rennaisance.",

   "I think it would be a great idea if everyone prefaced their post with \"I have/haven't read the Kuran.\"\n \n I have read the Kuran.\n \n It seemed to me that Mohamed wrote the Koran for political reasons, as a means to unite people under one banner, his banner. So there's alot of self serving stuff in there. That's not great, but it's not exactly evil either. There's alot in there about forgiveness and tolerance, which is good. There's alot about smiting one's enemies, which is bad. So really, it's pretty much on par with every other holy book I've read. If you want to use it as a justification for leading a good life, you can do that. If you want to be all smity, you can find justification for that in there too. So the Kuran itself isn't good or bad. It's got both in there, and whichever one you're looking for, you'll find.",
