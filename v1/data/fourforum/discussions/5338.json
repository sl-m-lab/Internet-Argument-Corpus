I suspect that the prosecutors just will not bring charges until they can be certain of a conviction. I do think it is interesting that there have been no further such anthrax letters. That tends to show that the perps are laying low and probably in the U.S.",

That tends to show that the perps are laying low and probably in the U.S.\n\n \n Thing is it could be a lot of people. Anthrax is avaliable to anyone who has access to farm animals and anyone who is working in decently stocked bio labs. Of course the farm animal one is much easier to access and get away with. It is likely they were in the US. \n \n But is there consenus on who? It doesn't seem very terrifying when only famous people are getting them. I mean if they just randomly mailed, that would freak out much of the nation, today could be the day you get anthrax. WHOA.",
