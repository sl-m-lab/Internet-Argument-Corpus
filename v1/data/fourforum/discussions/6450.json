Only in recent times have people gotten this idea that religion and science can't co-exist. Originally, religion and learning went hand-in-hand.

How the devil would anyone know that particular person was praying unless that person made a big fuss and wanted everyone to know that he or she was holier than the others and spent his or her time in prayer?\n\n Jesus says the exact same thing...not to make a big show of your praying. No one should, in the Christian faith that is, go and make a big deal about their praying. Wouldn't a belief in an Almighty God suggest that God can hear what ever voice you pray in?\n \nIn our schools, we have to offer education based in fact, as best we know it. Mathmatic constants. Physics and indisputable laws of nature. We cannot teach a child in one class that constants are constants and then send him to another class and fill their impressionable minds with myths and superstitions as if they are factual as well.\n\n Do you think that religion shouldn't be taught in a Social Studies class? Part of Social Studies is to learn about other cultures and their histories. Religion is one of the things that define different cultures and shape their history. Look at the Middle East. Besides all of the political messes over their over the decades (and into centuries) one of the main things about the cultures over there is the religion. Why is there so much conflict between the differnet cultures over there, because of their religion (and the political part I mentioned earlier.) Or what about all the Ancient cultures along the Mediteranian Sea. One of the things that defined Ancient Greece besides sports and drama was their religion. If you don't study religions at least in Social Studies then you can't really learn anything.\n \nHow could you expect a kid to believe a history or science teacher if the schools mixes facts with Santa Claus type myths and superstitions?\nActually, there was a real St. Nick. I believe he was the patron Saint of Turkey. (I'm not Catholic so I don't know this for sure or how it works.) But what he did was go out and throw coins to a man who had very little money and might have had to sale his three daughters into slavery/prostatution. By this St. Nick doing this, the man was able to get by without saleing his daughters. But this was back at least during the middle ages if not well before and probibly looked nothing like the modern day Hallmark Santa Claus. Just a little history lession for everyone. :) \n \nAfter all, we send students from science and maths to history and sociology, and english literature, without difficulty.\nBut wait a minute. Isn't English Literature (or any kind of literature for that matter) fiction with no real fact to them that can be proven? If anyone says that there should be no religion subject at all in school should also try to stop students from reading English Lit (or what ever kind of lit.) That sure would have made my Senior year of English breeze by better. :p \n \n Anyway, on the subject of prayers in school, I believe that all students should have the right to pray. No one said that a person has to be abnauxous when they pray (as I said before, especially Jesus said that.) I do not think they have to get up and drop to their knees and make a big deal out of it. I do not think students should be forced to say a prayer. Thats one reason why we have \"Meet You At The Pole\" in this country anyway so students can get together and pray by choice. No one ever had to go to that. To deny anyone the right to pray is to deny them the 1st ammendment. (I'm studding journalism. I'm aware of the 1st ammendment.) For anyone not in the USA, the 1st Amend. is the right to free speech and free religion. Enough said, enough said.",

Religion, as a whole, has had, and still has, such a huge effect on society and the world we live in that it's become, imo, essential to at least give students some background knowledge on the main religions. It doesn't have to be taught for any spiritual reasons imo.\nI have no problem with giving \"students some background knowledge on the main religions.\" I am just saying not in science classes.

If we can have classes that teach the literary arts and require our students to study the fictitious works of authors worldwide, why not religion too? As long as the student understands that it is what it is.\n \n In other words, do not teach Shakespeare in a science class. It's fiction. It's art. It's theatre. Make believe. NOT science. Not math. Those are real.\n \n Students should be taught the difference between reality and fiction. Or have the sense to know the difference.",
