   "\"An Associated Press analysis found that the 20 states with so-called 'civil commitment' programs will spend nearly $500 million this year alone to confine and treat 5,200 offenders still considered too dangerous to put back on the streets.\n \n \"The annual costs per offender topped out at $175,000 in New York and $173,000 in California, and averaged $96,000 a year, about double what it would cost to send them to an Ivy League university....\n \n \"The heavy financial burden of treating confined sex offenders has left lawmakers with less money as they make agonizing cuts to areas like education and health care....\n \n \"The confinement is costly mainly because of the need to hire behavioral therapists, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists....\n \n \"Fitch, the Maryland expert, said research suggests that treatment lowers their risk of committing more sex crimes only slightly, something less than 20 percent. He said states without civil commitment for sex offenders tend to focus on controlling behavior more than psychology. Colorado, for example, manages them through intensive supervision, lie-detector tests, tracking devices and counseling.\"\n Sexual predator treatment squeezes state budgets - Yahoo! News\n \n I suspect the main benefit of such programs is that they keep people who endanger the rights of others out of the general population for a few more years after they've served their time in prison. If an adult really does like children sexually then I question the ability of therapy to change that. It doesn't seem fair that a state should spend millions of dollars treating sex offenders but lay off thousands of public school teachers who haven't done anything wrong as has happened in states like California. Perhaps there is a less costly solution that wouldn't result in more innocent people being victimized.",
