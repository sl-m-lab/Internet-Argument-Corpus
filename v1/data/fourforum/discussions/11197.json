   "Do you believe in Gun Control? Personally, I think we should have some gun control laws, but only what's needed. In fact, I think America's gun control laws should be less strict. They banned assault weapons, saying that they have no legitimate sporting purpose. But the second amendment doesn't mention sporting, it's about organizing a militia in case of an invasion! But I don't think anyone with a history of serial felonies should be allowed to own a gun, or anyone with a mental problem of some kind. emoticon_xkill",

   "My problem with your opening post is how word your position \"we should have some gun control laws\". That statement implies that you are in favor of laws just for the sake of laws, regardless of their effect. Instead I would say that there are some good gun laws and some good concepts, such as, as you said, felons being denied access to weapons. I would add a ban on modern cannonry, child purchases of weapons, brandishing, carying while drunk, etc. We already have these laws, although they, in my opinion, need some work. For instance, in Ohio it is illegal to cary drunk, but also to cary in any establishment that serves alcohol, regardless of drunkenness or even intention to drink.",

Making a rule saying that the penalty will be more severe if you commit a crime with a gun is a great thing. In fact, I see this as an indirect measure of gun control in and of itself. And yes, many criminals are repeat offenders, but were once first time felons themselves. I understand you cannot stop someone with no criminal record from buying a gun, and I wouldn't want to. But, why make it easy for felons who are likely to repeat their crimes to purchase weapons? I understand that guns are not that difficult to come by on the street, but this is no excuse to blindly arm felons. Background checks, wating periods, etc. all have a purpose.

   "IMO the biggest problem with most gun control laws is that they lack a crime control element, rather they are just restrictions on what law abiding citizens may and may not do/have. That is nonsensical. For example, the entire brady bill is not aimed at criminals...criminals are not going to fill out paperwork and wait for a background check. \n \n Gun control laws that DO have a crime control element are, IMO, good. For example, in KS if you are caught breaking and entering and have a firearm in your possession you get a much stiffer punishment. I think that Virginia has the ultimate crime control law when it comes to carrying a concealed weapon....it is illegal to do so with felonious intent. Clear, concise, to the point, and does not restrict the rights of law abiding citizens on the off chance that it MAY have some effect on criminals. \n \n AS far as felons with firearms go, I am a fence sitter on that issue. At one time this would have been a no brainer. Today, a LOT more things are felonies than used to be, and not all of them seem to be all that serious. In my state certain TRAFFIC offenses, or combinations of traffic offenses, are felonies (you don't even have to get a DUI). Frankly if we are going to turn things that were in the past misdemeanors or infractions into felonies, I do not think that we should restrict rights based on them.",

   "I'm going to get into the discussion because I disagree with a few things iangb has said.\n \n 1. \"Attacking someone is not defending yourself. Attacking someone is attack. A gun is an offensive weapon, not defensive - if you want to defend your home, buy a decent burglar alarm and/or surveillance equipment, or a safe room.\"\n \n I disagree. The right of self defense is often referred to as \"the first law of nature.\" It's has been recognized since time immemorial to be a legitimate reaction to an attack. The legal limit of that reaction may vary across jurisdictions, but it is typically limited by language similar to the following: \"the force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and no person may use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\"\n \n Firearms are merely one tool that may be used to defend yourself. They provide the weak with the means to resist the life-threatening attack of the strong. \n \n If a woman were being attacked in her kitchen by a knife wielding and much stronger man, and she killed him in self defense, would you praise or at least excuse her for saving her own life by stabbing him with a butcher knife taken from her drawer, but condemn her if she shot him with a handgun she kept in her purse?\n \n 2. \"but I would add in the extra condition that 'self defence' is not a valid reason for owning a gun. See the UK system of gun ownership.\"\n \n For the reasons above I would disagree with this statement. But to take it further, I do not believe I am required to provide a \"valid reason\" for the peaceful exercise of this right anymore than I must give a \"valid reason\" why I go to a non-state-sponsored church, speak my mind freely here, or buy a good book or newspaper. I have reasons, but unless and until the 9 headed Caesar decides that the RKBA is to be struck from my nation's charter (and that decision is due any day now) then I don't have to provide them before I get permission to exercise this right. \n \n 3. \"If a 'right' puts innocents at risk, it shouldn't be a 'right'.\"\n \n I disagree with this assertion. There are a number of people who have said similar things about the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, the right to remain silent, the right of habeas corpus, and the right of counsel. The question I have is how far would you carry your statement? If I were to use your statement as a justification for limiting these other rights, then how would you respond? \n \n But perhaps the better question is what right does anyone else have to demand that I surrender my firearms? \n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim\". Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\" Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).",

   "\"the force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and no person may use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\"\nI have no problem with this. What I do have, is the problem shown  here and here (all references to 'shoot them first'). This is the way that gun use seems to be taking America.\n \n \nFirearms are merely one tool that may be used to defend yourself. They provide the weak with the means to resist the life-threatening attack of the strong.\n\n Or provide the weak with an oppertunity to threaten and attack the strong. It works both ways. \n \n \nIf a woman were being attacked in her kitchen by a knife wielding and much stronger man, and she killed him in self defense, would you praise or at least excuse her for saving her own life by stabbing him with a butcher knife taken from her drawer, but condemn her if she shot him with a handgun she kept in her purse?\n\n I would excuse anyone for killing anyone in (what I would call) self defence - the heat of the moment. If the woman killed the man with a knife or a gun when there was no threat to her, I would condemn it. It's just easier to do this with a gun, and knives have legitimate purposes.\n I would be almost as dismayed to find that a woman was carrying around a kitchen knife in her purse as a gun.\n \n \n I have reasons, but unless and until the 9 headed Caesar decides that the RKBA is to be struck from my nation's charter (and that decision is due any day now) then I don't have to provide them before I get permission to exercise this right. \n\n Fair enough, but I am arguing to limit that right, so this doesn't much convince me. The main argument for the historical context of the right to bear arms is the means to form a millitia against an invading army - somewhat out of date, 250 years later.\n \n \nI disagree with this assertion. There are a number of people who have said similar things about the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, the right to remain silent, the right of habeas corpus, and the right of counsel. The question I have is how far would you carry your statement? If I were to use your statement as a justification for limiting these other rights, then how would you respond? \n\n Each and every case must be looked at on an individual basis - and for each case, you have to look at the consequences of taking away each 'right'. If the consequences are (in total) positive - as I believe a limit on firearms would be, then you have a justification for taking action.\n Simply quoting the constitution can not justify it - the only thing that this seems to be allowed for is 'holy' texts, on the basis that they are dictated by higher powers.\n \n \nBut perhaps the better question is what right does anyone else have to demand that I surrender my firearms? \nHeh, nice question. But again, it is based on the current constitution. Should guns be controlled, that would give people the right to demand that you surrender your weapons, just as the state currently demends that you hand over all terrorists, drugs and illegal material.\n \n \nWhat if you can't afford that? Let them invade your home? And the police won't be there instantly. It can be hours before they arrive. This gives the intruder plenty of time to take what they want and escape. \n\n I've mentioned elsewhere that, given that your home has been invaded, having the criminal take what they want and leave is one of the better possible outcomes.\n \n \nYour beloved table shows number of people killed, not number of people killing.\n\n I was using NoobDebator's assertation that \"for one victim there is one criminal\". To do otherwise throws his logic out the window either way.\n \n \nHow does that help if you don't have UK violent crime rates.\n\n I have shown you UK homicide rates, many times. The wikipedia table has gone from the page, but here is the government page on it.\n \"Contrary to public perception, the overall level of gun crime in England and Wales is very low - less than 0.5% of all crime recorded by the police.\"",

The main argument for the historical context of the right to bear arms is the means to form a millitia against an invading army - somewhat out of date, 250 years later.\n \n\n \n This is wrong on so many levels. It has been discussed in great detail in other areas of this forum, so it's not worth reposting again.\n \n \nI have no problem with this. What I do have, is the problem shown here and here (all references to 'shoot them first'). This is the way that gun use seems to be taking America.\n\n \n So when somebody breaks into your home, you have to wait for them to shoot you before you act? I think it's pretty safe to say a person breaking into your home is not there to bring you flowers and chocolates. The act of breaking and entering is in itself enough of an offense to warrant deadly force.\n \n \nOr provide the weak with an oppertunity to threaten and attack the strong. It works both ways. \n\n \n The difference is the weak people you are talking about in this case are criminals. They intend to break the law anyway, so all your gun control is going to do is disarm the law abiding citizens who have the right to defend themselves.\n \n \nI've mentioned elsewhere that, given that your home has been invaded, having the criminal take what they want and leave is one of the better possible outcomes.\n\n \n So you want a society where nobody stands up to criminals? Let's all just roll over and allow the criminals free reign on our homes and families. Do you think that's going to deter criminals more than an armed citizen?\n \n \nEach and every case must be looked at on an individual basis - and for each case, you have to look at the consequences of taking away each 'right'. If the consequences are (in total) positive - as I believe a limit on firearms would be, then you have a justification for taking action.\n Simply quoting the constitution can not justify it - the only thing that this seems to be allowed for is 'holy' texts, on the basis that they are dictated by higher powers.\n\n \n You have contradicted yourself here. First you say each and every case must be looked at on an individual basis. The very next sentence says we should look at the consequences in total, which is impossible if we follow what you said in the first sentence. What do you mean?\n \n The constitution was written when this country was created and is considered the overall law that governs the land.

Because two people in the world say that, then every single one of the million gun owners are jerks, eh?\n \n \nOr provide the weak with an oppertunity to threaten and attack the strong. It works both ways.\n\n \n So a skinny, ninety pound, 5'2 woman shouldn't be allowed to have a gun to defend herself against a 200 pound bodybuilding rapist? And would I just take a gun and pick a fight with the biggest guy I can find? Would the average gun owner do that?\n \n \nI would excuse anyone for killing anyone in (what I would call) self defence - the heat of the moment.

I guess us ordinary dirtbags just can't be trusted. A greedy, Jabba-the-Hutt tax collector who sits around all day fattening himself can be trusted, but a poor person who lives among murderers, thieves, and robbers isn't trustworthy no matter how good of a person he/she is. Typical greed. Your elites have the means to defend themselves, while you who are looked down on are simply untrustworthy. Also, what if they draw a gun on you? It's not hard to obtain guns illegally - any determined, intelligent person could do it. So what if they drew a gun at twenty feet? How fast could you close in on them? And anyhow, what would the ninety pound woman do against the rapist if she wasn't carrying a weapon? Should we all just walk around unarmed, and let ourselves become targets?\n \n \nFair enough, but I am arguing to limit that right, so this doesn't much convince me. The main argument for the historical context of the right to bear arms is the means to form a millitia against an invading army - somewhat out of date, 250 years later.\n\n \n Who are the militia members? Do you think there's supposed to be some official militia group or something? The militia members are citizens. If my town was invaded, armed citizens could assemble in main street and form a militia. Also, why don't we ban the right to free speech, freedom of the press, and hell, we don't need fair trials. After all, this stuff is out of date after 250 years. Your argument lacks some logic, as you might say. \n \n \nEach and every case must be looked at on an individual basis - and for each case, you have to look at the consequences of taking away each 'right'.

   "I'm sorry, iangb, I may have misunderstood what you meant when you said this: \n \n \"Attacking someone is not defending yourself. Attacking someone is attack. A gun is an offensive weapon, not defensive - if you want to defend your home, buy a decent burglar alarm and/or surveillance equipment, or a safe room.\"\n \n This appeared to me to be an argument that self defense cannot exist if a gun is used. Do you believe that a gun can never be used in self-defense? \n \n Now I would like to address a few of your responses to me in your most recent post:\n \n 1. \"What I do have, is the problem shown here and here (all references to 'shoot them first'). This is the way that gun use seems to be taking America.\"\n \n There may be a belief that defensive gun use in America is trending into some cartoonish Daffy Duck opinion of how to handle problems (\"Shoot him now! Shoot him now!\") But I would say as an American citizen and someone who is intimately familiar with crime, including gun crime, that there is no such trend, despite your citing two statements from fellow posters here. \n \n When my home state of Virginia streamlined and relaxed its CCW permit process about 15 years ago the consensus was many more Virginians would get permits and carry concealed. That belief was certainly born out. The alarmist cries of \"there will be blood\" have long since faded, however, and those who uttered them retired in silence when their prophecy of shootouts in stores and on the streets by untrained, ill-prepared, and trigger happy CCW permit holders proved false. These same prophets resurfaced in the more recent debate in Florida, where the law was changed granting greater authority to citizens to use firearms to defend themselves outside their homes. We saw similar alarmist claims that Florida would become the \"Gunshine State\" and we would see a spike in handgun violence by CCW permit holders in situations like \"shootings by enraged drivers at accident scenes.\" \n \n Where are all these false prophets today?\n \n 2. \"Or provide the weak with an oppertunity to threaten and attack the strong. It works both ways.\"  (and from our discussion of my \"woman with knife v. gun\" defense scenario) \"If the woman killed the man with a knife or a gun when there was no threat to her, I would condemn it.\"\n \n Absolutely. I agree with this completely. If a firearm is used to threaten/wound/kill outside of legitimate self-defense, then I think we can agree to call this a gun crime. This is how I choose to respond to any gun crime: \n \n I do not believe that we should blame the sword for the hand that wields it. What we should do instead is hold those who are a fault accountable-the person who chose to commit a wrongful act through an unjustifiable motive, be it anger, hatred, revenge, greed, etc. We should seek to hold accountable the person who knew right from wrong, who understood the nature and consequences of his actions, and who made a conscious choice to shoot someone and take their life without a shred of legitimate excuse or justification. This is how I respond to gun crime.\n \n You may agree or disagree. As I have not asked your opinion on this subject yet I do not know.\n \n What I do see from you is a desire to go further in response to gun crime and target peaceable citizens-men and women for whom their government cannot articulate even the slightest hint of suspicion or imputation of having committed an offense. The RKBA is a fundamental right, and I believe it will be a sad day when it becomes the general policy of my government to punish the innocent for the crimes of the guilty by depriving them of this right.\n \n 3. \"Fair enough, but I am arguing to limit that right, so this doesn't much convince me.\" \n \n I want to make sure then that I understand your position. Are you agreeing that what I call the RKBA is a \"right,\" or is it merely a custom or permitted practice? Regardless of whether it is a \"right\" or not, are you then advocating greater than present limits on the right as opposed to a total ban or private firearm ownership/possession?\n \n 4. \"The main argument for the historical context of the right to bear arms is the means to form a millitia against an invading army - somewhat out of date, 250 years later.\"\n \n I must respectfully yet completely disagree here. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest the main argument in favor of a militia system was that it was intended to protect my nation from external enemies. The Founders of my nation did not fight against an invading army. They fought against the standing army of their own government. The \"main argument\" for the militia system arose from a very real fear of a standing army and its use by a domestic tyrant as an instrument of his tyranny. The militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment is nothing more than a restatement of this important principle: \"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" (cite in link below). I defy anyone to show how this primary original intent has become less relevant with the passage of time.\n \n Before you respond, please read and also give me your thoughts on this:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=98925#post98925 \n \n 5. \"Simply quoting the constitution can not justify it - the only thing that this seems to be allowed for is 'holy' texts, on the basis that they are dictated by higher powers.\"\n \n Then I am ashamed to admit we have been going about it all wrong here for the last two centuries. Criminal suspects merely have to say \"I plead the fifth\" to avoid an interrogation. They are not required to justify why the 5th. Amendment says they have a right to remain silent, or why they feel it necessary to invoke this right. Homeowners can likewise freely deny officers permission to search their homes absent an authorizing search warrant, and motorists can freely refuse to consent to a search of their car absent the officer having probable cause to do so during a stop for speeding. In neither case are they required to justify to the officers involved why my Founders thought it important to include the 4th. Amendment in the BoR, nor are they required to justify/explain themselves further when the officer says \"If you don't have anything to hide then why not let me search....\"\n \n 6. \"Heh, nice question. But again, it is based on the current constitution. Should guns be controlled, that would give people the right to demand that you surrender your weapons, just as the state currently demends that you hand over all terrorists, drugs and illegal material.\"\n \n Again I want to be clear. Does this mean you believe the current interpretation of my Constitution recognizes an individual RKBA (which may or may not change this week with the pending gun case opinion)?\n \n Now assume that SCOTUS says the government can demand that I surrender my guns. Tell me how you justify that demand-tell me why you believe I cannot be trusted with a firearm. \n \n ---\n \n \"Nothing will make a nation so unconquerable as a militia, or every man's being trained to arms. . . . And if the generality of housekeepers were only half disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their liberties. . . .But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery. . . .The confidence, which a standing army gives a minister, puts him upon carrying things with a higher hand, than he would attempt to do, if the people were armed, and the court unarmed, that is, if there were no land-force in the nation, but a militia. Had we [ England ] at this time no standing army, we should not think of forcing money out of the pockets of three millions of our subjects. .[a long list of injustices suffered by the colonists is omitted here] . .There is no end to observations on the difference between the measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people.\" James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, pp. 390 and 475-76. ( London 1774).\n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.",

We have a HUGE (really...massive...EXPENSIVE) military for that. \n \n I have never found any historic evidence that protecting against a foreign invasion was a primary consideration when it came to the RKBA, or even of the militia system.
