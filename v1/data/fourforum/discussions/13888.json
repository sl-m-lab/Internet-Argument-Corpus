   "Uganda's Anglican Church Has Additions for the 'Kill the Gays' Bill\n \n \n Uganda's Anglican Church Has Additions for the 'Kill the Gays' Bill - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n The Anglican Archbishop of Uganda has offered his $.02 on the \"kill the gays\" bill. Some parts of it just aren't enough for him:\n \n Orombi\n \n Orombi added, '\"The Church of Uganda associates itself with the concerns expressed in the Anti Homosexuality Bill 2009,\" Archbishop Henry Orombi said in a Feb. 9 statement. \"However, instead of a completely new bill, the church recommends a bill that amends the Penal Code Act addressing loopholes, in particular: protecting the vulnerabilities of the boy child; proportionality in sentencing; and, ensuring that sexual orientation is excluded as a protected human right,\" said the archbishop.\n \n ...The ideal situation would be one where necessary amendment is made on existing legislation to also enumerate other sexual offences.' ... 'The church appreciates the bill's objective of protecting the family in the light of a growing propaganda to influence younger people to accept homosexuality ... to provide for marriage as contracted only between man and woman,' said the archbishop...\n \n Other proposals by the church include the prohibition of lesbianism and bestiality, together with 'other sexual perversion,' and a ban on the procurement of homosexual material and the promotion of homosexuality as a normal lifestyle. 'Homosexual practice has no place in God's design of creation, the continuation of the human race through procreation, or his plan for redemption. Even natural law reveals that the very act of sexual intercourse is an experience of embracing the sexual other,' said Orombi. At the same time, the church offered to counsel, heal and pray for people with, 'sexual disorientation' in schools and other institutions of learning.\"",
