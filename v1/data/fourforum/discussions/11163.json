   "When Bill Clinton came to Microsoft to give a speech, he was received warmly by a crowd who were impressed by his wisdom and his view of a better, more helpful and compassionate world. People naturally are drawn to and appreciate an intelligent, well-spoken person who can think on their feet. He touched on a lot of issues and he had a lot of great one-liners in dealing with world events such as \"Osama bin Laden likes technology just like the west likes technology. But bin Laden likes it exclusively and the west likes it inclusively\". While the crowd was left pondering this gem, Clinton would either throw out either another line of insight, or a line of wisdom or a line of encouragement. This left the group constantly intrigued and mentally stimulated. \n \n There was a question-and-answer period at the end of this speech and Clinton answered each with detail and precision. One woman asked if he could hold a Cabinet position in a Hillary presidency. Specifically, I believe she asked if he could be secretary of state. \n \n The former president said, \"That is a good question. The answer is no.\" And then he explained that a law was passed - I believe during the Lyndon Johnson administration - that said an immediate family member of the president can not be in the cabinet. This had something do to with Bobby Kennedy being in John Kennedy's Cabinet and a president can not or should not have to fire a family member. President Clinton went on to say that he thought that this was actually a very good idea. \n \n This makes me wonder because Hillary was in charge of revamping the Health Care system during Bill Clinton's presidency. But on the other hand, this really was not a position of power. \n \n (#1) A Hillary Clinton Presidency will not Mirror the Years of the Bill Clinton PresidencyThis leads me to the first reason why Hillary Clinton will not be the Democratic nominee for president. \n \n I always suspected that the only reason why many people liked Hillary Clinton was because of the run-off charisma from her husband. When I first noticed her surfacing as a candidate for president, I was at a loss as to why so many people liked her and they seemed to like her very much. I went to several liberal and progressive web forums. They seemed to be upset by my just asking the question as if I was questioning some divine prophecy. Trying to get into the heads and understanding how liberals think is often difficult. Ann Coulter might be wrong about a lot of things, but one thing I think she gets right is that Liberalism is like a church. You can not question the divine doctrine or those who are appointed the Pope of the Church of Liberalism - doing so will get you banished from the Progressive web forums. \n \n Regardless, without any other reason for supposing why people liked Hillary, I was left with only the name recognition and the face recognition and their subconscious appreciation of happier times. When all possible reasons are discounted, the only reason left, no matter how improbable, is the only possible explanation. \n \n My suspicions were confirmed by several people who would openly admit \"I miss Bill\" when I am talking about having a president Hillary. \n \n Well, it is time for me to officially burst this bubble. As Bill Clinton said himself, he can not be placed into any real position of power in a Hillary presidency. \n \n So now ask yourself this. If you could erase Bill Clinton from the picture - if you could remove the association between Bill and Hillary, would you still be excited about Hillary Clinton being president? \n \n You might tell yourself that since Hillary seemed to be a powerful player when Bill was president, it might work the other way. It would not. The two have very different personalities and ideologies and interpersonal skills and management styles. Bill is a charismatic intellectual while Hillary is a driven, ambitious and power-hungry leftist ideologue. Switch the seats of power and you have a very different administration and, as a result, a more troubling future for our country. \n \n Being the wife of Bill Clinton should not be a reason why you would want to support Hillary. A Hillary Clinton Presidency will not be any way like the Bill Clinton Presidency.",

And since you continue to bring him up as if I ever defended him, as you have defended Hillbilly, it needs to be pointed out that your hero knowingly did business with this embezzler. And then when the gig was exposed, she sold him out and conveniently covered her own butt. So no, I never defended him or supported him for PRESIDENT or any public office. Isn't it strange that you are still supporting the scumbag who was the other part of his scam? And still has a lawsuit pending against her for that debacle. \n \n Why is that antonia? Why would an honest and righteous woman like you are support and defend a candidate whom you know deals with known felons? Doesn't that seem a bit hypocritical to you antonia? I'll bet it doesn't at all, does it. There in lies our problem. you have a huge blind spot as you point to twigs in my eye, you can't even see the log in your own eye.\n \n And finally antonia, I don't HATE any supporters of Hillbilly, just as I don't HATE any of you neo marxist socialists who will be the downfall of this Country I love so much. But I do pity you all, and feel sorrow and compassion for the lack or moral center that that mindset represents in you. And believe it or not, neither do I judge or condemn your shallow World view. But since we are here, on a DEBATE FORUM WHERE OPINIONS ARE SOUGHT; It seems only right that I give my honest opinions here. If that reality is too much for you to bear, then maybe this forum isn't the place for you.

While refering to an individual who bamboozled Warren Burger, U.S. customs officials, and the Brazilian government, not to mention all the investors who were ripped off? You are one sick dude. Don't you think it's hypocritical that you single out the candidate whose positions you don't agree with, and use her contact with him, and when many people had contact, to smear her character along her husband's? Or anyone who says anything on their behalf?\n \n I think you simply use character assault on anyone who disagrees with your religious extremist and anti-Constitutional agenda for America, Archangel. Because your arguments, as far as logic, evidence, law, and ethics are concerned, are zilch. You have nothing else but character assault, your low-down dirty trick.\n \n I repeatedly see you do this to me, and to many other persons on this board whose positions on issues you disagree with. So the fact that you do it as well with a Democratic candidate for political office, and even more mean-spiritedly, is no surprise.\n \n The one whose character appears flawed, AA, is yourself.\n \n This is the end of our contact on this board, fellow.

Here's a brush up on some recent history that's only 4 years old. How soon we forget Jo.\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/tst042204a.cfm\n \n Here we see that the UN in general is implicated as part of the scam which is why it went on for so long. Here's an excerpt:\n  \n There is mounting evidence that the United Nations Oil for Food program, originally conceived as a means of providing humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people, was subverted by Saddam Hussein's regime and manipulated to help prop up the Iraqi dictator. Saddam's dictatorship was able to siphon off an estimated ten billion dollars from the Oil for Food program through oil smuggling and systematic thievery, by demanding illegal payments from companies buying Iraqi oil and through kickbacks from those selling goods to Iraq, all under the noses of UN bureaucrats. The UN staff administering the program are accused of gross incompetence, mismanagement, and possible complicity in allowing the Iraqi regime to perpetrate the biggest scandal in UN history. \n And here we see Kofi was part of the scam and profited greatly from it with no negative repercussions at all. Here's the link and an excerpt:\n \n http://mideastoutpost.com/archives/000024.html\n The list, found in Iraq's Oil Ministry, was first cited by an Iraqi\n newspaper, al Mada, at the end of January.\n \n Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office estimates that Saddam Hussein\n skimmed as much as $10.1 billion from the $47 billion program - originally\n established in 1996 to buy humanitarian supplies for ordinary Iraqis.\n \n Among those expected to be named are the head of the U.N. program, the\n Russian Communist Party, the PLO and \"a French businessman close to\n President Jacques Chirac.\"\n \n This, of course, may help explain Chirac's implacable opposition to the\n dispossession of Saddam a year ago.\n \n And Kofi Annan's longtime pro-Saddam bent, as well.\n \n As Andrew Apostolou notes on the preceeding page, Annan's immortal words -\n \"I think I can do business\" with Saddam - take on an entirely new meaning.\n \n This much is clear: Saddam was able to turn the program into a mystery-\n shrouded tool for sanctions-busting, bribery and international\n influence-peddling.\n \n The fog began to clear in February after the name of Benon Sevan - the\n U.N.-appointed executive director of the Oil-for-Food program - appeared on\n the al Mada list.\n \n According to al Mada, individuals, corporations and political parties on the\n list received cash-convertible oil vouchers from Saddam.\n \n Sevan apparently was given vouchers for at least 11 million barrels of oil,\n worth some $3.5 billion. No wonder the program he ran:\n \n * Knowingly collaborated with Saddam's massive violations of the U.N.'s own\n sanctions.\n \n * Said and did nothing about the Saddam regime's use of Oil-for-Food income\n to build presidential palaces.\n \n * Ignored huge kickbacks, thereby making itself complicit in Saddam's\n bribery of foreign leaders, opinion-makers and companies.\n \n * Permitted the regime to cheat Kurds in northern Iraq of billions - money,\n by the way, that is still unaccounted for.\n \n This much, too, is clear: The vast profits for foreign companies made\n possible by abuses of the Oil-for-Food program helped buy foreign support\n for the Baghdad regime.\n \n Saddam made a point of throwing Oil-for-Food business and oil-voucher bribes\n at contractors from key countries, especially those with vetoes on the\n Security Council, like France and Russia:\n \n * Forty-six recipients of illegal allocations of oil were Russian companies\n or individuals - many with links to President Vladimir Putin.\n \n * French interests were so deeply involved in corrupt Oil-for-Food dealings\n that France opposed the ending of sanctions even after Saddam had fallen.\n \n And the scheme seems to have worked: France, Russia and Germany were all\n hostile to military action to overthrow Saddam Hussein.\n \n Is it any wonder that Russia and France now oppose independent inquiries\n into the scam, although Secretary General Kofi Annan - under extreme\n pressure - has nominally agreed to the idea?\n \n The Iraqi Governing Council has been probing the scam since al Mada first\n revealed it. The audit, prepared for the council by KPMG and the law firm\n Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer, is due in May.\n \n Complicating the effort, however, is the refusal of the BNP Paribas Bank of\n France to make available critical Oil-for-Food program records.\n \n And U.N. officials in New York have declined to send necessary statements\n for months.\n \n Yes, the U.N. says an \"internal inquiry\" is under way.\n \n But, given that Kofi Annan's son Kojo is linked to the scandal, it's not\n hard to imagine how hard that effort will be pressed.\n \n And though the elder Annan has admitted to the need for an outside inquiry,\n there's no reason to believe that he - or anyone else at the U.N. - will be\n even slightly helpful when it counts.\n \n Remember, folks as high-ranking as the president of Indonesia, former French\n Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and pro-Saddam British politician George\n Galloway are implicated.\n \n These are, after all, people with substantial influence at Turtle Bay.\n \n And there are others - many others - who are similarly situated.\n \n Plus, it has now become undeniable that the folks Kofi Annan had running the\n program were fully aware of the graft they were enabling.\n \n Indeed, for Kofi Annan to say - as he did last week - that he was agreeing\n to an investigation \"because I don't think we need to have our reputation\n impugned\" is simply laughable.\n \n His own son is part of it.\n So your protests about legal standing ring very hollow Jo, when it is found that the very, allegedly peace loving, non violent, anti war proponents who fought so hard to prevent our dismantling of the Saddam Regime, the very people and Governments like Russia, France, Germany and men like Kofi Anon himself whom you credited with having the wisdom to seek peace over War, were in fact being paid off and were aiding in leading to the deaths of millions of innocent Iraqi's through starvation and disease because the foods and medicines that were supposed to be traded for Oil for them was in fact being converted to dollars and going into their Swiss Bank Accounts. It was greed and personal self interest that motivated these people Jo, not humanitarian concern for the defenseless people of Iraq at all.\n \n And yet you still claim that those who cried out that the war was wrong were motivated by righteous intentions. And that we, the coalition are the war criminals.",

Here's the link and an excerpt:\n \n http://mideastoutpost.com/archives/000024.html\n The list, found in Iraq's Oil Ministry, was first cited by an Iraqi\n newspaper, al Mada, at the end of January.\n \n Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office estimates that Saddam Hussein\n skimmed as much as $10.1 billion from the $47 billion program - originally\n established in 1996 to buy humanitarian supplies for ordinary Iraqis.\n \n Among those expected to be named are the head of the U.N. program, the\n Russian Communist Party, the PLO and \"a French businessman close to\n President Jacques Chirac.\"\n \n This, of course, may help explain Chirac's implacable opposition to the\n dispossession of Saddam a year ago.\n \n And Kofi Annan's longtime pro-Saddam bent, as well.\n \n As Andrew Apostolou notes on the preceeding page, Annan's immortal words -\n \"I think I can do business\" with Saddam - take on an entirely new meaning.\n \n This much is clear: Saddam was able to turn the program into a mystery-\n shrouded tool for sanctions-busting, bribery and international\n influence-peddling.\n \n The fog began to clear in February after the name of Benon Sevan - the\n U.N.-appointed executive director of the Oil-for-Food program - appeared on\n the al Mada list.\n \n According to al Mada, individuals, corporations and political parties on the\n list received cash-convertible oil vouchers from Saddam.\n \n Sevan apparently was given vouchers for at least 11 million barrels of oil,\n worth some $3.5 billion. No wonder the program he ran:\n \n * Knowingly collaborated with Saddam's massive violations of the U.N.'s own\n sanctions.\n \n * Said and did nothing about the Saddam regime's use of Oil-for-Food income\n to build presidential palaces.\n \n * Ignored huge kickbacks, thereby making itself complicit in Saddam's\n bribery of foreign leaders, opinion-makers and companies.\n \n * Permitted the regime to cheat Kurds in northern Iraq of billions - money,\n by the way, that is still unaccounted for.\n \n This much, too, is clear: The vast profits for foreign companies made\n possible by abuses of the Oil-for-Food program helped buy foreign support\n for the Baghdad regime.\n \n Saddam made a point of throwing Oil-for-Food business and oil-voucher bribes\n at contractors from key countries, especially those with vetoes on the\n Security Council, like France and Russia:\n \n * Forty-six recipients of illegal allocations of oil were Russian companies\n or individuals - many with links to President Vladimir Putin.\n \n * French interests were so deeply involved in corrupt Oil-for-Food dealings\n that France opposed the ending of sanctions even after Saddam had fallen.\n \n And the scheme seems to have worked: France, Russia and Germany were all\n hostile to military action to overthrow Saddam Hussein.\n \n Is it any wonder that Russia and France now oppose independent inquiries\n into the scam, although Secretary General Kofi Annan - under extreme\n pressure - has nominally agreed to the idea?\n \n The Iraqi Governing Council has been probing the scam since al Mada first\n revealed it. The audit, prepared for the council by KPMG and the law firm\n Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer, is due in May.\n \n Complicating the effort, however, is the refusal of the BNP Paribas Bank of\n France to make available critical Oil-for-Food program records.\n \n And U.N. officials in New York have declined to send necessary statements\n for months.\n \n Yes, the U.N. says an \"internal inquiry\" is under way.\n \n But, given that Kofi Annan's son Kojo is linked to the scandal, it's not\n hard to imagine how hard that effort will be pressed.\n \n And though the elder Annan has admitted to the need for an outside inquiry,\n there's no reason to believe that he - or anyone else at the U.N. - will be\n even slightly helpful when it counts.\n \n Remember, folks as high-ranking as the president of Indonesia, former French\n Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and pro-Saddam British politician George\n Galloway are implicated.\n \n These are, after all, people with substantial influence at Turtle Bay.\n \n And there are others - many others - who are similarly situated.\n \n Plus, it has now become undeniable that the folks Kofi Annan had running the\n program were fully aware of the graft they were enabling.\n \n Indeed, for Kofi Annan to say - as he did last week - that he was agreeing\n to an investigation \"because I don't think we need to have our reputation\n impugned\" is simply laughable.\n \n His own son is part of it.\n So your protests about legal standing ring very hollow Jo, when it is found that the very, allegedly peace loving, non violent, anti war proponents who fought so hard to prevent our dismantling of the Saddam Regime, the very people and Governments like Russia, France, Germany and men like Kofi Anon himself whom you credited with having the wisdom to seek peace over War, were in fact being paid off and were aiding in leading to the deaths of millions of innocent Iraqi's through starvation and disease because the foods and medicines that were supposed to be traded for Oil for them was in fact being converted to dollars and going into their Swiss Bank Accounts. It was greed and personal self interest that motivated these people Jo, not humanitarian concern for the defenseless people of Iraq at all.\n \n And yet you still claim that those who cried out that the war was wrong were motivated by righteous intentions. And that we, the coalition are the war criminals.\n\n \n So a document is \"found\" that mysteriously implicates pretty well all opponents of US policy. What a surprise emoticon_cool I'm pretty sure the George Galloway connection (odious little turd that he is) has been refuted. Also, nothing in the article you pasted says Kofi Annan was actually involved.",

   "???\n \n He said take care of their 'own people'.\n You mistakenly extrapolate that to be invade other people's nations.\n\n \n Actually he said handle. Furthermore, I mentioned African dictators who the first is currently being prosecuted to be included and Bassman giving a resounding answer that they shouldn't be prosecuted, he must therefore think that dictators who invade other nations shouldn't fall under the jurisdiction. Charles Taylor. God knows how many people his soldiers killed in other nations. \n \n \nAnd FYI, no one did much of anything against Hitler until they felt htey had too...due to their alliance agreements cf Poland\n\n \n I'm just seeing how logical bassman's beliefs are. If history tells me anything, they are as solid as swiss cheese that's been in the company of sewer rats.",

By running on her record of long public service, and not focusing that she, herself, was a newly elected public official, she set herself up to be the establishment candidate that Obama could run against.",
