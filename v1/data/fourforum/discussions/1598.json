   "The purpose of Must read Books on Gun Law for Gun Owners,\n is NOT to spam anyone, it is intended for ANYONE that ALREADY HAS OR IS CONSIDERING purchasing any kind of gun for \"Home Protection\" purposes.\n \n Below iHere's a post from a typical legal gun owner and a walking disaster to himself, his family, and other people, just waiting to happen, and the reason why I created this thread. S/he is likely to spend 15 to 20 years on Voluntary Manslaughter or a Murder in the 2nd Degree Charge, if s/he uses his/her gun for \"Home Defense\", and I am NOT exaggerating. \n \n If you think anything like the person that posted the message below, this thread is for you:\n \n \n\n I use firearms for personal protection under my natural right to preserve my life any way that is available to me. In a life and death struggle against a felon. I will not play fair. I will use the maxium amount of violence I can muster to save my life. ... Too bad if a felon enters my house. To the Americans here, if you have a gun in the house, do you reach for the gun or go after a baseball bat in a life and death struggle against a home invader? Yes I have the right to use any means necessary at hand to protect my life. The idea that if I have a gun under the 2nd Amendment and I am attacked in my home, that I have to put my gun down and find another weapon is laughable.\n\n \n The next post I make will have ONE BOOK (VERY inexpensive), AND VERY Short. That book, above ALL OTHERS, is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ BOOK, to give you JUST A CLUE, about the disaster that you as a legal gun owner can inflict on yourself, and your family. A brief description of that book will be in the next post. \n \n Subsequent posts will contain some other books I highly recommend, and will fill you in on why you are that disaster waiting to happen, if you don't know your own State's Gun Laws, or are thinking like the person that posted the message above.\n \n Note: THE MOST IMPORTANT Gun Laws to read are those for YOUR SPECIFIC STATE! They are posted on the Web! HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM...State Laws on the subject of self-defense and guns are VERY DIFFICULT for a layman to understand. Commonly used words, and known terms that are in the State Laws WILL HAVE a VERY different meaning than you, as a layman will expect!\n To REALLY understand your State Laws, you will have to do a substancial amount of reading, BEFORE you even attempt to read your State Laws. \n \n Note that State Laws can and do differ greatly. They certainly vary enough to make or break a case for self-defense, and the result can get you 10, 15, or 20 years in prison, not to mention ruin you financially. \n \n Note: IF YOU LIVE IN New Jersey... PM Me!!! \n There is a book that is SPECIFIC to New Jersey Law, written by a lawyer specializing in N.J Gun Law that is a MUST READ book above ALL other books! PM me for the name of that book, and info on it.\n \n I spent about 180 hours reading a variety of books on Gun Laws and \n Self-Defense Laws, after which it took me an entire WEEK to get a reasonably clear understanding of exactly what my own State Laws are and what they would mean in a Court, as opposed to what a layman might expect that they mean. There is a HUGE difference, between the two interpretations, and NO short and quick way to really understand your own State's Gun and Self-Defense Laws.",

   "Title: \"The Law of Self-Defense: A Guide for the Armed Citizen\"\n Author: Andrew F. Branca, Attorney at Law\n ISBN: 0-9665119-1-3\n The book is 227 pages, and is very well written and highly understandable.\n \n I bought this book in a book store. However, if your bookstore is unable to order it, the book can be ordered directly from the Publisher, which also has\n a Web Site, E-Mail Address, and Phone Number in the book:\n Web Site: www.op-sec.com\n E-Mail: op-sec@op-sec.com\n Phone # (in the U.S.): (617) 838-1438\n If ordering fromthe publisher the book is $15 + $4.95 shipping/handling\n (Prices may have changed, since the book was published, but that's what it says inside the book).\n \n About the book:\n \n 1) The Author defines and explains a number of Legal Issues for a gun owner that intends to keep a gun for home defense purposes.\n \n 2) The Author compares a number of different State's Laws with regard to these issues, to give you an idea of the variation in the laws, and to help clarify what the laws mean.\n \n 3) The Author compares Judicial Decisions involving a number of cases concerning, both: the legal issues a gun owner must be aware of, and cases involving judgements permitting, denying, and involving a plea of Self-Defense.\n \n An example of only A FEW Chapter's Titles (that I've abreviated) are:\n \"Standards/Burdens of Proof\"\n \"Reasonable/Prudent Person\"\n \"The Criminal Charge\"\n \"The Defense of Self-Defense\"\n \n Final comments: This is a great book to clue you into the difficulties with understanding your own State's Laws concerning Self-Defense and Issues you MINIMALLY need to be aware of. The book does NOT give you any clue as to a highly experienced gun owner's advice, or very important experiences,\n and things you need to know about that are MORE INCLUSIVE than JUST your own case for Self-Defense. (Books in subsequent posts from me, will do that.) This book is a must read for all gun owners.",

   "This Advice, Experiences & Situations From Gun Experts post is intended to give you the words of people that are VERY WELL KNOWN as Professionals in \n the Self-Defense Industry with Guns. The author's have trained Cops, or were formerly Cops, and are known to anyone that knows anything about guns and/or suing them for self-defense. The author's run premier training schools, way too expensive for me to even consider. \n \n I will recommend just 3 books by 2 authors. The books are all quick reads, well written, and don't require nearly as much thought as the #1 book oon Legal Issues that I recommended.\n \n Note: Massad F. Ayoob has his own Web Site. Use a major search engine to find his site, I can't recall it. I think that I ordered at least 1 of his books via his Web Site.\n \n Title: \"In the Gravest Extreme\"\n Author: Massad F. Ayoob\n ISBN: 0-936297-00-1\n Pages: 130\n Cost: $11.95\n \n A bookstore should be able to order it, but if not, it is available from:\n Police Bookshelf\n P.O.

   "Thanks for the information. I heard from a lawyer that if you shoot someone in self defense that most likely you will be prosecuted. I also remember learning in school that you're not allowed to shoot an attacker that is armed only with a knife. You may only shoot an attacker that is armed with a weapon of equal destructiveness. Is this true?\n \n You could have your gun confiscated and be charged with assault with a deadly weapon if you point your gun at somebody. That's what happened to Linda Hamilton who pointed her gun at a truck driver.

The gun must be held at a specifc angle to be dangerous. The knife does not. The average American male can be hit with a leathal shot and still live long enough to kill the person that shot him from 21 feet away. 21 feet is the distance police officers train to kill a man with a knife.\n \n Of course you can shoot a person with a knife if they threaten deadly force. The police do it all the time. The police are no different that a common man with rights.\n \n Yes I also guarantee you will go to trial. That is part of due process. You will be called upon to prove that you did not violate the rights of the attacker in defense of your right to live. The police officer who shoots a man in self-defense will do the same.\n \n Did someone bring up guns and toilets? Yes it is true.

She thought that the truck driver was following her too closely. \n http://www.sierratimes.com/archive/starticles/2001/feb/artt020101.htm\n\n \n Some excellent questions here, Tim. \n \n First, I have to say straight out that I'm not a lawyer, so none of this is legal advice, it is my opinion, based on my studying, which is far more limited than an Attorney specializing in Gun would do. That said. I'll give you my opinion and my thoughts.\n \n If you shoot someone, EVEN if you did it in self-defense. Expect to go to jail.\n \n That does not mean that you will be prosecuted. It depends upon the opinion of the D.A. which of course is influenced by the detectives assigned to the case, and if someone is killed, the Coroner as well.\n \n Even if you shot someone in an undeniably justified circumstance of \n self-defense, expect to go to jail, AND the VERY likely possibility that you will be prosecuted by the State, if they D.A. believes that there is ANYTHING that compimises a Self-Defense case.\n \n BTW. There are 2 different types of Self-Defense pleas. One is called Perfect, the other is called Imperfect, if I remember correctly. They are stated in State Laws of my State New Jersey. They may or may not apply in your State. You would need to look up your own State's law that is available on the Web.\n \n As to what you need to show for a Self-Defense case...this is documented in general in the books I mentioned, and may also be documented in your State Law, but the wording may be very confusing to a layman, or misunderstood to mean something that a layman would think, but not an Attorney.\n \n You mentioned remember hearing in school that you are not permitted to shoot someone with a knife. That statement, as is, taken in all cases, is absolutely untrue.\n \n A knife is a deadly weapon, and any deadly weapon could in specific cercumstances allow for a person with a gun to shoot them.\n \n BTW. The idea of a deadly weapon can is something that HAS BEEN and can be challenged on a case by case basis. A case was made that I read about, in which some object was claimed to be a deadly weapon, by the gun owner that shot the person who was going to use it. The judge found that, that object was NOT a deadly weapon, and the gun owner's self-defense plea was not permitted. I forgot what the object in question was.\n \n Getting back to shooting someone that has a knife.\n \n This is extremely tricky as are all self-defense situations. The gun owner must show that he was in immiment danger of loss of life (in my state loss of\n a sense or organ is included. For example, loss of sight.). The gun owner must show that the person attacking them had the opportunity to use that deadly weapon. So, for someone with a knife, being 30 feet away from you, unless they were an expert knife thrower, and you knew that for a fact, there would be no opportunity at a distance of 30 feet. And there's a 3rd requirement, as well. On top of all of that, there is something called a Retreat \n Rule, that in some States, applies unconditionally in your house when you can do it without getting killed while doing it. And these Retreat Rules can also vary by State, in your home, depending upon if you were the aggressor. For example, in some States, if you punched the guy in your house and he pulled a knife, you MUST do everything possible to Retreat, EVEN in your own house!\n \n This principle of the aggressor, as well as, using reasonable force to deter an attack in your house applies to the case of a person pointing a gun at a person that is not posing a deadly threat in an immenent way upon you, and does not have the opportunity to use that deadly threat, and as I mentioned there is that 3rd thing. Which I am not bothering to look up.\n \n Let's put it this way. A case for self-defense against soemone with a knife that could be made would probably be if you were (for example) in your bedroom, the unknown intruder walked in with a knife, the intruder was able to use that knife to harm you. In other words, a 3 year old with a knife is not a threat to an adult. The guy would have to be within reach of you to use that knife!!! And that's where the situation of gun owner's getting themselves into trouble can happen, because many gun owners would not wait for that moment, and shoot an intruder with a knife while the guy was 10 feet away.\n 10 feet away aint good enough your life is not in immement danger at a dsitance of 10 feet! The knife has got to be able to reach you!\n \n BTW. There is also the legal concept of Incidents. And what might be thought of as an entire incidident by a layman is NOT necessarily thought of that way by the law! You may initally not be the aggressor, but a few seconds later the law may have considered a particular incident to have ended, and a new incident to have begun, which you could be considered an aggressor! This stuff is explained ini the books I recommended. You need to understand these things about Retreat Laws, Incidents, the Aggressor, the 3 Things that must be present for a self-defense case in a shooting, and more, including your own State's specific Laws, to know if there is a Retreat Law in your house, and all the rest of it. \n \n It's a really bad situation. Very tricky. I REALLY recommend that you read the 1st 2 books in my 2nd post if you want a few examples.\n \n The book in my 1st post will give you a good comparison between State Laws, and explain the 3 basic things that can permit you to shoot someone, IN a case of self-defense in GENERAL.\n \n BTW. I think that I am recalling that a case for an Imperfect Self-Defense could under the specific conditions that are required for self-defense, be made if YOU were the Aggressor, but could not Retreat, or DID Retreat, and the guy came after you, and all the other things that qualify for a self-defense case exist.\n \n The books I've recommended are ALL quick reads! They are VERY interesting books and they will give you a great idea of HOW DIFFICULT it is for a legal gun owner to be able to claim a self-defense plea. Much more information, scenarios, and advice is given in the first 3 books I recommended. Someone asking these quesions should read those books, and then AFTER that locate your own State laws, and look up the Laws about Self-Defense, and also the Laws about using a Gun to protect yourself or your family. These Laws are in DIFFERENT locations in State Laws, as one has to do with guns, and the other has to do with the various Pleas that you can make and things you can be convicted of.\n \n The last statement about shooting an attacker that himself has a deadly weapon involves what is a deadly weapon, and can they actually use it against you at the momonet you shot them. They have to be within reach, if it is a knife, or striking weapon. AND Again, in some States, there is a Retreat Law inside the home, you need to understand if you are the Aggressor, and various other conditions must also be met.\n \n The entire subject is EXTREMELY difficult to answer. I can tell you this...\n \n If I am in my bed, and an intruder has broken in and I am still in my bed, and the intruder walks up to me with a knife and is shouting that he's gonna kill me... If I have a gun nearby, (which I do) I will make sure that as soon as that knife as raised an he can touch me, or leap at me with it, that he will be taken care of.\n \n A Self-Defense case is VERY DIFFICULT! I COULD LOOSE a case that was brought against me in that scenario, if he had not drawn blood, or had no motive, or was a leap away, or had not exhibited some material signs of being totally crazy by smashing things....\n \n It is VERY tricky and even in the best of circumstances, it can be very difficult to make a case for self-defense. If the guy has a gun, your best case, is when the guy has shot at you. Because there are bullet holes to prove something. If the guy had a knife, swung at you and missed and the knife went into a wall, that would help, or a guy with a bat that's swinging it at your head and the bat missed and tore apart some of the wall, or smashed something.\n \n Note, that even a bat MAY not be considered a deadly weapon, depending upon the circumstances. For example, if a robber ties you up and breaks both your legs with a bat, your life is still not in immement danger if he walked away. In fact, someone could kick the XXXX out of you in your own home with their fists, and unless they are a huge person, or pro-boxer, your whole face could be all bloody, but unless you can show that your eyes were going to be destroyed by the next blow, you sure as XXXX better not even point a gun at that person!!!\n \n That is an example of the problem that gun owners can get into.\n \n 3 guys kicked the XXXX out of a 70 year old man in a nearby town. The old man had an unregistered very old gun. He killed one of them and HE went to jail for murder, even though the 3 guys broke into his house and were kicking the XXXX out of him.\n \n Your life literally needs to be in immement danger (in my State and in many others, there are inclusions for such things as the loss of a sense, or organ, and other things, all of which varies State by State.)\n \n BTW. 1 thing you may or may not know. Rape is considered a crime in which a gun can be used and self-defense, or defense of a family member is considered as a valid plea for a Perfect Sefl-Defense case. In other words, if you come home and find that your wife is being forcibly raped. You CAN JUST shoot the guy during a forcible rape, without ANY other of these tricky things coming into play.\n \n Again, this is all my opinion. NOT legal advice, because I'm not a lawyer.",
