   "I forgot who it was, but someone asked how this has anything to do with the evolution/creation debate.\n \n See the problem is, science assumes that in order for information to get from one place to the next that it must be transferred from one place to the next. They assume that animals are not intelligent, but that the information from the environment must be \"transferred\" to each animal (by way of selection). Likewise, they assume that the galaxys and all of space and time and matter are not intelligent, that information must be transferred by some materialist mechanism. But is this necessarily the case?\n \n Play like you're back in school -- let's say 3rd grade -- and the teacher asks \"Ok, class, who knows what 2 + 2 equals?\" Suddenly 10 hands go up in the air at the same time followed by \"Me!\" \"Me!\" \"Me!\" So what we have is a situation where several kids in the class all \"know\" at the same time what the answer is. There is no \"transfer\" of information....yet every student has the answer!\n \n The way I see it, the same could be argued for life, and the universe as a whole. About a month ago or so I posted a link about the brain where researchers were baffled to learn that different areas of the brain fired simultaneously to create a single thought or to accomplish a single function...(sorry, don't have the link.) So, once again, there is no need for information to be \"transferred\"......it just sorta happens at different places at the same time by way of unexplained phenomenon. Therefore, we can assume that \"life\" must be some sort of flow of energy or \"process\" rather than a thing or group of things, which materialists assert. And it's this concept of a \"process\" which validates the idea that life is an organized \"whole\" and not an accumulation of independently-acting parts. And this \"whole\" is wide open to the environment and able to realize its full potential by reading, interpreting, and acting upon external signals. \n \n And so it must be with the universe as a whole. Materialists try to make the argument that information cannot be transferred faster than the speed of light. But that might be a strawman because one galaxy in the universe may be open to the environment and be able to interpret the same signals (and respond accordingly) as another galaxy 10 gazillion lightyears away. Maybe, just maybe, upon God's command, all the hands of the galaxys, just like 3rd graders, went up in the air at the same time and came up with the same answer. Maybe that's how all the galaxys formed those cute little spirals and how they spread out so evenly across the universe, no matter how far out you look, which would infer that they all formed at the same time from the same signals. \n \n This of course, is the same argument, just on a different level as the creation/evolution argument. It's all about the philosophy of life and what exactly makes life (and the universe as a whole) what it is. Creationists/IDists say each creature is creative and intelligent -- that information does not have to be transferred to them because each individual has the potential to create his own information -- and thus, his own destiny. I would also argue that the universe at large is no different.\n \n Of course, this would require that the universe, including all of space and time and matter has wisdom. But that's such a dumb idea -- no one could possibly believe that. \n \n http://www.geraldschroeder.com/new.html\n \n A single consciousness, a universal wisdom, pervades the universe. And more than that. The discoveries of science, those that search the quantum nature of subatomic matter, have moved us to the brink of a startling realization: all existence is the expression of this wisdom. In the laboratories we experience it as information that first physically articulated as energy and then condensed into the form of matter. Every particle, every being, from atom to human, appears to represent a level of information, of wisdom. The puzzle we will confront in this book as we study the behavior of the atomic building blocks of all matter and then the functioning of biological cells is from where does this information arise? There is no hint of it in the laws of nature that govern the interactions among the basic particles that comprise all matter. It just appears as a given, with no causal agent evident, as if it is an intrinsic facet of nature.",

Maybe you could search for the link, because nothing you say here would seem to indicate that there was no transfer of information....only that different parts of the brain work simultaneously to solve problems and accomplish a single function. That in and of itself does not preclude information being transferred prior to those part of the brain engaging. \n \n \nAnd so it must be with the universe as a whole. Materialists try to make the argument that information cannot be transferred faster than the speed of light.

In order to be correct, it would need to be more like:\n \n \"Information being conveyed in the form of matter cannot travel faster than the speed of light through normal, 4 dimensional spacetime\"\n \n We can change the state of sub atomic particles over a distance instantly...no travel time at all. Not only is there no travel time at all, we cannot find any indication that anything at all traveled between the 2 points. This means that either the information was not conveyed as matter, or that it did not travel through normal, 4 dimensional spacetime. \n \n This would make an interesting thread in and of itself if anybody is interested...preferably not somebody who uses the term \"gazillion\". \n \n And galaxies are not spread out evenly across the universe. You can see this with a $200 telescope from wal mart. They collide and interact with each other fairly frequently. In a few billion years, our own galaxy is going to collide with Andromeda. Right now the Spitzer telescope is watching FOUR galaxies collide. If they were spread evenly over the universe, this would not happen. \n \n \nThis of course, is the same argument, just on a different level as the creation/evolution argument.

A whole string of information transfers JUST on the surface. \n\n \n I agree it's not a perfect example, but the concept that different 3rd graders all know the right answer at the same time and that different particles all know how to act at the same time is what I'm getting at. A 3rd grader would not need to be taught that a bee sting hurts, that \"knowledge\" is already there. The concept of where the information came from, or how it arose, is not important....simply that it's there. I'm simply saying the same for all the particles in the universe. Like Dr. Schroeder says, there is a prevailing wisdom throughout the universe -- I'm just saying this wisdom does away with the need for materialist mechanisms. \n \n \n \n \n \n This also does not make sense. Maybe you could search for the link, because nothing you say here would seem to indicate that there was no transfer of information....only that different parts of the brain work simultaneously to solve problems and accomplish a single function. That in and of itself does not preclude information being transferred prior to those part of the brain engaging. \n\n \n how could there be a transfer if different areas of the brain respond simultaneously? There may be a transfer between the source and the different areas, but not between the two areas themselves.....simple logic would that different areas of the brain could not transfer information, yet respond at the same moment in time.\n \n \n \n \n \n You certainly seem to be trying to create your own set of facts here. Is that what you mean by \"creating his own information\"?  \n\n \n \n well that was probably the wrong word to use because the information is already there. What I should have said is that each creature is able to be creative. There are two ways of looking at biology...either way environmental information must be transferred. In the IDist's eyes, the environmental information is transferred directly to each organism by way of the organism \"sensing\" or \"perceiving\" the environment and then responding accordingly. The Darwinist says selection fits the organism into its environment, thus making the population adapted.\n \n But it's the concept that each animal can respond to the same environmental cues that undermines darwinists' populational adaptation. Adaptation requires information to be passed on by way of materialist mechanisms, while the IDist says information already exists within, ultimately enabling the organism to create its own destiny.",

Like Dr. Schroeder says, there is a prevailing wisdom throughout the universe -- I'm just saying this wisdom does away with the need for materialist mechanisms. \n \n\n \n Even that example does not work. IF a 3rd grader knows that a bee sting hurts, it is becuase they have been stung before...or because somebody has told them it would hurt...or because they have been cut or had their skin broken before and they are able to theroize that havinga bees stinger jabbed in them would be painful because they relate it to the earlier experience. \n \n You obviously do not have children.

There may be a transfer between the source and the different areas, but not between the two areas themselves.....simple logic would that different areas of the brain could not transfer information, yet respond at the same moment in time.\n\n \n First, it is virutally impossible to measure an electrical pulse in varios areas of the brain and establish if they are truly responding simultaneously and I SERIOUSLY doubt somebody with a biology background would even know where to start. You are literally talking about about measure the trasnfer of an electrical charge...which happens at nearly the speed of light, across a meaduim where we have not direct contact with that charge. I am not going to say it is impossible, but it would probably be impossible to do so without killing the patient. There is certainly no medical aparatus in existance that could do it. That is why I siad we would need to see the article to draw any kind of inference. I can tell you without a doubt that your interpetation of it is WRONG. If it was correct, it would have sent MASSIVE waves through the physics world because the results would without question mean that there are quantum processes taking place in our brain...essentially meaning that our brain is a biological quantum computing device. \n \n I did try to google for an article like that you are decribing, but every one I found that was even close was using a MUCH looser definition of the term \"simultaneously\" than you seem to be attaching here. They are using it to descibe operation of various parts of the brain occuring in the same general time frame. I have not managed to find one that uses the term to describe 2 areas of the brain activating in the exact same instant in time, which is what you seem to be describing.\n \n \n \nwell that was probably the wrong word to use because the information is already there. What I should have said is that each creature is able to be creative. There are two ways of looking at biology...either way environmental information must be transferred. In the IDist's eyes, the environmental information is transferred directly to each organism by way of the organism \"sensing\" or \"perceiving\" the environment and then responding accordingly.

Lets break your arguments down a bit.\n \n \nTo be an 'adaptationist' you must assert that organisms can and do adapt themselves to their world. \n \n\n \n Sorry but to be an adaptionist one only need to assert that orgainisms ARE adapted to their environments. You need not assert that they adapted THEMSELVES to their environment. The observation doe not allow you to infer self causation. Adaptation is an observation not a philosophy.\n \n \nA 'selectionist', aka any modern darwinian, asserts that organisms need only survive their world [avoid 'selection'], long enough to reproduce their own genes. \n\n \n To be a selectionist you only need assert that different phenotypes exhibit different relative rates of survival/reproduction and that some of the differential is due to genetic (ie heritable) factors.\n \n \nSelectionism[darwinism, fisherism, etc] is gene ['bits of stuff']-based, whereas 'adaptationism' is whole organism [system]-based.\n\n \n Its all bits-of-stuff based buddy. Science does not deal with non-materialist explanations anywhere within it. Organisms are bits-of-stuff just as much as muons are bits-of-stuff and galaxies are bits-of-stuff.

But thats an educational problem for journalists.\n \n \nI'll bet that you and the darwinian ditto-heads who parrot the dogma around here never realized that fact, did you? Just a bit too subtle for a darwinist.\n\n \n Most evolutionary biologists are NOT fans of the radio talk show madman Rush Limbaugh.

Science does NOT test what happened before history. It infers what may have happend historically based on tests of what past events are predicted to do with regard to the present.

Even though the many different Christian denominations are unified in their basic belief in Christ, having all those different interpretations of the details weakens them. No one is looking very hard for naturalitic processes other than Darwinism. There's little chance that it would help politically against Christianity.\n\n That is just warped.

   "To continue this issue. Science does NOT test what happened before history. It infers what may have happend historically based on tests of what past events are predicted to do with regard to the present. The causal chain is inferred and is always provisional - its not considered PROOF. For example if you find a dead body with a bullet hole in its forehead you just might infer that in the past somebody (possibly the corpse) discharged a gun in the vicinity of the victim. Of course you could be wrong as there are alternative ways of getting the same result but the inference is at least provisionally sound. \n\n \n But hasn't science claimed it has PROOF that there was no Biblical flood?\n \n \n \n \nBut as I have pointed out your viewpoint of just what science claims is incorrect.

And yes it is difficult for the general public to grasp the logic going on in a scientific field. We do an awfully lousy job in educating people as to the logical bases and rational foundations of science.

I know it's old stuff, but that shouldn't be a problem for an evolutionist. It was practically yesterday, compared to the billions of years required for evolution. \n \n \nGotta love it. Even the bible supports abiogenesis which is the origin of living organisms from non-living matter. What did GOD make Adam from? Was Adam derived from another human or was he made from the dust of the earth. Hate to tell you but thats abiogenesis. And abiogensis is really very logical. At one time there were no living organisms, there are now living organisms. They could not have arisen intially from other living organisms - where would those organisms have come from? See what I mean. Abiogenesis is as much a religious concept as a scientific one. The argument of course is over HOW abiogenesis happened - as of yet nobody is certain. \n\n \n Gotta love it allright. That's the first time I've heard that one! That abiogenesis is as much a religious concept as a scientific one. Dictionary.com tells us that it's an \"organic phenomenon\", and a discredited one at that. God was, and is not bound by science.",

   "If prosperity and law abiding behavior begin naturally, and no maintanence is required to keep them from failing, then it would make sense to let science use the randomness mindset of evolution to perform social experiments. \n\n \n \n \nDoes this make any sense in the current context. Do you think evolutionists are proposing any such experiment? What for heavens sake are you smoking. \n\n \n What I've been doing lately is checking up on what's going on in todays universities. Which university did you attend? What is your position on the Academic Bill of Rights? You're invited to that thread in the education forum. \n \n \nAnd by the way the US has solved many problems in our society by experimentation sometimes on a trial and error basis. \n\n \n And it has also CAUSED many problems in our society by trial and error experimentation. You and I undoubtedly have differing opinions on what the ratios are. It's a worldview difference, a Democrat vs. Republican difference, an atheist vs. Christian difference, a liberal vs. conservative difference. The categories are almost always only two, aren't they? Democrats, atheists, liberals, vs. Republicans, Christians, conservatives. When one has a certain worldview concerning origins, their political beliefs quickly separate, and go down predictable paths, don't they? \n \n \nAnd evolution is not random given the nature of natural selection. My goodness so many errors in so little space! \n\n \n This is what makes so many Christians suspicious of the cozy relationship that evolution and atheism have. It's similar to your above claim about abiogenesis being a religion thing, only much more so since its such a widespread term, \"natural selection\". Nature doesn't have a mind, and it doesn't have a purpose. Normal use of the word \"selection\" almost always includes a \"selector\",a conscious choice, a decision of a mind, a purpose. Since creationists believe that creation was a choice, a decision, purposed by God (the word purpose is found many times in the Bible) the term \"natural selection\" is favored by atheists, since it counteracts the idea of the existence of God. Evolutionists seem to favor it too. Would it be better if I used the word \"MINDLESS\" instead of random, when referring to social experiments? Again, mindless origins, vs. purposed origins, seems to quickly divide political beliefs.\n \n \nOh yes you overlooked the key scientific concept of entropy which is applicable. Scientists do not believe that systems maintain themselves without work. \n\n \n There is no comparison between scientific systems and human behavior systems, which is what societies are. \n \n \nAnd if we consider GOD to be the source of knowledge and rely on the Bible as our guide to empirical reality we shall manage to achieve the serfdom of the middle ages which was inferior to the Roman standard of living. \n\n \n If we do it in the traditional ways that it has been done for the first 150 years of the existence of the U.S., history tells us it will work pretty well - we have experience in it. \n \n \nThe Romans ceased to act rationally and it led to their downfall. They were the last superpower left standing and it went to their heads.\n\n \n Ceased to act rationally? Elected Democrats maybe? Lost their patriotism maybe? Became too lazy to deal with their enemies? High taxes? Corruption? Ideological conflicts? Loss of family values? Too worried about the environment to build new oil refineries for 30 full years?

And let me ask this if you lived in 1859 would you have been for the status quo or would you support change? If you were alive in the 1960s did you support or oppose the civil rights movement? And did you think we should have stayed in Viet Nam regardless of the hopeless nature of the situation? Anyway nobody has a blank check on change at the government level. You would realize this if you had read the constitution or watched the current congress try to institute change. \n \n As to Iraq, it is the Iraqis who have abandoned us by failing to accept the opportunity we gave them by removing a tyrant. If they cannot organize themselves into a functional government and stop fighting among themselves over a combination of religious and economic issues - why should we bleed to death to postpone the ultimate outcome of their civil war. Its their country its their responsibility to take care of it. Its not our role to provide them with what amounts to international welfare. Help is one thing, making them permanent wards of the US taxpayer and dependent on us is both cruel and ineffective. They need to learn to get and hold down their job of running their nation, others have world wide its not too much to expect on our parts.\n \n \n\"Very strong indeed\", but not \"cozy\"? What are the differences between the two?\n\n \n One is a semi-quantitative estimate of the preponderance of the evidence, the other is a term involving social/professional interactions between parties?",

   "As to Iraq, it is the Iraqis who have abandoned us by failing to accept the opportunity we gave them by removing a tyrant.\n\n \n Here you go Mr. Iraqi, here's your liberty delivered at the point of a gun. We don't quite know what to do next, but you're allowed to choose your government (as long as we approve), and you're now entitled to rights (but we'll dismantle your institutions, so there's no one left to protect them), and we'll stay here to protect you during this difficult time (untill it becomes politically more unpopular than it already is)\n \n \n \nIf they cannot organize themselves into a functional government\n\n \n In my mind the Iraqis have done an OK job. They just need more help to stave off the insurgents.\n \n \n and stop fighting among themselves over a combination of religious and economic issues - why should we bleed to death to postpone the ultimate outcome of their civil war. \n\n \n Because we started it. If the Allies hadn't invaded there wouldn't be a civil war raging.\n \n \nIts their country its their responsibility to take care of it. Its not our role to provide them with what amounts to international welfare.\n \n \n However we felt it was our place to go and replace thier leader (dictator or not) because we didn't like him (Anyone hear the sloshing of oil barrels?). We already give money to some countries, and given that the US won't allow the UN to take control it's not like anyone else can step in.\n \n \nHelp is one thing, making them permanent wards of the US taxpayer and dependent on us is both cruel and ineffective.\n\n \n And has already happened... `(Don't forget you Americans aren't the only guys over there)\n \n \n They need to learn to get and hold down their job of running their nation, \n\n \n Given the Allies intalled a form of government that had no precedent in the Middle East I think the Iraqis are giving it a decent go. The trouble is that there are at least 4 groups with totally seperate desires and views. Normal democracy sorts these problems out as it grows and develops, but the Allies removed any chance for natural growth (where people can adapt to change) and instead are trying to impose thier ideal government on a people not really ready for it.\n \n \nothers have world wide its not too much to expect on our parts.\n\n \n Given that the US seems to like sticking its nose in world wide, don't be suprised when the rest of us expect you to stay true to your commitments.\n \n I know tis is off topic, and really should be in the politics forum.

   "No problem even if life was created from \"nothing\" then it would still be an abiogeneic process! \n\n \n Science knows everything, doesn't it? There's no way it could be a process completely different, that science knows nothing about? \n \n \nSo abiogenesis is neither supportive nor nonsupportive of creationsism or of evolution. In fact its a near certainty.\n \n And I would add that virtual particles arise from what physics terms the vaccum close as you will get to \"nothing\". That I might also add is a scientific concept, and matter is both created and destroyed all the time as a matter of routine. \n\n \n That was always profound to me, that \"matter cannot be created nor destroyed\". So profound, that I remember exactly where I first saw it - in one of my middle school SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS. It was italicized in the book. (that was the 1960's - I'm sure no middle school textbook would say that today) It made sense to me, if I set fire to a piece of papar and burn it up, I didn't destroy it, I simply changed it to ashes and smoke. I changed it so that I, or no man, could change it back, but I just rearranged it, I didn't destroy it. The smoke moved on to be changed to something else by the trees or sun or whatever, and the ashes moved on to decay into their next state, however microscopic it might be, it didn't disappear. It's like \"creation\", everything we see form anew, already had ALL its building blocks in place - nothing has been completely created since the universe was created in the beginning. But I know this is soooo 1960's, back in a time when science knew its place - it actually studied present scientific conditions - rearrangements, and didn't claim to know all about the past, and all about the future. Since it is now largely controlled by atheism, it had to get into the creation and destruction business. Can't compete with God if its just studying rearrangements. \n \n \n \nOr perhaps you forgot Hiroshima? Its matter-energy which is conserved in most cases. And M theory even allows for the creation of matter-energy from the collision of 11 dimensional rippling membranes - but thats pretty hypthetical and at this stage of things purely mathematical theory.\n\n \n Do you think my 60's textbook forgot Hiroshima?",

   "Does it bother you that the constitution forbids Congress from passing any law respecting the establishment of a religion? \n\n \n No, I like it. Establishment of religion is a far cry from religious principles. \n \n \nOf course it does not bother me. The documents were written by masters of the language and poetic expression of the time and the DI in particular reflects the rhetoric they needed to use to draw the various power centers together. Its a masterful exercise. The documents are meant to pursuade for independence and then to establish a governmental structure.\n \n As to PRINCIPLES perhaps you realize that the few mentioned explicitly are not particulary limited to religion. Even the opening of the declaration \n \n \n \n Is largely based on the thinking of deists. And note well the use of the term Laws of Nature, Natures God. Granted they say all men are created equal (ie born equal) and the concept of a Creator is mentioned as the source of rights. But that creator is a neutral one is it not. It could be Allah, or the Great Pumpkin, or the Christian GOD, or something else entirely even Nature as a set of physical laws. \n \n lBut you can take it all for what its worth its meant to elicit different intrepretations from those of different beliefs - thats the way you create unity you know - by studied ambiguity! And as I said it is an absolute masterpiece of the art!!! Wonderful thing.\n \n As to the constitution does it contain religious statements? I'll check later but I don't recall any. Now other than the declaration and the constitution what dcouments are you referring to?\n\n \n Those documents laid the foundation for much of the activity in the U.S. in its first 150 years of existance, and there was plenty of religion in government. The setting aside of a Thanksgiving day was one example. There are many others. Religion had a place in many court and congressional decisions of the 1800's as well. \n \n Willaim Rehnquist \n \n As the United States moved from the eighteenth into the nineteenth century, Congress appropriated time and time again public moneys in support of sectarian [religious] Indian education carried on by religious organizations. Typical of these was Jeffersons treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians, which provided annual cash support for the tribes Roman Catholic priest and church. It was not until 1897, when aid for sectarian education for Indians had reached $500,000 annually, that Congress decided thereafter to cease appropriating money for education in sectarian schools. \n\n \n It probably wouldn't be hard to find many other examples of violations of 'separation of church and state\", throughout the 1800's. That was before a 1947 activist Supreme court separated them.",

   "Ah Marc9000 you make it far too easy: \n\n \n I'm just keeping you humored until you're back on your feet. It's my Christian duty! emoticon_xangel \n \n \n \n \n \nNot only could we but largely we do so. But of course those markets are not free in the sense that LF capitalists would wish. And keeping the status quo in any of our institutions is to run the risk of stagnation and is likely to be social suicide. Times change, knowledge changes, technology changes, threats change, needs change, so must our institutions change to deal with it. But bear in mind that the greatest social changes in the last century DID arise from the private sector not the government. \n\n \n This is really another subject, but maybe we'll get into it later in the proper forum. \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is garbled and disconnected. I take it you oppose gay-marriage {how about civil unions instead?}. I take it you are pro-life also {I am not I am pro freedom}. I take it that you are against change in general - why are you so fearful? \n\n \n Because even many despotic countries that have embraced sweeping changes have often found that these changes were for the worst. I'm not against change, to be completely \"for\" or \"against\" change in general is unrealistic. To be automatically for change is to say that we have it so bad that any change would be for the better. The very poor in the U.S. have it better today than much of the middle class only a few centuries ago. Many experts in government have suggestions for change that don't fit the real world. Naturally they think it's the real world, and not their own fantasies, that need changing. \n \n \nYou have much more reason to fear stasis you know. And let me ask this if you lived in 1859 would you have been for the status quo or would you support change? If you were alive in the 1960s did you support or oppose the civil rights movement?
