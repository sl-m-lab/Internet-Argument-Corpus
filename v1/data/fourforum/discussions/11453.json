At some point one can't help but wonder why those who take this approach continuously ignore that the problem is really fundamentalism, not so much religion in general.

   "From the 'Letter to Louise' page:\n\n \n Really Peeling, do you sincerely believe that god made me gay.com is a legitimately objective theological source for accurate and truthful bible study? And talk about using emotionalism to tug at the heart strings rather than theological facts. Here is a source that has no preference one way or the other in supporting or condemning homosexuality. All it does is translate the words according to the original greek. http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/FRMB46C006.htm Now, click on malakoi and arsenokoitai on verse 9 to see what they actually mean without the modern day attempts to manipulate their meaning in order to justify homosexuality in the bible.\n \n Also, your pro gay link is full of lies and misinformation. For example:\n \n \n\"My brother hates God because God made him gay, and he knows he is going to hell, and I do, too, for that is what the Bible says.\"\n\n \n 1 Cor 6:11 above shows that gays wont go to hell if they will only receive the free gift of salvation that Jesus made available for all of us/ all sinners. Homosexuals are no worse than any other type of sinner in Gods eyes. So the bible doesn't hold some special condemnation for homosexuals as louise say's it does. It just doesn't offer homosexuals a special dispensation for their preferred sin.\n \n \nIf I can say God made me as I am, a heterosexual, then homosexuals can say God made them as they are. If God made them that way, that way is good. If I am created in the image of God, homosexuals are created in the image of God.\n\n \n If God created homosexuality, then why so many passages between the Old and New Testament that condemn it as a sexual outlet? Someone's lying here. It's either Louise, an emotional pro gay apologist, or God, our Creator. I'll take God anytime.\n \n \nEvelyn Hooker, who taught psychology at UCLA, conducted the \"...very first investigation into whether or not homosexuality was an illness that examined a population of `normal' gay men--men who were not residents of mental hospitals, prisoners, or distressed patients in therapy [common subjects of study at that time], but ordinary people living ordinary, if closeted, lives....In 1956 Hooker presented her findings--that no psychological differences existed between homosexual and heterosexual men--before the annual meetings of the American Psychological Association.\"3-1\n\n \n She even has the nerve to use evelyn hookers fraudulent work in order to support her lies. Here's an excerpt.\n A report for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality by researcher Jeffrey B. Satinover, cites Evelyn Hooker as \"more than anyone else\" the one whose work is responsible for normalizing homosexuality.\n \n Satinover writes that Hooker's work has helped the homosexual movement - in keeping with the Marxist theories from which it came - to convince judicial and legislative bodies such as the US Supreme Court that homosexuality comprises an oppressed \"class\" whose rights have been trampled by irrational prejudice.\n \n Hooker's work itself, however, was the product of a deliberate effort by homosexual activists to bring forward particular, pre-arranged outcomes, an approach that precludes scientific objectivity.\n \n While teaching at UCLA in the late 1940's, Hooker fell in with a group of homosexuals and the newly formed activist organization, the Mattachine Society. Founded by leading thinker and member of the US communist party, Harry Hay, the Mattachine Society members convinced Hooker to embark on a research study of homosexuality on their behalf in order to advance the movement.\n \n The study's subjects were selected entirely by the Mattachine Society, a group that Hooker herself admitted in the report had \"as its stated purpose the development of a homosexual ethic...\". In the same section she concedes the possibility that homosexuals are indeed pathological. The inadequacy of her methodology was acknowledged by the Journal of Projective Techniques that published it.\n \n In the study, \"The adjustment of the male overt homosexual\", Hooker administered three standard personality tests to two groups of 30 men, one homosexual and screened by the Mattachine Society and the other heterosexual. Despite the fact that the purpose of the study was ostensibly to examine the possibility of mental instability in homosexuals, individuals who showed signs of mental instability were removed from the groups, which further predetermined the study's conclusion.\n \n As with many other such \"groundbreaking\" studies seminal to the sexual revolution however, although Hooker's research has been criticised, and for all practical purposes debunked, the movement she helped to launch has not slowed.\n \n To this day, the Hooker study is the only paper referenced in detail on the main website of the American Psychological Association in its discussion of Gay and Lesbian issues. It was one of the two upon which, in 1973, the APA decided to remove homosexuality from the list of psychological disorders. It was the one study discussed in the APA's brief in 2003 in the Lawrence v. Texas case that struck down the criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy in Texas.http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1867047/posts\n \n So please Peeling, get a clue before relying on pro gay sources in order to justify that which the bible clearly condemns, and by condemns, I mean homosexuality, not homosexuals.",

Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor \n adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders\n \n 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers \n will inherit the kingdom of God.\n ^^^These 2 verses are stating a variety of types of sinners who will never see the kingdom of Heaven.\n 11 And that is what some of you \"were\". But you were washed, you were \n sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by \n the Spirit of our God.\n ^^^And verse 11 clearly states, 11 And that is what some of you \"were\". Paul was showing that all of those sins were forgivable, and that people in that very church in Corinth had been forgiven as they had come out of those very sins and lifestyles. And remember, I originally posted this passage to make that very point. This happens all the time around here. The points I try to make showing that God is gracious and seeks to forgive us are twisted around in order to imply that I'm attempting to condemn everyone who ever sinned. Well, let me state for the record, as sinners go, I am the greatest among you. That's why I'm in such dire need of His forgiveness. And I never claimed otherwise.\n \n So unredeemed sinners wont see heaven, but those who accept the free gift of salvation as offered through Christ's sacrifice will all be forgiven. That is what that passage is saying, and is the only message that I have ever given here.",

   "I regularly encounter homophobia in my job (I'm a teacher) in kids who are in no way religious, and indeed find the idea of my being a Christian and going to church amusing. There does not need to be a rationale for it. For most homophobes \"it's disgusting\" or \"it's unnatural\" will be the most thought they ever give to it. You have to remember that for a lot of people don't have the mindset that prejudice and bigotry are wrong - more than one kid I teach has been told \"don't go near asians\" by their parents, because apparently \"asians will stab you\".\n\n \n I agree with you. Individuals aver their hatred of gays based on non-religious reasons all the time. Also I never meant to imply that all Christians/or other believers are homophobic. \n \n I was speaking to the OP. When established, non-underground groups openly express their disdain for homosexuals they uniformly (in the US at least) do so based on religious rationalizations. In the US, you can safely bet that all of those groups are Christian. I would like someone to find a single group that is not. \n \n They are nutcases and are easily dismissed by many. However, I find it disturbing that mainstream religions do not vociferously oppose them. There is the occasional \"progressive\" preacher who speaks of \"tolerance\" in private services, but I do not see much pubic objection to the groups that use religion to couch their homophobia from religious leadership . If some group used Christian teachings to support antisemitic sentiments, there would be an uproar.",

   "I think you should be more careful with your broad brush. Blaming all religion for the actions of some is hardly fair. If you mean specific religions, then say so, I have a few Wiccan friends who would be more than a little puzzled to find themselves accused of promoting homophobia.\n \n I also think your view is very americocentric, few churches in the UK make much of an issue of homosexuality in their day to day work, even when they do believe it to be wrong. It's nothing comparable to the virulent political campaigns of the conservative evangelicals in the US. Yes some church leaders have spoken out against gay rights, but there is not the same anti-gay social movement that there is in the US. Civil partnerships were passed here without a whimper.\n\n \n Frankly, I am convinced that religious thinking is particularly prone to authoritarianism and hostility to non-conformists, especially if the believers can convince themselves they have the approval of their deity to be as beastly as they sometimes are. \n \n Of course, I've never claimed that religion is the only type of belief system that can generate this hatred; nor have i ever claimed that all religion or all religious believers are equally bad. My argument is that religion makes it easier for otherwise good people to behave in bad ways. It is not and never has been a generalisation to all religions or all believers. I think we know of whom we speak here.\n \n Smoking causes lung cancer, but not all smokers get cancer, and not all lung cancers are caused by cigarettes. That doesn't mean that smoking in general is a Good Thing. I have rather similar views of religion. \n \n Now, you can point out to me many examples of believers who do not succumb to the worst excesses of religion, however, the problem I have is with those who do. Religion just makes it easier for them to go bad, in my view.\n \n BTW, I do live in the UK. While the UK churches are generally not as hysterically homophobic as some in the US, nevertheless, they can hardly be described as gay-friendly -- not even the Anglicans, as the recent kerfuffle over Bishop Eugene Robinson showed, and especially not the English or Scottish RC churches, whose bishops have recently made some rather nasty attacks on gays.",

The Methodists are generally pretty gay-friendly, and many Quaker meetings will marry same sex couples. Also, the arguments at the Lambeth conference don't reflect what is happening on the ground in the church of England. Bizarre as it may seem, the CofE has effectively operated a don't ask don't tell policy towards gay clergy, and many clergy, live with their partner, and some are in civil partnerships. The policy of many Bishops has been to ignore this unless the priest in question tells them about it. You will find gay couples are a part of more than a few CofE congregations, even 20 years ago my Dad was curate at a church where a female couple worshipped, though this being the CofE nobody asked any questions about the nature of their relationship. Effectively, until the evangelicals started kicking up a fuss, the church had successfuly operated a conveniently fuzzy system that allowed all members of the church to continue with a clear conscience, and in the best tradition of the church of england, this involved statements of policy and practical implementation that were wildly divergent. Sure, it's not rainbow flags hanging by the door, but change in the Anglican church does not come with a bang so much as a grumbling into the beard.",

Call me a liar if you like, and I know it's important for you to paint me in that light, but to inaccurately define me as you must, only makes you the liar. \n Introduction \n \n This page features a photo essay about the 2008 \"Up Your Alley\" Fair -- a free, open-to-the-public street festival held in San Francisco on July 27. Up Your Alley -- which until recently was called the Dore Alley Fair -- is very similar to the larger and more well-known Folsom Street Fair, in that they are both held to celebrate the leather and fetish scene in the gay community. While Folsom is internationally known and draws visitors from all over the world, Up Your Alley is thought of more as the fetish event \"for locals,\" and because of that it is smaller, has fewer retail vendors and booths, and generally flies under the radar. \n \n However, in recent years, the original Dore Alley Fair stopped being independently produced, and became a subsidiary of the larger Folsom Street Fair nonprofit organization; the name was changed to Up Your Alley, and was it was more heavily promoted on the official Folsom Web site. As a result, as I discovered this year, Up Your Alley has become extremely popular itself, with many tens of thousands of people in attendance (at least from my guess, though I'm no expert at estimating the sizes of crowds). Now it seems to be more than just a warm-up for Folsom, but instead has grown to become a major event in its own right (some of the photos below show how crowded it was). \n \n Why Make This Report? The Politics of Exhibitionism and Public Sex \n \n The story behind this report has its origins last year, when I did a photo essay about the Folsom Street Fair itself. After a controversy arose in 2007 about the \"blasphemous\" poster (a fetishistic parody of The Last Supper) advertising the Folsom event, and about Miller Beer's prominently visible sponsorship, I went to check out the 2007 Folsom festival to see if it really was as extreme as is detractors were claiming. \n \n Turns out that it was. I did a lot of musing and agonizing about my decision whether or not to publish my Folsom photos; rather than repeat myself, I invite readers who never saw my original Folsom report to read my introduction to it here, because most of the arguments I made then remain relevant to this new report as well. \n \n However, a few key points need reiterating: \n \n \u0095 I am only publishing these images for their evidentiary and journalistic value, and have no desire to run an X-rated web site. In order to prove that what I'm reporting is really true, I must necessarily post pictures that many will perceive as pornographic. \n \u0095 I am not responsible for the behavior of the people shown in these photos; if you feel that these images \"make gay people look bad\" and are unhappy about that fact, then take the issue up with the people shown acting out. Don't blame me: I'm just the messenger. \n \u0095 I am not claiming that the behavior depicted on this page is practiced by all members of the fetish or gay communitities, nor that they all universally approve of it. \n \u0095 I am not anti-gay, or anti-fetish, or anti-sex. \n \u0095 I myself am neither Catholic, nor Christian, nor religious in any way. \n \u0095 I have no \"agenda\"; I'm just reporting what I see. I'm publishing these photos to maintain my journalistic integrity and to not engage in self-censorship simply because the facts are inconvenient. \n \u0095 Personally, I don't particularly care one way or the other about what goes on at these fairs, or about Miller Beer's sponsorship. I'm just introducing some facts into an argument in which two opposing sides are making mutually contradictory claims. \n \n Just as with my Folsom report, I was at the Up Your Alley event for slightly less than one hour, even though the fair lasted all day, from 11am to 6pm. And in that one hour, I took all the images on this page (and many more similar scenes I did not have room to show). The goings-on depicted in this essay are not unique, significant or noteworthy incidents: they're just random scenes from a random hour in the day. If I had arrived an hour earlier or an hour later, I would have seen a completely different series of incidents. Whether I visited at a particularly sexy time, or during a lull in the action, I don't know: What I saw during that one hour was probably about average for what went on during every hour throughout the day. So, as I said in my previous introduction, one can extrapolate that a great deal more sexual activity must have gone on during those six hours that I was not there. \n \n \n So -- let's get down to business. \n \n \n FINAL WARNING \n \n The images shown in the report below have been published here because they are essential documentary components of a news story; they are not intended as titillation or pornography. \n \n However, they are EXTREMELY explicit -- much more explicit than even those shown in my previous Folsom report -- and may be considered disturbing by some viewers. \n \n Also be aware that the images in this version of the report have not been blurred by default, as they were in my earlier 2007 Folsom Street Fair report. If you prefer to only view blurred versions of the Up Your Alley photos, please return to the main Up Your Alley selection page. \n \n If you do not wish to see images of explicit and fetishistic public sexual behavior, this is your last opportunity to stop. Do not continue scrolling down the page. \n ",

THAT'S the sort of bizarre reasoning you're using here.\n\n emoticon_xdonno \n Show me any argument I have made where the issue ONLY involved \"they go to church\".\n I have no need to argue against such blatantly obvious falsehoods.\n \n \n \nSure, you've shown a \"link\" to Christianity--whoopteedoo--the point is that you've not shown it as the MOTIVE, and that's the real point of your argument. If all you are out to do here is show a \"link\", then who gives a flying flick? Having a link to religion means naadaa. If THAT were the problem, you'd have to be condemning groups like Soulforce too. ;) I swear--you'd fail a jury selection every time just on the basis of your preference for guilty-till-proven-innocent approach, alone.\n\n Again, these aren't just \"links\". \n One of them was FOUNDED by Pat Robertson. Not just a \"link\".\n One of them is a pseudo-\"scientific\" group that regularly works with Christian groups. Again, not just a \"link\".\n The third is a group that ADVOCATES CHRISTIAN ACTIVISM. Not just a \"link\".\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \nAnd you still haven't dealt with the fact that your argument contains, by default, an implication that such a link is somehow bad. Why does it even matter to you that there's a link with religion? Desmund Tutu is linked to religion too.\n\n I think the \"implication\" is something your guilty conscience is reading into it.\n Sure. That is my PERSONAL position, but it isn't necessary for the point of the observation.\n \n I \"haven't dealt\" with something cause it's just plain irrelevant.\n If I \"imply\" it, or don't say it and you read into it, or if I just plain say it...\n It DOES NOT MATTER.\n \n The bad part is the \"anti-gay group\". THAT is the bad part.\n \n On another level, I think I should save up some of these arguments that you are throwing out there for the next time somebody wants to credit religion for any sort of \"good\" it is tangentially involved in.\n \n \n \nEr, I haven't. I don't care if you call them purple-polka-dotted-porsches. Where they're bad is that they're being anti-gay, NOT that they're being religious.\n\n And I would agree that the \"anti-gay\" is the bad part.\n But WHY is the \"anti-gay\" bigotry (in \"anti-gay group\" form) coming EXCLUSIVELY from Christianity?\n \n THAT is the REAL thing that is bugging you.\n THAT is the implication you don't like.\n \n \n \nYou miss the point, yet again. Soulforce is 'linked' to Christianity too, and neither is the APA .... It's not about whether a given group is religious. It's about whether they are anti-gay. And that's the central problem with your approach.\n\n If it doesn't matter, then why are you trying to hard to argue against it?\n THAT is the question you can't deal with... emoticon_emb",

If their site doesn't give religion as their motive, and in fact (in some cases) indicates OTHER motives, then we're basically left with you ascribing motive as a matter of opinion on your part.

Again, why are you so eager to ONLY ascribe bad to religion but NOT good? And truly, if bad happens because of Christianity, then I have no problem with that being noted. But not on the pathetic evidence you've given here. You've not demonstrated causality by Christianity at all. And even if you did, what of the good that Christianity does? What's your point? Are you suggesting we should stop being Christians just because some people who do bad things claim to be Christians?\n \n \nBut WHY is the \"anti-gay\" bigotry (in \"anti-gay group\" form) coming EXCLUSIVELY from Christianity?\n\n \n There's a difference between saying that anti-gay groups are always Christian and saying anti-gay groups are always motivated by Christianity. Frankly, your logic here is like pointing out that all fascism comes FROM patriotic people. It doesn't matter--we don't blame patriotism for fascism. We blame them for being fascist. Your approach here is just wrong-headed, and you're looking for causality in the wrong place. Why should I believe you about Christianity instead of Mel White, who holds that Christianity leads him fight for gay rights? Why should I believe you about Christianity rather than ML King Jr, who was a Christian minister who fought for civil rights? Why should I believe you about Christianity rather than Jo, right here in these forums, who seems to believe that equality is more in keeping with Christianity? (And again, if that's NOT what you're saying about Christianity, then WHAT ARE you saying? WHAT IS your point about it?)\n \n \nTHAT is the REAL thing that is bugging you.\n THAT is the implication you don't like.\n\n \n Foundit, these silly tactics of yours are tiresome. It has nothing to do with being \"bugged\" or \"guilty conscience\", or whatever other silly psychoanalytical BS you're pulling here. Frankly, I wish you were HALF as interested here in actually getting to the bottom of showing Christianity is the CAUSE for being anti-gay as you are trying to get to MY motives for pointing out the problems in your arguments here. My reasons for doing so are that you're unreasonably implying something against Christianity where there's no causality proven.",

No. It's fascists that are the ones responsible for fascism to begin with, Foundit, not patriotism. Patriotism (like religion) is a very general concept and no unified body--that point seems to have gone right over your head. It consists of belief, not a team or club. STOP expecting everyone else to do your dirty work. I don't see anyone calling for gay rights groups to pledge support for Christianity and take up a cause of defending religion, you you seem to have this idea that Christians (an ideology that is inherently about OTHER unrelated issues) are supposed to take up your cause. If you don't like some organisation, then oppose it yourself, and stop holding people culpable who haven't done anything just because they're about OTHER un-related issues. Frankly this idea put forth that just because people aren't engaged on YOUR issue (instead about OTHER issues), they're not doing what they're supposed to is pretty downright arrogant. Not everybody puts YOUR concerns at the top of their list of priorities. (Did it ever even occur to you that many other Christians may do their in-justice opposing in OTHER ways?) This is all yet another oft-used predictable approach you use. As if Christianity is some monolithic card-carrying membership. Why is the fact someone else is being stupid the responsibility of Christians who AREN'T being stupid, Foundit, just 'cause they happen to be Christian too? That's like saying gay people are supposed to rise up and be responsible for condemning anything bad that happens among gays. Are all gays responsible for condemning the behavior going on in the photo site Archangel linked to? No, they shouldn't have to do that. Just like other Christians who aren't even involved in this issue shouldn't have to be responsible for the condemnations YOU'RE calling for. There simply aren't enough resources and time to oppose every case of injustice out there, and many Christians ARE fighting injustice in various ways; they just may not be pointing their efforts the way YOU want them to. If the politics of these anti-gay groups are causing you harm, then oppose them yourself.\n \n And by the way, while you're at it, you might find your insistence there would carry more credibility if you actually considered starting to acknowledge the work that IS going on in Christianity to condemn anti-gay groups, for once. There are pro-gay groups that are Christian too, there are denominations that HAVE condemned it, and a large portion of the Anglican church has also taken such a stance.",

I'm not really sure what the point of going over the fact that anti-gay groups are religious over and over really accomplishes when it's something everyone knows already. Certainly there are groups in religion that need to be more tolerant; everyone knows that. That's WHY there are movements afoot in Christianity that are more tolerant, and that's exactly WHY many younger people call for change in Christianity.",

   "Some can. The Methodists are generally pretty gay-friendly, and many Quaker meetings will marry same sex couples. Also, the arguments at the Lambeth conference don't reflect what is happening on the ground in the church of England. Bizarre as it may seem, the CofE has effectively operated a don't ask don't tell policy towards gay clergy, and many clergy, live with their partner, and some are in civil partnerships. The policy of many Bishops has been to ignore this unless the priest in question tells them about it. You will find gay couples are a part of more than a few CofE congregations, even 20 years ago my Dad was curate at a church where a female couple worshipped, though this being the CofE nobody asked any questions about the nature of their relationship. Effectively, until the evangelicals started kicking up a fuss, the church had successfuly operated a conveniently fuzzy system that allowed all members of the church to continue with a clear conscience, and in the best tradition of the church of england, this involved statements of policy and practical implementation that were wildly divergent. Sure, it's not rainbow flags hanging by the door, but change in the Anglican church does not come with a bang so much as a grumbling into the beard.\n\n \n Well, a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy is not a full-hearted acceptance, is it. However, I will certainly grant that the Anglican church is better than some others, if not in the third world. I suspect many English Anglicans are pretty embarrassed by the antics of their former colonial subjects. And fair enough, I wouldn't expect change to come overnight, either. At least they are moving (if somewhat glacially outside North America) in the right direction, which is far better than the RC church, which has lurched towards the mediaeval with the last two popes.\n \n It wasn't really my intention to single out the American Episcopal or Canadian Anglican churches, either. Although they've had their share of conservative extremists, they have been as welcoming as politically possible. The current Archbishop of Canterbury, on the other hand, has been a grave disappointment. No sign of any backbone whatever.",

Who wouldn't?\n\n The next step, as I have explained before and it went ignored, is SELF-CORRECTION.\n \n Numerous times on this thread people have talked about how gays should take it upon themselves to combat the higher stats of HIV in our community.\n AND I AGREE that we should. And we do.\n \n But when it comes to Christianity and the anti-gay side, the self-correction is glaringly absent.\n In fact, what ULTIMATELY happens is that the anti-gay biblical side that don't support the anti-gay groups typically try to drag the discussion down into a bible study so they can berate any pro-gay Christians for being supportive of gays...\n \n The really amusing part is how the Christians will spend ALL THAT TIME and effort in order to try to \"correct\" their \"pro-gay\" brothers, but the more vehement and bigotted \"anti-gay\" brothers don't get correction!\n \n Recognizing the problem is the first step in treating it.\n If you're ready to recognize the problem, then let's work on treating it!\n \n \n \nThere's nothing to 'admit' really; everyone is already in agreement on that.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n How many pages of arguing have you spent refusing to \"admit\" something, that evidently now you want to pretend you were \"admitting\" all along?\n Talk about changing the goal posts...\n \n \n \nThe problem is, saying that anti-gay groups are religious and saying religion is anti-gay are two VERY different things.\n\n Let's see.\n The bible says we should be put to death.

I don't think so!\n\n But you're missing the second part of what we're doing here.\n In conjunction with the question, we're asking if ANYBODY out there can show an example of a \"S\" which is NOT stupid.\n \n If I could give a couple dozen examples of \"S\" acting stupid, and NOBODY could give me an example of \"S\" not acting stupid, that would be pretty compelling evidence.\n Furthermore, if anybody wanted to argue that \"S\" was NOT stupid, all they would have to do is give multiple other examples of \"S\" not acting stupid to put it into perspective.\n \n You don't seem willing to get the fact that NOBODY OUT THERE can give me a U.S. anti-gay group which isn't based on Christianity IS EVIDENCE of itself.\n \n Suppose I said \"Earth life is carbon-based\".\n I could give example after example of \"Earth life\" which is \"carbon based\". And I've done that for Christian anti-gay groups.\n And then you would come along insisting on \"statistics\" and a \"web-site\".\n But the truth of the matter is that your challenge is MEANINGLESS, cause the REAL counter to my assessment is to show a NON-carbon based life form on Earth. That would be the REAL counter-proof.\n \n But you KNOW you cannot give that, so instead you obfuscate with a web-site that you don't have the cajones to even quote cause you know it'll look stupid to anybody who reads it.\n You insist on receiving meaningless \"proof\" that quite frankly doesn't exist cause nobody cares enough to keep \"statistics\" ON THE OBVIOUS.\n \n \n \nMy point is not being addressed, but evaded. I foolishly made the mistake of thinking that you would give a reasonable explanation as to why you think \"from my experience\" and \"individual examples\" are sufficient evidence to back up your point. I thought someone who could supposedly prove all kinds of stuff could give such an explanation. I guess not.\n\n I've already explained that statistics are made up of individual examples.\n So far, we have a couple dozen examples of \"Christian anti-gay groups\", and not a single non-Christian U.S. anti-gay group.\n We are CREATING the examples.\n \n And all you can do is cluck your tongue and say \"I don't think you're right\"... \n \n I can't prove anything to the blind.\n Furthermore, it is easily noted that you are in no way DISPROVING what I am showing.

I think that religion can give some people a sense of purpose, a motivation to pursue positive goals in life. This is not true for everyone, of course. \n \n This kind of personal transformation can cause a problem, though, if people suddenly embrace a rigid religious doctrine and begin to see everything through the lens of a doctrine that they suddenly decide is the \"truth.\" I have seen this in forums with a few folks who used to be alcoholic or addicted to drugs or both. They embraced a particular religious doctrine, which helped them personally to find hope, and then they decided that everything in this doctrine must be true, without any critical perspective. And they turned around and projected their experiences as alcoholics or drug addicts onto gay people, assuming that being gay is a form of addiction that can be \"cured\" through their brand of faith. I recall several posters in the NYTimes forums that used to argue repeatedly that being gay is a form of addiction, which all of the gay and bisexual posters found annoying to listen to, as it was simply false. \n \n I see a distinction between faith that takes the form of rigid adherence to a doctrine and faith that is more fluid and latitudinarian, faith that recognizes that no religious doctrine can grasp the whole of truth and that religious beliefs are simply an approach to truth, not the truth itself.

When someone insists that their religious beliefs are the \"truth,\" and that I should accept the \"truth,\" there is usually no discussion involved, because the person trying to do the converting is usually not open to questioning or reconsidering their own religious beliefs. I have found that the person seeking to convert another often believes in what amounts to a closed system of thought, resting on assumptions that can never, in their view, be challenged or reconsidered. They have an answer for everything, based on their assumptions and their closed system of thought. Instead of engaging in discussion in an effort to deepen understanding, they engage in an effort to tell you what they have already decided is the \"truth\" and to get you to buy into it. And since I don't agree with the person's underlying assumptions about \"truth,\" the discussion is unlikely to go far beyond us agreeing to disagree. Telling me over and over that something is in the Bible and is therefore the will of God is not going to get me to embrace that belief, because I don't start with the assumption that the Bible is the word of God. \n \n Discussions with people who are not seeking to convert anyone are usually different from this.

   "Why would you hold up criminals as some sort of ambassador for Christianity? I've heard this argument before. It doesn't really follow. For all we know, it could just as likely be the negative thoughts or psychological problems that led them to cimriminality, which also led to Christianity. Perhaps if they'd been identifying atheists in the first place, they wouldn't have become criminals at all. Who are the people that most feel the need for a supernatural forgiveness, a cleansing to soothe a guilty conscious? The answer: criminals. \n \n Who is to know what the cure for criminal behaviour is, but there is no reason to assume it's Christianity. Well, there is for those who pay religion more respect than is warranted. You don't see atheists, saying because a criminal identified as an atheist while in prison, and even did some nice things after being incarcerated, that this must make atheism the best thing ever! People would scoff, because atheism isn't presumed the same underserved respect as Christianity.\n\n \n The reason why it is acknowledged as true is because some very violent people have given God, through Jesus, the sole credit for changing them. They admit that apart from Christ they would never have been able to change their character at all. The bible say's that we become new creatures in Christ, and only someone who has personally experienced that new life within them can understand what it truly means.

   "I find that though with anyone who's not open to discussion on a given area of ideology. I think everyone has certain issues they would want to convince others on that they themselves would not move on. And it's not like there aren't stubborn dogmatic people holding to variety of ideologies out there. For example, we see this all the time in politics or in hot-button issues in society. IOW, I don't see any special category here for 'religious converting' people as opposed to other examples of people being dogmatic. What you're describing here is simply someone who's no open to listening to other POVs rather that specifically people seeking to convert others to a given religion. After all, stubbornness and refusal to consider other views as truth is certainly not limited to discourse about religion; it exists in, say, political discussions as well. (Hence the old saying that the two thing to never discuss at family reunions are religion and politics.) It's a case of it either being a.) a stubborn person, or b.) happening to be an immovable issue (which we all have, if we stop to really think about it).\n\n \n That may be true in many cases, but a disagreement may have less to do with stubbornness or a refusal to consider other viewpoints than with the two parties starting with fundamentally different assumptions. In some debates or discussions, the two parties involved share common assumptions and have simply reached different conclusions. In other debates or discussions, the two parties start with entirely different assumptions. In the former types of argument, the two parties can consider together how to evaluate evidence in light of their common assumptions, to see precisely how and why they differ in their conclusions. They may wind up agreeing on most points, or at least on some points. In the latter kind of argument, because the parties start with fundamentally different assumptions, there may be little area of common thinking, and the likelihood is that the parties will end having to agree to disagree. For example, if I am discussing an issue with someone who assumes that the Bible is the inerrant word of God and thus turns to the Bible as authoritative about God's will, and I do not start with that assumption, then our arguments rest on entirely different assumptions. The other person can argue repeatedly that the Bible says X, and this argument is irrelevant to me, as I don't view the Bible as authoritative. That, I think, is why my discussions with Archangel are unlikely to yield agreement on the subject of gay rights, as we start from fundamentally different assumptions about the topic. If we are aware of our fundamentally different assumptions, then we can at least recognize the source of our disagreement. Many Christians start with different assumptions than mine about the Bible, but also different assumptions than Archangel's about the Bible, and their debates with Archangel will be different from my debates with him. These Christians are more likely to debate with Archangel what the Bible says and what it means; whereas I don't concern myself with what it says or means, as I do not embrace the Bible as authoritative.",

Where the rights of the fetus/baby end, and the rights of the human begin.\n But if the bible were to hypothetically say \"life begins at conception\", then there could be no debate on the issue for people who believed.\n (Ironically, there are bible passages that are interpreted to establish \"life\" as beginning when blood flows (Leviticus 17:1-14) which would put the beginning of life well after conception.)\n \n \n \nIn terms of it being an issue and argumentation, I don't really see it any differently when someone is trying to convince another to \"become a Christian\" than trying to win a person over to any sort of major ideology.\n\n You're ignoring the stark differences in the situation.\n Suppose I were to say \"I believe that Jesus was inspired by God, but I don't believe he was God. The Old Testament's absence of any sort of \"Holy Trinity\" idea makes the idea of him being in a \"Trinity\" as something he made up, and not genuine to the Judeo-Christian belief\".\n If I were then to follow Jesus's preachings, would I be counted as a \"Christian\"?\n \n Despite the perceived contradictions, gays can be Republicans. They can hold to \"trickle down economics\" and a variety of other Republican ideals, while down-playing the anti-gay aspect.\n Despite what some claim as a contradiction, blacks can be Republicans.\n etc, etc, etc...\n \n But to be a Christian, one must BELIEVE the Bible and must BELIEVE Christ is God.\n The difference is there. To be a Christian REQUIRES belief in the bible and holding to its preachings.\n There are obviously some \"grey\" areas, but those typically reside in areas that most can see as trivial like the \"eucharist: represents the body & blood or IS the body & blood\".\n Other differences which could be trivial, like having a gay church leader, can rip the church apart just cause of what \"the bible says\". (Interestingly enough, you don't see too many other legal sins ripping the church apart.)\n \n Personally, I think Jesus had some GREAT teachings that I wish more of his followers would listen to. \n But does that make me a \"Christian\"?\n \n Heck. Even the CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY claims there is a big difference. A difference that you may be missing.\n Remember the bible passages that establish a person CANNOT believe on their own accord? That it requires divine intervention?\n How many issues do you know that require GOD HIMSELF to make the transition of changed position complete?\n \n I think your own bible proves you wrong...",
