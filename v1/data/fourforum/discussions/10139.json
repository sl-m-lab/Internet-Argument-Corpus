   "A warning to all people of conscience as what you're about to see is very blatant and disturbing. It reveals the active and conscious agenda of the Gay Movement to indoctrinate our youth while they are most impressionable. While they are too young to discern the vile values being propagated as right and normal. What kind of people is it who would willingly rape the minds of children by stealing their innocence in such an intrusive and deceptive way ? \n \n And of course in the second video he brings up the gay marriage issue so as to soften the children up so they will someday accept it without question as normal and right. Now if this discussion were taking place in a College class room called Sociology, i would have no objections. But when young children in Grammar schools are being actively and purposefully indoctrinated, it makes my blood run cold. \n \n The reality is that if homosexuality was right, normal, natural and good then why must they attempt to brain wash children who are too young and innocent to even understand what sex is ? Why must they be told that this type of sex is normal if it really is ? There are two short videos, but they clearly show what the Gay Agenda is and the part our progeny plays in their goal for accomplishing their Political Agenda.\n \n http://www.massresistance.org/media/video/brainwashing.html",

Did you ever consider that information might just be information that is helpful for kids to know to function in this society and not a social agenda/ideology?\n\n \n The video included footage of people talking about the moralistic perspective. There's a difference between teaching kids that people exist who are attracted to members of the same sex and trying to instill a moralistic view about that being lived that out. They didn't just stop at the informational level, but went on to the moralistic one, IMO, which basically means they were trying to instill their particular moralistic values here. It looked like they also spent an inordinate amount of time on the whole tolerance thing. I would not send my children to this school, not because they teach that gays exist, but because they would purport to be the ones to teach their values to my kids. That's the thing--the issue of homosexuality is not only one of facts, but also one of moralistic matters in terms of behavior and how it's lived out, for many people anyway. And the school clearly crossed the line from the realm of facts to the realm of moralistic values. Again, it's interesting to me that people like this seem to think it's just fine and dandy to teach moralistic values in schools if it's their moral system. But they would surely balk if it were a religious-based one. \n \n Let me reiterate--I have no problem with the teaching that people exist who are attracted to members of the opposite-sex (gays), but I feel the video went farther than just giving the facts, to the point of putting forth moralistic values about those facts.\n \n \nOtherwise they may grow up to be like you and Arch. These are merely facts.\n\n \n I don't know what you mean by \"you and Arch\"; I'd say you're more like Arch in terms of just being a fundamentalist to your views, though of course you stand on opposite sides of your fence. Regardless, No, these were not \"just facts\". Again, they went farther, IMO, into trying to instill their values.\n \n \n\"The govt. has too much power when it comes to public education.\" Who else should be running a public institution?\n\n \n *Local* government.\n \n Addendum: Not that this is important, but I also thought it was a little humorous that the principal looked somewhat like the antagonist principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Any time a given set of values are taught to children, it's \"indoctrinating innocent children before they are mature enough\". That's the way it works; you have to teach kids some things. The real problem here is that you just don't like the values religion teaches. But it's one thing to take kids to a place that's there for the purpose of teaching values (religious churches). After all, you know on the front end that's what you're getting. It's another thing altogether to have kids get their values at a place that's really for a different purpose (education) as in this case. And that's why I disagree with the approach the school takes here in this video.

   "Being gay is no more a \"moral\" issue than being left-handed is a \"moral\" issue. The idea that this is a \"moral\" issue is a falsehood in itself. The fact is children get an overwhelming amout of negative influence on the issue of homosexuality from home, schoolmates and society in general. We know this, in most cases, will not be countered in the home or church. As many as 10% of these children will be gay themselves and close to 100% will have a gay family member or friend. Being gay is NORMAL and always will be NORMAL no matter what kind of bigotry is spewed from the religious sect. \n Loving and at least treating your fellow human with dignity and respect will come about only when we stop treating people with differences as some sort of epidemic that needs to be brought under control. Children will know at some point someone who is gay, how they react to this will rely a lot on what they were taught as a child. I don't see any problems with these videos. If anything, they should receive federal funding, be expanded into ALL schools and include video of this kind for each mistreated minority in society. We all know we can't leave it to the parents, we have hundreds of years of history to prove this.\n\n \n So you support pushing your immoral agenda to innocent school-children that the practice homosexuality is fine and not a sin and an abomination in God's sight?",

   "Religion is a mind virus.\n \n I want to posit the idea that Religion is a virus of the mind. A meme that is passed from one mind to another, mostly through verbal instruction and usually when the minds defenses are down ie: when an individual is undergoing physical or emotional stress. Or through indoctrination of children, who have yet to develop proper mental defenses.\n What makes the religion meme virus-like is that, in most cases it instructs the mind it infects to pass it on to as many other minds as possible.\n Were religion a benign infection it would be easy to ignore. But to the individual who is most infected, eg: the pious believer, it short-circuits rational thought processes and propagates irrational responses from the very serious such as suicide bombings, murder of abortion doctors and victimization of homosexuals to the significant, such as modifying education curriculum's to deny the overwhelming evidence of science, eg. teaching intelligent design, a young earth etc. beside real science.\n One of the things that has allowed the religion-mind-virus to continue infecting Humans into the 21st century is the deferment we offer religion above other social and political institutions.\n We are taught to \"respect the beliefs of others\". So we tolerate behaviors from violence and bigotry to the subjugation of women that we would otherwise strongly object to.\n The cure is simple, it is time we learned that tolerance does not mean allowing people to denigrate the rights of others, it means that all people must be tolerant of each other regardless of whether their holy books sanction intolerance and rights abuse.\n \n \n http://arguelifeblog.blogspot.com/",

It's easy to assume that that's the main cause, but that could be because we are, in fact, animals (and mostly shallow ones at that, you got that one right), and we are strongly capable of making inane decisions like marrying too soon...but sometimes that's a cause of not being responsible enough to live the married life, and not so much based on sexual impulse. \n \n I'm not really even sure what this is all about. There are responsible straight and gay parenting, and many instances of irresponsible parenting, but that's just a part of nature. At least we aren't like a certain rodent species in which the father immediately has sex with the daughter as soon as it's born (they had shown it on the Discovery channel, and not sure about you, but that's my idea of despicable behavior). \n \n Welcome to Planet Earth!",

   "I will translate Archangel for you all:\n \n \nYou are speaking about a dysfunctional family JSD, and unfortunately they too are normal as in the sense of every family suffers from its own particular dysfunction, whatever it may be. But the only way the word \"normal\" is being used is regarding sexuality. Hetero being the only healthy norm, and only then if hetero sex is based on equal respect and a true love for one another. \n\n \n Hetero is normal.\n Homo is abnormal. \n [Because a handful of passages in some ancient book says so. Never mind that nearly no one can agree on what this book is saying on numerous topics, or that some people don't care what it says. Never mind that by every other measure of what reasonable people accept as normal for everything else, homo is clearly normal]\n End of discussion.\n \n \n \nThe reason why the lines have been blurred today is because people have random sex based on a hedonistic and narcissistic need to satisfy some physical lust with no concern or desire to share a deeper love or commitment. It is animalistic at its basest level and those practitioners, whether they be straight or gay don't even realize how empty and shallow their attempts to find fulfillment this way is.\n\n \n \n Physical lust is a new phenomenom. Never existed before the 60's.\n All relationships and encounters prior to that were meaningful and only based on a desire for lifelong virtuous commitment. All sexual desire that exists outside this framework is bad and dirty.\n [Because a handful of passages in some ancient book says so. Never mind that nearly no one can agree on what this book is saying on numerous topics, or that some people don't care what it says.]\n \n \n \nThey don't call clubs meat markets because people go their to buy steaks ya know. There was actually a day and time in this Country when if women found out that a particular type of place was frequented so women could get picked up for sex; most women would avoid it like the plague as they understood that the type of men seeking those types of women aren't the type of men a good woman would want to marry anyway nor do men like that marry the types of women they find in such places.\n\n \n Back in the good old days (before the 60's) only men were lustful and women had no sex drives. Women are chaste are should not pursue any sexual satisfaction outside of a dutiful marriage. The men who frequent these meat markets will ultimately come around after they have sown their wild oats, and that is OK, because otherwise there would be no men to marry the chaste girls. Boys will be boys and girls should be girls. \n [Because a handful of passages in some ancient book says so. Never mind that nearly no one can agree on what this book is saying on numerous topics, or that some people don't care what it says.] \n \n \nBut today, no such levels of self respect even exists for the most part. This also explains why the divorce rate is so high also. Because people who marry no longer base their marriages on a solid foundation of love, commitment and trust. They justify marrying on the quality of the sex life and by how horny the girl or guy is.\n \n \n I blame sex as well as the gays for bad hetero marriages. \n Sex is the entire problem for all of society's woes. \n I have a problem with sex even though I have an infantile understanding of human sexuality. My attitudes about sex are that of a fifth grader. That is why I am obsessed about it. But I know sex for sex sake only is always bad.

I think that you give them far too less credit. \nPerhaps you are the one underestimating the childs ability to learn these things outside of school? Furthermore, the point is not whether the child can handle it but whether or not it needs to be taught at school. I also think you underestimate the job of the parent.\n \n \nWhat do you suggest that school officials do when students are abusing/ridiculing other gay students? Let it go because the issue is too touchy? Or perhaps try to prevent that abuse from ever happening by teaching children at a young age that homosexuality is no reason to judge someone.\nsuspend the students as they do whenever kids act stupid. I don't see us preaching about how kids with glasses are great whenever a kid with glasses gets beat up. If you wish to address a growing problem at a school then you tell the kid not to beat up someone because you disagree with them. I don't understand how it would ever get to a discussion on gay marriage or homosexuality in general as a moral issue.",

So everyone would make fun of them.\"\n \n And a former girlfriend of Charles Andrew Williams - who killed two classmates and injured 13 others at his California high school in March 2001 - reported that Williams was tormented by anti-gay harassment he experienced being the new kid at his high school.\nhttp://www.washblade.com/2005/4-15/news/national/boycode.cfm",

   "Yeah let's, and can you prove that all of those kids were out and known gays by their community rather than suffering alone because they didn't accept themselves for the feelings they were having ? Or that they were more afraid of telling and disappointing their parents ? It is so easy to blame gay bashing without even considering that natural social pressures of everyday life tells us all that being straight is the norm even if PC dogma is now pushing the normality of being gay.\n \n The reality is that all of those social pressures mean very little to a young teen who doesn't want to be different from the rest of his friends under any circumstances. Do your statistics clarify those internal issues that motivated those kids to commit suicide ? That would be a neat trick since the kids are dead.\n\n \n What is you point, Archangel? You speak of social pressures. Society can be anything we who are a part of it want it to be. Straight may be the norm, statistically, but that doesn't make it better. Do you mean \"norm\" meaning better; straight is good and anything that doesn't conform to that norm is less than heterosexuality? What do you think would come of giving gay kids that message? Is that why you wish to not take this teasing seriously. Funny, I thought you always said you cared about the person, and were concerned about actions.\n \n In fact rejection by family and friends is a factor in gay suicide--\n \n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=2609366&dopt=Abstract\n \n http://jar.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/477?ijkey=33c0ea8699eb3927e10f2a297aa4b434b3a51bcb&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n \n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=8192119&dopt=Abstract",

   "This insertion of social agenda along with basic education is one reason why other education movements are on the rise, such as private schools and homeschooling. The govt. has too much power when it comes to public education. The thing is, the same people who promote such would freak if it were something approaching religion that was being taught. So one would think they would WANT to let schools be purely for education rather than promoting social ideologies. Lest it come back and bite them in the arse.\n\n \n This does not make sense. The government provides public education, so of course it has power over it. Are you saying that a particular branch of the government has too much power over public education? Are you suggesting that the federal government has too much power in this area? Or the states? Or local governments? Is \"No Child Left Behind\" an example of too much federal government power, in your view? \n \n I have seen no evidence of a \"social agenda\" introduced into public schools beyond the agenda of teaching responsible citizenship and respectful behavior toward others. That is the agenda that I see being promoted in my local public schools, and I as a parent support that particular agenda. Oh, there is also the agenda of safety, which I support as well. I do not see our public schools promoting \"social ideologies.\" \n \n As for teaching religion, this is something the public schools may not do. It is unconstitutional for public schools to teach religion as doctrine, though teachers can teach about religion as a subject. If people want their children to learn religious doctrine, they can send them to a church or to a private school. But teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools is not allowed, and it should never be allowed.",

But I'm not surprised.\n\n \n Mass is a part of the USA and it directly affects us all if it happens there too. So don't even try to disregard the travesty of justice that is taking place there to kindergarteners and their concerned Parents in the name of GAY SOCIALIZATION, INDOCTRINATION AND NORMALIZATION. If this doesn't offend you then you don't have children.\n Summary of what happened\n \n On April 27, a Lexington, MA, parent, David Parker, was arrested by the Lexington police and charged with \"trespassing\" at his son's elementary school during a scheduled meeting with the principal and the town's Director of Education over his objections to homosexual curriculum materials. Parker had asked for notification and possible opt-out for his son for homosexual curriculum or ad-hoc discussions by adults in his son's kindergarten class. After several months of communication, he was repeatedly told that his requests are \"not possible.\" He finally said he would not leave the meeting until this was resolved.\n \n After being arrested and spending the night in jail, Parker was arraigned on Thursday, April 28, in Concord District Court. When he informed Judge Robert McKenna that he had not been allowed to call his lawyer, the judge scolded him for not being respectful. Parker was released on $1,000 surety bond. He was officially informed that he may not set foot on any school property in Lexington, or he will be arrested again for trespassing. A hearing was set for June 1, followed by court appearances on Aug. 2 and Sept. 19.\n \n New superintendent is no different. During the summer, Dr. Paul Ash took over as superintendent of Lexington Schools from William Hurley, who was serving in an interim capacity. On Sept. 22, Ash announced he was ordering teachers to give NO notice when discussing homosexual relationships with children, even in elementary grades. (see report below). Ash also continues to enforce the no-trespass order against Parker. At the Sept. 19 court appearance, Judge McKenna gave Ash an extra 30 days to decide whether to lift the ban, after Ash had complained he hadn't had enought time.\n \n \n Statement by David Parker (April 27, 2005):\n \n \"I, David Parker, am the father of a kindergarten student at Estabrook Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts. Since the beginning of this school year, my wife and I have learned that school materials and discussions about gay-headed households/same-sex union issues have been exposed to the children. There are definitive plans to increase the teacher/staff/adult mediated discussions of these subjects.\n \n \"We have officially stated on many occasions-to the Lexington school administration-a request that we be notified when these discussions are planned, and want our 6-year-old opted out of such situations when arising \"spontaneously\".\n \n \"Our parental requests for our own child were flat-out denied with no effort at accommodation. In our meeting on April 27, I, insisted that such accommodation be made and refused to leave the meeting room. I was informed that I would be arrested.\"\n \n \n \n Events leading up to the arrest\n \n Timeline of events and email exchange between Parkers and principal. \n Extremely enlightening. This is the timeline of events starting in January and leading up to the final meeting and arrest on April 27, 2005.\n \n Original book brought home by kindergarten class.\n Here's the book, \"Who's in a Family,\" that started it all. It came home with the Parker's kindergarten-age son in January. (Also, some of the books given out in other grades.)\n \n Parkers attend elementary school's \"Anti-Bias Committee\" meetings. \n Here's what the Parkers witnessed (and were told) -- a real eye-opener. In Massachusetts (and other places) much of a school's radical agenda gets in under the radar through these semi-official committes of radical teachers, administrators, and some parents, which operate outside of any formal oversight.\n \n Other family in David Parker's elementary school leaves town over homosexual agenda in school.\n David Parker is an unusual -- very special -- man, in that he was willing to stand up and fight for his rights. Unfortunately, too many parents feel so overwhelmed and or intimidated that they see their only option is to leave. (And this is exactly what the so-called \"diversity\" crowd likes to see happen!)\n \n The night before arrest: Parker addresses the Lexington School Committee with his concerns, gets ignored. \n The night before the final meeting (and arrest) David Parker spoke passionately before the School Committee about his situation. And they rudely ignored him. They wouldn't even give him the courtesy of a reply.\n \n \n The arrest and court appearance\n including meeting & negotiation with school officials\n \n The meeting and \"negotiation\" -- followed by arrest, jail, and court appearance (plus photos). \n Very dishonest tactics throughout, as the Superintendent pretended as if he were willing to reach a settlement with the Parkers, then at the end pulled the rug out and had him arrested.\n \n Following the arrest, Superintendent makes public statements to discredit and demean Parker. \n Read Superintendent's statements to the press, and his press release (sent with home with every child in the school). Unbelieveable.\n \n Superintendent sends letter to Parkers officially denying their request to be notified when adults discuss homosexuality with their son. \n Completely Orwellian - must be seen to be believed. Superintendent even gets the son's grade wrong (says \"first grade\" instead of \"kindergarten\"). It's clear he didn't actually read Parker's written request, since he continues to misstate concerns as primarily centering around the original book.\n \n Gov. Mitt Romney on television making statement in support of David Parker.\n ",

   "This is a predictable response. I believe they should have a talk with those who use terms such as \"fatty\" as well. They would have to address the issues directly related to plus-size people, educate, impart knowledge on this issue, and teach sensitivity. People, kids, need to know all the reasons why it is a bad thing to say. That is how education, and learning over a lifetime, works. That's what achieves long-term results. Punishment by itself has only limited, short-term benefits.\n\n \n So basically, you think schools should take the time, energy, and resources to deal with every motivation out there behind name-calling. Gee, wonder if we can fit some basic fact-based education in there too while we're at it. emoticon_rolleyes I can see it now ...

It's not an island all to itself, nor should it be approached that way. I can't help it if you need reminding of that sometimes. You bring up name-calling, so deal with name-calling.

The level of sophistication of analysis increases as children get older. When you learn to read you are not merely learning \"facts.\" You are learning communication and expression. I think you are trying to suggest that schools should teach information, not values, and I partly agree with you about this. But I think that schools also must teach children how to interact with others in ways that are productive rather than destructive, just so they can function socially. I suspect you would agree with that, as you have said that schools should stop the practice of bullying. And I think that we teach two important values in the very practice of educating children, which are the value of critical analysis of knowledge and the value of independent thinking.",

When my son was three I kicked his abusive, biological father out and divorced him. Since then we have never heard a word nor has he offered an ounce of support. Oh well, good riddance. However, when my son hit kindergarden he started acting out and was verbal about wanting a dad. I signed us up for Big Brothers of Minnesota and talked to congregation elders. Nobody at church seemed to have the time. But I kept praying.\n \n Two years later Big Brothers came through with a mentor. Great guy - patient, generous, loving, plays catch, goes fishing, helps me when I need it. Easily the best man I have ever known. He stayed committed to my son for nearly four years when we decided to make it legal. We went to court and this great guy legally became my son's father. My son is happier, more patient, and turning into an amazing young man. The amazing man our lives were blessed with is gay.\n \n When my congregation found out that I allowed a gay man to mentor my son I got plenty of criticism - but no offers to take on the role.\n \n At school one day a kid was using the word \"gay\" in a deragatory manner. My son asked them to stop because his dad was gay. The response from these kids from \"normal\" families was to throw him down on the bus, shove garbage in his mouth, and to threaten him with beatings if he even saw his own father again. Thats what these innocents have learned about being gay from society, church and home. In high school I knew gay kid who had his head pounded into a locker daily. You bet your XXX gay tolerance needs to be taught. \n \n Actions speak louder than words. We don't go to church anymore. And I have seen how a loving man behaves.",

I'd have just as much of a problem if it were someone bringing in moralistic values from their religion. It's the same thing--schools aren't for that purpose. You say you want students to be able to think on their own, but I suspect you wouldn't teach these children that some people don't agree with your take on gay relations, give them both sides, and tell them to make up their own minds. Would you? The reason you wouldn't is that your moralistic values are that YOUR way is the right one, and so you would be bringing your moralistic values into the classroom.\n\n Where exactly is the moralistic disagreement on the school message?\n Anti-gay bullying / Teasing?\n Gay tolerance?\n \n Can we explicitly spell it out with an example?",

   "Let me tell you guys a little about Christian love and grade-school from the perspective of my family.\n \n As many of you know, I used to be Christian. When my son was three I kicked his abusive, biological father out and divorced him. Since then we have never heard a word nor has he offered an ounce of support. Oh well, good riddance. However, when my son hit kindergarden he started acting out and was verbal about wanting a dad. I signed us up for Big Brothers of Minnesota and talked to congregation elders. Nobody at church seemed to have the time. But I kept praying.\n \n Two years later Big Brothers came through with a mentor. Great guy - patient, generous, loving, plays catch, goes fishing, helps me when I need it. Easily the best man I have ever known. He stayed committed to my son for nearly four years when we decided to make it legal. We went to court and this great guy legally became my son's father. My son is happier, more patient, and turning into an amazing young man. The amazing man our lives were blessed with is gay.\n \n When my congregation found out that I allowed a gay man to mentor my son I got plenty of criticism - but no offers to take on the role.\n \n At school one day a kid was using the word \"gay\" in a deragatory manner. My son asked them to stop because his dad was gay. The response from these kids from \"normal\" families was to throw him down on the bus, shove garbage in his mouth, and to threaten him with beatings if he even saw his own father again. Thats what these innocents have learned about being gay from society, church and home. In high school I knew gay kid who had his head pounded into a locker daily. You bet your XXX gay tolerance needs to be taught. \n \n Actions speak louder than words. We don't go to church anymore. And I have seen how a loving man behaves. #### God if he don't agree.\n\n \n wow, powerful story. Thank you for sharing. But I am sure you'll get some christian \"justification\" from the forum bigots. \n \n I was raised, in my teens, by two gay men (one who was our family doctor). I had physically abusive het parents. These men pretty much saved my life when I was a teenager. My older brother (who was gay) committed suicide from the bigotted abuse my parents bestowed upon him. Oh, did I mention my parents were pentacostal born-agains? lol\n \n I know first-handedly how screwed up religion can make people and how christer's can justify their evil from cherry-picking versus from the bible.\n \n The funny thing was, that my parents went to the church and told them that I ran-away from home. That I was abducted by the \"F@gs\". Of course, broken bones, a head contusion, broken arms, bruises and welts on my body could not be overlooked in court. Thank god for that... or I'd be with my dear brother right now. But my two fathers suffered some pretty grotesque prejudice because of their choice to help me. They had to come out in a conservative community to save me. But they survived and have told me they never thought twice about it. \n \n All my other siblings, I'm happy to say, ended up functioning members of society.... after lots of painful therapy to deprogram them from the christ-psychosis that was indoctrined upon them at an early age. We're all not close, but respectful.\n \n People like AA and his \"ilk\" are pretty scary. Not that I'd ever be afraid of them physically, but their mental blockage as to what is right and wrong is what is so astonishing. Does not bode well for the future.",

   "Actions Have Hurt Community (Anti- David Parker letter)\n Lexington Minuteman ^ | August 4, 2005 | Craig Cyr\n \n Posted on 08/04/2005 7:46:19 PM PDT by lexfreedom\n \n Letter: Actions have hurt community Thursday, August 4, 2005\n \n This is my perspective in the David Parker matter. Here's a little background. My wife, three daughters and I moved from California to Lexington in 2001. My daughter was a kindergartner with Mr. Parker's son this past year..\n \n We chose to move to Lexington after looking at a myriad of towns. We sought a community with a commitment to quality education and one that reflected our belief in openness, inclusion and diversity. This type of decision-making is based on \"the social economics of townships.\" Towns are differentiated with diverse values and services, thereby, providing consumer choice. Families are social consumers in this way. After becoming a member of this community, I expect to reap its benefits, i.e., openness and inclusion.\n \n I support Mr. Parker's right to his beliefs, but do not agree with either the premise or the structure of his proposal. His \"premise\" would result in the school having to marginalize the existence of some families. In its structure, his request is impractical.\n \n His wish to disrupt school activities, based on spontaneous discussions wherever his child is present with a resulting parent notification and the removal of his child from a school activity, is unworkable no matter what the subject matter. Without definitions of what discussions qualify as offensive to Mr. Parker, and without every adult in the school being made aware of both the student and the hazy definitions, how could the school possibly satisfy his desired outcome?\n \n I also have a hard time reconciling Mr. Parker's words with his actions. Instead of working to get a solution that could be accommodated, he had one proposal. Instead of running for School Committee to institute change through community channels, he chose to be an activist. He chose to be arrested. He chose to align himself with outside groups to obtain administrative, media, tactical, financial and legal support.\n \n He chose to use local, regional and national media to distort his case and denigrate Lexington. He chose to bring his crusade to communities as far away as Maine, just recently, speaking at the \"Wake UP Maine Tour,\" a statewide rally opposed to homosexual rights. These conscious decisions speak volumes.\n \n Mr. Parker's states he is \"anguished that his arrest has caused any pain to this community.\" His continued promotion of this crusade does nothing but cause the community anguish and pain.\n \n His actions speak louder than his words. \n \n Mr. Parker is an anti-gay activist. This letter tells the truth about what happened. Of course, a rightwing fascist pig like AA would see it differently.",

   "So basically, you think schools should take the time, energy, and resources to deal with every motivation out there behind name-calling. Gee, wonder if we can fit some basic fact-based education in there too while we're at it. emoticon_rolleyes I can see it now ... Day one is gay-awareness day, day two is obesity-awareness day, day three is race-relations day, day four is visual-aid-sensitivity day, day five is handicapped people sensitivity day, and on, and on, and on. The thing is, all those are noble causes, but the venue is misplaced. That's what I'm arguing. Not that society shouldn't deal with these problems.\n\n \n School doesn't exist in a bubble, as the problems with the name-calling show. Yes, we can fit facts into there. Education isn't just about learning facts, as others have responded. The whole person as part of the community is being educated, and must be taught creativity, social interaction, logical and critical thinking. Your argument is a false dilemma fallacy. It's another diversion. The choices are not limited to two: either teach only facts, or else only teach about society and its issues.\n \n \nWell, that's because issues gays face is only one issue among many in society; it's not the only one.\n\n \n Who said it is the only one? Strawman diversion.\n \n \nIt's not an island all to itself, nor should it be approached that way. I can't help it if you need reminding of that sometimes. You bring up name-calling, so deal with name-calling. Not just name-calling when it comes to gays. Deal with ALL name-calling and you cover that having to do with gays as well.\n\n \n It's very useful to name and discuss what it is you don't want others to say, and why. People must learn to empathize with their victims, therefore they must know about the victims.",

   "Actually, when issues related to gay people come up in my college classes, I DO say that different people have different views on such matters and that all viewpoints should be listened to and considered carefully. I do not in any way try to impose my beliefs about being gay or about gay rights on my students. That would be unprofessional, in my opinion. I am not in class to express my views. I am in class to teach my subject, which is history. I am usually reticent to tell students my views on things, and I do so only when they ask me directly. I always qualify my answers by saying that these are my personal views. There is a difference between presenting the scholarship and letting students debate and discuss historical issues and me telling them what I think personally. I also do not advocate for any political position, and I am always careful not to say negative or postive things about current political leaders, since it's not my job to do that. It's up to students to make up their own minds. The values that I bring to my college classrooms are values about how to think, how to analyze evidence, how to use primary and secondary sources, and how to write clearly and effectively. \n \n When it comes to the first few grades of elementary school, I think that students do need to learn how to behave with others, and that is clearly a major goal of early education: teaching students how to treat others in a social setting. If we just say, \"Let the parents do it,\" then we wind up with chaos in the classrooms, which is what in some cases we have now. I don't know how we as a society can effectively improve parenting, but we can work on the schools. I agree with you that ideally, parents will teach students how to behave, but we don't live in an ideal world, and if schools don't require good behavior, then no one can learn. This is not the same as \"moralizing\" in a broad sense, but it is teaching rules and how to act. \n\n \n Agreed that it's important to teach them how to behave toward others, but it seems to me that if they're calling other kids names, then make rules about name-calling and punish them when those rules are broken. The impression I get here is that some here feel that name-calling when it comes to gays is somehow more important in terms of prevention than any other issue, and I don't see why. Why is this the one issue we have to get to the root of \"prejudices\" with children in schools and not other areas? After all, kids commit suicide later over lots of issues related to self-esteem--it seems to me that if we're going to have a message for them, the message should be not to make fun of each other over ANYTHING, not just the gay issue. Now you may reply and say \"but we should do it with other areas too\", but if we start doing that with all other areas, our schools turn into social work clinics, and I just don't think that's what schools should be about. So basically, schools already have means in place (or should) to teach this way of behaving--it's called rules. If kids bully, they've broken the rules. Punish them. Is that not sufficient to take care of anti-gay bullying and name-calling in schools?\n \n \nAs for whether teaching \"morals\" is the same as teaching religion, it is not. Teaching religion in the public schools is specifically prohibited, and the Supreme Court has been quite firm on this. Teaching \"morals\" more broadly is not prohibited, and it is an open and contested question how much schools should teach in this area.\n\n \n Ok, then what if someone is teaching morals you don't like that aren't coming from their religion? A non-religious homophobe, for instance, teaching that gays are bad. The point is that teaching moralistic values in schools is just not a good precedent (religious or otherwise), because ultimately it comes down to someone's morals being given precedent. If we ARE going to teach moralistic values in schools then it needs to be something EVERYONE agrees with, and certainly not everyone does on gay-related issues. \n \n It's also interesting that you're drawing a distinction here between religion and morality, because I don't see you and others doing that in other areas, such as the president and other govt. officials legislating from his views of morality when those moral views come out of his religion. You can't have it both ways in terms of the 1st amendment. People have moral views as a result of all sorts of reasons, religion included. You probably wouldn't want someone teaching their moral view that gay sex is wrong, so I see no reason your view that living as a gay person, out, should be taught either. \n \n \nI tend to agree with you that teaching \"morals\" ought to be limited to teaching respect for others and good behavior. But if public schools teach some kind of civic virtue, that is not the same as schools teaching religious doctrine. The former is permitted; the latter has been ruled unconstitutional. \n\n \n There's a fine line there. And there's sometimes no line at all.\n \n \nBtw, I did not see the video posted by Archangel, because I have him on ignore. So I do not know what the content of this video is, or what kind of school setting the video captured. I will say that the rules for private schools are very different from the rules for public schools. Public schools cannot teach religion as doctrine. Private schools can.\n\n \n It's an interesting video, no matter how you feel on the issues. The school in the video IS a private school. However I do think it bring up the opportunity of discussing this issue in relation to public schools too.",

The problem as I see it is that too often schools have been unwilling to do anything at all about anti-gay bullying. The more we push to have this motivation for bullying taken as seriously as other motivations for bullying, the sooner we will have it stopped. Pretending that gay people do not exist certainly has not helped things. \n \n Is punishment for bullying enough? I don't know. If children don't know why the bullying they do is wrong, then they haven't learned anything. Maybe it is enough to teach that bullying others for any reason is wrong.

   "Yes, apparently you did. The point of my stance on the penguin book issue when that discussion took place was that I felt was a case of ulterior motive, not that it made homosexuality look normal. I wasn't saying it was bad for a book to make it look normal, but rather to masquerade as something else rather than just coming out and saying what the book was intended to do.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but this explanation does not make any sense to me. In your original post, you wrote that you objected to the use of this book because it made \"homosexuality look normal,\" and you thought that was an \"ulterior motive\" of someone, presumably either the authors or the educators who chose to use the book in school. Now you say that you did not object to the fact that the book made \"homosexuality look normal.\" You appear to contradict yourself here. \n \n Here is what you originally posted on this: \"The thing that bugs me about these sort of books is that they tend to have ulterior motives. The purpose is probably really for nothing other than, on some level, to try and make homosexuality a completely normal, socially acceptable matter rather than to be a book about penguins or really even the unusual case of 2 male penguins raising a baby (which would indeed be interesting in and of itself without viewing it as some sort of human social commentary about a moral issue).\"\n \n This statement from you sounds to me like an objection to the fact that you think the purpose of using the book is to make \"homosexuality look normal.\" But now you say that this is not your reason for objecting. \n \n If your objection is to what you regard as people having \"ulterior motives,\" who do you imagine has these ulterior motives? And if you are not objecting to a book making \"homosexuality look normal,\" what imagined \"ulterior motives\" are you objecting to?",

   "Agreed that it's important to teach them how to behave toward others, but it seems to me that if they're calling other kids names, then make rules about name-calling and punish them when those rules are broken.\n\n \n No one is saying we shouldn't make rules and punish.\n \n \nThe impression I get here is that some here feel that name-calling when it comes to gays is somehow more important in terms of prevention than any other issue, and I don't see why.\n\n \n Well, no no one said this, and you know it. You continue on and on with this strawman diversion fallacy, like a broken record. I guess it is all you have to say, as you have no logical argument. Gay opponents never have that. This is why they are losing debates in many societies, as gay acceptance progresses.\n \n \nWhy is this the one issue we have to get to the root of \"prejudices\" with children in schools and not other areas?\n\n \n No one is arguing that. Deal with problems as they come up!\n \n \nAfter all, kids commit suicide later over lots of issues related to self-esteem--it seems to me that if we're going to have a message for them, the message should be not to make fun of each other over ANYTHING, not just the gay issue. Now you may reply and say \"but we should do it with other areas too\", but if we start doing that with all other areas, our schools turn into social work clinics, and I just don't think that's what schools should be about. So basically, schools already have means in place (or should) to teach this way of behaving--it's called rules. If kids bully, they've broken the rules. Punish them. Is that not sufficient to take care of anti-gay bullying and name-calling in schools?\n\n \n No, it is not sufficient. Punishment, rules, can be deterrants. Anti-bullying education requires those doing the bullying develop empathy for the intended victim. This is the way to ensure the long-term, best results when dealing with this problem. In addition punishing, without explaining to the child why what he or she did is wrong, never works in the long-term.\n \n \nOk, then what if someone is teaching morals you don't like that aren't coming from their religion? A non-religious homophobe, for instance, teaching that gays are bad. The point is that teaching moralistic values in schools is just not a good precedent (religious or otherwise), because ultimately it comes down to someone's morals being given precedent. If we ARE going to teach moralistic values in schools then it needs to be something EVERYONE agrees with, and certainly not everyone does on gay-related issues.\n\n \n Teaching kids that gay people are worthy of basic dignity and respect, and giving positive and truthful representations of gay people to counter ignorance and hate and to teach empathy should not be considered too moralistic. This is one reason why I don't buy that your objection is to the gay behaviour and not the gay person.",

   "jito, read my post above that you quoted and allegedly responded to and show me where I said gays have no right to exist ? \n\n \n OK - see below\n \n \nLie to yourself if you like robbie, but don't lie to me. In order for homosexuality to make any sense to children this young, they must understand what it is and how it is different from what their parents do. They're going to ask what happened to the dad ? Why two moms, or dads ? \n\n \n Now - tell me how you reconcile what is implied by the statement above and your claim that you don't expect them to hide their existance? And please respond to the following points from my post.\n \n 1 - Why can the kindergarden children know about you, your wife and your family, but not my son, his dad and his dad's partners family?\n \n 2 - And just what do you expect children in gay families to do about their families? Lie? Be pulled from school? \n \n 3 - How do you figure that anyone \"doesn't have the right\" to show your children that there are those who do not agree with their faith/morals? I assure you, children in gay families are well aware that there are those who are in opposition to them. Just what makes you and yours so much more special? Point to a single point of law that calls for preferencial treatment in the favor of Christians.\n \n \nAnd who said anything about hiding ones existence ? All I'm saying is that the gay agenda has absolutely no right imposing their values and sexual reality on kindergarteners and first graders, especially against the will of those children's parents who are legally responsible for raising them and teaching them the life values they want for there kids. \n\n \n Nobody gives a damn what you think about gay sex and nobody is asking to teach kids about gay sex. But yes - these kids will have to learn that gay people exist, that they have families and despite how they feel about that, that they have to live in society with them, go to school with them, and are expected to treat them well. If this is beyond the cababilities of Christian children to handle then, as I already said, get the hell out of the public sector. We are not obligated to appease your faith. This is a secular society and government. Gayness being against your religion is your problem - and your's alone. Don't like it - stick to your church's and private schools that agree with you. \n \n I have no use for religion. Easy - I don't go to church and I do not tell people what to believe. You don't like that the diversity of a secular society is in opposition with your faith - keep out of it as much as you need to feel to. It is not up to us to make you comfortable.\n \n \nIf you can't see past your personal bigotry and limited perspective to appreciate that then I feel sorry for you in ways I can't even describe.\n\n \n Oh shut up. I so tired of Christians who think they are being persecuted every time someone does not share their faith. My son gets beat up and threatened for having a gay dad and you think you can talk to me about bigotry? \n \n \nI'll tell you this. They're alot smarter than the adults debating this issue who think they are learning that homosexuality is normal without learning what it is.\n\n \n Without question they are smarter. Than me - than you. Its why each generation is more tolerant. \n \n And enough with the little boy's quote already. Sounds like kid logic to me. Hating something you haven't tried is likely something most kids learn (how do you know you don't like brocoli if you have never tried it?). As you have well stated - these children have no idea how sexuality works. They are not going to have gay sex because they heard about gay people as a kid. I had a gay aunt and I never slept with a woman in my life. Please, find me a single adult source behind your big conspiracy theory - if a all you got is a kindergardner's quote - that's pretty weak.",

I'm not asking for generalities here (like \"gays exist\" or \"gays are worthy of respect\"), I'm asking for specifics. \n \n - How would you go about doing it? Examples might be a percentage of class time (which I'd like you give), or day or week of the year set aside for gays. Or something else? \n \n Maybe we can better discuss this and come to some common ground if the specifics are on the table here. After all, your ideas for values-based education here are pretty ambitious--anti-bullying education, anti-namecalling education, anti-prejudice (all kinds, I'm sure), teaching tolerance, etc. A lot of ground and time will have to be covered.\n\n \n You want me to design a detailed program that would fit every school, right here? I can't do that, and must to some extent speak in generalities.\n \n I don't see why these issues couldn't be covered in a day, maximum. If it takes a week or more, the school in question must have major difficulties.\n \n In fact, gay members of the community, perhaps someone's gay parents could be brought it and discuss how they are decent people who have loving families that function much like any other family.\n \n This could mean less time spent punishing. It takes time out of a teacher's schedule to sit in detention. The time the student is being punished, or expelled from school, isn't time spent learning.

   "What is your concern based on, Archangel? Why are you concerned about children being taught to respect and accept gays, insead of calling gay people hateful names?\n\n \n That isn't the issue and you know it Jake. It's about the age of these kids and the amount of info their getting about the practices of homosexuality. This isn't teaching cross cultural respect at all. It's teaching that homosexuality is right, normal and good for people and that is the great lie here. It's an unnatural lifestyle that afflicts approximitely 7% of the Worlds population. These people are to be cared about, respected and accepted fro who they are but not promoted as the normal, right and preferred lifestyle choice to make for anyone, especially kindergarteners and 1st graders. \n \n \nNow I see your concern when you make ignorant and hateful statements about my allegedly \"grubby hands\", and imply that I am a danger to children because I'm gay. They already know about gay people, Archangel. That's why they are using words like XXXXXX, and use the term gay to imply something inferior or negative about someone. It wouldn't be an issue, if your bigoted ideology didn't teach these things in one way or another. Gays represent something different, and inferior, not understood the way heterosexuality is, too horrible to talk about, unless maybe it is to put down those of us who are gay.\n\n \n What do you mean my gay ideology ? Are you implying I taught my daughters degrading terms about gays ? You would be very wrong. And again, you are attempting to relate what is indoctrination to teach that HOMOSEXUALITY is normal to be cultural respect which I would have no issues with. But they would then be teaching these kids about all aspects of accepting people for their differences, not just that being gay and having a gay family is right and totally normal.\n \n \nIn addition, they know about heterosexuality, basic things, that it's when a male likes a female. They can know basic things about homosexuality too, as I said, they already do. Knowing positive things won't harm them.\n\n \n Positive things as in all people are the same and deserve to be respected whether they are black, white, handicapped, boy, girl, or any type of minority, even if they are a sexual minority. If respect were taught like this, it would be different. But not a purely gay acceptance agenda with no concern for any of these other very real social ills. This is indoctrination designed to make homosexuality normal and right in the minds of children so don't try to make it sound like socially positive education when it isn't. If you respected what was right and normal you wouldn't be endorsing doing this to kindergarten and first grade age children. you would understand that waiting till they are older before putting this in their school curriculem would be the responsible thing to do.\n \n \nSexuality is important to how humans live and are. It shows up everywhere in many different ways. Naturally any discussion with young children should only go so far, whether its about when a male likes a female, or when a male likes a male, or a female likes a female.\n \n \n homosexuality is a fluke of nature that afflicts approximitely 7% of the human population. There is no justification for teaching it as anything different or more than that. We should be teaching compassion and respect for gays just as we teach compassion and respect for the handicapped.

However, that realization would humanize homosexuality and gay people too much in your mind.

It's also not such a horrible thing to try to love someone.\n\n \n It isn't my preocupation about gay sex to me Jake, How thick are you not to get that ? It's about a first grader already thinking such a thing firmly enough in his own mind to actually feel confident enough in that school to share it as a proper opinion. That 1st grader actually said that anyone who isn't willing to TRY, as in PERSONALLY TRY GAY SEX is PREJUDICED.

Just like religion, there's really no rational reason for having it there and treasuring it (any more so than religion). You can't quantify it. It's a matter of sacredness.

   "samiinh I can understand where your anger for religion comes from. But sometimes I do feel that it is misdirected. Many good people come from religious backgrounds. \n \n I may not agree with their beliefs but we have to have respect for their beliefs as long as they are leading good lives without intent on demeaning others such as you and I or other gays. \n \n Those that choose to use their religion as a vehicle for prejudice is where your disaproval needs to be directed. Making sweeping statements about all religion undermines what our country was founded on, the freedom to believe or not beleive in whatever one wants.\n \n I like you and think you are just to the point of returning the intolerance we feel back to them. Just focus your anger where it is deserved without such sweeping statements. \n \n I think an important part of them understanding our point of view is to also try to understand theirs. We don't have to agree, but giving respect is necessary in receiving repect. Again, I like you so please don't take this the wrong way.",

   "I may be influenced by some recent books I've read. One of them is Sam Harris' \"The End of Faith\". I think non-believers have given too much to believers over the years which gives them a sense of superiority which when one actually studies the events of organized religions, we see mostly death, hate, and evil.\n \n I'm sorry if some are offended by the truth. I do believe religion poisons everything. One only has to look at what is going on in the middle east, or in the catholic church to see that what I am saying is true.\n \n I realize there are millions for whom religion has provided comfort and peace. My ex-wife is one of them. People of faith need to know that there are others in this world who are offended by their self-serving righteousness. Historically, religion has had a powerful and highly respected position in our western societies. America is one of the few today where that is still true. You'd think we'd be smarter as a people with the knowledge we have today. It means something is missing within us that we need to turn to ancient writings and myths and legends and superstitions to bring some reality into our lives.

   "I would agree, OP, that there are progressives some who are Christian who have been instrumental in the fights for equality. Today is the anniversary of the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, NH, 1848. I grew up in Seneca Falls and graduated from high school there a long time ago.\n \n I recently read a book about early free thinkers in America, a book by a Susan Jacoby. It is interesting that the women involved in this movement were free thinkers and did not cowtow to religious bigotry.\n \n I will also gladly agree that there are many who live with their faith and are good people. But I also think one can be a good person and not have a faith in some supernatural being. The problem as I see it is that to make such statements can be offensive to those who are \"people of faith.\" They tend to want everyone to be like themselves. I think religion is repressive and restrictive, and I find the organized RC Church to epitomize evil. And all the rest of christianty stems from this organization.\n \n In the company I used to work for, we had a customer who was an evangilcal baptist minister. He'd come into our operation with his wife and two daughters. The wife and children wore clothing like you might have seen in the 1950s, and all three had smiles on their faces that made you wonder what kind of drugs they were on. Spacy smiles, if you get my drift. And all I could think of was which one of the daughters was the father doing!!!! It just radiated off them.

   "You are making way too much out of this. There is nothing at all wrong with being open to loving anyone, either a male or a female, whether or not one is male or female. The kid probably meant more along the lines that people are afraid of the unknown, like a different vegetable. He would not have an understanding of sexual acts, and it would be highly unlikely he was referring to that.\n \n \n This is a first grader Jake, so let's try not to attribute any deep philosophical understanding to him, ok ? The excuses and justifications you guys can come up with is unbelievable. And remember, this kid isn't coming up with these beliefs on his own. And neither did the so called responsible adult in charge of that class correct his error in any way. And my whole beef here is about Age Appropriate information being disseminated to prepubescent children and no one deals with that concern. If that class was taught sensitivity for all minorities, cultures, beliefs and types of handicapped people along with gays then I wouldn't be complaining here at all as that would be a good thing. But your cover excuse of Social sensitivity is sorely lacking as the gay version of sensitivity training strangely excludes all other minorities from the process and concentrates only on gay acceptance.\n \n \nYou are so concerned people will be so easily \"converted\", oh what an awesome myth that is, \"conversion\"! Where is this coming from, Archangel? Surely people who are secure in their straightness cannot be converted, unless they \"doth protest too much\". There is so much straight influence in society, I don't see how a straight person could be pressured to try to be gay, unless there is something inside that person that is homosexually oriented.\n\n \n You either refuse to get what I'm saying or are just incapable of getting it. What if you saw a video of a 1st grader in a private school saying in a class setting that anyone who didn't try having sex with girls was prejudiced, and the teacher didn't even correct him to say that the class was about sensitivity training, not to encourage trying sex with anyone ? Can you possibly comprehend what I'm trying to say here or are you lacking a moral center that you can't see how inappropriate this type of reasoning is for prepubescent children ?\n \n So in response to your allegation that I'm acting on fear rather than revulsion for the mental and emotional child abuse I see this to be. The answer is I'm not afraid of converting, but of creating kids who experiment with gay sex and LEARN that its acceptable so they stay with it. Tell me this Jake, is it natural for children to willingly kill, or strap on suicide bombs and kill masses of people with themselves ? I think not, yet children in Islam are doing it every day because adults they respect tell them it is right. So don't even try to tell me that children can't be indoctrinated to accept, endorse and participate in lifestyles and activities if taught they are right from a young age.",

   "Could you post some links that confirm that medical science thinks it's a good idea to teach prepubescent children enough about homosexuality that they come to believe that anyone unwilling to TRY IT is prejudiced cuz I'd really like to see that as that is the crux of the point I'm attempting to make here which you seem totally incapable of getting. \n\n \n That is not the claim I made. I said medical science says that homosexuality is not abnormal.\n \n \nThen answer me this jito, I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt and assume this kid was just projecting and had no idea what he was saying to all of his fellow classmates and their TEACHER in that setting that is on the video in post#1 on this thread. So tell me why the teacher never corrected him ? Nor any of the other kids in the class setting ? Why is that if he was wrong in that teachers opinion, and saying something that a responsible adult was there to correct or protect those young children from misunderstanding was nothing said to correct him at all ? Any takers on that one ?\n\n \n Maybe, unlike you, this teacher wasn't going to make a mountain out of molehill. Harping on details the children were not likely to understand would have turned it into a sex talk. Plus there is truth in the meat of the child's statement - it is wrong to hate something just because you don't understand it - something you (a grown man) have yet to figure out.\n \n \nThe reason why I have ignored your 3 questions is because they are irrelevant to any arguments I have made and are in fact misinterpretations of my arguments pertaining to this issue. \n\n \n My son attends school, has a gay dad and we are irrelevant to this? \n \n \nI haven't asked to hide gays, make them disappear or become invisible in any way. \n\n \n OK - then tell exactly what my son should and should not be allowed to say about his family.\n \n \nJust that young children not be taught enough about the gay lifestyle in such a tainted way so that a 6 year old say's with confidence that anyone who isn't willing to TRY IT is PREJUDICED. And not even be corrected by the adult in charge of the class. That is no better than promoting that all kids experiment with gay sex before deciding which type they prefer in my opinion. But any of this taking place with such young children is my major concern.\n\n \n And like I said - provide evidence of any educational material that this is being done and then we will talk. I am not going to go to battle over the comments of a six year old.\n \n \nIf we had straights in schools teaching the straight equivalent to this methodology I would be screaming just as loud, and have in sex ed debates.\n\n \n Well if we didn't have folks teaching that gays are immoral, lack a moral compas, are bad, reprobate, unnatural or wrong then this simply would be a non-issue all together. Like it or not, you have helped create hostility towards gays. This hostility is present in our school system and something needs to be done about that. Its not gays that created the need for this, its people like you. \n \n \nSo lay off of the bigotry accusations because the only bigots around here are the anti-christian bigots who think anyone with a moral compass and a heart to protect childrens innocence is trying to convert them.\n\n \n I never said you were trying to convert anyone. The fact that you think sex-ed does not belong in the kindergarden class-room or that you are a Christian are not why I think you are a bigot.",

   "\"By providing the educational community with IT'S ELEMENTARY, Chasnoff and Cohen have provided...college instructors, workshop leaders, facilitators, and social activists one of the most powerful and important resources available for initiating dialogue, encouraging individual self-development, and pushing forth toward educational and social change on a topic that too few have successfully accessibly addressed.\"\n EdChange Multicultural Pavilion \n \n \n IT'S ELEMENTARY is, to date, the most important film (and one of the most important pieces of work in any medium) available which addresses gay and lesbian issues in a grade school setting. Debra Chasnoff and Helen Cohen, the filmmakers, visited six elementary and middle schools in which teachers used a variety of techniques to introduce discussions about gay and lesbian issues in their classrooms.\n \n While the film is worth it's price for the teaching strategies employed and displayed by the educators whose classrooms were highlighted, the power of It's Elementary transcends teaching techniques and pedagogy. Chasnoff and Cohen broach topics that even people in the Multicultural Education community often find difficult to discuss. More importantly, the film challenges several assumptions made by educators and lay-people alike about student interest in, and ability to intelligently discuss, gay issues. And it does so in a way that is accessible, not intimidating, for viewers who most desperately need to be pulled into a discussion about gay issues as they pertain to self, school, and society.\n \n Even teachers and administrators who routinely hear students throw around terms like \"XXXXXX\" or \"gay\" tend to be more comfortable believing that those students are not ready to discuss the bigger implications of this \"name-calling,\" maybe because they, themselves, have never had an opportunity to engage in a dialogue about gay issues. Even as our society is becoming more comfortable exploring issues of race and gender, dialogue about sexual orientation remains taboo, even in many of the most liberal circles. In such a context and climate, the most critical assumption challenged by the film is that young students are not ready to discuss oppression, discrimination, and specifically, homophobia and heterosexism. This assumption is shattered in the unforgettable opening sequence through a manufactured exchange of ideologies between a Congressman who prefers such topics to be left out of the classroom and a group of elementary school students who demonstrate that they're not only ready to discuss it, but that they may be more ready than a hefty percentage of adults. Then, throughout the rest of the film, the students continue to demonstrate and reiterate their readiness.\n \n By providing the educational community with It's Elementary, Chasnoff and Cohen have provided me and other college instructors, workshop leaders, facilitators, and social activists one of the most powerful and important resources available for initiating dialogue, encouraging individual self-development, and pushing forth toward educational and social change on a topic that too few have successfully accessibly addressed.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"[It's Elementary] serves as a model for educators who want to deal with the subject of lesbians and gays but don't know where to begin.\"\n Barry Walters\n San Francisco Examiner \n \n Full Review:\n \n Taking Gay Issues Into Classrooms; Documentary It's Elementary Designed to Enlighten Teachers, Parents, and Administrators\n \"What we found is that by third grade almost all children have already been exposed to information about gay people,\" documentary filmmaker Debra Chasnoff in regard to her latest project, It's Elementary:Talking About Gay Issues In School. Chasnoff, who won the best short documentary Oscar in 1992 for Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment is obviously no stranger to controversy. \"We want to influence the kind of public debate that has heated up around teaching kids about gays and lesbians,\" says collaborator Helen Cohen of the film that will have its world premiere June 5 at the Herbst Theater. \"We'd like to inject a little sanity, as well as inspire educators who need to recognize they have a responsibility to make schools a safe place for everyone, where issues like prejudice and homophobia can be addressed.\"\n \n The result is what could become one of the most important films ever devoted to lesbian and gay issues. Chasnoff and Cohen's 75 minute film is designed to enlighten teachers, parents and administrators how to teach elementary and middle school students about lesbians and gays.\n \n By going into the classroom with teachers and students from the first to the eighth grade, Chasnoff and Cohen demystify an issue that has become a rallying point for the right to create an unnecessary hysteria that paralyzes schools, worries parents and confuses students. No matter how informed you think you may be about homophobia and what is or is not appropriate for children to discuss, it is another thing entirely to watch 6-7 and 8 year old kids talk about how they don't like being called names like \"XXXXXX\" and think it's unfair that two men or two women shouldn't be able to get married.\n \n As they point out themselves, kids already have been exposed to ideas about gay people on the news, in movies, during talk shows and from their parents. They don't see what the big deal is about discussing those issues in school. \"The youngest kids have a sense of fairness and a kind of instinctual philosophy about gay people,\" says Cohen. \"As they grow older, they become more difficult to reach because of the negative things they've picked up.\" \"When you talk about lesbian and gay issues in the classroom, \" explains Chasnoff, \"people immediately think teachers are talking about sex because the right has programmed us to think that way. We found that elementary kids aren't interested in all that, but they are concerned about name-calling, issues about families that don't consist of one mommy and one daddy as well as examining stereotypes about lesbians and gays. The kids are often much more relaxed about the topic than their parents.\"\n \n The locally based team went into the classrooms of seven schools, both public and private, in New York, Madison, Wis., Cambridge, Mass., and San Francisco. It was difficult to find schools that would welcome the filmmakers, and some students were kept home by their parents on the days that the cameras would be in the schools. What did get onto film is not only impressive for how sophisticated and rational the discussion is among students, but also for the clarity and ingenuity of the teaching. The combination serves as a model for educators who want to deal with the subject of lesbians and gays but don't know where to begin.\n \n The film starts with Sen. Robert Smith (R-N.H.) talking about gay people as \"filth\" and \"trash,\" then cuts to a fourth-grade class in New York brainstorming about what comes to mind when they hear the words \"lesbian\" and \"gay\" and where they get their ideas from. Clips of \"Home Alone 2,\" \"Kindergarten Cop\" and \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" - all PG movies popular with kids - follow with characters spouting homophobic remarks. First- and second-graders from Madison then share a book they've created about gays and lesbians. A parent who says she doesn't approve of homosexuality says that the fact that the topic comes up in school allows her to broach the subject at home and share her own views.\n \n Although a handful of teachers involved in the project came out to their students, most of them are straight and have learned to be at ease dealing with the subject. As one points out, straight teachers are possibly more likely to feel safe talking to students about gays and lesbians because they can't be accused of \"recruiting\" children to their \"lifestyle,\" as the right fears. Minority women point out that it was important for them to overcome their own biases and make the classroom comfortable for children of different backgrounds, including those with lesbian or gay parents, particularly because they know first-hand what it's like to feel discrimination.\n \n Although the final cut of the film was finished only days ago, the pair created a trailer for the film and showed the footage to 500 educators around the country. \"They were absolutely beside themselves,\" remembers Chasnoff. \"They demanded copies of the film right now!\" While sifting through the hours of footage, it did occur to the filmmakers that conservatives might seize the film as an opportunity to further distort the issue. \"We had to put that aside,\" says Cohen. \"Anything can be taken out of context, even this film.\" \"I wanted to take an optimistic approach,\" Chasnoff elaborates. \"We can stop being on the defense. I would love to sit and watch a right-wing group see this film and explain why this topic should be censored. I want them to tell me why a student can't have his or her questions answered, why a little girl shouldn't be allowed to read an essay she wrote about her two mommies. Personally, I don't welcome an attack. But I do welcome a real dialogue about why this issue is perceived to be so dangerous.\"\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"...a sterling production...highly recommended for parents, educators, and other adults.\"\n 4 stars\n Booklist \n \n Full Review:\n \n This enlightening program eavesdrops on activities and discussions about gay issues in various elementary and middle-school classrooms across the country. While this might seem like a fiery topic for a grade-school curriculum, the emerging theme is respect, tolerance, and acceptance rather than sexual orientation. In a New England Quaker school, gay pride activities include assembly programs and picture-book readings, while New York City third-graders listen to their classmate read a winning Mother's Day essay about her two lesbian mothers. A Wisconsin teacher shares artwork and photographs with his class as he introduces the contributions of such well-known homosexuals as pop singer Melissa Etheridge and artist Michelangelo. A photography exhibit about gay and lesbian families is well received at another school, despite initial reservations from both faculty and parents. Selected film, television, and newsreel clips and occasional interviews add dimension, but it is the low-key classroom footage (and blase response from students, who seem more accepting than reactionary adults) that is memorable. This sterling production from Debra Chasnoff (Deadly Deception [BKL F 15 93]) and Helen S. Cohen is highly recommended for parents, educators, and other adults.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"IT'S ELEMENTARY does a lot to cool down one of education's hottest potatoes... (it) should be consoling to parents who are eager to raise good-hearted children but who can't imagine how this topic can be addressed in class.\"\n Editorial, Minneapolis Star-Tribune \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"A challenging, wonderfully provocative piece which offers a highly engaging forum for discussion of many issues concerning schools - like what's 'appropriate' subject matter and how to combat the most basic kinds of intolerance.\"\n Andrew Garrod\n Chair, Education Department, Dartmouth College\n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"Groundbreaking - a 'must-see' for educational policy makers everywhere.\"\n Luis O.

   "But you do it constantly. And you don't \"challenge\"; rather you say mean-spirited things. You are to religion what Archangel is to gay rights, here anyway. And just like AA, at some point it becomes obvious you have a bigotry problem. Let me remind you that when you say mean things about religious people in general (as you just did in the post I'm responding to), you're putting down people like Martin Luther King Jr., and members of Soulforce, like Mel White. That's what I don't think you get. Nor do I think you realize the gravity of how sacred religion is to some people, or you'd surely not be so mean as to belittle it or at least you'd make some effort to limit it to the people who are anti-gay. I've used this analogy before, but it's like someone going into a widow's home who has a funeral urn on the mantle of her husband's remains (and keeps it there because it's sacred to them) and then the visitor starts belittling it and telling her she is psychotic for treasuring it and considering it sacred. Just like religion, there's really no rational reason for having it there and treasuring it (any more so than religion). You can't quantify it. It's a matter of sacredness. You might easily call their sacred view of it as \"superstitious\" and \"insane\" or \"psychotic\" or any of the mean-spirited things you've said, but you'd be very cold and callous to do so, just like you are cold and callous over people's adherence to their sacred religion.\n\n \n Applying jyoshu's logic on gays to that:\n \n Perhaps the actions of the person who has the urn are being criticized, and not the person. People can't be expected to accomodate everything that comes along, or to be accepting of every behaviour that comes along. It doesn't matter that this is important to the humanity of the person in question(the way we mourn our dead and beliefs), and he or she is not harming anyone. We can't be expected to be accepting of everything that comes along, even if we have empathy for them as a human person. Why is this issue more important than every other issue?",

As to the first sentence, the only opinion that matters regarding how we interpret the bible is Gods opinion as to what He intends for us.

His truth. That is all that matters in the end.\n \n As to the second bolded sentence, You have defined perfectly in your explanation how the WORLD/THE NATURAL MAN perceives and determines their moral center/compass. Not so with believers. We determine what Gods will is for our lives and seek to be as obedient as possible to Him at all times in how we live our lives. That is why when i share opinions based on my moral compass, so many take offense as if I'm demanding they live as I do. But all I'm stating is what God requires of us according to His will. But each person must be responsible for their own choices in life. And they will in the end whether they admit His authority over us or not. \n \n \nMy point is that the distinction is not based on what Jesus taught, the breaking of the sabbath rules was justified by the need to help someone, I read that as Jesus saying that all the laws are subject to the commandment to love one another.

And that is that the Mosaic Law was created for MAN, not that MAN was created for the Mosaic Law. At the time that He was here, Jews wouldn't even stop walking down the road on the Sabbath to help a dying person laying in the road. They had lost all perspective about what the Law represented and had become slaves to it rather than allowing it to be a moral guide to show them how to live within Gods will.\n \n This is no different than what cultural christians do today by using the NT as a weapon to justify their lifestyles by interpreting it according to their comfort zones. And Jo, you are being a total hypocrite if you say adultery breaks Gods Law to love one another but homosexuality doesn't. You are placing your human understanding above Gods as you imply He doesn't get it. Because Jo, It was God who condemns the act of homosexuality, not me or any other bible believing Christian like me. By rejecting His truth you are rejecting Him and questioning His omniscience.",

But it is not acceptable to throw the proverbial stones at those who do not share your views. I have no desire to share the pedestal that you attempt to create for yourself here. Your words here are degrading to many. You are aware of this and it would be wrong for you to deny. \n \n What of those, like myself, who just lead typical lives? The typical work day/week. The typical trips to the grocery. The typical monthly payment of the bills. Yet this one miniscule aspect of these typical lives puts some into a frenzy - polite or otherwise. There are some of \"us\" that have these typical lives and the only aspect that seems to be of regard is whom we share a pillow with at night. You tend to qualify what is acceptable - based on beliefs that are not shared by many. THIS IS MY CONCERN. Provide something valid to all. Provide some sort of thinking and input to which everyone can relate. There are many that are not aware of the words of the Bible and will probably never be.\n \n It is unfortunately interesting to me that you write \"the only opinion that matters regarding how we interpret the bible is Gods opinion as to what He intends for us.\" You are confirming my thoughts with that phrasing. \"The only opinion that matters is how we interpret the Bible.\" If I failed to indicate this, I am now. Who are we to interpret anything? Who are we to interpret Gods opinion or intentions? You and I can be provided identical information and interpret it as we want. Our interpretations are not absolute truth. I am no more qualified than you to interpret the thoughts and words of another - neither present day nor past. In your response to me - \"all I'm stating is what God requires of us according to His will.\" Again, interpretation. And again, my thoughts of interpretation are applicable. \n \n I do not foresee your beliefs ever being mine - nor mine yours. And this is fine. This quality makes us individuals. While this individualism makes for pleasant (and unpleasant) discussion, I do not foresee a common end point for either of us. I will continue to love as I do and you will continue to degrade me in the name of a religious belief that is not shared universally. And we both will continue to express our individualism. You deem what is right based on the words of others / the words of the Bible. I deem myself as right because I am a hard-working man who takes care of his family, his friends, his home and especially the one he loves. If this makes me immoral in your opinion, then I will continue to be immoral in your opinion - yet happy in mine. At the same time being loved by those close to me. \n \n So I revert to my submission earlier today. What is the real goal? To waste our energies trying to change things that need not be changed? To waste our energies focused on the lives of those we do not know and those who have little to no consequence on our lives? These should be rhetorical questions but now I am squeemishly interested in a response.",

The thing is though, from the Christian POV, Jesus created the law to begin with. He was God, and there from the beginning. (John chap.1) You could say, he basically owned it. So He wasn't exactly bound by it anyway. He was the fulfillment of it, though. \n \n \nIn summary, *we don't follow the law cause Jesus didn't* causes more philosophical problems than it solves...\n\n \n That's not what I said.

Jesus said we interpret the law according to loving God and loving each other. (Jo pointed this out earlier and he is correct on that.) And, there is clearly a difference in the law, where some are morally-based having to do with human relationships, and others that are more ceremonial and having to do with the whole Judaic clean/unclean thing (which the pork issue falls under). Look, it's complicated. Entire books have been written about what you're asking about. But I believe that what I'm telling you (though brief) is correct. \n \n \nSay whaaa?\n We're talking NEW Testament here Jyoshu.\n\n \n That's odd, because I could have sworn we were talking about the Biblical law (which is OT). emoticon_confused \n \n \nCan you point to the bible verse which distinguishes?\n\n \n No. The distinction there is by default--if some laws pertain to moral actions (they do) and some to ceremonial actions (they do), then obviously, there's a distinction. You don't need a 'freaking Bible verse to tell you that--you can glean it by reading the OT law and using your brain. Just like in modern-day state laws, you shouldn't need a third defining statement somewhere differentiating between theft laws and homicide laws--the distinction is already clear by just reading the laws!\n \n Now, that's all I'm going to say on this here. Foundit, As I told Saminh, you should start a thread in the religion forum if you're wanting to keep discussing this.",

   "Well I never said he kept it perfectly. The thing is though, from the Christian POV, Jesus created the law to begin with. He was God, and there from the beginning. (John chap.1) You could say, he basically owned it. So He wasn't exactly bound by it anyway. He was the fulfillment of it, though.\n\n Interesting perspective. Thoroughly inconsistent with every other account I've heard of Christian dogma, which insists that Jesus had to keep the law perfectly in order to fulfill the \"covenant\".\n \n \n \nThat's not what I said. The founder of the religion made the statement \"the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.\" It's not a matter of mimicking Jesus, it's a matter of going by what he SAID, in that case.\n\n And the fact that it contradicts Mosaic law application can easily be ignored because it was Jesus.\n And the fact that Jesus hadn't fulfilled the law yet would probably be more of a minor technicality...\n \n \n \n(As an aside, It's interesting how those who argue against Christianity can sometimes be more fundamentalist with the law than those they argue against!)\n\n Interesting way to spin that. Especially since I am not asking for people to ABIDE by these fundamentals, but rather simply asking why they are NOT abiding by the fundamentals.\n It's a demonstration of how certain aspects of the bible are abandoned based on reason.\n It's a demonstration of how certain aspects of the bible STILL EXIST in the bible, but Christians ignore them.\n \n \n \nJesus said we interpret the law according to loving God and loving each other.\n\n Citation?\n \n \n \nAnd, there is clearly a difference in the law, where some are morally-based having to do with human relationships, and others that are more ceremonial and having to do with the whole Judaic clean/unclean thing (which the pork issue falls under).\n\n It's funny how you casually claim a \"clear difference\", when the difference is anything but clear.\n Nor is it clear where Jesus supposedly advocated abandoning what you call \"the whole Judaic clean/unclean thing\"...\n ... with the exception of noting that you have casually tried to switch my question on TOUCHING PIGSKIN with a different issue of \"pork\".\n \n You try to be sly, don't you...\n \n \n \nLook, it's complicated. Entire books have been written about what you're asking about.\n\n Entire books to justify its absence in the bible?\n \n \n \nThat's odd, because I could have sworn we were talking about the Biblical law (which is OT). emoticon_confused \n\n I think the confusion is yours because YOU are the one who wants to limit it to Biblical \"law\".\n HERE is what I said in my statement:\n How about the application of the standards on women inferiority and cannot take authority over a man?\n \n And then YOU replied specifying \"law\", when previously in the conversation we had been talking about MORALS.\n It's the old bait-and-switch, where I was talking about one thing and you try to come in and insist we narrow the focus for no real reason other than its more convenient for you to make an argument out of the fact that what I am saying isn't consistent with your narrowed focus...\n \n Now then, BACK to the actual issue which you have been trying to dodge.\n Why don't Christians adhere to this standard?\n Why do Christians allow female school teachers to teach male students?\n Female college professors to teach men?\n \n \n \nNo. The distinction there is by default--if some laws pertain to moral actions (they do) and some to ceremonial actions (they do), then obviously, there's a distinction.\n\n And I'm still waiting on substantiation on ANY of this.\n Not to mention the fact that, like I said, the passages on homosexuality have been associated with CEREMONIAL actions. Which would tend to open up a whole new mess...\n \n \n \nYou don't need a 'freaking Bible verse to tell you that--you can glean it by reading the OT law and using your brain.\n\n 1) And in the manger was born \"Christian Apologetics\".\n 2) Actually, the main thrust of all this is NOT whether or not you can sub-categorize these morality statements, but rather WHERE in the new testament the entire category of \"ceremonial actions\" were done away with.\n 3) Again, interesting how you changed the focus from addressing THAT issue, to instead trying to focus on whether or not we could sub-divide these items of morality.",

   "WASHINGTON - Truth Wins Out today called a lawsuit settlement between Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX) and Arlington County (Virginia) schools a capitulation that puts the health and well being of students at risk. The agreement allows PFOX to hand out pseudoscientific fliers at middle schools that will urge students to visit a website that refers them to a troubled counselor who was permanently expelled from the American Counseling Association. \n \n \"Arlington County failed in its responsibility to protect students and ensure that they are not harmed by disreputable therapists or dangerous practices,\" said Truth Wins Out's Executive Director Wayne Besen. \"The content provided by PFOX is medically reckless and morally reprehensible and no school system should have a hand in its distribution.\"\n \n Truth Wins Out contends that by focusing on the phony question of equal access, Arlington County missed an opportunity to win this case by pointing out that PFOX is a discredited group that is driven by Richard Cohen, a bizarre therapist who was permanently expelled by the American Counseling Association. Cohen's peculiar brand of therapy includes banging a tennis racket while yelling a parent's name, caressing clients who sit on his lap and blaming the angry spirits of dead relatives for causing homosexuality. \n \n \"It is clear that if the methods practiced by Cohen had been made central to this legal battle, PFOX would have been railroaded out of court,\" said Besen. \"Even conservatives would have recoiled when they saw Cohen's methods as displayed on national television. Arlington County could have made a strong case that they have a duty to protect vulnerable children from the predatory therapies promoted by PFOX.\" \n \n Well, here's one school that has capitulated to the right wing fascists that is going to allow these snake oil sales men make things even tougher for young gay kids.",

   "Agreed that it's important to teach them how to behave toward others, but it seems to me that if they're calling other kids names, then make rules about name-calling and punish them when those rules are broken. The impression I get here is that some here feel that name-calling when it comes to gays is somehow more important in terms of prevention than any other issue, and I don't see why. Why is this the one issue we have to get to the root of \"prejudices\" with children in schools and not other areas? After all, kids commit suicide later over lots of issues related to self-esteem--it seems to me that if we're going to have a message for them, the message should be not to make fun of each other over ANYTHING, not just the gay issue. Now you may reply and say \"but we should do it with other areas too\", but if we start doing that with all other areas, our schools turn into social work clinics, and I just don't think that's what schools should be about. So basically, schools already have means in place (or should) to teach this way of behaving--it's called rules. If kids bully, they've broken the rules. Punish them. Is that not sufficient to take care of anti-gay bullying and name-calling in schools?\n \n \n \n Ok, then what if someone is teaching morals you don't like that aren't coming from their religion? A non-religious homophobe, for instance, teaching that gays are bad. The point is that teaching moralistic values in schools is just not a good precedent (religious or otherwise), because ultimately it comes down to someone's morals being given precedent. If we ARE going to teach moralistic values in schools then it needs to be something EVERYONE agrees with, and certainly not everyone does on gay-related issues. \n \n It's also interesting that you're drawing a distinction here between religion and morality, because I don't see you and others doing that in other areas, such as the president and other govt. officials legislating from his views of morality when those moral views come out of his religion. You can't have it both ways in terms of the 1st amendment. People have moral views as a result of all sorts of reasons, religion included. You probably wouldn't want someone teaching their moral view that gay sex is wrong, so I see no reason your view that living as a gay person, out, should be taught either. \n \n \n \n There's a fine line there. And there's sometimes no line at all.\n \n \n \n It's an interesting video, no matter how you feel on the issues. The school in the video IS a private school. However I do think it bring up the opportunity of discussing this issue in relation to public schools too.\n\n \n \n \nNo one is saying we shouldn't make rules and punish.\n \n \n \n Well, no no one said this, and you know it. You continue on and on with this strawman diversion fallacy, like a broken record. I guess it is all you have to say, as you have no logical argument. Gay opponents never have that. This is why they are losing debates in many societies, as gay acceptance progresses.\n \n \n \n No one is arguing that. Deal with problems as they come up!\n \n \n \n No, it is not sufficient. Punishment, rules, can be deterrants. Anti-bullying education requires those doing the bullying develop empathy for the intended victim. This is the way to ensure the long-term, best results when dealing with this problem. In addition punishing, without explaining to the child why what he or she did is wrong, never works in the long-term.\n \n \n \n Teaching kids that gay people are worthy of basic dignity and respect, and giving positive and truthful representations of gay people to counter ignorance and hate and to teach empathy should not be considered too moralistic. This is one reason why I don't buy that your objection is to the gay behaviour and not the gay person.\n\n \n JakeCJB, I'm just catching up on the forum and came across the bolded you directed to Jyoshu. That hits the nail on the head.. his refusal to specifically address gay bullying, educate children about gays etc.. does not AT ALL fit his talking point of \"it's not about the gay its about the behaviour\". \n That doesn't make sense does it? If you are not against the gay only the behavior, then why so many objections to so many issues that are related to only the person not the behaviour.",

   "As promised I have now viewed the It's Elementary video. It shows how a handful of grade and middle school classrooms discussing gays and lesbians. \n \n One of the main excersizes is simply telling the kids to brainstorm - write down whatever comes to their minds when they think of gays and lesbians. They then tackle the items that are stereotypes and address where they learned them. It then shows how very prevelant negative images and language about gays can be found all over the place, on TV and in films (even those aimed at children).\n \n They also talk to students about using negative gay-oriented names (i.e., f*g) or using \"gay\" as an insult.\n \n One teacher also told his students about well-known artists, musicians, academics and politicians who were gay/lesbian to show that they are like anyone else and contribute positively to society and history.\n \n There were a couple of grade school students who spoke about their gay families or teachers.\n \n One teacher did a great visual metaphor for the kids about how much harder it is for him to be a good person/friend/teacher when he has to worry about hiding the fact that he is gay. (He used a soccer ball - and showed how hard it would be to play hiding one of his legs.)\n \n They also showed the teachers discussing it and their various levels of comfort. \n \n They showed news reports that reported on the high number of suicides by gay youth and the fact a huge number of gay-hate crimes are perpetrated by teens. Those stats and wanting to create a environment where all their students could feel safe to be who they are or speak about their family were why it was felt that this type of tolerance education was important.\n \n Now for the accusations.\n \n It is not indoctrination. Most of the teachers were straight and the video also showed the reasonable arguments of those who had concerns about whether/when this was appropriate for kids. (It also showed some very ugly actions/words/reactions from some anti-gay rights activists.) \n \n Many of the kids did voice their discomfort with it and were not belittled for that at all. One of the rules before engaging in the discussion was \"there are no wrong answers.\" The older kids debated the age-appropriateness of the material and gay marriage.\n \n Sex was not discussed. As a matter of fact, when one middle school student asked a gay guest speaker how he \"did it\" the speaker said he was not allowed to speak about his sex life, that it was not appropriate nor was it the topic at hand.\n \n Now for the controversial vegetable metaphor. The little boy was NOT suggesting that everyone try gay sex. His class was reading a story called My Two Mums about a little girl who told her teacher that she had two moms and the teacher got angry and told her that she couldn't have two moms. The teacher reading the story then asked the kids in her class how they thought that made the little girl in the story feel. That is when the little boy said that if the teacher were more opened minded she maybe could understood that it was possible for this little girl to have two moms. When asked what he meant by \"open-minded\" he came up with vegetable metaphor. It had nothing to do with gay sex at all.\n \n There was one teacher who I thought verged on being a tich political - but overall it was an excellent video - and even I learned some things. \n \n And - there is no hiding this. Kids know about homosexuality - they just all too often have misinformation. But the main thrust of the video is that regardless of what kids or their parents think about homosexuality, kids are aware, it is impacting schools and its OK to talk about.",

This is an all boys, selective high school environment, predominantly of asian background, where naturally you have these kind of ratios. Needing glasses or being gay was something accepted as an inherent part of a person. Being overweight was seen as a deficiency in personality, like \"You XXXXX, why are you eating that cake, don't you know you're fat, you stupid idiot? Eat a salad or something\". etc.\n \n Your experience may differ but to suggest gay students are always and everywhere bullied more than others is a baseless generalisation.",

   "A warning to all people of conscience as what you're about to see is very blatant and disturbing. It reveals the active and conscious agenda of the Gay Movement to indoctrinate our youth while they are most impressionable. While they are too young to discern the vile values being propagated as right and normal. What kind of people is it who would willingly rape the minds of children by stealing their innocence in such an intrusive and deceptive way ? \n \n And of course in the second video he brings up the gay marriage issue so as to soften the children up so they will someday accept it without question as normal and right. Now if this discussion were taking place in a College class room called Sociology, i would have no objections. But when young children in Grammar schools are being actively and purposefully indoctrinated, it makes my blood run cold. \n \n The reality is that if homosexuality was right, normal, natural and good then why must they attempt to brain wash children who are too young and innocent to even understand what sex is ? Why must they be told that this type of sex is normal if it really is ?

Now here is an excerpt from that book review you posted.\n  it offers many perspectives on the various aspects of elementary education and the myriad ways it is heterosexist. \n In the first chapter James T. Sears proposes several ideas that appear throughout the book: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n So first it defines and labels elementary education without gay indoctrination as heterosexist creating a them VS us atmosphere upon which to build the second part, which is to indoctrinate grammar schoolers to, and I quote: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n \n In other words, indoctrinating young children to believe that homosexuality is right and normal activity that is no different than straight sexual activity. Well at that age I don't want schools teaching anything about any sexual activity, and no matter how much they water this review down for adult consumption, the book takes a pro gay and justification stance and is definitely crossing the line of fitting the definition of indoctrination when it is the schools job to educate, not indoctrinate. I repeat my argument and the reason for this thread and insist that to deny the very clear and obvious evidence that has been posted is to deny the truth of what the gay agenda is in reality.\n \n And click on this link at your own discretion because it is disgusting, then scroll down the page to see what our middle school age kids are being exposed to. Is this what you call being taught to be tolerant?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html\n \n And here is a book that is read to second graders. I dare you to tell me this is teaching tolerance and not that homosexuality is good, right and NORMAL?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html\n \n So I repeat my previous statement:\n \n These schools have no right to impose these values on other peoples children is my point.

I can see that when you fear a God that will kill you for straying from His idotic rules freedom and love can be so scarry. :xbanghead\n\n \n More useless off topic irrelevant minutia, huh Matthew? The schools job is to educate, not indoctrinate toward any sexual preference at all. That is the point of this thread and is the only reason your side has gone off on every conceivable tangent possible in order to divert attention from the real topic of this debate, which is that the schools have no right, authority or responsibility to teach our children about sex at all, whether it be straight or gay.

How you can possibly ignore multiple separate pieces of evidence just proves you have no interest in objectively judging the obvious agenda being played out with our youngest, most innocent members of Society as the pawns for the gay agenda to normalize in the future what is seen as abnormal and unnatural behavior today. \n \n Are you a parent Penfold? Do you really want your middle schooler introduced to what the first link below shows? With addresses of gay hot spots to follow on the same booklet that lists and then explains the most perverted sexual acts imaginable? Does that not infuriate you as a parent? And if not, then what does that say about your moral center, or should I say the lack of any moral center, or your parenting skills as a protector and a nurturer of your own children. \n \nThere is no martyr complex on my part at all TQ and I resent the implication as it is a totally fallacious statement based on my last post. Now here is an excerpt from that book review you posted.\n  it offers many perspectives on the various aspects of elementary education and the myriad ways it is heterosexist. \n In the first chapter James T. Sears proposes several ideas that appear throughout the book: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n So first it defines and labels elementary education without gay indoctrination as heterosexist creating a them VS us atmosphere upon which to build the second part, which is to indoctrinate grammar schoolers to, and I quote: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n \n In other words, indoctrinating young children to believe that homosexuality is right and normal activity that is no different than straight sexual activity. Well at that age I don't want schools teaching anything about any sexual activity, and no matter how much they water this review down for adult consumption, the book takes a pro gay and justification stance and is definitely crossing the line of fitting the definition of indoctrination when it is the schools job to educate, not indoctrinate. I repeat my argument and the reason for this thread and insist that to deny the very clear and obvious evidence that has been posted is to deny the truth of what the gay agenda is in reality.\n \n And click on this link at your own discretion because it is disgusting, then scroll down the page to see what our middle school age kids are being exposed to. Is this what you call being taught to be tolerant?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html\n \n And here is a book that is read to second graders. I dare you to tell me this is teaching tolerance and not that homosexuality is good, right and NORMAL?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html\n \n So I repeat my previous statement:\n \n These schools have no right to impose these values on other peoples children is my point. Parents are responsible for teaching moral values, not the schools. Schools should educate, not indoctrinate. And that was the whole point of posting this thread originally. You can see it in the title. With all of the side attacks that your side has come at me from, my whole and only complaint here is that complete strangers composed of gay militants, extremists and radicals with a social/politcal agenda to indoctrinate the next generation to be more pliable to their social manipulations is what is happening here and it is dead wrong at every level. Go off on as many tangents as you like, attack me from as many angles as you can think of, but this is the crux of what this thread is about. INDOCTRINATION OF OUR CHILDREN TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY MORALLY THAT IS AGAINST WHAT THEIR PARENTS WOULD CHOOSE TO TEACH THEM.\n",

This is not a way to teach middleschoolers respect for gay families. I will say though, having raised four kids of my own, that getting them to pay attention to information that comes from an adult, when they're teens, requires skill, nerve, and manipulation. I think the book goes about disseminating this information in the wrong way, but some of it, (how to use condoms, disease prevention, etc.) is vital. I'm willing to bet the authors were trying to be 'cool' and speak to the kids in what they think is their own language. (nearly ALWAYS a mistake, BTW.)\n I never think kids can have TOO much knowledge, and I doubt this book harmed any average pre-teen, but, YEAH!, I'd definitely want to be asked before they showed this book to any of my pre-high schoolers. ,,,and second grade??? no way.

I merely think that you are overreacting, that you have a tendency to buy into any anti-gay demonizing propoganda that is out there, and that you are generally wrong in your opinion on gay issues. I am merely disagreeing, and voicing my disagreement.\n \n \nYeah, yeah, your in denial. I know... It's a how to book for the same reason that telling kids not to smoke is all the advice they need to go out and smoke. It doesn't take lessons, just the knowledge that these previously unknown sex acts exist in order to create the curiosity to motivate them to experiment with it. You know jito you really show how utterly unenlightened you are as a parent to not see any deeper than you do with such obvious consequences as we are seeing all over this Country today.\n\n \n I think you are utterly unenlightened as a parent if you think that keeping them in the dark about the world we live in is effectively preparing your child for life as an adult.\n \n \nHow many 13 and 14 year olds do you think know of fisting as a sexual\n practice jito? I never heard of such a thing until I was in my 40s. And never would have dreamt of it in my wildest imaginings in a lifetime had I not been told it was widely practiced in the gay community.\n\n \n Really? Weird. Well - lets just say I was not that sheltered. My recollection of my teen years is that we were pretty well aware. Most of us were even at least partially sexually active. I was also well-educated about sex and did not lose my virginity until I was an adult. \n \n As a parent, I think that the teen years is when to learn about sex. All of it. The good, the bad, the ugly, the consequences, the realities. This is when the hormones kick and they start to become sexual beings. I want my son to know about all this stuff. I want him able to make informed choices. \n \n \nThis is totally irrelevant to this debate jito. I don't care about your home life. You can raise or teach your kid any thing you want to teach him. But don't sanction the school to teach this vile pornography to my children too, because I have my rights to raise my kids as I see fit just as you demand for yours. Leave these teachings to the family at home. It isn't the public schools job to teach my children how they must think about any kind of sex, especially gay sex.\n\n \n You are misrepresenting here. These books were handed out at gay tolerance event. They were not taught in the classroom. \n \n \nBut it wasn't a mistake on their part at all jito. It was done on purpose and will be done again because they must dumb down this generation while they're young if these kids will grow up to accept homosexuality as normal and right as the gay agenda has ordained. And how do you unring a bell jito? how do you take out of their minds what has been put into them? How do you return innocence to a child? \n\n \n It wasn't done on purpose to send any information about gays to anyone. It was sexual risk information aimed at gay youth. I will say they did a really lousy job of it, though.\n \n I also don't have a fairy-tale romance with the idea of \"innocence\". They aren't little children. They are teenagers. They are signifigantly closer to adulthood than they are to their birth. These kids don't need \"innocence\", they need to be able to operate in society as functioning people. To do that they need information and they will have to come to terms with the idea that not everyone and everything they are presented with is going to be something they approve of. Maybe you should work on that one yourself.",

   "I watched the video in the ops and it seems that it was lifted from Its emementary http://www.newday.com/films/Its_Elementary.htmlby the christianist group in Massachusetts. At the end of the video they quote leviticus, then make several way out assumtions.\n \n 1 that homosexuality is one of the most distructive forces in our society.\n \n 2 they claim that if everyone were to turn gay then no one would have children\n \n 3 that if everyone turned gay and no one had children then the world would end within 100 years.\n \n They then produce this argument: That homosexuality is not right because if everyone turned gay and stopped having children we are doomed destruction and annihilation.\n \n What these christianists fail to realise is that no one just turns gay, and teaching tolerance does not lead to people turning gay.They fail to realise that the most destructive force in our society is religion. They ignore that through out the video gay and lesbians have children and that the majority of children in the video were very gay supportive.\n \n I personally find their statement at the top of the page offensive\n \n\"Had enough? Citizens, take back your government!\" \nAre they saying that gay people are not citizens? Are they saying that gay families are less then theirs? Are they saying that gay people do not have a right to be apart of the government? Are they saying that there should be no equality for gays and lesbians? Who do they want to take the government back from? The people elected by the people?\n \n The christianists have been pulling their children from the public schools now for years.

   "OK Arch, I have to admit, if I were IN a gay relationship and raising children, I'd be the first beating down the door at the schoolboard meeting.\n\n \n Thanks for showing you can be objective in your judgment of this issue fg, that is a rare characteristic around here. And If it would offend you as a gay parent, then how much more offended do you think straight parents are by that kind of info being dispensed so freely in ways that are not age appropriate at all without their permission? \n \n \n This is not a way to teach middleschoolers respect for gay families. I will say though, having raised four kids of my own, that getting them to pay attention to information that comes from an adult, when they're teens, requires skill, nerve, and manipulation. I think the book goes about disseminating this information in the wrong way, but some of it, (how to use condoms, disease prevention, etc.) is vital. I'm willing to bet the authors were trying to be 'cool' and speak to the kids in what they think is their own language. (nearly ALWAYS a mistake, BTW.)\n \n \n The reality is, if there are true anti gay homophobic kids with their own sexual identity issues in that class being shown this material, they would be able to identify gay sensitive kids by their acceptance of it and then target them for potentially violent harassment because of it. That would mean this material would garner exactly the opposite response intended by its promoters. That is if it was truly being given for sensitivity training, which it is not. It is given for indoctrination purposes and I will argue that point with reason below.\n \n \nI never think kids can have TOO much knowledge, and I doubt this book harmed any average pre-teen, but, YEAH!, I'd definitely want to be asked before they showed this book to any of my pre-high schoolers. ,,,and second grade??? no way. I plead guilty to thinking you were just another homophobe, didn't read the link, and I apologize.\n\n \n I also believe knowledge is a good thing and that we can never get too much of it. But that statement comes with a couple of healthy limitations for the discerning advocate of education. By that I mean AGE APPROPRIATE and not all knowledge is healthy. For example, if information was made available to the masses for how to commit the perfect murder, is that knowledge that you necessarily want the masses to have? Couldn't that cause Social Chaos for the authorities? \n \n So you see, I know how curious I was as a kid, and how inquisitive my daughters were in all areas of life. My youngest is just like I was in that she asked why about everything in life right down to why were the speed limits what they were, and I was exactly the same with my dad. When I was 5 I was attracted to the bright red burner on the stove top. My mother saw me reaching to touch it even though I could feel the heat as I got close to it and she said ALI, DON'T TOUCH THAT; IT'S HOT AND YOU'LL BURN YOURSELF!! Well, within two minutes, I touched it as soon as she turned toward the sink and away from the stove because I had to experience what this burning she warned me about was. I never did it again, but I had to experience it first hand to learn that it hurt and that I didn't like it.\n \n So it is with all aspects of life. Life is learned through experience, through trial and error so to speak. Especially with young kids who are getting such blatantly mixed messages from society and from the adults within their own school. I know when I was a kid, I believed and trusted adults and especially the authorities over me to be representing the truth about whatever they told me. That is just the nature of innocence, and that is naivet\u00e9 and gullibility. \n \n That's why young children get abducted, because they believe the adult who asks for help to find their puppy. And why kids get molested by the adult who calls what he is doing to him/her a game they can play. And so is what these adults are doing to these children in grammar school emotional abuse because it is giving information that is both age inappropriate and is not objective info but is slanted to make homosexuality look not only normal and right but attractive and ok too. \n \n I suggest to you that if we did an experiment with second graders and gave them a class for just one semester that was about the sport of Russian Roulette. A class that focussed on the champion survivors of the Sport, how much money they have made and how much respect they gained in that community. And even focussed on champions who's number, or bullet came up and the sense of loss the community suffered when they died. That if at the end of that semester we left the kids in that classroom with a revolver with one bullet, there would be a game going in no time at all. Now would every kid in the class participate? Of course not. But some of them would and that is an undeniable fact based on the nature of humanity.\n \n This is what I am talking about when I refer to the shallowness of parents who are completely unable to look beyond what is told to us by these groups to justify what they are exposing our children to in the name of tolerance and education, when in reality and in FACT the outcomes of their actions are much more diabolical yet parents like Jito and all of the others above who have done nothing but make excuses, justifications and obfuscations in response to my evidence that has very clearly shown an organized agenda if we just discern objectively what is resulting in the real World from the type of info our children are being exposed to today.\n \n So thank you for recognizing that I am not motivated by homophobia or any personal animosity toward gays themselves. In fact if this info was disseminated to college students, who are 18 or older, no complaints would exist. But that old rule of age appropriateness regarding this being shown to middle schoolers is absolutely valid, yet rather than the parent age people above agreeing with this criticism, they have instead labeled me as bigoted, homophobic, over reacting, anti gay and demonizing. None of which I am or am doing in reality. \n \n I just marvel that these members above are blind to the fact that this is a conscious effort to long term indoctrination of our youngest children all the way through the public education system today to incrementally indoctrinate them into thinking a predetermined and pro homosexual way so that by the time they are adults, they will accept homosexuality as normal and right. \n \n Teaching sensitivity to different types of people is fine with me. But teaching that being different is right and normal isn't, and that is the difference of what is being perpetrated on our children here by the gay agenda. And sadly, this thread is evidence that so many adults today are lacking the common sense discernment to grasp that reality.",

Sorry, egomaniac, we don't live in a Archiecentric world.\n \n \n You really can't have one without the other.

These people are under no obligation to sit quietly while you continue to demonize and misrepresent them, and they have EVERY RIGHT to counter your negative portrayal of them. If that is an agenda to you, so be it. It is a valid one.\n \n \n \n What - were you a eunich as teen? They are aware. Information about sex, even badly put together information is not smut. By the way - this attitude that sex is some dirty little secret that must be kept from the children (even the teenagers who are going through puberty) is that unhealthy puritanical hang-up about sex that I mentioned in the abortion thread. Sex is a normal part of being human. It is no more shameful or innapropriate for kids to know about than eating or going to the bathroom. And if you really want to encourage kids to make good choices, to avoid STDs and unwanted pregnancy - you don't keep information about it a freaking secret.\n \n \n \n You think that pamphlet was adult? That speaks volumes about your level of maturity. You talk like it was porn. It wasn't, it was clinical information about sex and its risks put in language they hoped would be more easily undertood by young people. As a matter of fact - it points out that ALL kinds of sex acts are risky. It seemed to me to be discouraging them, and at the very least discouraging them without precations. Granted, unlike you, the booklet does not buy into the fallacy that if you don't tell horny teenagers about sex, then they won't figure it out.\n \n \n \n Teaching an idea that isn't sanctioned by you damned religion isn't warping minds.\n\n \n You go, girl!

Let Christians, Muslims Jews and everyone else believe whatever they feel like; let them live their lifestyles the way they want; and let them leave others alone to do as they wish instead. That would be neat.\n \n With the Archies of this world, that isn't about to happen. But I think it's a good agenda. Let people be who they are, and as long as they don't harm anyone, and even if you disagree with them, well, what harm can they do? As Jefferson said, as long as they don't pick my pocket or try to break my leg, let them get on with it. Now... if only it were possible to persuade the Archies of the wisdom of this course of action.\n \n And that all depends on giving kids information that is accurate, and that they can use -- anathema to Archie.

Let Christians, Muslims Jews and everyone else believe whatever they feel like; let them live their lifestyles the way they want; and let them leave others alone to do as they wish instead. That would be neat.\n \n With the Archies of this world, that isn't about to happen. But I think it's a good agenda. Let people be who they are, and as long as they don't harm anyone, and even if you disagree with them, well, what harm can they do? As Jefferson said, as long as they don't pick my pocket or try to break my leg, let them get on with it. Now... if only it were possible to persuade the Archies of the wisdom of this course of action.\n \n And that all depends on giving kids information that is accurate, and that they can use -- anathema to Archie. He wants kids to be brought up hateful and ignorant instead.\n\n \n \nThat isn't the schools job TQ, it's my job as the parent. The school has no right to tell my kids how they must think about sexual issues. Especially unnatural sexual issues, nor about premarital sexual issues. But it used to be that if schools wanted to impart such info on young children, they would first require a permission slip from their parents. Thereby respecting the parents rights and authority over what their children were exposed to.\n \n And let me tell you something else TQ, until my 26 year old daughter bought her own house this past year she shared a house with a gay couple and very good friends of hers and never did she hide that fact from me, and never did I make any type of judgmental issue out of it at all. \n \n But had the schools attempted to impose on my authority over what my daughters learned at such young ages, there would have been hell to pay. And I wouldn't have been alone at that time. But that doesn't mean I raised them to judge, condemn, reject or judge in a negative way gay people at all. I raised them to judge people on the content of the character and by how they treat others. \n \n But in order to really understand where I'm coming from and why this disgusts me so much, you would have to actually have a moral center, so I understand the disdain you have and where it's coming from.\n\n \n \nIt is my job to teach my children what I want them to know at that age, not what some over inflated, egomaniacal, amoral pseudo intellectual thinks I should teach them. So keep your advice and judgments of what I can teach my kids to yourself.\n \n And I notice you edited completely this part out of my post:[Posted By Archangel]And let me tell you something else TQ, until my 26 year old daughter bought her own house this past year she shared a house with a gay couple and very good friends of hers and never did she hide that fact from me, and never did I make any type of judgmental issue out of it at all. \n \n But had the schools attempted to impose on my authority over what my daughters learned at such young ages, there would have been hell to pay.

But that doesn't mean I raised them to judge, condemn, reject or judge in a negative way gay people at all.\n Don't want to allow anything through that shows I'm rational, balanced or caring now do we TQ. And you question my ethics? HYPOCRITE, it fits you so well, you should change your handle to represent your character and adopt.\n\n \n \nThat is again you projecting and assuming that I raised my daughters to be prejudice and to discriminate against anyone else at all. It is you lying again about someone you don't really know at all but you will judge me as harshly as possible and demonize me because I don't condone homosexuality as a sexual outlet. And because I object to complete strangers INDOCTRINATING THEM to believe that homosexuality is right and normal when I firmly believe it is an unnatural sexual practice.\n \n That doesn't mean I teach them to hate gay people at all. But to reject homosexuality; you know, the sexual act? If you have a problem with that then tough. But they are my kids and my responsibility. \n \n These schools have no right to impose these values on other peoples children is my point. Parents are responsible for teaching moral values, not the schools. Schools should educate, not indoctrinate. And that was the whole point of posting this thread originally. You can see it in the title. With all of the side attacks that your side has come at me from, my whole and only complaint here is that complete strangers composed of gay militants, extremists and radicals with a politcal agenda to indoctrinate the next generation to be more pliable to their social manipulations is what is happening here and it is dead wrong at every level. Go off on as many tangents as you like, attack me from as many angles as you can think of, but this is the crux of what this thread is about. INDOCTRINATION OF OUR CHILDREN TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY MORALLY THAT IS AGAINST WHAT THEIR PARENTS WOULD CHOOSE TO TEACH THEM.\n\n \n \nThere is no martyr complex on my part at all TQ and I resent the implication as it is a totally fallacious statement based on my last post. Now here is an excerpt from that book review you posted.\n  it offers many perspectives on the various aspects of elementary education and the myriad ways it is heterosexist. \n In the first chapter James T. Sears proposes several ideas that appear throughout the book: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n So first it defines and labels elementary education without gay indoctrination as heterosexist creating a them VS us atmosphere upon which to build the second part, which is to indoctrinate grammar schoolers to, and I quote: speaking the unspoken by teaching about XXXXX issues in elementary school, homosexuality as part of the human condition, and asserting that heterosexism and homophobia are acquired or learned beliefs.\n \n In other words, indoctrinating young children to believe that homosexuality is right and normal activity that is no different than straight sexual activity. Well at that age I don't want schools teaching anything about any sexual activity, and no matter how much they water this review down for adult consumption, the book takes a pro gay and justification stance and is definitely crossing the line of fitting the definition of indoctrination when it is the schools job to educate, not indoctrinate. I repeat my argument and the reason for this thread and insist that to deny the very clear and obvious evidence that has been posted is to deny the truth of what the gay agenda is in reality.\n \n And click on this link at your own discretion because it is disgusting, then scroll down the page to see what our middle school age kids are being exposed to. Is this what you call being taught to be tolerant?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html\n \n And here is a book that is read to second graders. I dare you to tell me this is teaching tolerance and not that homosexuality is good, right and NORMAL?\n \n http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html\n \n So I repeat my previous statement:\n \n These schools have no right to impose these values on other peoples children is my point. Parents are responsible for teaching moral values, not the schools. Schools should educate, not indoctrinate. And that was the whole point of posting this thread originally. You can see it in the title. With all of the side attacks that your side has come at me from, my whole and only complaint here is that complete strangers composed of gay militants, extremists and radicals with a social/politcal agenda to indoctrinate the next generation to be more pliable to their social manipulations is what is happening here and it is dead wrong at every level. Go off on as many tangents as you like, attack me from as many angles as you can think of, but this is the crux of what this thread is about. INDOCTRINATION OF OUR CHILDREN TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY MORALLY THAT IS AGAINST WHAT THEIR PARENTS WOULD CHOOSE TO TEACH THEM.\n\n \n \nOh really Jito? This link: http://www.massresistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html Isn't normalizing homosexuality to second graders? And even romanticizing it for such young minds?\n \n And then for the middle schoolers, this doesn't turn your stomach with the way the material is dispensed in such a cavalier and non-chillant way? http://www.massresistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html And in such crude and offensive language? This doesn't disgust you as a parent? If not Jito, then it is you who has the problem and a serious moral blind spot, not me.\n",

   "And here's another perspective from another independent pro family source. And the mission which focuses on young children in the school system is solid evidence of an organized plan to impact the way all children think without consideration or respecting the authority of Parents to determine what their children learn about sexuality and when they want to teach them such info if they want to at all.\n \n This is nothing less than intellectual kidnapping and brainwashing as this information is force fed to children before they are even sexually aware. \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu9D3Dp1HbDYBp0BXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExN3FtdGo3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12fijmfgh/EXP=1201561719/**http%3a//www.connectionmagazine.org/2002_08/ts_gay_agenda.htm\n 'Gay Agenda' in Public Schools Initiated by Pedophiles\n \n Parents don't know the depth of it!\n by Jody Brown\n \n (AgapePress) - At a Capitol Hill conference recently, Christian activists made the case that public school programs promoting such things as tolerance, diversity, safety, and anti-discrimination are actually being used to promote and encourage homosexual behavior.Monday's seminar and panel discussion in the Rayburn House Office Building revealed details of the homosexual agenda in the public school system from its history to its exponents. \"Putting Kids at Risk: The Implications of 'Gay' School Programs\" addressed several questions of concern to pro-family activists - among them: Should elementary-age children be taught how to cross-dress in the classroom? Do homosexuals really have more sexually transmitted diseases than heterosexuals? Will \"hate-crimes\" codes be used to silence freedom of speech in schools?Bob Knight is director of the Culture and Family Institute, host of the event. He said many people fail to see the homosexual agenda - but that it is there when the facts are examined.\n \n \"The Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which boasts membership of more than 1,200 teachers, also has a budget of $3.5 million,\" Knight said, \"and they work all over the country to introduce homosexuality into the school system.\" The group's mission, he said, \"is to promote homosexuality in the schools under any guise that works.\"Knight says the leadership of the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the United States, has endorsed GLSEN's efforts to introduce its agenda, but the NEA membership has defeated attempts to officially adopt the plans. But according to Knight, those goals are being implemented one at a time and are turning America's schools into vehicles for homosexual advocacy. \n \n \"Now they are introducing [the agenda] piecemeal, and some of it involves things like 'Gay and Lesbian History Month,' gay recruitment of teachers, and incorporating homosexuality in every classroom subject.\"Peter LaBarbera, an analyst with the Culture and Family Institute, said kids are being manipulated by groups like GLSEN. \"They are getting in and out before parents even know what's going on,\" he said. \n \n According to Knight, parents are not being told the truth about what is being taught in schools to their young children. He said if parents understood the depth of the homosexual agenda in the schools, there would be a \"revolution.\" \n \n Knight said the effort to introduce a homosexual agenda began in the 1950s with the fraudulent \"Kinsey Report\" on sexuality, which has since been shown to have been compiled by pedophiles and homosexuals. He points out the plan to normalize homosexuality is now in its final stages. The final step of the campaign, he said, is to openly promote acceptance of homosexuality even among the youngest children. \n ",

I'm an adult and the format is a turn off for me. However, I don't see how teaching our young to accept people different from themselves can be anything but a good thing. We all have to share the planet. So, unless you think we should round up all the gay people and put them on and island, and keep doing that as the next generations grow up, it is in everyone's best interest to foster understanding and acceptance. You began this thread by protesting a book for our kids. Now you sound like a wild-eyed paranoic! You DO know that extreme bigotry, as 'pathological bias', is on the American psychiatric Associations list of mental illnesses, right? Homosexuality is not.

   "Homosexuality is right, normal, and equal to heterosexuality. The parents are part of the problem. They have a choice, just as other bigoted christianists, they can pull their children from the public schools and send them to bigot, bible, christianist terrorist training camp private schools. If the chistianist churches were more concerned about this then money they would allow the parents who can't afford it to go for free. There is also a thing called home schooling where the parents can instill their anti gay bigotry.\n \n See here is the actual rub. You would not have a problem if the discussions in the classes were about heteroexual families only.\n\n \n Sure they can send their kids to Christian schools Matt, but the gay militants wont respect those rules either. They will sue and attempt to force the schools to accept their values at the expense of all the other students in the school. No christian institution is safe from your militancy because your side has no respect for traditional values at all. So we aren't imposing our values on you but must fight on every front to preserve our values against your attacks. READ THE WHOLE ARTICLE\n \n http://americansfortruth.com/issues/youth-and-schools/\n Lesbian suit against Christian school tossed\n 'No triable issues': Academy's right to expel 2 girls in 'relationship' confirmed\n \n \u00a9 2008 WorldNetDaily.com, Jan. 25, 2008\n \n A California judge has ruled that Christian schools can set standards for behavior for their students, and impose penalties if they are not met.\n \n The decision comes from Riverside County Superior Court Judge Gloria Trask, who found 'no triable issues' on claims that a Christian school discriminated against two girls because of their perceived sexual orientation, according to a report in the North County Times.\n \n Trask recently dismissed the claims made against California Lutheran High School in Wildomar by the two girls and their parents.\n \n The case developed in 2005 when the girls, members of the junior class, were expelled after school officials noticed behavior by the two that may have indicated a lesbian relationship.\n \n The lawsuit filed by the girls and the parents then alleged the California Lutheran High School Association -- which oversees operation of the Wildomar school -- engaged in discrimination, invasion of privacy and unfair business practices in its handling and ultimate dismissal of two juniors.\n \n The students were summoned into the office of Principal Gregory Bork, the lawsuit claimed, where Bork \"individually and separately interrogated the (students) in a closed room, without the parents\" knowledge or consent ... and asked (them) inappropriate and personal questions such as whether they loved one another and were lesbians.'\n \n \"In such a manner, Bork coerced one of the (students) to admit that she 'loves' the other,\" a court document stated.\n \n The next day, the parents received a phone call from Bork informing them the board had decided to expel the students. One day later, the parents confronted the principal in person and by phone and were told the two girls could not remain at school \"with those feelings.\"\n \n Bork also wrote a letter to the parents stating \"while there is no open physical contact between the two girls, there is still a bond of intimacy ... characteristic of a lesbian [relationship]. ... Such a relationship is unchristian. To allow the girls to attend [Cal Lutheran] ... would send a message to students and parents that we either condone this situation and/or will not do anything about it. That message would not reflect our beliefs and principles.\"\n \n The students, identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe and Mary Roe, were expelled in September 2005 for \"engaging in homosexual conduct in violation of the Christian Code of Conduct, including but not limited to, posing for pictures in suggestive sexual positions.\"\n \n Lawyers for the students argued the school is not a religious institution but a fee-taking organization.\n \n But they were opposed by other lawyers, from the Christian Legal Society and the Alliance Defense Fund, who argued on behalf of the school, because the decision could affect members of the Association of Faith-Based Organizations.\n \n \"Christian schools have the right to make admissions and disciplinary decisions consistent with their Christian beliefs,\" said Timothy J. Tracey, a litigation counsel for the CLS. \"To subject Christian schools to liability under the California anti-discrimination laws for expelling students who engage in homosexual conduct flatly violates this right.\"\n \n \"The 14th Amendment protects the right of parents to send their children to a private religious school that shares their religious beliefs,\" the arguments said. \"The United States Supreme Court has long recognized the existence of parents' right to direct their children's education.\"\n \n \"These parents have chosen to send their children to private Christian schools because of the unique Christian mission and values espoused by the schools. Compelling the schools to condone extramarital sexual conduct contrary to their values and beliefs eliminates a primary reason why parents choose to send their children to these Christian schools in the first place - having their children educated and mentored from a distinctly Christian perspective,\" the court filings said.\n \n \"The state may govern the 'basic requirements' of private schools, through licensing and reporting requirements, but 'it cannot unreasonably interfere with the teaching and educational philosophies of such schools,'\" the argument said.\n \n The First Amendment's Religion Clause also prevents state anti-discrimination laws based on moral behavior from applying, the attorneys argued.\n \n Attorney Kirk Hanson, representing the students, said he would appeal the dismissal of the case. He said he'll continue to argue the school is a business and must abide by state discrimination requirements.\n \n \"That's (appeals court) where this case would have ended up regardless,\" Hanson told the newspaper. \"Win or lose at the trial level, the case is going to be in front of a court of appeal.\"\n \n But John McKay, a lawyer for the school, said, \"The First Amendment gives Christian schools the right to educate children on the [basis] of Christian beliefs. We're right on the First Amendment [regarding] free association.\"\n \n On a forums page at the newspaper's Internet site, 'Edward,' supported the decision.\n \n 'It's not right to enroll in a school that has certain defined beliefs and rules, and then decide you don't want to comply,' he wrote. 'Simply enroll in a different school that closer matches your idealogy [sic]. Don't sue to try to make the existing school what you want it to be.'\n \n 'This was obviously an attack by the 'diversity' crowd on another religious institution,\" added 'Watch out.' \"They are dead set on destroying any mention of or exercise of religious freedom.\"\n \n And Peter added, 'Think, people, think .... If you as a parent sign on a dotted line accepting the rules of the private school, then disciplinary action against your son or daughter should be expected when they break the rules. Face the consequences and move on.\"",

   "ARCH! JEEZ! What exactly do you think the Gay Agenda is? (if there in fact IS one) You use it like you would 'child prostitution' or something of that order. Do you really believe that gays are attempting to create more gays from our children? Because you can lay that to rest right now. If anyone knows that you can't 'turn' somebody gay, it's the gays themselves. Neither can it be 'cured' anymore than being black, or asian, or arabic, can be 'cured'. Are you imagining the gays are trying to create a pool of future sexual partners? What exactly, in your view, is the 'gay agenda'?\n If there is an agenda, it's one of gaining acceptance and rights and one of anti-discrimination, just as any minority fights for and I don't have a problem with that. \n I agree that that book you began this thread with is too intense for the very young student. I'm an adult and the format is a turn off for me. However, I don't see how teaching our young to accept people different from themselves can be anything but a good thing. We all have to share the planet. So, unless you think we should round up all the gay people and put them on and island, and keep doing that as the next generations grow up, it is in everyone's best interest to foster understanding and acceptance. You began this thread by protesting a book for our kids. Now you sound like a wild-eyed paranoic! You DO know that extreme bigotry, as 'pathological bias', is on the American psychiatric Associations list of mental illnesses, right? Homosexuality is not. In fact, homosexuality is on NO list of mental or medical disorders by those professions. I want to know exactly what it is you're really afraid of.\n\n \n \nWell, that's rather the point. The \"Gay Agenda\" is supposed to be ill defined. If Archie actually came out and said \"gays are trying to get the dignity and respect that everyone else gets, we gotta stop them!\" it would hard for him to pretend that he isn't a homophobe. So instead the anti-gay crowd talks about an \"agenda\", which sounds kind of sneaky and ominous, without ever really pinning down what it's supposed to be. Archie's linked a bunch of things, and none of them are in any sort of agreement; after all his posturing I doubt Archie could actually define said agenda, even if he wanted to. It's just a catch phrase used to make it sound like gays are up to something so as to generate a bit of fear and mistrust and rally the \"faithful\" against gays.\n\n \n Try again Kronus. Here is the Gay Agenda defined and laid out as clearly as possible for you. And your agenda has nothing at all to do with dignity or respect. Because if it did, you wouldn't feel the need to hijack parental control over what their grammar school age children is exposed to by people who play no other part in raising them yet feel justified in shaping their moral foundations in life. What the gay agenda represents is criminal and this post will clearly lay that out for you.\n \n If you simply read the links I already posted flygirl, you never would have written this post. It makes no sense at all in context of what is posted above it. This link for example: http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu.Dk.pxH2M0ATU9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExcDQ1bmxqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12lq0f78b/EXP=1201556580/**http%3a//americansfortruth.com/news/gay-agenda-what-gay-agenda.html And this one: http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu9D3Dp1HbDYBp0BXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExN3FtdGo3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12fijmfgh/EXP=1201561719/**http%3a//www.connectionmagazine.org/2002_08/ts_gay_agenda.htm Now in case you can't gleam from these links what the agenda is, let me spell it out for you.\n \n The gay agenda is NOT designed to turn children gay, although instilling sexual confusion and promoting sexual experimentation and liberation is a PART of their plan to indoctrinate our youth. But what they are attempting to accomplish long term is for Society at large to accept homosexuality as right, normal and as traditional a form of sexual unity and bonding as heterosexuality is. \n \n You see, they understand that as adults we know the obvious differences between homosexuality and heterosexuality and examples like the 13 States that put Homosexual Unions on the ballot in 04 that overwhelmingly defeated the measure just confirmed for the militant gay groups that this generation is lost to them as far as manipulating and coercing them into willingly supporting the Gay Agenda. \n \n This is why they are going after our youngest and most innocent citizens. Our next generation if you will. And under the guise of sensitivity training they are using standard brain washing and indoctrination procedures by systematically and consistently imposing their moral values on our children with each higher grade level the child attains. \n \n This is why they read stories like this:http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html that they claim is innocent enough to second graders, but it isn't. Because rather than teach that simply respecting peoples differences is right, it teaches that BEING different is right and normal. It justifies homosexuality rather than teaching understanding and sensitivity to the differences between them and us.\n \n And then simultaneously, while second graders are being brainwashed to see homosexuality as right and normal at their very young and impressionable ages, their middle school age siblings are being taken to the next level of indoctrination with information like this:http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html So you see, the militant gay organizations understand that if they were to lock these young minds up and force them under threat to accept the immoral perversions they offer, the kids would go home crying and disturbed and the jig would be up for them. \n \n But if they gently manipulate them over years in school; increasing the information and the justification of their beliefs with each passing grade level, then in one 12 year cycle through the public school system they will have captured the next generation of Americans to not only accept homosexuality as right and normal but to have also dumbed down their moral value system so that any who were curious about experimenting with homosexuality or any other types of sexual perversions would feel morally justified in doing so.\n \n They also understand very well that needing parental approval for the info they want to force feed our children is a deal killer as it was in the last generation because so many parents opted out back then, thereby preventing the full scale manipulation of that generation from taking hold. So now they are straight out refusing to inform parents or giving them any right at all as our children's responsible guardians to protect them from receiving this indoctrinating and manipulative brain washing that will only work completely if carried out over the full 12 years of public school education. And here is the evidence for this aspect of their desire and goal to castrate parents of their rights to determine what info their children are exposed to by these anti family advocates of brain washing and manipulation. http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52311\n \n That is what the GAY AGENDA is flygirl and Kronus, as plainly and as simply as I can lay it out for you. And the corresponding links support my argument.",

   " they will have captured the next generation of Americans to not only accept homosexuality as right and normal but to have also dumbed down their moral value system \n\n AP, it is impossible to 'dumb down' morality. Morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live', and the eternal answer to that question is that we live in the manner that harms the fewest people. The 'golden rule' is the basis for practically every moral code held, in any religion or society, since homo-sapiens developed into a sentient being.\n A minority, yet a significant number, of people are homosexual. They just are. Nothing will change them into heterosexual. Nothing. \n You say the gay agenda is to teach our children that it's OK to be homosexual. We SHOULD teach them that. We take an active interest (excepting the lunatic fringe) in seeing that they learn, in school, to be tolerant of people of all other races and religions. You believe that homosexual behavior is wrong. OK, TEACH your kids that, that's your right as a parent. But don't expect a minority to abandon their quest not to be vilified or discriminated against by society as a whole because you don't care for it.\n You keep saying that they're teaching our children that being different is right, as in not being different is wrong. This is incorrect. From reading through the links I see an assertion that being different is alright, as in, OK. In this they join all the other minorities in saying, being black is ok, being asian is ok, being handicapped is ok, being jewish is ok.....",

Then I read this part and my mystification only deepened:\n \nBecause rather than teach that simply respecting peoples differences is right, it teaches that BEING different is right and normal. It justifies homosexuality rather than teaching understanding and sensitivity to the differences between them and us.\n\n I couldn't understand what you meant at first. How do you teach respect, understanding and sensitivity toward others who are different without portraying them as existing on an equal footing?\n \n Then I got it - a real face/candlestick moment. To you, respecting differences isn't about acknowledging or accepting that other people can be different in their beliefs or sexual preference yet fundamentally equal so long as they do their best not to harm others. To you, respecting peoples differences is about allowing them to be wrong, sinful and deviant. In one sense it's not about other people at all - it's certainly not something you do for the benefit of those whose differences you 'respect': it's something you do in order to feel good about what a wonderfully tolerant and enlightened person you are.\n \n So as far as you're concerned, sure, individuals shouldn't be overtly discriminated against based on their sexuality. But not because discrimination might be unpleasant for them. No: it's because being tolerant and understanding and sensitive is what nice people like you do. What you really can't stand is the idea of future generations respecting others who are different for the wrong reason; doing it out of genuine empathy and a sense of fellowship rather than as an exercise in spiritual masturbation.\n \n A very insightful and revealing post; I enjoyed reading it.

   "First of all, it isn't just christian groups, but pro-family secular groups that are fighting the anti family and moral values attacks on our children that is taking place under false pretense by the militant gay groups.\n\n Show me any \"pro-family\" group that is truly secular, without any ties to Christianity.\n \n \n \nAnd what we are fighting for isn't to change the status quo ...\n\n That's a blatant lie.\n Do you need me to link to multiple cases where the religious homophobic right (not to be confused with the general christian population) tried to get \"gay-straight alliances\" tossed out of schools?\n \n Or maybe the \"status quo\" you don't want to change is actually the predominant presence of anti-gay atmosphere in our schools? Whereby a majority of students are very familiar with anti-gay slurs being tossed around our schools? And even statistics on some gay kids having to leave school because of harassment?\n Is that the \"status quo\" you're not interested in changing?\n \n \n \n...but is intended to preserve the long standing moral foundation that has existed in America from the beginning.\n\n Just out of curiousity, what do you think is going to stop existing?\n Are \"families\", with a married mom and dad and 2.5 kids, going to stop existing?\n Are people who are against homosexuality going to stop existing?\n Is Christianity going to stop existing?\n \n Give your propaganda a rest. Those \"long standing\" traditions of prejudice you confuse with \"morals\" are going to exist in America for a long time here-after.\n \n \n \nIt is the gay agendas goal to tear down that moral center by imposing their amoral world view on our children while they are too young and innocent to reject the lies it represents.\n\n And we supposedly do this with books that ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE of gays.\n These books don't go around saying \"Gay parents are great and your parents are lying if they tell you that they are *wrong*\".\n \n Often, they simply ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE of gays.\n \n Tell you what Archie.\n Have you ever READ ANY of the books you rail against?\n Do you know ANYTHING about what they ACTUALLY say beyond what some religious right homophobe wants you to think? \n \n \n \nThat is why you refuse to actually answer my assertions above, directly and just try to reverse the argument by claiming we do the same thing you are doing.\n\n Archie, what \"assertion\" do you want answered?\n \n My position is that the vast majority of your complaints are hyperbolic hot air.\n \n You complained about the \"lesbian\" couple that sued in ONE christian school, and you won that case.\n So what is it that you are complaining about there? The fact that the suit was ACTUALLY FILED.\n Get over it. When you discriminate, you'll have to protect that discrimination from SOME people who fight against it.\n And note, that was ONE christian school. Hardly evidence of a collaborative gay \"plot\" to overthrow \"family\" values.\n All these girls wanted was to go to school.\n Would that have \"overthrown\" your \"family\" values if gay kids are allowed in YOUR schools???\n \n \n \n The difference is foundit, is that when parents are asked if they approve of our influence upon their children, they know that no emotional harm will come from our influence.\n\n Can you prove your claim?\n \n Cause the reality of the situation is that schools are often a \"democratic\" atmosphere in many ways.\n If the parents truly DID NOT WANT the gay education present, they could easily keep it out.\n You ever hear of a school-board Archie? You know how those work?\n \n But the reality of the situation can be found in many cases like Massachusetts, where ONE family gets up and complains. SOLO.\n They are typically not joined by OTHER parents in the school, but rather joined by \"Christians\" who stand up behind them. Often \"Christians\" who have no ties to the actual school involved.\n \n \n \nAgain I ask, and not one of you apologists has answered it. Why, if your goals, agenda and influence on our children is so righteous and sincerely about being concerned about teaching ONLY SENSITIVITY TRAINING AND NOT INDOCTRINATION, then why are your militant groups fighting so hard to not allow parents to approve the VERY AGE INAPPROPRIATE material you are force feeding our children BEHIND THEIR BACKS?\n\n Talk about a loaded question filled with self-justifying assumptions.\n 1) Can you show me \"age inappropriate material\"? Specifically, an example?\n \n 2) \"Behind their backs\". I hate to break this to you, but the world does NOT revolve around catering to a bunch of homophobic bigots who need \"alerts\" sent to their house to let them decide if something is going to happen that they don't approve of.\n Should I get an \"alert\" based on every library book in the library I might find objectionable?",

   "AP, it is impossible to 'dumb down' morality. Morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live', and the eternal answer to that question is that we live in the manner that harms the fewest people. The 'golden rule' is the basis for practically every moral code held, in any religion or society, since homo-sapiens developed into a sentient being.\n A minority, yet a significant number, of people are homosexual. They just are. Nothing will change them into heterosexual. Nothing. \n You say the gay agenda is to teach our children that it's OK to be homosexual. We SHOULD teach them that. We take an active interest (excepting the lunatic fringe) in seeing that they learn, in school, to be tolerant of people of all other races and religions. You believe that homosexual behavior is wrong. OK, TEACH your kids that, that's your right as a parent. But don't expect a minority to abandon their quest not to be vilified or discriminated against by society as a whole because you don't care for it.\n You keep saying that they're teaching our children that being different is right, as in not being different is wrong. This is incorrect. From reading through the links I see an assertion that being different is alright, as in, OK. In this they join all the other minorities in saying, being black is ok, being asian is ok, being handicapped is ok, being jewish is ok.....\n\n \n Please flygirl, with statements such as the bolded, you are causing me to doubt the level of common sense and intelligence I attributed to you. Remember that we are discussing grammar schoolers here. Children with no hard wired sense of self, much less an established sense of morality. That is what their parents are for, and instilling a moral center isn't accomplished between birth and 5 years old, so that from first grade on these kids are armed with the knowledge to resist the propaganda and lies being fed to them by these militant groups who have infiltrated our public school system.\n \n I raised my daughters to accept and respect all people, no matter their race, religion, lifestyle or sexual orientation. But I instilled within them a sense of self so that they know what is right without being told how they must think, or what they must believe by those who have no personal investment or interest in the real and actual quality of their lives. But had they been exposed to these opposing values at such young ages, it would have completely undermined my parental authority and could have confused them in ways I hate to even consider. \n \n Don't you see that the only investment these militant gay groups have in our children is for the socio-political long term agenda of the very small minority of homosexuals to attain the end result of capturing all of the rights they demand at the expense of America's moral values? They have no actual or personal concern for the health of their minds and the emotional stability of our children. \n \n What is becoming painfully obvious to me is that you are purposely misinterpreting what I am saying in order to deflect the meat of my argument and to ignore the very clear points I have made. There is no way you cannot comprehend what my response to you implies unless you are purposely feigning ignorance so as to ignore the true implications which you are unable to refute. Shame on you flygirl. You have become a puppet rather than the objective person I remembered.",

I trust that those objective readers will very clearly see and appreciate my perspective as well as the evidence I have posted. So believe what you will Jito, you are free to delude yourself and to deny the truth. \n \nTry again Kronus. Here is the Gay Agenda defined and laid out as clearly as possible for you. And your agenda has nothing at all to do with dignity or respect. Because if it did, you wouldn't feel the need to hijack parental control over what their grammar school age children is exposed to by people who play no other part in raising them yet feel justified in shaping their moral foundations in life. What the gay agenda represents is criminal and this post will clearly lay that out for you.\n \n If you simply read the links I already posted flygirl, you never would have written this post. It makes no sense at all in context of what is posted above it. This link for example: http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu.Dk.pxH2M0ATU9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExcDQ1bmxqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12lq0f78b/EXP=1201556580/**http%3a//americansfortruth.com/news/gay-agenda-what-gay-agenda.html And this one: http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu9D3Dp1HbDYBp0BXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExN3FtdGo3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12fijmfgh/EXP=1201561719/**http%3a//www.connectionmagazine.org/2002_08/ts_gay_agenda.htm Now in case you can't gleam from these links what the agenda is, let me spell it out for you.\n \n The gay agenda is NOT designed to turn children gay, although instilling sexual confusion and promoting sexual experimentation and liberation is a PART of their plan to indoctrinate our youth. But what they are attempting to accomplish long term is for Society at large to accept homosexuality as right, normal and as traditional a form of sexual unity and bonding as heterosexuality is. \n \n You see, they understand that as adults we know the obvious differences between homosexuality and heterosexuality and examples like the 13 States that put Homosexual Unions on the ballot in 04 that overwhelmingly defeated the measure just confirmed for the militant gay groups that this generation is lost to them as far as manipulating and coercing them into willingly supporting the Gay Agenda. \n \n This is why they are going after our youngest and most innocent citizens. Our next generation if you will. And under the guise of sensitivity training they are using standard brain washing and indoctrination procedures by systematically and consistently imposing their moral values on our children with each higher grade level the child attains. \n \n This is why they read stories like this:http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/king_and_king/book.html that they claim is innocent enough to second graders, but it isn't. Because rather than teach that simply respecting peoples differences is right, it teaches that BEING different is right and normal. It justifies homosexuality rather than teaching understanding and sensitivity to the differences between them and us.\n \n And then simultaneously, while second graders are being brainwashed to see homosexuality as right and normal at their very young and impressionable ages, their middle school age siblings are being taken to the next level of indoctrination with information like this:http://www.MassResistance.org/docs/issues/black_book/black_book_inside.html So you see, the militant gay organizations understand that if they were to lock these young minds up and force them under threat to accept the immoral perversions they offer, the kids would go home crying and disturbed and the jig would be up for them. \n \n But if they gently manipulate them over years in school; increasing the information and the justification of their beliefs with each passing grade level, then in one 12 year cycle through the public school system they will have captured the next generation of Americans to not only accept homosexuality as right and normal but to have also dumbed down their moral value system so that any who were curious about experimenting with homosexuality or any other types of sexual perversions would feel morally justified in doing so.\n \n They also understand very well that needing parental approval for the info they want to force feed our children is a deal killer as it was in the last generation because so many parents opted out back then, thereby preventing the full scale manipulation of that generation from taking hold. So now they are straight out refusing to inform parents or giving them any right at all as our children's responsible guardians to protect them from receiving this indoctrinating and manipulative brain washing that will only work completely if carried out over the full 12 years of public school education. And here is the evidence for this aspect of their desire and goal to castrate parents of their rights to determine what info their children are exposed to by these anti family advocates of brain washing and manipulation. http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52311\n \n That is what the GAY AGENDA is flygirl and Kronus, as plainly and as simply as I can lay it out for you. And the corresponding links support my argument.\n",

Why are kids still cruel to each other to the point that the victims come back to school with guns to kill their abusers if these programs are being carried out as claimed? \n \n And you want to know something about me whom these anti-christians have labeled as a homophobic hatemonger? When I was a kid and one of the most popular kids around school, I stood up for and always defended those kids that just didn't seem to fit in with the crowd from the jerks and bullies who thought it was fun to insult and hurt them just because they were different.\n \n So I raised my kids to be sensitive to those with less going for them than mine had going for them. But why don't you question that the results we are getting don't match the claims being made of what these groups are saying they are trying to accomplish? It's because they aren't teaching kids to respect others who are different at all, but are only teaching that being homosexual is right and normal when it isn't.

In the 1970s, 13 percent of nonteachers said there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. By 2006, 32 percent of them felt this way. During the 1970s, 18 percent of teachers also saw nothing wrong with it. By 2006, about a third saw nothing wrong with it; there was no significant difference between the two groups. If we control for education, however, we find that in each of the four decades, teachers are from 10 to 15 percentage points less likely than other Americans with 16 or more years of schooling to see nothing wrong with homosexuality \nHey, what happened to the conspiracy?",

On homosexuality and abortion, teachers tend to be more liberal than less-educated Americans but more conservative than those with high levels of education.\n\n \n Maybe if we insisted on less education for teachers they would better approach the general population.",
