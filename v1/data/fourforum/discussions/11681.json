It was almost like she threw mud and hit McCain in the back of the head. In that kind of forum that is EXTREMELY dangerous because Biden had the chance to explain why he and Obama voted the way they did. Basically it is like she went \"you are terrible because you voted against troop funding\", Biden comes back with \"So did McCain, here is why WE did it\", but you never hear about why McCain did it, so he just stays labeled as a terrible person who did not support the troops. \n \n \nYeah, as soon as she started with that, I cringed.

He respresents a Herbert Hoover kind of guy. Warned it was coming, had a plan to do something about it, and probably would not take no for an answer. Well, historically things seem to be repeating themselves, because Hoovers warnings were not heard. So the questions now are these: Who will play the role of FDR? MaCain or Obama? McCain seems a better fit for the part, but that is probably not a good thing anyway. And, will we need a Truman?",
