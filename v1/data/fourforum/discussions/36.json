   "Most of the comments here are way off what the real issue that affirmative action tries to deal with. ACtually over 63% of the country supports affirmative action. Many of these comments here such as:\n \"Many times they slide through school and this is the only reason why they get into colleges...it's an excuse to be lazy because they know they'll be special anyway.\"\n Broker\n \n Is proof that people are still racist and don't think objectively. Stereotypes such as that prove there is a need for Affirmative Action. And just to rpove you all wrong about your theories here is how mcuh your chances will improve without Affirmative Action or as I like to call it Affirmative Consideration. It is taken from a Michigan Law Review Article.\n \n http://amptoons.com/blog/arc20030119.html#BlogID181\n \n \n Also here is the Michigan Law Review Article written by Goodwin Liu an Asian that would benefit from removal of Affirmative Consideration.\n \n \n http://www.umich.edu/~urel/admissions/statements/liu.html\n \n \n A tiny excerpt to help expand your mind.\n \n Affirmative action is widely thought to be unfair because it benefits minority applicants at the expense of more deserving whites. Yet this perception tends to inflate the cost beyond its real proportions. While it is true that affirmative action gives minority applicants a significant boost in selective admissions, it is not true that most white applicants would fare better if elite schools eliminated the practice. Understanding why is crucial to separating fact from fiction in the national debate over affirmative action. \n In 1974, Bakke was one of 3,109 regular applicants to the medical school. With the racial quota, the average likelihood of admission for regular applicants was 2.7 percent (84 divided by 3,109). With no racial quota, the average likelihood of admission would have been 3.2 percent (100 divided by 3,109). So the quota increased the average likelihood of rejection from 96.8 percent to 97.3 percent. \n \n To be sure, Bakke was not an average applicant. Only one-sixth of regular applicants (roughly 520) received an interview. But even among these highly qualified applicants, eliminating the racial quota would have increased the average rate of admission from 16 percent (84 divided by 520) to only 19 percent (100 divided by 520). Certainly a few more regular applicants would have been admitted were it not for affirmative action. But Bakke, upon receiving his rejection letter, had no reason to believe he would have been among the lucky few.\n \n Get the Facts!!!!!!!!",

   "in some sense there is a need to have affirmative action, despite the fact that it is discrimination. everyone agrees that the person with the right skills for the job (school) is the one who should get the position, but that is never true, and affirmative action brings it closer to being true. \n \n just to make things clearer, let's look specifically at schools. most schools don't look at just grades and SAT scores, despite the fact that those are the two things that decide on the capability of the student, and even if they do, there is a degree of unfairness.\n \n a child raised in a family with highly educated parents would do better academically, on avarage. i don't think there is any doubt in this. unfortunately, african americans don't have this luxury. a child with parents who are former slaves would probably not do very well academically and, hence, won't be highly educated. a child with not so highly educated parents probably wouldn't do well academically and, hence, won't be highly educated. this slavery business sets up a chain... and affirmative actions is an attempt at breaking this.\n \n it's clear that caucasian americans are, statistically speaking, wealthier, and, hence, can afford to send their kids to extracurricular activities, and, as you all probably know, those are highly regarded in college admissions. a child of immigrants who make barely enough to survive probably would work after school instead of joining the debate club, or math team, or out playing soccer. this person clearly has a lower chance of getting into the same school if he/she has the same SAT score and grades as another person from a richer family (which has a high chance of being caucasian, statistically speaking) who can afford to send the kids to soccer camps and debate tournaments.\n \n a child of influential parents are more likely to be admitted; why haven't people made a big deal out of this? most influential parents are caucasian americans, as how likely can a son/daughter of slaves be influential? take, for example, mister president. i don't think anyone doubts his less than 1200 SAT score, mostly C grades, and yale undergraduate education. you have to naturally wonder how this is possible? it's been a long time since high school, but i was in the top 10% of the class (mostly A's with sparing B's) with over 1350 SAT, and i am certain that if i had applied to yale, i would not have gotten in. \n \n i think when people look at it and say affirmative action is discrimination, and discrimination is bad, so affmirative action is bad, they are neglecting the big picture. it's easy enough to say \"two people with the same 'status' should have equal treatment\", but you have to ask how these people came about to get this \"status\". obviously a millionaire who inherits all his/her money from his/her parents is not so respectable as a millionaire whose parents were in poverty.\n \n believe it or not, the nebulous shape of society as it is today experience much of the repercussions of the not so desirable history of america, and this needs correction....\n \n i guess i should leave with saying that i am neither caucasian nor african american, so affirmative action wouldn't benefit me, but, in fact, it hinders. most schools do implement a kind of affirmative action where they admit students so as to balance out the racial distributions of the student body. i didn't get some schools (this was a long time ago) because of this, but i thought it was necessary.\n \n \n there..... maybe you would like that. sorry i had to break the chain of agreements.",

If a racist person hated blacks so much that he wouldn't hire them, then why would that person institute affirmative action to \"equal the playing field.\" He doesn't want the playing field equal. Affirmative action is instituted by those who are already fair, and that only makes it unfair for those in the majority\"\n \n That is what yous till don't get. You don't have to be so much better.

   "I think you missed the point of my post, though I'll ignore the condenscending attitude that came as part of the response (btw, I don't deserve to be in college, that's why I am a high school junior).\n \n You say we need AA until racism ends and equal oppurtunity exists. What is racism? It is the perception that blacks (or members of X race) are inferior to others. But that is ALL it is, a perception. If you agree, as I'm sure we both do, that racism is a misguided perception that is entirely unwarrented by any factual support, then the manner in which we eliminate racism must be by eliminating the perceptions that feed it, not be strengthening them. AA seeks to eliminate the non-existant factual support for racism (perhaps that blacks are poor or weak), but in giving preferential treatment it actually strengthens the root of racism, the PERCEPTION that they are inferior and that they can't succeed without help. If AA will exist until there is no racism, it will exist forever, because AA increases racist perceptions.\n \n I'd like to point out something here. I am a minority. Specifically I am Jewish. Now, anyone who denies that Jews have experienced significant discrimination in the past, as much as any other group, is delusional. I'd go so far to say that Jews have seen more discrimination, across history, than any other group. Why doesn't AA apply to us? Simple. We know that, so long as De Jure racism (or anti-semitism) is illegalized, we can win on the level playing field. De Jure anti-semitism has been banned awhile ago, and Jews have made good in the world. De jure racism has been banned to, and its time for blacks to step up. What characteristic of blacks makes them unable to this? I say none, because I BELIEVE THEY ARE MY EQUALS. To say that they are unable to step up on there own after the elimination of De jure racism is to demean them and to put them on a lower plane than any other oppressed person who has succeeded in the modern world. I consider that racism at its worst.\n \n \nThe reason is that minorities have it tougher and are at a disadvantage at competing. It isn't a question as to whether they're smarter or less intelligent. It's whether we have to work harder at to compete because of the disadvantages we face such as discrimination, economic confinement, lack of educational family support, bias standardized testing, and the value of diversity. \n \n Let's address the hardships one at a time:\n 1) discrimination: can be applied to anyone. Jews, muslims, blacks, even whites in some areas. It is hardly a unique harm, blacks aren't the only one to be discriminated against. If someone can demonstratably prove that they have been discriminated against and overcame it, that should be a consideration in any endeavor. But to a) assume all blacks have faced discrimination and b) that no one else has, is fallacious.\n 2) economic confinement: class-based. Does it impact blacks more than other folks? sure. Can we trace it back to 1950s de jure racism? sure. That doesn't change the fact that we solve it based on economic grounds, not racial ones. The harms of economic confinement are as bad to a poor white as a poor black, and thus both deserve equal remedies from the state.\n 3) Educational family support: again, that's primarly a class characteristic (of poor folks). Thus, solve it as a class problem.\n 4) bias in standardized testing: I have never seen a warrent for why the tests are biased. And no, low scores aren't a warrent.\n 5) value of diversity: What is the value of diversity? that it presents a variety of opinions, thus broadening the perspective of the group. But a race, by definition, doesn't have its own set of opinions, PEOPLE have opinions. A conservative, J. Crew, rich black kid isn't going to help make UPenn more diverse, because his opinions and perspectives are the same as the overall student body. By arguing that black people, by definition, bring diversity into thought is a racist assumption, it defines the individual solely as a member of the whole and denies the importance and uniqueness of the individual. In a nutshell, this is the problem with AA, despite its good intentions, it makes spectacularly racist assumptions. ALL black kids have faced discrimination, ALL have faced hardships, ALL are economically below-average, ALL have a unique perspective on life only given to black people. This is ludicrous, there are rich black kids that have faced no hardships, seen no discrimination, and have been totally accepted by society. This is a distinction that has to be recognized by society as a whole, for as long as society sees blacks only as a victimized, lower-class, they will remain a victimized, lower-class. Only if we treat them as equals and agree to evaluate them as equals will they truely become equals in society.",

   "DSAdevil\n \n Sorry I didn't realize that you are still in HS. Maybe when you get to college and exposed to more perspective you'll understand this.\n \n I'll just answer each of your arguments that you listed.\n \n 1 I never said discrimination didn't exist for anyone except minorities. The rationale is that some peole suffer it more and a different level of severtiy than others. Assuming all blacks have suffered discrimination is not fallcious. Until 30 years ago every Black was discriminated against legally. Directly or indirectly every Black has suffered discrimination. The extent and severity is not anywhere to the levels of pre-1970's and hopefully never will be. The whole fact that the majority still do face discrimination and it's better to protect those interest at the expense of a few that haven't \"suffered\" discrimination and many minorities still face it as well.\n \n 2 Class based? I don't think so. Considering that there are so many restrictive covenants that stand the legal test but basically segregate areas. Take for instance LA. As soon as blacks moved out of the ghettos into suburbs the value went down. Whites moved out and decreased the property value. Low property value combined with racist measures the city became resegregated and left with substandard public services creating new ghettos.\n ASk anyone from Tennessee, Alabama, East LA, etc who has it worse, poor blacks or poor whites. Many lawsuits stem from those discriminatory practices. If you think its class based you need to wait til after HS to make that statement.\n \n 3 You don't understand educational family support. Until 30 yrs ago the door to universities was pretty much closed to minorities in general not just Blacks. So what we're seeing is many first or second generation On the other hand many of the other non-discriminated have been in college longer maybe even upto 8 generations. That is substantial assistance to have a support group of college graduates. THat is not class based. Many in that class fall in that category but it isn't because of classs that minorites are in that situation its because of past discrimination that so many find themselves in that situation.\n \n \n 4 You know i don't know what to say. If science doesn't warrant anything then we really can't argue anything but opinions here.\n If thousand of studies haven't proved standardized testing is bias I think nothing will. Go to google or proquest and research the subject. Just because you don't knwo about it doesn't really mean much. That's jsut your fault for not researching.\n \n 5 So you thing that class determines perspective? That diversity can only bring in a certain viewpoint because of their circumstances? If you see a Black person get beat do you think you feel teh same as a black person from the upper echelon? Really DSA you're not in college and really out of your league on this one. Like the brief file by the Association of University Presidents on behalf of the University of Michigan stated, \" We go to college to see differences not similarities\". Growing up a certain race has its unique challenges and opportunities. Growing up in a certain class has it's own unique challenges and opportunities as well. Class and race are separate but btoh bring their own pespectives. You need to expose yourself to mroe minorities to understand that.\n \n \n I know Jews have suffered longest among recorded history. The fact that Jews and Asians have overcome them is remarkable. Also the fact that other minorites have persevered in face of racism is also commendable. The fact is that the legacy of the civil rights movement is that \" we suffered so that you can have a better life\". The fact that minorities have had to struggle to succeed among unfair challenges doesn't mean that everyone should. Just because our people used to have to do it doesn't mean that is the way it should be. it jsut proves that you can do ti without it. And just because you can do it without it doesn't mean that you should have to do it. There are perceptions that if Blacks don't make the strides that Affirmative action provides that racism will grow. Also if it \"perpetuates racism\" then it proves the need to have affirmative consideration because that is what we need to counteract racism. If it racism doesn't exist then ti can't perspetuatue it. The fact that you wnat to eliminate a sytem to cobat racism without offering an alternative is not logical.\n \n \n WJM read all the above that will answer some of your arguments. \n \n Never has anyone said minorities need AA affirmative consideration (action) to get into schools it simply means we work harder in light of our circumstances to get to that point. That many put in the same effort as another non-discriminated applicant and may end up short. Affirmative Consideration will help those students.\n \n Affirmative Consideration takes into account race to help an applicant doesn't necessarily make them \"less qualified\". It takes into account that each person brings special experiences with them. Even if that weren't the case the fact that the minorities would be hurt more severely than \"white males\" without it. The curent policies actulaly protect more than it hurts. These programs aren't perfect but its better than the alternative.\n \n Let the courts deal with it. Tell that to Rodney King. Proving discrimination is so hard because there are so many ways subtle and blatant that it can nvere be remedied by the court systems. Remember that cases filed in court are teh only ones that we have discovered or actually can prove. What do you think would have happened to Rodney King's case if it weren't video'd? How many cases like that exist that we can't prove? Affirmative action is to help compenste for those cases we can't prove and to help ensure that it change. If you have another system that can change that then lets hear it.\n \n Also Michigan's addmission process doesn't discriminate that is why the courts should leave it alone.",

   "OK, mana'ia, now I'm getting upset, because you give no warrent as to why my opinions are less valid just because I am in high school. How do you know what perspectives and experiences I have had? You stereotype on assumptions based on the whole of high schoolers. How ageist of you. Perhaps I defy the whole.\n \n \n1 I never said discrimination didn't exist for anyone except minorities. The rationale is that some peole suffer it more and a different level of severtiy than others. Assuming all blacks have suffered discrimination is not fallcious. Until 30 years ago every Black was discriminated against legally. Directly or indirectly every Black has suffered discrimination. The extent and severity is not anywhere to the levels of pre-1970's and hopefully never will be. The whole fact that the majority still do face discrimination and it's better to protect those interest at the expense of a few that haven't \"suffered\" discrimination and many minorities still face it as well.\n \n And 30 years ago your argument would make sense. But as for recent immigrants, or in the case of college applicants, people who were born after the 30 year cut off, the de jure discrimination didn't exist. I don't see that TODAY the majority face discrimination TODAY. And I certainly don't see applicants to college today that have faced de jure discrimiantion (unless you are applying at 45 years old). But all of that misses the point. IF the applicants can prove bona fide discrimination, that should be taken into account, for sure. But to make it a mandatory assumption IS fallacious, because not everyone has been discriminated against. You say that this is justified because the majority today is still being discriminated against based on race but 1) I don't buy that and 2) why use such a broad remedy as AA when we can make a more narrowly tailored one that actually benefits those who have been harmed?\n \n2 Class based? I don't think so. Considering that there are so many restrictive covenants that stand the legal test but basically segregate areas. Take for instance LA. As soon as blacks moved out of the ghettos into suburbs the value went down. Whites moved out and decreased the property value. Low property value combined with racist measures the city became resegregated and left with substandard public services creating new ghettos.\n\n Bingo. What here is causing the problem? Low property values. One which are brought about by racism? Perhaps. But we can still solve the problem by either a) working to raise the property values or b) making it so our cities don't offer sub-standard services to areas with low property values. Either way, its an economic based solution. And while past racism might give blacks a higher propensity for living in poor areas, the problems of living in a poor area still effect a poor black and a poor white the same (bad schools, poor services etc.)\n \n3 You don't understand educational family support. Until 30 yrs ago the door to universities was pretty much closed to minorities in general not just Blacks. So what we're seeing is many first or second generation On the other hand many of the other non-discriminated have been in college longer maybe even upto 8 generations. That is substantial assistance to have a support group of college graduates. THat is not class based. Many in that class fall in that category but it isn't because of classs that minorites are in that situation its because of past discrimination that so many find themselves in that situation.\n \n Umm...I understand the point just fine thanks. But we can agree that living in a family where your parents have not gone to college is the harm here right? Then the solution is saying, \"hey, this person lived in a family without any family support, and they still did X accomplishment. He should be rewarded.\" That is a narrowly tailored solution that solves the problem for members of any race who have been afflicted with this problem. Your solution on the other hand is \"This person is black. Therefore his parents couldn't POSSIBLY be college educated. We'll mark him up for that.\" That's a) racist and b) less precise than my method, which actually targets the people affected. Unless your claim is that most poor whites have college educations, the harms you are attributing to lack of educational support don't flow only to poor blacks, but to poor people in general. the fact that blacks don't have college educations for different REASONS doesn't change the fact that essentially, we are dealing with the same problem here, regardless of the root cause.\n \n4 You know i don't know what to say. If science doesn't warrant anything then we really can't argue anything but opinions here.\n \n I've done my research thanks. All the studies I have seen have shown that blacks score worse than whites. But that doesn't necessarily prove racism. Why not? Because it can be as easily attributed to the fact that blacks are more likely to be poor as a result of past discrimination. For the test to be racist, then blacks and whites in similar socio-economic situations would have to be shown to perform differently. That study I have yet to see, and in fact the studies I see have shown that economic conditions are more of a factor than race. But, thanks for automatically assuming I've done no research.\n \n5 So you thing that class determines perspective? That diversity can only bring in a certain viewpoint because of their circumstances? If you see a Black person get beat do you think you feel teh same as a black person from the upper echelon? Really DSA you're not in college and really out of your league on this one. Like the brief file by the Association of University Presidents on behalf of the University of Michigan stated, \" We go to college to see differences not similarities\". Growing up a certain race has its unique challenges and opportunities. Growing up in a certain class has it's own unique challenges and opportunities as well. Class and race are separate but btoh bring their own pespectives. You need to expose yourself to mroe minorities to understand that.\n \n I feel plenty \"in the league\" thanks. You never addressed my core point, that perspective is an INDIVIDUAL entity, it doesn't occur as a whole. In terms of who we empathize with, I see more in common with a black of my class than a white of a different one. In terms of how we live, how we see the world, what oppurtunities we've had, all of that I am more similar to the black kid than the white one. Basically, the automatic assumption of differing perspectives due to race, in itself, is a racist assumption, a point you never refute. I agree whole heartedly with U of M's sentiments. But I see more similarities with a black kid of my class then with a white kid of a different class.\n \nI know Jews have suffered longest among recorded history. The fact that Jews and Asians have overcome them is remarkable. Also the fact that other minorites have persevered in face of racism is also commendable. The fact is that the legacy of the civil rights movement is that \" we suffered so that you can have a better life\". The fact that minorities have had to struggle to succeed among unfair challenges doesn't mean that everyone should. Just because our people used to have to do it doesn't mean that is the way it should be. it jsut proves that you can do ti without it. And just because you can do it without it doesn't mean that you should have to do it.\n \n In this case, the fact that it can be done without preferential treatment DOES mean that it should be done without preferential treatment. Why? Because preferential treatment, violates rights, and that should always be a last resort. If their is another way to the solution, one that doesn't violate rights, then that is the route you need to take. Especially when you consider that the plan I give is more narrowly tailored and solves the problem more precisely than the blunt object that is AA, I think we de facto go to mine rather than yours, as mine presents equal treatment AND STILL takes into account personal hardship.\n \nThere are perceptions that if Blacks don't make the strides that Affirmative action provides that racism will grow. Also if it \"perpetuates racism\" then it proves the need to have affirmative consideration because that is what we need to counteract racism. If it racism doesn't exist then ti can't perspetuatue it. The fact that you wnat to eliminate a sytem to cobat racism without offering an alternative is not logical.\n \n umm...for a college attendee you seem to be remarkably consistant about missing the analysis I give. I said AA perptuates racism, that is, it is a cause of racism. You say, in effect \"Because AA produces racism, we need AA to combat racism.\" So AA is needed to....combat the effects of itself? Not to mention since I already proved AA is, in itself a racist assumption (another point that went unrefuted), this defies common sense. The perception is that blacks, now that de jure racist standards have been eliminated, can't do it alone. The solution is to prove they can. The alternative I give is one based on individual circumstances, not on percieved harms to the whole. Again, if one can prove bona fide discrimination to the individual, that should be taken into consideration for sure. But to assume prima facia that all blacks or all anyones have been discriminated against is fallacious and racist.",

   "DSA- Sorry if I offended you. You could defy the whole world. More than likely you don't. I make statements more on probability than possibilities.\n \n \n \"And 30 years ago your argument would make sense. But as for recent immigrants, or in the case of college applicants, people who were born after the 30 year cut off, the de jure discrimination didn't exist. I don't see that TODAY the majority face discrimination TODAY. And I certainly don't see applicants to college today that have faced de jure discrimination\"\n \n So you're logic is that as soon as the Federal Government stepped in and enforced equality that instantaneously everything was equal? That is very presumptuous and false. My parents immigrated here in 1970's and did they feel racism. Have you eve been to Mississippi, Alabama, or Tennessee? They are still totally racist there. I don't know why those people there put up with it. You don't see inner city kids getting less? What happened in lawsuits filed in NY in the 1980's to force schools to give proportionate amounts to inner city schools? What about when I went to apply for an apartment at six different places and they told me they were all full. Then later that same day 4 of my friends told me they got an apartment an hour after me at one of the places? Even though you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It exists and there are hundreds of lawsuits showing that it exists. Even government officials admitting to racism. Just last year NJ State police chief acknowledge that they racially profile? Did you see that? Did you see the $115 million that Texaco paid in 1998 for discrimination? Texaco almost destroyed all the evidence but luckily they had tapped the place to prevent that. What would have happened if the courts didn't grant the bugging? DSA really think before you speak. Have you ever seen Tonga? Does it exist? So because you don't see and probably most of your friends have never seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n \n \"IF the applicants can prove bona fide discrimination, that should be taken into account, for sure.\"\n \n Like Rodney King needed to prove bona fide discrimination. Remember that they had testimonies from other policemen and previous complaints. They showed a video of the beating and witnesses of them calling him names. Yet the jury found that the officers weren't guilty and Rodney King wasn't discriminated or suffered police brutality. Yeah that's the solution make everyone prove it. Do you see how impracticable that is to require every instance of discrimination to be proven? Who has the time and resources to go and prove every act of discrimination? I want to see you prove that a major corporation like Texaco or the State of NJ discriminated against you.\n \n \"But to make it a mandatory assumption IS fallacious, because not everyone has been discriminated against.\"\n Indirectly every minority has been discriminated. Racism is entrenched in so many parts of this country. It's true many face trivial effects but something that affects collectively in many ways hurts individually. \n \n \"You say that this is justified because the majority today is still being discriminated against based on race but 1) I don't buy that and 2) why use such a broad remedy as AA when we can make a more narrowly tailored one that actually benefits those who have been harmed?\"\n \n You don't buy that? Wow, what an argument? There are cases when even Jews have discriminated against other minorities. Jews have suffered many anti-Semitic problems from the past. The problem is this country has not discriminated against Jews even to the extent of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and many of the other minorities. The fact is that you don't know because you probably are very fair and most people can't distinguish Jews from other \"whites\". It's not like people see Jews and instantly know that they're Jews unless they're wearing something very traditional. If something is hurting collectively then help them collectively. If you can draft a narrow based one that can ensure the problems of the past will be counteracted then I will accept that.\n \n \"What here is causing the problem? Low property values. One which are brought about by racism? Perhaps. But we can still solve the problem by either a) working to raise the property values or b) making it so our cities don't offer sub-standard services to areas with low property values.\"\n \n I think that will make people more upset than to have affirmative consideration. Property value is based upon demand. When you get to college you realize this. So the government is going to subsidize housing to increase property value? The government did that in what are housing projects known as the \"projects\". You can't expect \"whites\" to be mandated to buy homes in housing projects. The system won't work. When minorities move into any suburb in force, most people that can afford to leave do. The other argument to requiring cities to offer equal services to all schools is already required. The fact is that it just doesn't happen. Until it is done we should at least keep affirmative consideration.\n \n \"And while past racism might give blacks a higher propensity for living in poor areas, the problems of living in a poor area still effect a poor black and a poor white the same (bad schools, poor services etc.)\"\n \n Have you been to poor rural areas of Idaho, Nebraska, and Oklahoma? Do you honestly believe the conditions and education of poor white kids is the same for poor Hispanics, Blacks, and other minorities in the cities? Seriously DSA you keep killing your credibility with all these assumptions. There is no way that the poor white boy in Tennessee has equal conditions to the poor black kid there.\n \n \"hey, this person lived in a family without any family support, and they still did X accomplishment. He should be rewarded.\"\n \n I agree with that and affirmative consideration takes that into account. Also many schools allow applicants to express that in their personal statement. I don't think though it balances out the other inequities.\n \n Your solution on the other hand is \"This person is black. Therefore his parents couldn't POSSIBLY be college educated. We'll mark him up for that.\"\n \n That is not what I'm saying and don't put words in my mouth. I'm saying this person is black and in all likelihood his family didn't go to college. And the fact that even if one of his family members did go to college doesn't compensate for the lack of support from the rest of the family. This is not a main issue of affirmative consideration anyways. It's one of the arguments that people should consider.\n \n \"I've done my research thanks. All the studies I have seen have shown that blacks score worse than whites. But that doesn't necessarily prove racism. Why not? Because it can be as easily attributed to the fact that blacks are more likely to be poor as a result of past discrimination.\"\n \n I don't know what to tell you. I guess your research never pulled up these facts. \n \n \n The speeded nature of the SAT imposes an unfair burden on students for whom English is not the first language. Research suggests that the SAT I does not predict Hispanic students' first-year college grades as accurately as it does white students' grades. One study found that even for bilingual students whose best language was English the SAT I underpredicted college performance\n \n Biased format: Research shows that a fast-paced, multiple-choice format favors males over females. Guessing, a risk males are more likely to take, is rewarded. Since multiple-choice items do not allow for shades of meaning they work against the most typical female thinking style.\n \n Biased language: Idiomatic terms such as \"ball and chain\" (to indicate a married partner) and \"straight from the horse's mouth\" may not be familiar to many test-takers, particularly those whose first language isn't English, causing them to choose wrong answers.\n \n \n \n http://www.fairtest.org/\n \n http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m0HRV/1_24/71761765/p1/article.jhtml\n \n \n \n \n \"For the test to be racist, then blacks and whites in similar socio-economic situations would have to be shown to perform differently. That study I have yet to see, and in fact the studies I see have shown that economic conditions are more of a factor than race. But, thanks for automatically assuming I've done no research.\"\n \n Sorry I just assumed that since you did not find out any of these facts you didn't do your research. I mean if you didn't see it in google or any other search I don't know what kind of research you did. Even in the library there are books about standardized testing biases all together with any of the standardized testing material Maybe you just researched off the website of Center for Individual Rights. Sorry maybe I went to a different high school where researching was done differently.\n \n \n \n 'You never addressed my core point, that perspective is an INDIVIDUAL entity, it doesn't occur as a whole.\"\n \n Sorry I didn't know you were making a point that people have their own minds. I thought there wasn't a question about that. Individual perspective happens individually true but it is affected by perspectives collectively. The Supreme Court refers to it as \"Critical Mass\". Critical Mass was upheld in Allan Bakke Case. Since that case the Supreme Court upheld that you need to allow enough minorities into an institution that you can get an idea of what they are collectively. If they allow just a few that meet a certain criteria it would skew the perception of a minority group and enforce stereotypes. All these were compelling interest to allow affirmative consideration. For educational purposes you might not bring in enough view points to a school with a small minority group.",

For educational purposes you might not bring in enough view points to a school with a small minority group.\n \n \n \"I see more in common with a black of my class than a white of a different one. In terms of how we live, how we see the world, what oppurtunities we've had, all of that I am more similar to the black kid than the white one.\"\n \n There you go stereotyping saying that you see Black kids in a certain way and that way is similar. I probably know more Blacks than you and from different parts of the country and different classes and I'll tell you that class difference only affects certain elements of perspective. So you proved that since you've only seen a certain type of Black student from a certain class being more similar to you and I have seen an opposite that there is a compelling interest to have a larger critical mass number and also to help you see other Black perspectives. The fact that you stereotype shows the need more exposure to help you open up a new perspective of what individuality of a race and yet what similarities they share collectively. The fact that you see it one way is really not a relevant issue when facts show contrary to your limited exposure.\n \n \"In this case, the fact that it can be done without preferential treatment DOES mean that it should be done without preferential treatment. Why? Because preferential treatment, violates rights, and that should always be a last resort.\"\n \n Exactly our point preferential treatment violates rights. When the current system shows lack sensitivity for the advantages not overcome in 30 yrs for a group collectively then it violates rights. Affirmative consideration should be given to counteract those problems that we have already shown. You say that if we eliminate affirmative action it won't violate rights. How do you see that when you have already admitted that there are problems and disadvantages currently for minorities?\n \n Just because you can get educated in a segregated school doesn't mean its right. Again to force someone to accept inequalities and work harder to overcome them is not equitable. Explain to me because someone overcomes inequities proves that there are no inequities?\n \n \n \n \"Especially when you consider that the plan I give is more narrowly tailored and solves the problem more precisely than the blunt object that is AA, I think we de facto go to mine rather than yours, as mine presents equal treatment AND STILL takes into account personal hardship.\"\n \n No system is perfect and the more narrowly you tailor something like this the more people fall through the cracks. You solution does not take into account of current discrimination, test biases, and the other challenges minorities face. It's better that you protect the group and benefit the few than benefit the few and hurt the majority.\n \n \"I said AA perptuates racism, that is, it is a cause of racism.\"\n Quick vocabulary lesson from Webster's dictionary: per\u00b7pet\u00b7u\u00b7ate to make perpetual or cause to last indefinitely Perpetual 1 a : continuing forever : EVERLASTING b (1) : valid for all time (2) : holding (as an office) for life or for an unlimited time2 : occurring continually : indefinitely long-continued\n 3 : blooming continuously throughout the season synonym see CONTINUAL\n \n Do you see in there anything that refers or is similar to create? If you meant causes or creates that is one thing but you didn't say that. And by the way I said,\" If it racism doesn't exist then ti can't perspetuatue it.\" You can't perpetuate something that doesn't exist. According to definition how can you continue something that doesn't exist? If you thought perpetuate and create were the same word then of course you'd be confused. Don't worry though I'm sure it will be part of your Senior English vocabulary.\n \n Then let's take for example your assumption is true (remember this is only an assumtion), that, \"I said AA perptuates racism, that is, it is a cause of racism\". That AA is actually a cause of racism. If that is true then we shouldn't do anything that causes racism even if it's right. What a criteria. We should abolish interracial marriages, integration, and minority advancement because they also in some cases cause racism. Racism is wrong and if an individual is racist then the problem is the individual and not the system. Racism is ignorance. There is no cure for ignorance than education. It's like the logic of let's not pursue terrorist because it will create more terrorists or terrorists threats. That line of thinking is counter productive. If you don't act against terrorist because of the possibility of more terrorism then you've empowered terrorist and they've accomplished their goals. Respectively if you don't act against racism for fear of more racism then you're empowering the racists and they are accomplishing their goals. Why didn't the country stop with integration when it caused more contention and racism among \"whites'?\n \n \" Not to mention since I already proved AA is, in itself a racist assumption (another point that went unrefuted), this defies common sense\"\n \n Your point was refuted and this isn't some high school LD debate.\n \n \"The perception is that blacks, now that de jure racist standards have been eliminated, can't do it alone. The solution is to prove they can.\"\n \n Just because you can get educated in a segregated school doesn't mean its right. Again to force someone to accept inequalities and work harder to overcome them is not equitable. Explain to me because someone overcomes inequities proves that there are no inequities?\n \n \"The alternative I give is one based on individual circumstances, not on percieved harms to the whole. Again, if one can prove bona fide discrimination to the individual, that should be taken into consideration for sure. But to assume prima facia that all blacks or all anyones have been discriminated against is fallacious and racist\"\n \n Like I already explained how come if they were hurt as a whole you want to compensate them individually? Doesn't it make more sense to compensate as a whole when they've been hurt as a whole? I'm sorry that you know that if a Jews were discriminated as a whole wouldn't affect you individually. Maybe you and you're ancestry is not as well interconnected to accept that mentality. No offense but that line of mentality really irritates me.\n \n Some more facts about Standardized testing that I forgot to include.\n \n includes questions about foods, furniture, television programs, legends, computer usage, and views of private and public property that advantage students from white, middle-class backgrounds and those who grew up in the US\n \n Questions for the exam are given trials and the entire exam is \"normed\" using focus groups of students that are far whiter and far more representative of the middle class than are urban school districts such as Los Angeles\n \n \n Sorry WJM I don't have time all the time to respond to all posts. I usually do it when I have time.\n \n \"Also, if you could explain how the University of Michigan could discriminate against minorities in their admissions process, please let me know\"\n \n If the inequities are not addressed then you're putting them into an unfair advantage effectively discriminating them.\n \n \"I perservered in spite of some major health problems this year, but it affected my grades. So I want to use Affirmative Action to raise my class rank. Do you think that's fair?\"\n \n If you're problems were above and beyond normal detriments that the majority face you should receive special consideration. Many colleges will favor that in a persona statement. There are even administrators that will write letters to colleges to help out students that have had severe adversity. I think if a situation is severe then allow special consideration. If it were for just say a broken leg; then no. It's inconvenient but very finite and the harm is similar not substantial enough.\n \n Rodney King's video combined with testimonies of other police officers was evidence that there was racism. The jurors against the mainstream public thought otherwise. The court failed. If we are to allow court decisions then why not allow the court decision of permitting affirmative action in the case of Bakke v California; No quotas but affirmative action is necessary to provide critical mass?",

   "\"You said there were no inequities. Now you say that its discrimination if the inequities are not addressed. If the inequities exist, show them to me.\"\n \n What are you talking about WJM? All I've talked about are inequities such as past disrimination, present discrimination, economic conditions, cultural differences, bias standardized testing. That is what I've ben addressing the need for affirmative consideration to combat these inequities. \n \n \n \"I disagree with a blanket adjustment given to all minorities. Some minorities have had to overcome very little, while some have had to overcome much more than others.\"\n \n yeah that's true many have had to overcome much more than others. So then why did we grant equlality to all men? Some minorities like Blacks had it worse than Asians. Hispanics had it worse than Arabs. So why did we grant them all equal protection? Becasue it makes sense to ensure that everyone colectively is protected.

   "DSA- Sorry if I offended you. You could defy the whole \n world. More than likely you don't. I make statements more on probability than possibilities.\n \n Amazing. That's your major flaw in a nutshell. Probabilities, not possibilities. Incredible. Probabilities deals with is likely to happen, possibilities forces us to take into account all scenarios and thus provides for a more exacting standard than probability.\n By the way, incidentally I just finished debating LD at CFL nationals (I got to quarters! :) ). Sorry if you can't handle the style.\n \nSo you're logic is that as soon as the Federal Government stepped in and enforced equality that instantaneously everything was equal? That is very presumptuous and false. My parents immigrated here in 1970's and did they feel racism. Have you eve been to Mississippi, Alabama, or Tennessee? They are still totally racist there. I don't know why those people there put up with it. You don't see inner city kids getting less? What happened in lawsuits filed in NY in the 1980's to force schools to give proportionate amounts to inner city schools? What about when I went to apply for an apartment at six different places and they told me they were all full. Then later that same day 4 of my friends told me they got an apartment an hour after me at one of the places? Even though you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It exists and there are hundreds of lawsuits showing that it exists. Even government officials admitting to racism. Just last year NJ State police chief acknowledge that they racially profile? Did you see that? Did you see the $115 million that Texaco paid in 1998 for discrimination? Texaco almost destroyed all the evidence but luckily they had tapped the place to prevent that. What would have happened if the courts didn't grant the bugging? DSA really think before you speak. Have you ever seen Tonga? Does it exist? So because you don't see and probably most of your friends have never seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n \n My logic is that the de jure discrimination stopped. De facto might not of, but to solve that we have to hit the source, and that means stopping racist perceptions and at the same minimizing that harms it provides, WHEN THE HARMS manifest themselves. Basically, you provide alot of examples of where racism exists, but you still don't warrent how you extend across the board. EG, the fact that Mississippi or Texaco is racist doesn't by definition mean that Maryland or California or Safeway or Microsoft is. So right there you are making a huge logical leap, and NO WHERE HAVE YOU TOLD ME WHY YOU CAN. I've asked again and again for the warrent for claiming racism across the board and you never give it, all you do is give examples. But I can solve for those w/out AA via anti-discrimination statutes, and the point I made that by showing bona fide discrimination, you should still get \"points.\" my distinction is that the harms shouldn't be assumed by default, we need to account for the POSSIBILTY that not all blacks are being harmed by racism even if the probability dictates otherwise, then when we sort out who's been harmed and who hasn't, we work from there. Finally, you talk alot about innercities, but what about the white kids who live in them? Where is the solvency under AA for the harms being given to them?\n \nLike Rodney King needed to prove bona fide discrimination. Remember that they had testimonies from other policemen and previous complaints. They showed a video of the beating and witnesses of them calling him names. Yet the jury found that the officers weren't guilty and Rodney King wasn't discriminated or suffered police brutality. Yeah that's the solution make everyone prove it. Do you see how impracticable that is to require every instance of discrimination to be proven? Who has the time and resources to go and prove every act of discrimination? I want to see you prove that a major corporation like Texaco or the State of NJ discriminated against you.\n \n OK, on both of your examples, you showed the proof yourself. W/ regards with rodney king, you said he DID prove it, and that it didn't mean anything. That's changed under my plan, in which proof of racism means something. W/ texaco, you told us yourself that the plantiffs won the judgement in the case. You say it is impractical for all times of discrimination to be proven, but that is exactly was has to be done in a criminal justice system. Our system is accusatorial, not inquistorial. To achieve remedy from a harm, you have to prove you are actually being harmed, you can't just ask the system to assume a harm exists.\n \nIndirectly every minority has been discriminated. Racism is entrenched in so many parts of this country. It's true many face trivial effects but something that affects collectively in many ways hurts individually.\n \n And you were complaining about ME making warrentless assertions? This takes the cake. You don't provide a warrent for why it happens, other than that in many areas it happens, and even THERE you don't give warrentation. Sheesh.\n \nYou don't buy that? Wow, what an argument? There are cases when even Jews have discriminated against other minorities. Jews have suffered many anti-Semitic problems from the past. The problem is this country has not discriminated against Jews even to the extent of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and many of the other minorities. The fact is that you don't know because you probably are very fair and most people can't distinguish Jews from other \"whites\". It's not like people see Jews and instantly know that they're Jews unless they're wearing something very traditional. If something is hurting collectively then help them collectively. If you can draft a narrow based one that can ensure the problems of the past will be counteracted then I will accept that.\n \n I don't buy it b/c you refuse to give warrentation for the universality of the harm. You've dodged that issue in every post. Give me the warrent for UNIVERSALITY. Not just \"well, it happens alot.\" I do provide thhat system that solves for the harms, that's what my narrowly tailored system does, provides benefits for people who can show they've been harmed, and not to people who can't show harms.\n \nI think that will make people more upset than to have affirmative consideration. Property value is based upon demand. When you get to college you realize this. So the government is going to subsidize housing to increase property value? The government did that in what are housing projects known as the \"projects\". You can't expect \"whites\" to be mandated to buy homes in housing projects. The system won't work. When minorities move into any suburb in force, most people that can afford to leave do. The other argument to requiring cities to offer equal services to all schools is already required. The fact is that it just doesn't happen. Until it is done we should at least keep affirmative consideration.\n \n Straw man argument. Subsidized housing isn't the only way to raise property vaues, you know it. We can just increase the services to their and make it a more desirable place to live. Actually, you provide for the just solution here, providing equal services to poor areas, esp. schools. This is our solution and unfortunately it ISN'T mandated (San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez). That should and needs to happen, and that's the avenue we should take.\n \nHave you been to poor rural areas of Idaho, Nebraska, and Oklahoma? Do you honestly believe the conditions and education of poor white kids is the same for poor Hispanics, Blacks, and other minorities in the cities? Seriously DSA you keep killing your credibility with all these assumptions. There is no way that the poor white boy in Tennessee has equal conditions to the poor black kid there.\n \n Yes. I do believe that. I believe that two poor kids have the same problem regardless of there race. You ASSUME otherwise without providing a warrent. I don't make an assumption, I warrent the claim by saying that the harms that occur to poor kids that are white (lack of access to schools, poor standard of living, no oppurtunity) are the same to those of black kids. You're assuming that there is some intangible difference without telling us what it is. That's far greater an assumption than anything I do.\n (continued on next post....)",

   "I agree with that and affirmative consideration takes that into account. Also many schools allow applicants to express that in their personal statement. I don't think though it balances out the other inequities.\n (RE: My claim that colleges can look to lack of family support and mark up for it.)\n \nThat is not what I'm saying and don't put words in my mouth. I'm saying this person is black and in all likelihood his family didn't go to college. And the fact that even if one of his family members did go to college doesn't compensate for the lack of support from the rest of the family. This is not a main issue of affirmative consideration anyways. It's one of the arguments that people should consider.\n (RE: my claim that AA marks up all blacks based on the assumption that they dont have family support, regardless of whether they do or don't)\n Here's the problem. It doesn't necessarily take into account family support, because the system still gives the same benefit to a black kid with family support as to one without, and the same lack of benefit to a white kid without family support as to one with. Basically, the question here is: If I see a black person, and assume \"He can't possibly have a college education,\" Is that a racist thought? Yes. Why is it any less racist for a college to make a same assumption about the parents of black kids, without even bothering to check for it? The harm here is especially sharp when you consider that here at least the harm almost ALWAYS applies to poor whites in the same way, b/c they don't the family support of a college educated parent either. Yet they don't get the benefits you claim are necessary.\n \n The speeded nature of the SAT imposes an unfair burden on students for whom English is not the first language. Research suggests that the SAT I does not predict Hispanic students' first-year college grades as accurately as it does white students' grades. One study found that even for bilingual students whose best language was English the SAT I underpredicted college performance\n \n Biased format: Research shows that a fast-paced, multiple-choice format favors males over females. Guessing, a risk males are more likely to take, is rewarded. Since multiple-choice items do not allow for shades of meaning they work against the most typical female thinking style.\n \n Biased language: Idiomatic terms such as \"ball and chain\" (to indicate a married partner) and \"straight from the horse's mouth\" may not be familiar to many test-takers, particularly those whose first language isn't English, causing them to choose wrong answers.\n \n\n OK, with regards to 1 and 3, those harms are solved via the TOEFL, which is a test for people for whom english is not the first language.The SAT is a test for people where english is the first language. For non-first languagers, there is an alternative.\n For number 2, one the SAT doesn't favor guessing, that's why they take off a quarter point per wrong answer, it on average negates any benefits. It DOES help if you can narrow it down, but narrowing down answers is an area where the female \"nuanced thinking\" helps not harms. Finally, since only Verbal questions have \"nuances\" (math IS clear cut), the fact that females out perform males on the verbal section of the SAT is somewhat telling.\n Finally, although you don't mention it here, you talk elsewhere about cultural bias in the reading passages. But I can assure you it isn't there. I just took the SAT, and while perhaps the questions on Napster and File sharing are slanted to the mid/upper class males, the passage on the specific challenges of black females as a unique entity from both women and blacks certainly wasn't slanted to me.\n \nSorry I just assumed that since you did not find out any of these facts (RE: on test bias) you didn't do your research. I mean if you didn't see it in google or any other search I don't know what kind of research you did. Even in the library there are books about standardized testing biases all together with any of the standardized testing material Maybe you just researched off the website of Center for Individual Rights. Sorry maybe I went to a different high school where researching was done differently.\n \n Apology accepted (But what's wrong with the CIR?). As to my research, my high school taught me to examine the research as a whole, and that includes checking to see whether the results actually lead to the conclusion. My attack on the studies is that they jump to conclusions because it can be as easily, in fact more easily explained via socio-economic reasons as racial ones. That was my attack, you ignore it and instead accuse me (incorrectly) of doing no research. Smooth.\n \nSorry I didn't know you were making a point that people have their own minds. I thought there wasn't a question about that. Individual perspective happens individually true but it is affected by perspectives collectively. The Supreme Court refers to it as \"Critical Mass\". Critical Mass was upheld in Allan Bakke Case. Since that case the Supreme Court upheld that you need to allow enough minorities into an institution that you can get an idea of what they are collectively. If they allow just a few that meet a certain criteria it would skew the perception of a minority group and enforce stereotypes. All these were compelling interest to allow affirmative consideration. For educational purposes you might not bring in enough view points to a school with a small minority group.\n \n We'll see how Bakke holds up with the U of M case. In the meantime, yes, I was making a point on the individualiness of perspective b/c you seem to not account for it, instead having this racial hive mind (Blacks = Borgs). Why is it affected by perspectives collectively? You don't warrent. Critical mass is about having enough differing perspectives to have a real debate on campus, but I already show how race doesn't necessarily give you this b/c a black kid could and often does have the perspective on the issues as a white kid of the middle class. The point that we need alot of minorities to break down stereotypes is contradictory, because you say we need minorities b/c they provide a unique collective viewpoint independent of whites even of the same social class BUT THEN say we need alot so that they don't have the same view. Either we want this unique view (which I maintain, and my analysis on the matter hasn't really been challenged, doesn't exist) OR we want alot b/c it breaks down stereotypes. Which is it?\n \nThere you go stereotyping saying that you see Black kids in a certain way and that way is similar. I probably know more Blacks than you and from different parts of the country and different classes and I'll tell you that class difference only affects certain elements of perspective. So you proved that since you've only seen a certain type of Black student from a certain class being more similar to you and I have seen an opposite that there is a compelling interest to have a larger critical mass number and also to help you see other Black perspectives. The fact that you stereotype shows the need more exposure to help you open up a new perspective of what individuality of a race and yet what similarities they share collectively. The fact that you see it one way is really not a relevant issue when facts show contrary to your limited exposure.\n \n Wait...I'm stereotyping because....I'm looking to the individual perspective of the person and not cross-applying the expected perspective to every black person I meet? You must have weird definition of stereotype. Again, look back to my analysis on the last point on why you are contradicting yourself, claiming both collective perspective and individual perspective. Oh, and you have no warrent as to why you just assume I know few black people. My \"stereotype\" if you will, is based on my refusal to put a blanket label on an entire race of people. You, by espousing your \"collective perspective\" idea (which you convienantly start disavowing when you start claiming benefits from unique perspectives within the race) stereotype to a far worse degree than i do.\n \nExactly our point preferential treatment violates rights. When the current system shows lack sensitivity for the advantages not overcome in 30 yrs for a group collectively then it violates rights. Affirmative consideration should be given to counteract those problems that we have already shown. You say that if we eliminate affirmative action it won't violate rights. How do you see that when you have already admitted that there are problems and disadvantages currently for minorities?\n \n \"our\" point? Is this the infamous collective mind speaking? As to this point, you can't claim to solve for de facto unequal treatment by creating a system of de jure unequal treatment. The means aren't just here. Since I create a narrower way of remedying the harms you claim from the preferential systems of 30 years ago WITHOUT violating the rights of people TODAY, I both help to eliminate the De facto racism w/out throwing in De Jure discrimination. I'm not claiming that de facto inequities are gone, I'm saying that because we can solve them without creating NEW inequities in the current system, then we should work in that direction.\n (continued again....)",

   "No system is perfect and the more narrowly you tailor something like this the more people fall through the cracks. You solution does not take into account of current discrimination, test biases, and the other challenges minorities face. It's better that you protect the group and benefit the few than benefit the few and hurt the majority.\n \n Actually, the more narrowly and precisely you tailor the system, the LESS people fall through the cracks. Specifically, in my system, white people who have faced the harms you claim the need to solve get a remedy, while black people who have not been harmed don't get remedies reserved for people who do. Your system allows for poor whites to fall through the cracks, mine is more precise, benefiting those with harms.\n \n Quick vocabulary lesson from Webster's dictionary: per\u00b7pet\u00b7u\u00b7ate to make perpetual or cause to last indefinitely Perpetual 1 a : continuing forever : EVERLASTING b (1) : valid for all time (2) : holding (as an office) for life or for an unlimited time2 : occurring continually : indefinitely long-continued\n 3 : blooming continuously throughout the season synonym see CONTINUAL\n \n Do you see in there anything that refers or is similar to create? If you meant causes or creates that is one thing but you didn't say that. And by the way I said,\" If it racism doesn't exist then ti can't perspetuatue it.\" You can't perpetuate something that doesn't exist. According to definition how can you continue something that doesn't exist? If you thought perpetuate and create were the same word then of course you'd be confused. Don't worry though I'm sure it will be part of your Senior English vocabulary.\n \n Ok that was a pretty pathetic attack, considering I think the meaning was quite clear. I don't really misuse perpetuate either, I just am talking in a broader context, IE, that because AA allows for the creation for new racist ideals, it perpetuates (continues) the system of racism that already exists, that it is, it doesn't allow it to die by feeding more racist people into the system. Racism DOES exist, and AA, by creating more reasons to be racist and more racist people, and by make racist assumptions, perpetuates the ideology of racism (makes it continue indefinitely). Care to hit the arguments, and not the semantics? Or are the big bad LD-esque arguments to tough?\n \nThen let's take for example your assumption is true (remember this is only an assumtion), that, \"I said AA perptuates racism, that is, it is a cause of racism\". That AA is actually a cause of racism. If that is true then we shouldn't do anything that causes racism even if it's right. What a criteria. We should abolish interracial marriages, integration, and minority advancement because they also in some cases cause racism. Racism is wrong and if an individual is racist then the problem is the individual and not the system. Racism is ignorance. There is no cure for ignorance than education. It's like the logic of let's not pursue terrorist because it will create more terrorists or terrorists threats. That line of thinking is counter productive. If you don't act against terrorist because of the possibility of more terrorism then you've empowered terrorist and they've accomplished their goals. Respectively if you don't act against racism for fear of more racism then you're empowering the racists and they are accomplishing their goals. Why didn't the country stop with integration when it caused more contention and racism among \"whites'?\n \n OK, sure in some cases, we have to make the racists upset. but we don't do it randomly, we do it for a purpose. The objective of AA (I assume) isn't to make more people racist, but to either\n a) reduce racism (which I show through the last argument that it doesn't, or\n b) reduce the harms caused by racism, of which I solve in a more precise manner without discriminating unnecessarily and without letting other people with comparable harms fall through the cracks. In essence, your argument here is that \"Because we can cause racism to protect rights or because it achieves some good ends, we can cause racism just because we feel like it, even if it is entirely unnecessary.\"\n \nYour point was refuted and this isn't some high school LD debate.\n \n I just showed you why it wasn't refuted, asking you TO refute a point I make isnt unique to LD, and finally if you can't handle logical LD style arguments, that's your problem not mine. Maybe if you returned to high school, you'd remember that :) .\n \nJust because you can get educated in a segregated school doesn't mean its right. Again to force someone to accept inequalities and work harder to overcome them is not equitable. Explain to me because someone overcomes inequities proves that there are no inequities?\n \n Cross-apply previous analysis, I don't say inequities are gone, just that since de jure inequities are gone, I'm solving for the de facto inequities that remain in a more precise manner AND in a manner that has a lower infringement on rights. Even the benefits you claim go my direction here.\n \nLike I already explained how come if they were hurt as a whole you want to compensate them individually? Doesn't it make more sense to compensate as a whole when they've been hurt as a whole? I'm sorry that you know that if a Jews were discriminated as a whole wouldn't affect you individually. Maybe you and you're ancestry is not as well interconnected to accept that mentality. No offense but that line of mentality really irritates me.\n \n First, I show why the collective harm point isn't valid (Univerality warrent attack WAY BACK at the top). Then you get annoyed because I...deny the hive mind mentality of the Jewish people. Forgive me for not claiming that because Jews died in the holocause, I deserve benefits even though I wasn't involved. You don't provide a warrent for why there is a hive mind either. I suppose if you HAD a hive mind, it would be annoying to find out others didn't have it too. But alas, that is the world we live in.\n \n Wow that was long (over 22,000 characters!). Key points (Crystallization)\n 1) AA side provides no warrent for Universality of harms\n 2) AA side provides no warrent for Universality of perspective AND contradicts himself when he claims the benefits of differing black views.\n 3) My side has better, more precise solvency that has less people being ignored.\n 4) Mine is less racist/stereotypical because it focuses on individual conditions rather the guessing on what the condition of the group is and then cross-applying it to everyone in the group without individual verification. (going by probability w/out regard to possibilites screws people who go outside the mold)\n Cheers, and good luck!\n DSAdevil",

   "The whole Affirmative Action debate raises several important points even before we get to the 14A.\n \n 1) When inquired into, most AA advocates claim that 'diversity' is a compelling State interest, and that ethnic diversity is a compelling State interest because of the (insert minority here) experience. A thought: VERY tall people have a unique experience; they risk injury in public banging their heads into too-low doors, people stare and occasionally ridicule them. Ugly people are discriminated against in being stared at, being denied access to various forms of employment, being ridiculed, etc. So should we have AA quotas for tall people and the unattractive? Of course not.\n \n 2) The puropse of academic institutions is to advance the pursuit of truth, and to say that ethnic quotas advance this worthy goal is ludicrous. Consider: Would Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams agree on ANYTHING? If anything, AA should be based on ideology; Conservative, Socialist, Liberal, Libertarian, etc. quotas. Ideological diversity would advance the legitimate and worthy goal of true academic freedom. However, it would raise the same 14A issue that ethnic AA does, as well as a 1A freedom of expression issue.\n \n 3) US Supreme Court Justice Wm. O. Douglas (an FDR appointed liberal Democrat and on the majority opinion in most if not all civil rights cases from 1939-1975) raised this scenario in his autobiography:\n \n Minority A is admitted into LAw School A under a court order making ethnic quotas a remedy for a non-diverse student body. His scores would NOT have gotten him in under the old competitive system. He is tutored through the school, as in many cases graduation percentages are considered in remedies. He gets to his 1st firm and starts clerking. The partners discover our man can't prepare wills, or perform just about any legal function and is soon discharged. After floating between several firms, our man has a reputation for incompetence and winds up digging ditches. The firms are prejudiced against hiring future minorities as a result of the experience with our man. How does this in ANY way advance the status of minorities?\n \n 4) Our man is instead admitted to a med school under a similar remedy. He is pencil-whipped through med school, and the other residents cover for his inadequecies during his internship. He goes into general practice, misdiagnoses a case and is sued for malpractice as a result of a patient's accidental death under his care. As a result, he is removed from practice, it is more expensive to practice medicine as a result of higher claims on malpractice insurance, and health care costs more as a result of the higher cost of doing business. How do ANY of these advance the status of minorities?\n \n Then there is the issue of using race as a determining factor's violation of the 14A.",

It's not meant to fix the inequalities between classes. That's communism or socialism in essence and a very liberal view. Affirmative consideration meant to fix the hundred of years of millions being oppressed and discriminated against in this country that has caused the inequalities. The system is not made to account for poverty only. It is made to account for all the disadvantages as a whole. It has been my experience and I believe if you check the membership of the neo Nazis, Aryan nation, and other white supremacists that the lower class is usually the most racists because they have the least education. You are going to try to give them an advantage as well when historically they have been the most racists class and still are I believe. How can your system account for everyone when you tailor it on your perceived inequities? My cousins were raised in a fairly ghetto area in LA. I felt that they faced some serious issues and inequities. Also I was raised part of my life in a middle/upper class neighborhood and faced some inequities that were more subtle but I thought more detrimental. You see you can't account for everything when you tailor especially if you want to include possibilities. Anything is possible and to tailor it narrowly then how can you account for everything that is possible? If you account for what is probable then you will cover everyone and then some that don't. Our system of government is better some of the guilty go free than to punish the innocent. If you want to do something for economic inequities then create your own system. This is not intended to correct lack of progress for families that face fewer challenges than minorities in their same class. Those families had opportunities to them from the beginning that weren't available to minorities. Now you want to help them when they didn't take opportunity before? Affirmative consideration is about counteracting the problems given to us from the past nd face continue to face presently.\n \n \"I think the meaning was quite clear.

Care to hit the arguments, and not the semantics? Or are the big bad LD-esque arguments to tough?\"\n \n \n Your argument wasn't very clear especially because you meant one thing and said another. The logic of giving another reason to do something wrong isn't very good argument and isn't worth any consideration. Racism is wrong and there is no ways to justify it. We don't live our lives wondering what will make racists more racists. That lies within the individual. The fact that there are racist perceptions is wrong and using affirmative consideration to justify it is like using Israel's sovereignty or US military presence a justification to be attacked. There are no good reason and any reason a person comes up with is wrong. The fact is proven someone that has a racist perception will always find ways to justify their beliefs. If you feel we need to accommodate racists then you're in a new argument. Why don't we abolish welfare and all the other things that racists use to justify their racism? Affirmative action is made to combat racism. \"OK, sure in some cases, we have to make the racists upset. but we don't do it randomly, we do it for a purpose. The objective of AA (I assume) isn't to make more people racist,\" You admit racism exist but you leave nothing to combat it in its subtle forms. You mention the courts but that is so impractical because people are smart enough to discriminate without making it obvious such as Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond .Should we eliminate it and leave nothing to combat this inequity? Racism is so entrenched that we will not overcome it if we don't allow remedies meant to combat its effects and let the country be exposed to more minorities in the professional field. Exposure and ducation is the only way to combat racism. I was hitting the argument you just were using the wrong words. You said oen thing and meant another. Very confusing to know what you mean when you say something else.\n \n \"I don't say inequities are gone, just that since de jure inequities are gone, I'm solving for the de facto inequities that remain in a more precise manner AND in a manner that has a lower infringement on rights. Even the benefits you claim go my direction here.\"\n \n The argument is that de facto was cause by de jure. So shouldn't the benefits go the ones harmed? We are trying to compensate for the de jure affects. We are not trying to fix inequities of class. That is a socialistic and communistic attitude. We are trying to fix inequities caused by discrimination and other violation of rights. There is no infringement on rights here because you have a right to be accepted if you are the most qualified. The schools determine who the most qualified are including race. They feel only the top of each racial pool should be allowed inside the school and not the top test takers and GPA. Schools' consider things such as extracurricular activities, community service, life experiences, and demographics.\n \n \"First, I show why the collective harm point isn't valid (Univerality warrent attack WAY BACK at the top). Then you get annoyed because I...deny the hive mind mentality of the Jewish people.

You're comparing six years and six million people to four hundred years and 200 million people? The fact is the injustice was caught so quick that the German government could compensate those harms from the holocaust. The fact that the effects of the holocaust has been compensated and the German government has institutionalized reforms to protect Jews and compensate them. I know you felt outraged. However how would you feel if it happened in the US? Minorities don't ask to be compensated for apartheid in South Africa. They want to be compensated for the problems caused here in the US. Not somewhere else. They want things that are wrong in the US made right. Do you see anything the holocaust caused here in our country? Did you agree with the rationale that Israel should be created to protect Jews? Of course you agreed because you felt that Jews needed a land to protect them and their sovereignty. That has created a lot of problems in the middle east. Did you feel that the harms of the past to Jews warranted protection of future generations? Even those that weren't directly affected?",

   "\"1) AA side provides no warrent for Universality of harms\"\n \n universality of harms. The fact that there as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that, \"minorities have loss faith in our justice system.\" Minorities are convicted at a higher rate. Also minorities receive the death penalty at a higher rate than whites. Now is that a universality of harm? The justice system alone is prejudice? Also due to past injustices of the past there are not very many minority professionals. Studies have shown that people respond better and receive better service when they are serviced by someone of similar race. So the fact that minorities don't receive equal services is another harm. Also the effects of racism are very trivial sometimes. These trivial effects can mass up to be substantial. The fact is we need to make it less reactive and more proactive. It's always harder to cure than prevent.\n \n \"2) AA side provides no warrent for Universality of perspective AND contradicts himself when he claims the benefits of differing black views.\"\n \n Affirmative action isn't about universality of perspective. Affirmative action as a side benefit to give schools diversity. That racial diversity provides people a different perspective. That is why schools support the Affirmative consideration. Just because you don't believe in the need for racial diversity the fact that the Association of University Presidents, Majority of Universities, and the majority of Officers in the Military show that there is a bona fide benefit and necessity of racial diversity. Read all the Amicus Briefs supporting the University of Michigan. The briefs go into detail about what racial diversity brings. What you fail to show is how these benefits are not important. \n \n \"3) My side has better, more precise solvency that has less people being ignored.\"\n \n Your approach tries to solve class disparities and that is a very communistic, socialistic, and liberal view. It says it includes possibilities which is a an all inclusive because anything is possible. Probability is the true test for applying any program which bestows rights for those who qualify.\n \n \"4) Mine is less racist/stereotypical because it focuses on individual conditions rather the guessing on what the condition of the group is and then cross-applying it to everyone in the group without individual verification. (going by probability w/out regard to possibilites screws people who go outside the mold)\"\n \n Yours is less racial based because it doesn't deal with racial problems that Affirmative action addresses. It goes with assumption of class instead of race with which affirmative consideration addresses. Including everyone that goes outside the mold is much more inclusive and couldn't possibly be narrower than probabilities. I'm all for possibilities because it would include more people.\n \n \"(RE: my claim that AA marks up all blacks based on the assumption that they dont have family support, regardless of whether they do or don't)\n Here's the problem. It doesn't necessarily take into account family support, because the system still gives the same benefit to a black kid with family support as to one without, and the same lack of benefit to a white kid without family support as to one with. Basically, the question here is: If I see a black person, and assume \"He can't possibly have a college education,\" Is that a racist thought? Yes. Why is it any less racist for a college to make a same assumption about the parents of black kids, without even bothering to check for it? The harm here is especially sharp when you consider that here at least the harm almost ALWAYS applies to poor whites in the same way, b/c they don't the family support of a college educated parent either. Yet they don't get the benefits you claim are necessary.\"\n \n This isn't a big issue but the fact that the black kid's parents had to deal with so much more adversity to make it to were they are today than whites. Affirmative Consideration believes that the second generation can be compensated for the hardship that wasn't addressed by the system before. If the kid didn't suffer any detriments and his grades aren't suffering then it is a non-issue.\n \n \"OK, with regards to 1 and 3, those harms are solved via the TOEFL, which is a test for people for whom english is not the first language.The SAT is a test for people where english is the first language. For non-first languagers, there is an alternative.\n \n The TOEFEL is for foreign educated students. Students graduating high school here that aren't foreign exchange students are not included by the toefel. Also for Toefel many colleges either only allow toefel students to learn certain subjects or require that they take the SAT or form of the SAT. Also the language is still biased towards the \"white American\" mainstream. Colleges don't account for minorities that grow up as fluent in English as their second language. There is language that to many such as my family where we speak English growing up in the US but don't know all the common phrases, terminology, or phrases that commonly used among other English speaking countries. These phrases and terminology aren't so common that everyone knows them. \n \n \"For number 2, one the SAT doesn't favor guessing, that's why they take off a quarter point per wrong answer, it on average negates any benefits. It DOES help if you can narrow it down, but narrowing down answers is an area where the female \"nuanced thinking\" helps not harms. Finally, since only Verbal questions have \"nuances\" (math IS clear cut), the fact that females out perform males on the verbal section of the SAT is somewhat telling.\"\n \n The risk benefit is that if two people are 90% sure of the answer the male would more likely take the risk while the female will contemplate her option more. It benefits males more because overall we don't continually think about the past risks taken as for a woman might contemplate more and want to revisit the question. It does benefit to risk because as a man might take a chance when he's 75% of the time, a women may not because it goes against their nature. Many of the subject matter such as science and math are clear there are few \"nuances\" in comparison.\n \n \"Apology accepted (But what's wrong with the CIR?). As to my research, my high school taught me to examine the research as a whole, and that includes checking to see whether the results actually lead to the conclusion. My attack on the studies is that they jump to conclusions because it can be as easily, in fact more easily explained via socio-economic reasons as racial ones. That was my attack, you ignore it and instead accuse me (incorrectly) of doing no research. Smooth.\"\n \n Are you kidding what is wrong with center of individual rights? They are the most ultraconservative group. I'm a conservative maybe more moderate than most and the Center of Individual rights goes too far sometimes. Also the studies of the economic issues don't address the issues raised by other studies. It also jumps to conclusions that if you're poor and do poorly that it means poor people do worse. It never asks the question if you do poorly then does that make you poor? Does not doing well on standardized test mean less chance for success in life and leading to perpetual problems. Also did you know the SAT is officially called the SAT and not an acronym for \"Standardized Aptitude Testing\". Funny they did this about the time they started selling help material for the test.\n \n \"In the meantime, yes, I was making a point on the individualiness of perspective b/c you seem to not account for it, instead having this racial hive mind (Blacks = Borgs). Why is it affected by perspectives collectively? You don't warrent. Critical mass is about having enough differing perspectives to have a real debate on campus, but I already show how race doesn't necessarily give you this b/c a black kid could and often does have the perspective on the issues as a white kid of the middle class. The point that we need alot of minorities to break down stereotypes is contradictory, because you say we need minorities b/c they provide a unique collective viewpoint independent of whites even of the same social class BUT THEN say we need alot so that they don't have the same view. Either we want this unique view (which I maintain, and my analysis on the matter hasn't really been challenged, doesn't exist) OR we want alot b/c it breaks down stereotypes. Which is it?\"\n \n Collectiveness v individuality. It's like seeing the forest and the trees. The trees have many similar characteristics but not all trees are the same and each tree is unique. Seeing enough trees you see some similar characteristics and differences. People and personalities are similar but at wider spectrum. If there were 100 characteristic and people from a race were to pick 50 then each person wouldn't always pcik the same 50. Some would share 50, 48, 49, 30, and so on with the group. The fact is you'll see patterns collectively and then see unique individuality. It will help you see the tree from the forest and the forest from the tree. My cousins and I have many common view points but many different and for different reasons. I think a big part of it was regional and demographics. That is why its so important to have so many so you can see us collectively and individually.\n \n \"I'm stereotyping because....I'm looking to the individual perspective of the person and not cross-applying the expected perspective to every black person I meet? You must have weird definition of stereotype.\"\n \n Yes you're stereotyping when you say you find more in common with someone that is black and the same class then someone that is white and different class. How can you say you find more in common with \"black in your same class\" unless you stereotyped them as being a certain way, right?",

How can you say you find more in common with \"black in your same class\" unless you stereotyped them as being a certain way, right?\n \n \"Again, look back to my analysis on the last point on why you are contradicting yourself, claiming both collective perspective and individual perspective. Oh, and you have no warrent as to why you just assume I know few black people. My \"stereotype\" if you will, is based on my refusal to put a blanket label on an entire race of people. You, by espousing your \"collective perspective\" idea (which you convienantly start disavowing when you start claiming benefits from unique perspectives within the race) stereotype to a far worse degree than i do.\"\n \n Read the above analysis about collectiveness and individuality. It's seeing the forest and the trees. We protect the forest because it has unique qualities. Also we protect the forest by protecting individual trees and the uniqueness of each tree. We do not assume every tree is the same.\n \n \" \"our\" point? Is this the infamous collective mind speaking? As to this point, you can't claim to solve for de facto unequal treatment by creating a system of de jure unequal treatment. The means aren't just here. Since I create a narrower way of remedying the harms you claim from the preferential systems of 30 years ago WITHOUT violating the rights of people TODAY, I both help to eliminate the De facto racism w/out throwing in De Jure discrimination. I'm not claiming that de facto inequities are gone, I'm saying that because we can solve them without creating NEW inequities in the current system, then we should work in that direction.\"\n \n It's not de jure unequeal treatment. If you're top of your class this doesn't affect you. If you're bottom of the class it doesn't affect you. So how is it de jure? If you fail to be the top then you have by your own merits have put yourself in a pool that you might face that. Not every person will not be \"affected\" from affirmative consideration. De jure would affect everyone but in reality it only affects less than 5% of total applicants. In most cases it only affects maybe 1.5% of all applicants. There is no inequity in this system because in actuality they are compensating 25% of minority applicants which affects less than 5% of total applicants. Most people that get rejected assume that they were next in line but the truth was that they were not. Even if a minority with lesser \"scores\" was accepted there are many people that are accepted based on alumni parents, community service, awards, and other things people consider \"special\". So the fact that I don't have alumni parents subjects me to as much discrimination as any other parent not being a minority.\n \n \"Amazing. That's your major flaw in a nutshell. Probabilities, not possibilities. Incredible. Probabilities deals with is likely to happen, possibilities forces us to take into account all scenarios and thus provides for a more exacting standard than probability.\"\n \n Amazing that's you major flaw taking into account possibilities. You talk about possibilities and yet more narrow. If anything is possible then how can you tailor it more narrowly?\n \n \"By the way, incidentally I just finished debating LD at CFL nationals (I got to quarters! ). Sorry if you can't handle the style\"\n \n Congratulations! I went to nationals in Congress. \n \n \"De facto might not of, but to solve that we have to hit the source, and that means stopping racist perceptions and at the same minimizing that harms it provides, WHEN THE HARMS manifest themselves. Basically, you provide alot of examples of where racism exists, but you still don't warrent how you extend across the board.\"\n \n The fact that de facto exists is exactly why we need affirmative consideration. As Justice Clarence Thomas put it, \" We need to work twice as hard as whites to get half as far.\" Since there are so many cases of de facto discrimination we want affirmative consideration to help balance the field. My examples were to show you it happens in government and in the private sector. It happens at the entry level and executive level. It happens everywhere. We want affirmative consideration to help out by compensating in areas knowing that the reverse is happening somewhere else. Thus balancing the playing field. How do we stop from making racist perceptions? Do we do it by just removing anything that people might consider racists? If we remove Affirmative consideration then we will perpetuate racism for minorities. Minorities will believe that they are forced to accept inequities. Do you account for that in your plan? Do you account for the fact that whichever plan you implement racists will be racist whether it be white or minority. Racism lies within the individual. What we need to account for are not the perceptions but the harms produced.\n \n \"Basically, you provide alot of examples of where racism exists, but you still don't warrent how you extend across the board. EG, the fact that Mississippi or Texaco is racist doesn't by definition mean that Maryland or California or Safeway or Microsoft is. So right there you are making a huge logical leap, and NO WHERE HAVE YOU TOLD ME WHY YOU CAN.\"\n \n The fact is that there will always be people and companies that are racists. As I've explained before some areas there is racism. Others areas there is not. So to compensate for the areas that there are racism you implement programs such as affirmative consideration leveling out the playing field. We can do this as the Supreme Court held in Bakke is that it achieves equality for compensating for inequities caused by discrimination. \n \n \"I've asked again and again for the warrent for claiming racism across the board and you never give it, all you do is give examples. But I can solve for those w/out AA via anti-discrimination statutes, and the point I made that by showing bona fide discrimination, you should still get \"points.\" my distinction is that the harms shouldn't be assumed by default\"\n \n The fact is that minorities are never guaranteed to be treated fairly by corporate America is definitely a harm. There is no way of knowing where the harm exists. It's kind of like cancer. We all know it exists but until it's discovered by check ups or because of proactive health care there is no way of knowing until later stages. Racism is a cancer that tries to exist undetected. There are not many ways to actually discover that there is racism. We know that the court systems treats minorities unfairly overall. We know that the quality of health care received by minorities is less overall. We know that there is profiling done by private industry and government agencies. The fact that it happens means that minorities are not assured equality in America. Do yu consider that a harm? What extent does it have to manifest that it's a harm?\n \n \"we need to account for the POSSIBILTY that not all blacks are being harmed by racism even if the probability dictates otherwise\"\n \n we need to account for the POSSIBILTY that all blacks are being harmed by racism even if the probability dictates otherwise\n \n \"Finally, you talk alot about innercities, but what about the white kids who live in them? Where is the solvency under AA for the harms being given to them?\" \n \n Affirmative consideration isn't about class inequities. It's about inequities caused by hundreds of years of oppression. It's to compensate for oppression not poverty. It only accounts for poverty caused by the severe injustices of the past. The plan you propose solves class inequities and is very socialistic and communistic. If you want to solve that problem you will be perpetrating socialism or communism.\n \n \"You say it is impractical for all times of discrimination to be proven, but that is exactly was has to be done in a criminal justice system. Our system is accusatorial, not inquistorial. To achieve remedy from a harm, you have to prove you are actually being harmed, you can't just ask the system to assume a harm exists.\"\n \n So according to you we should just react instead of prevent racism. I think I've made it clear by now the harms done to minorities with the justice system, private sector, government discrimination, and the fact that we don't receive equal treatment in the health care and other professional industries because of past injustices.\n \n \"Subsidized housing isn't the only way to raise property vaues, you know it. We can just increase the services to their and make it a more desirable place to live.\"\n \n You can't offer more services to one person over another that isn't constitutionally mandated. If they offered those services to poor neighborhoods then they have to do it universally.\n \n \"This is our solution and unfortunately it ISN'T mandated (San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez). That should and needs to happen, and that's the avenue we should take.\"\n \n Actually because it hasn't been overturned completely the case has received negative treatment and someone needs to bring suit again to change that law. Just as recently as 1997 there have been cases requiring equality in school's. U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 14 and Brigham v State. Even though there hasn't been a formal overturn because of other reasons that case would not hold up if it was challenged again. It is considered old law. Currently all children are suppose to receive the same treatment in education.",

   "\"Yes. I do believe that. I believe that two poor kids have the same problem regardless of there race. You ASSUME otherwise without providing a warrent. I don't make an assumption, I warrent the claim by saying that the harms that occur to poor kids that are white (lack of access to schools, poor standard of living, no oppurtunity) are the same to those of black kids. You're assuming that there is some intangible difference without telling us what it is. That's far greater an assumption than anything I do.\"\n \n Sorry to inform you that I didn't assume anything. I've lived in areas of both and the difference is very apparent between rural poor areas and urban poor areas. There are so many more subsidies that are given to farmers and people from those areas. Also the education there is subsidized much more. All because of farming programs. Also the rural areas are not subjected to the crime, drugs, diseases, and racism that confront urban areas. Rural areas even has their school schedule vacation specifically for allowing children to help their families with the harvests. Urban schools don't allow children to stay home when ther is no childcare to allow their parents to go to work. They don't offer variety of school schedules to allow children to help care for their siblings while their parents go to work. Urban areas have to justify every need they need as opposed to rural areas that legislatures have to justify reason why they don't extend services to rural areas. There is a definite disparity between the two areas.\n \n \n WJM you really need to think before you ask these questions.\n \n \"You have posted both of these statements regarding Michigan's admissions process:\n quote: \n \n If the inequities are not addressed then you're putting them into an unfair advantage effectively discriminating them. \n \n \n quote: \n \n Also Michigan's addmission process doesn't discriminate that is why the courts should leave it alone. \n \n \n \n These two posts contradict each other.\"\n Thanks for taking my quotes out of context. WJM asked me \" How does the Michigan's admission process discriminate\". That was what my second quote regarded. Then later asked \"How would the Michigan admission process discriminate\" I responded with the first quote. Think again before asking the question and trying to make it contradictory. It's not contradictory if you see that I responded to two different questions. \n \"So you think people who had better grades should not be admitted because someone MIGHT have experienced some sort of discrimination, regardless of whether or not it affected their grades, test scores, etc. That is unfair..\"\n \n Yes the fact that it's unfair affirmative consideration would balance the inequities. The fact that it does or doesn't isn't the issue the fact that it happens should be addressed. We don't ask for more, we ask for equal. \n \n \"If someone experienced enough discrimiation to where it affected them, it would be easy to prove.\" \n \n Just the fact that the minorities are treated unequally is enough to show discrimination. We can't prove that we are treated but statistically when minorities with the same variables are always convicted of crimes more, given longer sentences, and receive less quality services than non-minorities. Don't you think that affect someone's ability or do you think it affects someone's opportunities? We persevere despite our challenges not because of them.",

   "John Calhoun\n \n \"1) When inquired into, most AA advocates claim that 'diversity' is a compelling State interest, and that ethnic diversity is a compelling State interest because of the (insert minority here) experience. A thought: VERY tall people have a unique experience; they risk injury in public banging their heads into too-low doors, people stare and occasionally ridicule them. Ugly people are discriminated against in being stared at, being denied access to various forms of employment, being ridiculed, etc. So should we have AA quotas for tall people and the unattractive? Of course not.\"\n \n John before posting read up alright on the debate. Don't come and post on a threads about your misconception that have already been discussed. Affirmative consideration is an attempt to deal with injustices of the past that were perpetrated through the government. The severity and harms caused by racial discrimination aren't even comparable to wht ugly and tall people face. Believe me I'm tall and ugly. I've been discriminated more because of race than anything else.\n \n \"2) The puropse of academic institutions is to advance the pursuit of truth, and to say that ethnic quotas advance this worthy goal is ludicrous. Consider: Would Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams agree on ANYTHING? If anything, AA should be based on ideology; Conservative, Socialist, Liberal, Libertarian, etc. quotas. Ideological diversity would advance the legitimate and worthy goal of true academic freedom. However, it would raise the same 14A issue that ethnic AA does, as well as a 1A freedom of expression issue.\"\n \n The truth huh? What is the truth? That unjust enrichment should be ignored? That compensation for government's action isn't necessary? The truth is that there are many inequities that have need to be addressed. Affirmative consideration addresses these issues. It's not a perfect system but it's better than no system.\n \n \"Minority A is admitted into LAw School A under a court order making ethnic quotas a remedy for a non-diverse student body. His scores would NOT have gotten him in under the old competitive system. He is tutored through the school, as in many cases graduation percentages are considered in remedies. He gets to his 1st firm and starts clerking. The partners discover our man can't prepare wills, or perform just about any legal function and is soon discharged. After floating between several firms, our man has a reputation for incompetence and winds up digging ditches. The firms are prejudiced against hiring future minorities as a result of the experience with our man. How does this in ANY way advance the status of minorities?\"\n \n That is the most ignorant thing I've ever heard. Affirmative consideration doesn't mean that those admitted aren't qualified. It compensates for minorities inequities. If someone is tutored and they pass the bar then they are qualified. Wills and trust are on the bar. If they pass the bar they know as much as they need to do wills. Saying someone that is admitted because of affirmative consideration is not as intelligent or graduates without doing the work himself is racists and ignorant. Affirmative consideration gets minorities in the door, we do the rest. The fact that you post such an insinuating commentary is very offensive. Research about what affirmative consideration is and not what it isn't.\n \n Women score lower overall on standardized tests. Yet they graduate twice as many women than men annually. The admission process denies more women than men. Yet women out perform males. Admission doesn't qualify you for anything more than an opportunity. People control their fate within the school. Admission fails to predict they're potential. Saying someone's qualification at time of admission determines their potential is ignorant and not supported by facts.\n \n \"4) Our man is instead admitted to a med school under a similar remedy. He is pencil-whipped through med school, and the other residents cover for his inadequecies during his internship. He goes into general practice, misdiagnoses a case and is sued for malpractice as a result of a patient's accidental death under his care. As a result, he is removed from practice, it is more expensive to practice medicine as a result of higher claims on malpractice insurance, and health care costs more as a result of the higher cost of doing business. How do ANY of these advance the status of minorities?\n \n Then there is the issue of using race as a determining factor's violation of the 14A.\"\n \n First off that these would never happen and are as likely to happen to a minoritiy as anyone else. People like you that believe that a minority admitted because of affirmative consideration is less qualified than those admitted because of alumni parents, community service, donations to the university, etc is totally racist and shows your ignorance. If you can't understand that logic then we really have nothing to discuss.\n \n \"Affirmative Action is official racial discrimination against Whites\"\n \n If affirmative consideration really discriminates whites then why are less than 5% of applicants affected? This isn't about whites it's about borderline students.\n \n \"Here's another statistic for you:\n \n 4 year graduation rate for minorities admitted due to AA: about 5%\n 4 year graduation rate for minorities admitted becuase of academic qualifications: 34%\n \n Source: University of California-Berkely.\" \n \n I couldn't find the source of these facts can you post the link.",

   "Hmmm...I'm not taking your quotes out of context. You changed what I said to make it appear as if I did. Here's a summary of what was said vs. how you claimed it was said in your previous post.\n \n Me: \"Also, if you could explain how the University of Michigan could discriminate against minorities in their admissions process, please let me know.\" (You stated that I said: \"How would the Michigan admission process discriminate.\")\n \n You: \"Also Michigan's addmission process doesn't discriminate that is why the courts should leave it alone.\"\n \n Me: \"If Michigan's admissions system doesn't discriminate, then why do we have affirmative action in place there?\" (You stated that I said: \"How does the Michigan's admission process discriminate\")\n \n You: \"If the inequities are not addressed then you're putting them into an unfair advantage effectively discriminating them.\"\n \n How am I taking these quotes out of context? I asked you how the Michigan admissions process could discriminate against minorities, and you said that it doesn't. I then asked why Michigan's admissions process includes AA, and you said it was to address the inequities. If there's inequities that are being addressed by AA, then the system must discriminate against minorities, which you said doesn't occur.\n \n However, regardless of what was said, the fact of the matter is that the UM system only discriminates against whites. It is a MATHEMATICAL system. For racism to play a part in the system it would have to be put in there by some human means. The facts are: IT CAN'T! The UM system takes GPA, test scores, class rank, etc. and puts them into a computer, which then assigns each a point value. The computer doesn't care whether your black, white, hispanic, etc. Oh wait, it does, because if you're a minority, it adds you 1 2/3 times the value of a perfect SAT score onto your score and gives you a 20% head start towards being admitted.\n \n \nIf affirmative consideration really discriminates whites then why are less than 5% of applicants affected? This isn't about whites it's about borderline students.\n\n \n What if you were in that 5%. What if you would otherwise have gotten in to the school of your choice but were told that because of your race, you were going to be denied admissions. Would you be outraged? I think so.\n \n I found those stats in a book. I'll look for them online. If I can't find them, I'll go find the book and give you the information you need to find it.\n \n Social injustice must be countered with justice, not preference. Inequality should be offset with fair and consistent standards. AA does not provide those standards. It works on the incorrect assumption that ALL whites have an advantage that ALL minorities do not have. This not only unfair to whites who would otherwise have gotten the job, admitted, but it is also unfair to those whites that are below most minorities, and those minorities who are above most whites.\n \n AA only rigs the rules in order to achieve the desired results.",

I am the most outspoken Conservative and Southern partisan I have ever run across in ANY college course taken at either of the two colleges I have attended, and have recieved lower grades than I thought were legitimate on a number of occasions? Yet I have never cried discrimination, and believe you me there is plenty of anti-South and anti-Conservative discrimination. I did not recieve A's in the various courses I took because I did not master the material to a sufficient degre to MERIT an A for the course.\n \n \n \n \nThe truth huh? What is the truth?\n\n \n That is just what we are trying to arrive at, and my AA suggestion would go a LONG way toward eliminating intellectual fascism from the collegiate environment.\n \n \nIt's not a perfect system but it's better than no system.\n\n \n Let's see, a list of Negroes that achieved high position without AA 'assistance': \n \n Justices Thurogood (sp?)

Douglas said that back in the late 70s, I only cited him.\n \n \n Affirmative consideration doesn't mean that those admitted aren't qualified. \n\n \n Then, sir, what exactly DOES it mean? If they were academically qualified, they would have recieved admission to the institution in question.\n \n \nIt compensates for minorities inequities.\n\n \n Ah, HERE we go.... This is the crux of ther AA 'arguement'; (insert minority here) have been discriminated against so much in the past, and it's our duty as morally superior liberals to right all wrongs. This insistance on dredging up wrongs in the past is nothing new in American polity. The Republicans did it just after the close of the Late Unpleasantness and called it \"waving the bloody shirt\".

   "\"How do you construe inflicting more injustice to be a legitimate remedy for past injustice?\"\n \n How is it injustice? Students affected by affirmative consideration are borderline students. Tehy ahve no right to admission. They are in a pool which the students are all compared and considered among a criteria that is expanded to help the University have the best student body. The University looks at the students to see if the student will be best for the Univeristy not the other way around. It's only an injustice because you see it that way and is affected by your perspective. It's like saying the American government was wrong in compensating Japanese American for being interned during world war II. I mean it took tax payer dollars to fix an injustice. I didn't elect those officials that encated those laws that deprived those Japanese. Why should I be forced to pay for those mistakes? You know why? Becasue it's not about me. It's about Japanese and the compensation that they are due. If you ask me the $20,000 fifty years later is not even cloe to compensation.\n \n \"Anecdotal evidence. I am the most outspoken Conservative and Southern partisan I have ever run across in ANY college course taken at either of the two colleges I have attended, and have recieved lower grades than I thought were legitimate on a number of occasions? Yet I have never cried discrimination, and believe you me there is plenty of anti-South and anti-Conservative discrimination. I did not recieve A's in the various courses I took because I did not master the material to a sufficient degre to MERIT an A for the course.\"\n \n \n There is your problem. First you assume that you know what type of discrimination I face. Also you did not face discrimination becasue you admitted you weren't discriminated. Also don't ever try to compare racial discrimination with any other possible discrmination. Throughout history racial discrimination has been the worse. Look at Germany even people, even Germans who were faithful Nazi supporters that were found to posses as little as 1/8 Jewish ancestry were murdered. The fact is many people like you who aren't a minority always try to say that discrimination doesn't exist because they don't see it. Unfortunately they didn't see the discrminatory practices of Texaco or NJ State police chief either. The fact that you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Your perception of our lives doesn't constitute reality. Even Clarence Thomas who is against affirmative consideration said, \" We as Blacks have to work twice as hard as whites to get half as far.\" That is the reality of it, we work twice as hard to get what we get. Racism was entrenched in our society for hundreds of years, do you really think 30 yrs has eliminated that mentality?\n \n \"That is just what we are trying to arrive at, and my AA suggestion would go a LONG way toward eliminating intellectual fascism from the collegiate environment.\"\n \n RE: What is the truth\n \n The truth is that minorites have suffered for hundreds of years and still continue to suffer in this country and these injustices have disadvantage minorities collectively and directly giving whites an advanteage. The fact that schools want to compensate and help change that upsets many \"non-minorites\" because they feel that their advantage would be eliminated. That any reason that maay indirectly put a FEW at a disadvantage in favor of MINORITIES upsets so many such as conservatives like yourself. Yet none of them want to comment on the injustice of UNJUST ENRICHMENT.\n \n \"Let's see, a list of Negroes that achieved high position without AA 'assistance': \n \n Justices Thurogood (sp?) Marshall and Clarence Thomas\n Colin POwell, 1st Negro Chair of the JCS, and 1st Negro Secretary of State\n Condoleeza Rice, 1st Negro NSA\n The Tuskegee Airmen\n Gov. Thornton Wilder of VA\n Chappie Harris (USAF general)\n J. C. Watts\"\n \n What an argument! The fact that some did it at twice the price that they should have done means that everyone should be forced to do it despite how unfair it is. Condoleeza Rice says that here success is directly from Affirmative consideration. You didn't research that one did you. Also Colin Powell is a strong advocate for Affirmative consideration. Clarence Thomas mentions how much harder he had to work to get where he is today. That he persevered DESPITE the inequites not BECAUSE of them.\n \n Also if you about the life of the Tuskegee Airmen you'll read how bad their life was after their service. They also mention that there were many more qualified that were denied becasue there were \"too many of 'em\".\n \n JC Watts doesn't suport such a strong approach to affirmative consideration but JC Watts does support affirmative consideration. He disagrees with the Republican party in that respect and is quoted in his book,\"Affirmative action,\" he writes, \"is a little like the professional football draft. The NFL awards its No. 1 draft choices to the lowest-ranked team in the league. It doesn't do this out of compassion or guilt. It's done for mutual survival. They understand that a league can only be as strong as its weakest team.\" He later goes on to write,\"We want to make the Cincinnati Bengals a resource as opposed to a drain on resources.\" I think that's the same theory that I apply in everyday life in trying to help the underserved community, all that I've done there. That's the purpose, to say let's make people a resource as opposed to being a drain on resources.\"\n \n JC Watts has fought against abolsihsing affirmative action programs he had teamed up with Democrats to do this. He even mentions that he was disheartened by the Republicans tough stance against it.\n \n Thurgood Marshall voted with the majority in Bakke v California. He believed so0 strongly tha affirmative consideration didn't go far enough. He also mentiioned about the hardships he faced that would have been avoided if programs like affirmative consideration existed. \n \n Chappie Harris dies before he could what affirmative consideration has done and would do for this country. Considering he was part of the Tuskgee air men he probably feel that affirmative considertation would be better.\n \n I don't know anything about Gove Thornton.\n \n The fact is that you point out the exceptions and not the norm. They all made it despit teh problems. Plus you also mention many from the military. The military uses affirmative consideration. The military submitted amicus briefs in support of University of Michigan. Even Colin Powell says that he was discriminated in the militayr until after the desegration of the military. he also say he was already qualified but his record was re-examined because of affirmative consideration.\n \n \"Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas said that back in the late 70s, I only cited him.\"\n \n Just because a Supreme Court justice makes a comment doesn't mean that its true or fact. The statement was made based on myth about what he preceived affirmtive consideration does and not based on reality. Affirmative consdieration does not do what you and him mentioned in the book.\n \n \"Then, sir, what exactly DOES it mean? If they were academically qualified, they would have recieved admission to the institution in question.\"\n \n The fact that you didn't read any of the previous posts means that I'll have to repeat arguments. Read the previous posts before I re-argue what has already been argued. The fact that standardized tests, inequities of education, continual inequties of standard of living, and cultural insensitivity has led to hurdles in education for minorities\n \n Affirmative consideration takes into account race just as a criteria like alumni relations, extra curricualr activities, donations, community service, etc. Those factor are all socio-economic related and affirmitive consideration helps to balance those inequities. The account for factors helping to balance the inequities that has been caused by injustices of \"non-minorites\".\n \n If those inequties were eliminated then those minorites undoubtedly would have perfomred better. They feel the GPA and standardized testing were poor indicators of ability. So that is why they are intelligent enough to be admitted because despite the inequities they still were competitive.\n \n Also the university only accepts people they feel are qualified and will be competent enough to compete.\n \n \"This is the crux of ther AA 'arguement'; (insert minority here) have been discriminated against so much in the past, and it's our duty as morally superior liberals to right all wrongs. This insistance on dredging up wrongs in the past is nothing new in American polity. The Republicans did it just after the close of the Late Unpleasantness and called it \"waving the bloody shirt\". It would be accompanied with such fool idiocy as slogans like \"Vote like you shot.\"\"\n \n Yeah exactly. you do a wrong fix it! Dreding up the past? Oh sorry I should jsut not pay my bills and say hey don't dredge up the past. If I kill, enslave, murder, rape, and torture people and the government wants to take action agisnt me I'll say don't dredge up the past. It's all in past just let it go. Just because it's in the past doesn't mean it isn't relevant to today. Don't expect people to just accept it. Do something about what you did. Fix the wrongs that are still present today. Don't tell us to accept injustices and move on when you feel afirmative consideration is injust and don't want to accept it. If you feel that is affirmative consideration is injust and don't want to accept it then don't expect anyone else to accept objective injustices.\n \n \"Wel, if their work does not pass muster at the firm, SOMETHING had to happen somewhere...\"\n \n What does that mean? I made the comment saying if you pass the bar you've proven your competency. Them hiring someone that doesn't know what he's doign couldn't possibly have passed the bar.\n \n .",

   "ok, mani'ia, first let me say its been a pleasure debating with you. I actually am more of a congressman than an LDer (i went to NFL's in congress last year, and placed at some national tournaments this year too), and its always nice to meet another.\n I'll just sum up the arguements, because at this point a line-by-line would be ridiculous.\n 1) probability/possibilty. You can never PROVE that no blacks are being discriminated against. Nor could you prove that no whites are. You can't logically prove a negative. So your burden of having AA until we prove that it is impossible for any minority to be discriminated against is illegitimate and abusive. What, it seems to me, you want to do is say \"OK, there is a 64% chance (i made the figure up) that a minority is being discriminated. That's above average, so it is probable that this minority is being discriminated against.\" my standard would ask \"is this minority being discriminated against?\" after all, the amount of average discrimination on my race might factor into the the odds of me being discriminated against, but it doesn't prove discrimination by itself. I account for the possibilty that anyone is being discriminated against. I just dont assume it, I examine it on a case-by-case basis. Don't make it a universal assumption which moves us to...\n 2) universality. You still havent provided a warrent for universality, instead, you just say its irrelevant because we need to account for the possibilty that all blacks are being discriminated against. But my system does that, by examining it on a case-by-case basis. If they are all being discriminated against, every case will come up positive. So mine accounts for that. But for you to skip the phase where we check whether they have, in fact, been discriminated would be to make an assumption to that effect. Why do we need not account for the possibilty that a white man is discriminated against? answer: because probably he hasn't. But that doesn't tell me why we shouldn't ascertain it. How do you account for the possibilty that he has?\n 3) What's more precise? simply because mine checks people's situation on a case-by-case basis, I am more precise, because I weed out people who have no legitimate claims. That may be 10% of all minorities. According to you its 0% of all minorities. But regardless of whether it is 0%, 10%, or 85%, my system provides solvency, by making sure the people with the harms get the solution.\n 4) What about the other people who get screwed? You attack my comparison to Jews by saying that it was only 6 million people and 6 years. First of all, get your facts straight, it was 1933-1945, well more than 6 million (that's just the death toll), and if you think Jews have never been discriminated outside of that 12 year period, you're delusional. Anti-semitism is the world's oldest sport. And its been going on for at least a millenia before the slave trade even started (exodus anyone?). But that's a digression. My core argument refers to the white kid who is poor. You assert that its a different issue, because problems in rural areas are different than in urban ones. Fair enough, perhaps thats true. But that doesn't address the point. What about the white kid who lives in the innercity, who comes from a poor family, who faces all the same problems as anyone else in the innercity (including racism, a white kid at a majority black school will be in the same situation as a black kid at a majority white school)? My system solves for this. Your's lends him the screw.\n 5) Purpose of AA. You say its purpose is to correct past injustices. Well, I'm not quite sure what you mean by correct, so I'll address the two interpretations I can think of.\n a) to solve for the harms caused by past racism. Great. But how do we do that? we cant change history, we can only deal with the manifestation of past racism as it appears today IE, we deal with the effects. That's what my system does, it deals with the effects, when and where they appear. And if those effects happen to also occur in a white family too, irrespective of the source, I say you solve for them too. The historical injustice is bad, but we can't change history. We can solve for the effects of history because those effects are bad. But if those same effects manifest themselves in another group, regardless of the source, equal protection would dictate we provide solvency for that group too.\n b) to eliminate racism today. I already show you why AA doesn't do that, in fact it hinders it. You dont contest the point, but merely say that we cant worry about what racists think all the time. Then you say, and I find this interesting, that racism can be found most frequently in the lower and working classes. I'd guess you are right, but you refuse to implement your own solution, IE, getting them an education, giving them the oppurtunity to not be poor. At this point, you again, make MORE people racist, while refusing to solve the actual problem of lack of oppurtunity.\n 6) How much of an impact does AA really have? You claim that the harms to whites, if they exist, are justified because it only occurs to a small minority of them (5% of them I believe is your figure). Casting aside the irony of claiming that its ok to harm minorities because it achieves some (in this case ambigious) social good (you could make that case for slavery), i would contend again that \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Collectivist arguementation denies the importance of the individual. Groups, classes, and races don't have rights, individuals have rights. Those rights are inviolable, no matter how few of them it effects. You lead down a slippery slope with your arguement here, one that would end up harming minority rights more than it helps.\n 7) Liberalism of my arguement? You bet, im proudly liberal. Im also proudly libertarian (socially anyway, I more of an interventionist economically). Sure its a liberal arguement. But that's because liberals believe (or theoretically believe) in the importance of individuals, not evaluating people based on what race they belong to or what religion they abide by, but based on their personal life and how they live it. Does capitalism have problems, problems that screw certain members of society? Yes. And while I am committed to a free market economy, I do believe in a synthesis of socialist intervention and capitalist free markets. Im not ashamed of that.",

But since race has nothing to do with who is better qualified, then race should not be a determining factor in admissions.\n\n \n But race could have something to do with who is better qualified. We live in a very segregated society. Growing up in an inner city \"ghetto\" is very different from growing up in an affluent suburb. You are much less likely to realize your full potential. The college applicant pool is everything but a level playing field.\n \n The college should want the students with the best potential - the smartest, most socially adept, most likely to succeed. If you compare two applicants with similar socio-economic backgrounds, past achievement is very predictive of future success. But if you compare people from radically different backgrounds, that is not so. In all likelihood, a ghetto kid with an SAT score of 1080 is smarter than a middle-class kid with 1120. This fact ought to be taken into consideration, and if it is, then we have Affirmative Action. And due to segregation, race will be the most prominent factor in AA considerations.\n \n Now how exactly to implement this is a very complex issue. There are better and worse policies. Don't forget that the question whether a policy is good is very different from the question whether it is constitutionally permitted.\n \n I think the Michigan UG policy was bad, but I would have upheld it as constitutional. This is why: the only reason it was bad was that it put excessive weight on the AA factor. 20 points (out of maximum 150) and its effects on selection results are, in my view, way too much. But that is a subjective, political view. I would vote against such a policy, but would vote for an otherwise identical policy that gives the AA factor a weight of, say, 5 points. But after the Gratz opinion, even 1 point is not allowed. However, based on the Grutter opinion, even the 20-point policy would be perfectly constitutional if you never actually quantified your preferences. This makes no sense.\n \n One final, but very important, point: I have been referring to the \"AA factor\" rather than \"race\" because in the Michigan case it was, very clearly, not just a matter of race. Most notably, a white student from a high school in which the majority of students are \"underrepresented minorities\" (blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans) was treated the same as members of those minorities. So a white kid from the ghetto got the same 20 points as his black classmate. This, in my view, made the policy fair in principle, with just the numerical value to optimize.",

   "I understand the difference between what is the best policy and what is a legal policy. However, shouldn't we strive for the best policy? Why should we settle for a worse policy when we have a better option available?\n\n \n Of course \"we\" should strive for the best policy. But keep this in mind:\n \n 1. Best policy is a political question, a matter of opinion and compromise. There is no objective way to compare two policies and uniquely decide which is better. On the other hand, while experts may disagree whether a particular policy is legal/constitutional, there is a limited number of principles and methods that are accepted for such evaluation. This means it is at least a partially objective measure. Also, the consequences are very different. Whoever controls the legislature can enact a policy no matter how bad you or I think it is, but no one may enact an illegal policy.\n \n 2. This discussion is obviously about the legality of AA, as almost all criticism directed at it is criticism in principle, not dependent on a particular case. I think I was the only participant in the discussion who brought up issues of bad, but legal, policy.\n \n 3. The \"we\" is different in the two questions. Legislature decides on what is the best policy, courts on what is legal.\n \n \nThe problem is, your situation could apply to either a white student or to a minority student. In this case, leaving racial AA will cause the minority to benefit but leave the white student out.\n\n \n That is a good point which might raise equal protection issues if there were no factors that work in the opposite direction. But there are: for example, the black student will face obstacles after the move, like being a minority in the new neighborhood and school, that the white student will not. So you are not comparing apples to apples, and the legal challenge seems weak.\n \n As a matter of policy, I do believe that the student's whole history should count, not just where he graduated. (And I really don't know how much actually counted in UMich admissions.) But I also claim that of the 4 combinations of white/black students in majority white/black schools, the only one that is not a disadvantage in any way is white/white. And regarding incentives, I don't think that ghetto whites need any to move out of the ghetto, so again the described policy is sound.\n \n \nI would have to guess Iowa solely because your example would be useless if I said DC. However, I never said that we should look at the money that schools spent on a student (because that can be wasted, as is probably the case in the above example), I stated that we should look at the average income of a family from the school district.\n\n \n That doesn't change a thing. Schools are financed mainly from local taxes, which depend mainly on property values, which in turn depend mainly on income. By all measures, the average income in DC is higher than in Iowa. See the Statistical Abstract of the US (1999 data) - median household income is $40,127 (DC) vs. $39,469 (IA); average pay is $56,024 (DC) vs. $28,840 (IA).\n \n \nI lived in the Chicago suburbs from the time I was born until last month.\n\n \n Then you can ignore the PM I sent you.

If person A gets in because of overcorrection, there is some person B who lost that spot he/she deserved.\n\n \n No, you are making an arbitrary assumption here - that the resources are fixed. Why would they be? Doesn't AA involve spending more resources on education to increase the total number of spots? It is not necessarily true that even a single student lost his spot due to AA.\n \n \nYes, but I don't see how even a large school such as that can take race into account with all of its applicants without quanitizing it in some way. Sure, they may not have numerical guidelines, but it will still be difficult to do without quanitizing it. \n\n \n Well, that was exactly my point - we agree on this one.",

   "Best policy is a political question, a matter of opinion and compromise. There is no objective way to compare two policies and uniquely decide which is better. On the other hand, while experts may disagree whether a particular policy is legal/constitutional, there is a limited number of principles and methods that are accepted for such evaluation. This means it is at least a partially objective measure. Also, the consequences are very different. Whoever controls the legislature can enact a policy no matter how bad you or I think it is, but no one may enact an illegal policy.\n\n \n But we can eliminate some policies by looking at their downsides as well as their advantages. In this case, I think my economic AA has more advantages and fewer downsides. I will agree that neither one is illegal.\n \n \nThis discussion is obviously about the legality of AA, as almost all criticism directed at it is criticism in principle, not dependent on a particular case. \n\n \n Not necessarily, as no one can dispute that it is not legal: the Supreme Court upheld the Grutter case. I am disputing that there is a way to achieve the intended result that is better.\n \n \nThat is a good point which might raise equal protection issues if there were no factors that work in the opposite direction. But there are: for example, the black student will face obstacles after the move, like being a minority in the new neighborhood and school, that the white student will not. So you are not comparing apples to apples, and the legal challenge seems weak.\n\n \n But the black student does not necessarily have to face those differences. There are some terrific schools where blacks are in the majority.\n \n \nAs a matter of policy, I do believe that the student's whole history should count, not just where he graduated.\n\n \n I'll agree with that to a certain extent. I don't think that attending first and second grade in a failing school district and then moving to a very good school district for grades 3-12 is worthy of consideration, but the situation you mentioned (1-10 in failing school, 11 & 12 in good school) should definitely be considered.\n \n \nThat doesn't change a thing. Schools are financed mainly from local taxes, which depend mainly on property values, which in turn depend mainly on income. By all measures, the average income in DC is higher than in Iowa. See the Statistical Abstract of the US (1999 data) - median household income is $40,127 (DC) vs. $39,469 (IA); average pay is $56,024 (DC) vs. $28,840 (IA).\n\n \n I will have to look at that data and my proposal more. I'm not going to respond right now, but I will respond at a future point.\n \n \nNo, you are making an arbitrary assumption here - that the resources are fixed. Why would they be? Doesn't AA involve spending more resources on education to increase the total number of spots? It is not necessarily true that even a single student lost his spot due to AA.\n\n \n But still a college has to cut off admissions somehow; most colleges can't accept everyone. (And for the few colleges that do accept all applicants, AA is unnecessary.) Why should person A be chosen over person B if person B is a better candidate. ('Better' meaning 'better in the eyes of the college admissions board.') If they want to increase the number of spots in order to admit more minorities, that is fine. But regardless, if a minority benefits from overcorrection, then there is going to be someone who was hurt.\n \n \nWell, that was exactly my point - we agree on this one.\n\n \n Sorry, I probably misread a statement you made, then. I thought you were trying to say that it was possible.\n \n My main point was: The Grutter case upheld AA, but the Gratz case limits it to the point at which you can do it without quanitizing it, which is really going to be the final group of applicants.",

We can try to persuade each other as to which is the better policy, and if that does not work, agree to disagree and vote for different policies.

   "I should qualify that I do not live in the US, so I don't know about the specific way that employment equity (or admissions equity, etc.) works there.\n \n However, as to the theory of employment equity- or what english Americans call \"Affirmative Action\", I am well aware, having worked in several companies and organisations with such policies.\n \n \nBut when you are dealing with college admissions or employment, when someone unfairly benefits, someone else is unfairly hurt. It is true that in some cases, a person can benefit without another being hurt, but that is not true here. If person A gets in because of overcorrection, there is some person B who lost that spot he/she deserved.\n\n \n This is the crux of the anti-AA argument; that white people in droves are going to be losing jobs/placements they are more qualified for because other people (of colour) will be given them instead.\n \n What makes me suspicious about these arguments is that I don't hear the people complaining about this making any kind of fuss about people of colour not getting opportunities because of racism. If anti-AA people are all for equality, they shouldn't they be equally concerned, indignant, and vociferous about victims of racism? Yet, curiously, they seem altogether silent on these events of discrimination, which are far more prevalent than equity or even what some call \"reverse discrimination\".\n \n The fact is that many industries are white-dominated, and that this is clearly because of racism, since qualified people of colour exist in enough numbers to make almost all fields diverse. In order to counter this trend, more people of colour need to be hired at certain times than white people. This does not mean that the people of colour are by necessity less qualified- in fact I think that assumption is pretty clearly racist. \n \n In many white-dominated spheres, people of colour are more likely to apply if there is an employment equity policy, making the number of qualified applicants more numerous.\n \n As well, the fact that someone is a person of colour may be of direct benefit to the employer, as was the case in the hirings I participated in. If you are a white-dominated company or organisation, guaranteed you are making a good number of people uncomfortable because of it. That's bad business, or bad organising. People don't trust people who won't trust them, if you won't hire any women, or black people, or asians, why should any of those people listen to you or support you?\n \n Of course, just hiring a person or two won't solve your problem, but it is a step, and believe me, it makes a difference. Organisations like schools and police forces understand the power of commonality in that sense- it is easier to get people to work with you if they feel a commonality with you. It is \n \n Besides, I don't know how many people on this board have ever been in the position of hiring someone. I have, and it's really hard, and really complicated. There are so many factors to consider. Ultimately if there is only one qualified candidate, the search for applicants was flawed and should be re-examined and the position be left open. Unless things are really messed up, you should be choosing between several qualified candidates. In that case, many more subtle things come into play- How does this person represent us? Do they agree with our mandate? Will they get along well with the other employees? etc.\n \n Anyway, I have always found the particular way employment equity worked where I was very sound policy, and was a great benefit to the organization.\n \n \nIt creates reverse discrimination against whites.\n\n There is no such thing as \"reverse discrimination\". The reverse of discrimination is eqality.\n \n It seems to me that many white people are really scared of people of colour actually joining white-dominated fields. After all, if you do your job well, why would you be so afraid of other people getting a shot too? It sounds like some people are just looking to point the finger at someone else for their miseries.",

I'm sure you agree that it was racist unless you don't think that it is possible to be racist when minorities are the ones getting the breaks. It could have just as easily been based on economics. People who come from a poorer home should be given points over those who come from richer homes. The idea behind this is that the richer kids were able to afford many opportunities that the poorer students would have been unable to afford and therefore would require more work ethic to succeed. To expand this further, you could add points for coming from a poorer community because the school systems would be of lower quality and it would take strong work ethic to keep up with the richer communities. Schools should want those who are born with less but work hard to achieve as much and sometimes more than those who had more opportunities. Plus this works to help improve the poorer communities in our nation. What's more, this is not racist although it will likely still benefit minorities more than whites.

   "Did whites really need racism to succeed? I don't think so. Whites already were successful before blacks came into the picture, and they would continue to have done so afterwards.\n\n \n Well now first off you should define your terms. \n \n When you say \"successful\", do you mean that they had a rich aristocracy or oligarchy and a dominating proto-capitalist market system?\n In other words, are you referring to the size of the geographical area they have invaded, and how many resources they have extracted from the colonized? \n \n Are you speaking of British whites, Dutch whites, and other European whites in total, or just those who invaded North America? \n \n Certainly Europe had already invaded several African nations before any British refugees ever came to live in the Americas. They were kidnapping African peoples as slaves by the 14th century, a century or more before Columbus started massacring Trinidad's first peoples.\n \n Of course, people of African heritage are not the only people of colour. East and South Asia, Oceania, etc., were also invaded by those busy (though fundamentally lazy) Europeans.\n \n In any case, the basis of the wealth of the \"white nations\" in total comes from invasions, massacres, enslavement, \"resource\" (land, food, geography) theft, and forced labour. The entire history of the US is a case study in this. Find me a rich guy, and I'll point you to the dead bodies. If I can't, it's just that they're too well hidden.\n \n Furthermore, unless you believe that people of colour are, by nature, inferior to whites, all evidence points to the continuation of this trend to this day. Any overview of the development of the US gov't, the evolution of American law, the creation of every state and millionaire will show it. Cotton fields and coffee, mestizos and maquiladoras.\n \n Thus, if you are a white person in the US who has enough money to go to University, that money is stolen from somewhere.

   "Sam Walton- \n \n In Sam We Trust\n The Untold Story of Sam Walton and How Wal-Mart is Devouring America\n Bob Ortega\n (Times Business)\n Book Review\n \n God knows why there is this morbid interest in telling the life stories of those who steal money from us through the disgusting come-on called retailing. Like books on Sam Walton, the man who created 3,000 discount stores, with almost a million workers; the man who converted $1,000,000 in debt in 1965 to $200,000,000,000 in assets when he popped off in 1992.\n Walton did it by selling. The great American dream. Sell enough and you become rich. Destroy your competition, and you become super-rich. Keep your employees underpaid --- minimum wage-earners are the best. (High turnover of employees means that you don't have to raise wage and ante up benefits.) Get your merchandise made overseas, in places like Bangladesh, where boys and girls, some as young as nine years old, become your workforce.\n \n Sam Walton died several years ago of multiple myeloma, but his works live on, including several patent falsehoods:\n \n The poor --- if energetic enough, and optimistic enough, like Sam --- can rise to the top. However, Walton started out far from poor. His PR machine doesn't advertise the fact that his first investment came from a rich father-in-law, bringing in a loan of some $500,000 (in 1995 dollars). \n Then there is the myth that Wal-Mart returns dollars to the community. In truth, a store that grosses many millions annually sets up, with great fanfare, local scholarships of $1,000; the rest gets shipped off to Arkansas. \n How about the myth that Wal-Mart workers are all \"family\" --- and that the company rewards its workers with stock options. If it's family, it's a family with peculiar rules (intrafamilial love not permitted). Moreover, it's been shown that not more than one in fifty will ever be able to take advantage of stock options. The rest drop out sooner or later because they just can't stand working for such miserable wages. \n Then there's \"what's good for Wal-Mart is good for all of us.\" This includes despoliation of land, encouragement of numbing conformity of the employees, and support of aggressive --- often vicious --- business practices, especially associated with the politics involved in setting up a new store. \n The most-repeated canard is Sam Supersalesman was a great and humble folk because he drove old cars and glad-handed his employees. This made him worthy of Presidential medals-of-honor. But you'll notice that he did not drive around in the $20,000,000,000 trusts he set up for his wife and each of his children --- thus avoiding almost all estate taxes. Finally, they tell us that he and his stores bring needed bucks into our communities. However, if you look at the figures, it turns out that our governments --- federal, state, local --- not only don't get much in taxes from the likes of Sam, they subsidize him, his estate, and his family estates through tax gimmicks. \n Walton's original method of operation was to set up huge discount stores that, in opposition to K-Mart or Target or J C Penney or Sears --- were located solely in small towns. He started out in Bentonville, Arkansas, and spread throughout the United States --- and now, even as we speak, his ghost is spreading the disease to other parts of the world.\n Like countless other entrepreneurs of the last half of the 20th Century, governmental institutions that helped him lavishly --- but their good works for Sam were well hidden. For example, he was --- Wal-Mart still is --- on the dole from federal, state, county and city governments. We ain't talking measly welfare checks, we're talking tax advantages, rebates, and multi-million dollar checks (what they call corporate welfare). \n \n On the federal level, there's the lowering of international tariff barriers so that his clothing can be manufactured by hand by teens and sub-teens earning ten-cents-an-hour in Honduras, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China. Then the U. S. Congress gives him artificially low minimum wage and medical benefit requirements so that the young and the ill-educated can be used as Wal-Mart's primary workforce. They tell us that this work keeps the kids off the street, makes productive citizens of them; we never look at the price extracted from their souls for working in such a sterile environment.\n Finally, there are the immense rebates and reduced taxes (sometimes, reduced to nothing) provided by city and county councils, themselves mostly real estate people. It's the usual variation on control over property values: a simple change of zoning from \"rural\" to \"business\" can increase the value of property a thousand-fold. With a bevy of lawyers, and an artful PR machine, it's always been easy for Wal-Mart to get variances so that their huge boxes can be erected, surrounded by acres of parking spaces. This doubles the value of the land, while at the same time contravening all good architectural and aesthetic sense. Would you want to live next door to a Wal-Mart?\n \n Then there are the other indirect subsidies. Local and county rebates are set up, written in arcane language, so that a town's citizens will never know that they are subsidizing Sam's stock portfolio. What is said, instead, is that the city is going to benefit from his merchandise, and from 800 new jobs. It's not much different from what happened in 1950 when they said that the thousands of new jobs created by the new nuclear facility in Hanford, Washington would be of great financial benefit to the community, offer great security for the citizens of Southern Washington. Typical. The local governments hot to get Wal-Mart in their area don't look at what sociologists know as the ruination of the natural infrastructure --- the links between merchants, townspeople, and the subtle health of a community. Only after it's done and in place do we see city center suddenly destroyed by this box from outer space, resting in asphalt, five miles north on the Interstate.\n \n At the end of his life, Sam Walton was lionized --- but few took the trouble to point out his was a tyrannical business where employees could be fired for trying to organize unions to represent them, or even falling in love with a clerk in the next department. The myth was that it was pure American work-ethic, with a benign, homey straight-shooting character at the top. \n \n In Sam We Trust is an excellent moral tale of a system that rewards the avaricious while it penalizes --- if not destroys --- the human scale and values of communities. The Christian fundamentalists think that the devil is at work in the form of abortions, television programs about gays, and crucifixes stuck into bottles of urine. Too bad they don't have the time to look out and see what's going on the edge of town.\n \n In 1992, George Bush gave Sam Walton the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the country's highest civilian honors. The message: if you build a fortune on the corpses of the poor and under-represented, the government will give you its love and its blessings. Local businessmen with more humane operations and more humane scale get bull-dozed, the owners sent into premature and poverty-stricken retirement --- while those who steamroller our lives with opportunistic merchandising get the blessings of the presidents.\n \n David Glass --- the man who took over after Sam's death --- was asked by NBC about children in Bangladesh who hand-sew clothes for Wal-Mart \"locked in their plant until all hours of the night, until they finish that day's production.\" Glass was then shown photographs of one factory that burned down with the children still locked inside. He responded, \"Yeah...there are tragic things that happen all over the world.\" The interview was terminated at this point, not by NBC, but by Wal-Mart's publicity person.\n \n Bob Ortega wrote In Sam We Trust and writes for the Wall Street Journal. He's good. In simple language, he shows how you and I had the privilege of paying, through the nose, for Sam's preposterous wealth. He also suggests that we deserve better. \n \n \n \n --- Ruth McCreedy",

Most biologists would agree with that. \n \n\n \n \"Most biologists\" wisely avoid the subject of human intelligence, so I don't know where you get that idea.\n \n Racism does not make people of colour less intelligent. The case could be made that it makes racist white people less intelligent. Or maybe it's just less intelligent people become racist. The jury's out on that one.\n \n Again, even the \"limits\" (which tend to be vast) of genotype that influence what is tested on SATs and IQ tests are in no way, shape or form correlative to \"racial\" categories.\n \n \nIntelligence is indeed complex, but you don't need to know what causes it in order to measure it.\n\n \n You can't measure intelligence. Neither can anyone else. Intelligence is not quantitative. You can't count it like jelly beans.\n \n Alfred Binet, the creator of the \"Binet scale\" (later re-named by others the Intelligence Quotient) never intended for it to measure intelligence at all, but merely to be used to identify schoolchildren with learning problems.\n \n \"The second fallacy, reification, is the assumption that test scores are a yard-stick for measuring a single entity or set of behaviors known as general intelligence. Binet warned against this application of his scale as a routine device for testing all individuals, especially normal individuals. The other question is that whether or not intelligence is testable.\"\n Emily Gibson and Kristofer Still\n \n \n \nBlacks also score far lower on SAT scores, and have epidemic rates of crime, illegitimacy, drug abuse, poverty and rape, DESPITE years of affirmative action and welfare programs designed to target blacks. All the signs one would expect from a group with lower average intelligence!\n\n \n Um, nothing in the above is either true or relevant.\n \n \nIf you don't like the term 'intelligence', how about 'less prone to creating First World societies'.\n\n \n Creating a \"First World\", or European-model society is based more on being European-based than \"intelligence\". However, many things Europeans value highly, such as math, writing, and many branches of science originated in Africa and Asia (including Persia). Such as the alphabet. \n \n \nHint: Eurasians faced an extremely cold, harsh environment in which they had to have intelligence and creativity in order to survive and build shelter. These same selection pressures did NOT exist in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n \n Hint: You're just quoting out-dated bunk that has no scientific basis.\n \n \"For example, some researchers claim that human groups evolved in the Earth's frost-zones have significantly more cerebral folding and a higher ratio of frontal lobe to anterior lobe brain mass, relative to groups evolved in temperate or tropical zones. These researchers claim that these characteristics correlate with abstract intelligence. The theory is that these areas demanded more technological adaptiveness to survive cruel winters. Thus groups with ancestry from these areas may accept more abstract forms of social institutions. A simple counterargument to this rationale is that the ecosystems in warmer climates are more diverse and complex than in colder ones, and similar technological adaptiveness would be just as useful for the people there to fully exploit the thousands of species of plants and animals they come into contact with. \n \n In fact, there is no empiric evidence of superior technical capabilities of people from northernmost areas, as many inventions crucial to the development of complex societies, such as agriculture, writing, metallurgy, wheel, gunpowder etc., originated in warm or hot climates, as did the complex societies themselves. The peoples living in colder climates have adopted all these technologies from warmer parts of the world, and all the arctic peoples, such as the Inuit and Native Americans of the arctic, who, according to this theory, should be the most adapted to make technical inventions and build complex societies, (when in fact they did not adopt such behaviours until) they became into contact with southern cultures.\" \n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \n \n Pseudo-science is a waste of everyone's time...",

   "Murray and Herrnstein claim that black IQs are 15 points lower than whites. (...)\n \n But The Bell Curve cites as its primary sources for this assertion R. Travis Osborne, Frank C.J. McGurk, and Audrey Shuey--all recipients of Pioneer 1 grants. Osborne, who has received almost $400,000 from Pioneer, used his \"research\" into black genetic inferiority to argue for the restoration of school segregation (Newsday, 11/9/94).\n \n And, in fact, even the data collected by these racists does not show a consistent 15-point gap. The studies they present show a wide range of results, ranging from no black/white IQ disparity at all to the absurd finding that most African-Americans are severely retarded. \n \n As for the \"consistency of the gaps,\" even The Bell Curve acknowledges that more recent tests have shown a narrower black/white difference, ranging from seven to 10 points. SAT tests have shown a similar convergence. But Murray and Herrnstein warn that \"at some point convergence may be expected to stop, and the gap could even begin to widen again\"--because \"black fertility is loaded more heavily than white fertility toward low-IQ segments of the population.\" In other words, the bad genes will triumph, no matter what the evidence says. \n \n That sort of circular argument abounds in The Bell Curve. Although sociologist Jane Mercer has shown that supposed racial differences in IQ vanish if one controls for a variety of socio-economic variables, the authors reject her method because their theories assume that low IQ causes people to be poor, rather than poverty causing low IQs. Similarly, even though IQ tests show that average scores are rising--by as much as 15 points since World War II--\"real\" IQs must be falling, since low IQ women are having more babies. \n\n \n 1 About Pioneer: \ndescribed by the London Sunday Telegraph (3/12/89) as a \"neo-Nazi organization closely integrated with the far right in American politics.\" The fund's mission is to promote eugenics, a philosophy that maintains that \"genetically unfit\" individuals or races are a threat to society. \n\n \n Quotes from an article by Jim Naureckas",

(Blacks, on the other hand, tend to be more realistic and accurate in their perceptions of their economic status relative to whites.) If white Americans make no effort to hear the viewpoints and see the experiences of others, their awareness of their own privileged racial status will disappear. They can convince themselves that life as they experience it on their side of the color line is simply the objective truth about race.

You asked a few of your friends what they thought, and then called it a \"survey\". Then you took a single sentence from the definition of \"survey\" I provided, and used that to argue that you had fulfilled the entire definition. This is what the ASA writes under the heading \"What is a Survey?\"-\n \n \nThen, What Is a Survey? \n Today the word \"survey\" is used most often to describe a method of gathering information from a sample of individuals. This \"sample\" is usually just a fraction of the population being studied. \n \n For example, a sample of voters is questioned in advance of an election to determine how the public perceives the candidates and the issues ... a manufacturer does a survey of the potential market before introducing a new product ... a government entity commissions a survey to gather the factual information it needs to evaluate existing legislation or to draft proposed new legislation. \n \n Not only do surveys have a wide variety of purposes, they also can be conducted in many ways -- including over the telephone, by mail, or in person. Nonetheless, all surveys do have certain characteristics in common. \n \n Unlike a census, where all members of the population are studied, surveys gather information from only a portion of a population of interest -- the size of the sample depending on the purpose of the study. \n \n In a bona fide survey, the sample is not selected haphazardly or only from persons who volunteer to participate. It is scientifically chosen so that each person in the population will have a measurable chance of selection. This way, the results can be reliably projected from the sample to the larger population. \n \n Information is collected by means of standardized procedures so that every individual is asked the same questions in more or less the same way. The survey's intent is not to describe the particular individuals who, by chance, are part of the sample but to obtain a composite profile of the population. \n \n The industry standard for all reputable survey organizations is that individual respondents should never be identified in reporting survey findings. All of the survey's results should be presented in completely anonymous summaries, such as statistical tables and charts. \n\n Doesn't sound anything like what you did. But feel free to take it up with the ASA. Or try to publish your \"findings\". \n \n So, are you going to \"try again\"?\n \n \nThink for a second. Why would they have an Affirmative Action Office if they didn't have Affirmative Action?\n\n \n Having an \"Affirmative Action Office\" does not mean \"they give unconstitutional benefits based on race.\" Try again. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nWhy is that in the section \"Columbian Exchange\" then?\n\n \n I don't know why your sources are inaccurate.\n \n Columbus did not only arrive in a trip in 1492, but more importantly returned in 1493,\n \n \nWith an invasion force of seventeen ships, appointed at his own request by the Spanish Crown to install himself as 'viceroy and governor of {the Carribean Islands} and the mainland' of America, a position he held until 1500. Setting up shop on the large island he called Espagnola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he promptly instituted policies of slavery (encomiendo) and systematic extermination of the Taino population. Columbus' program reduced Taino numbers from as many as eight million at the outset of his regime to about three million in 1496. Only 100,000 were left by the time of the governor's departure in 1500. His policies, however, remained, with the result that by 1514 the Spanish census of the island showed barely 22,000 Indians still alive. In 1542, only two hundred were recorded. Thereafter, they were considered extinct, as were Indians throughout the Carribean basin, an aggregate population which totaled more than fifteen million at the point when the Columbian adventure began.\n\n \n What you are referring to happened mostly after Columbus had gone. Columbus' \"trade\" was the theft of gold- it was the later Spanish invaders that enslaved the nations of South and Central America as well as the Carribean for the export of agricultural and mined goods.\n \n \nAll told, it is plausibly estimated that, from the Rio Grande southward into Chile, as many as 80 million human beings were expended in the Spanish/Portuguese drive for wealth and imperial grandeur by the year 1700.\n both above quotes from A Little Matter of Genocide by Ward Churchill\n \n On working in the mines,\n \n \n Dropped down a shaft bored as far as 750 feet into the earth, taking with them only 'some bags of roasted maize for their sustenance', observed Loaisa, the miners remained below ground for a week at a time. There, in addition to the dangers of falling rocks, poor ventilation, and the violence of brutal overseers, as the Indian laborers chipped away at the rock faces of the mines they released and inhaled poisonous vapors of cinnabar, arsenic, anhydride, and mercury... For as long as there appeared to be an unending supply of brute labour it was cheaper to work an Indian to death, and replace him or her with another native, than it was to feed or care for either of them properly. It is probable, in fact, that the life expectancy of an Indian engaged in forced labor in a mine or on a plantation during these early years of Spanish terror in Peru was not more than three or four months- about the same as that of someone working at slave labor in the synthetic rubber manufacturing plant at Auschwitz in the 1940s.\n Rodrigo de Loaisa wrote the first-hand account paraphrased in Conquest of the Incas, by John Hemming. \n \n Also interesting (though gory and harrowing) are the first-hand accounts of Bartholome de Las Casas, who wrote repeated entreaties to the Spanish monarchy to stop the slaughter and genocide of the First Nations. He describes in his writings common practices of the Spanish colonists, such as \"hanging Tainos en masse, roasting them on spits or burning them at the stake (often a dozen or more at a time), hacking their children into pieces to be used as dog food and so forth\". \n \n Please explain to me how it is that you can view any such behavior in terms of an \"exchange\", such as freedom and life and community for horses and bananas and hell.",

Each person is guaranteed equal protection. That means that no one can receive a greater protection, because others would then have to receive less. Therefore, AA which gives a greater protection to certain groups, is unconstitutional.\n\n \n In your interpretation. Thankfully, you're not a Supreme Court judge.\n \n \nHeld: The Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body is not prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI, or \u00a71981. Pp. 9-32.\n\n \n By Equal Protection Clause they refer the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI refers to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and \u00a71981 refers to 42 U. S. C. \u00a71981\n \n This decision was made based on several points\n \n (a) In the landmark Bakke case, this Court reviewed a medical\n school's racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats for\n members of certain minority groups. The decision produced six separate\n opinions, none of which commanded a majority. Four Justices\n would have upheld the program on the ground that the government\n can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial\n prejudice. 438 U. S., at 325. Four other Justices would have\n struck the program down on statutory grounds. Id., at 408. Justice\n Powell, announcing the Court's judgment, provided a fifth vote not\n only for invalidating the program, but also for reversing the state\n court's injunction against any use of race whatsoever. In a part of his\n opinion that was joined by no other Justice, Justice Powell expressed\n his view that attaining a diverse student body was the only interest\n asserted by the university that survived scrutiny. Id., at 311.\n Grounding his analysis in the academic freedom that \"long has been\n viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment,\" id., at 312, 314,\n Justice Powell emphasized that the \" 'nation's future depends upon\n leaders trained through wide exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation.\" Id., at 313. However, he also emphasized that \"[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in\n which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed\n to be members of selected ethnic groups,\" that can justify using\n race. Id., at 315. Rather, \"[t]he diversity that furthers a compelling\n state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and\n characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though\n important element.\" Ibid. \n \n (b) All government racial classifications must be analyzed by a reviewing\n court under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227. But not all such uses are invalidated by\n strict scrutiny. Race-based action necessary to further a compelling\n governmental interest does not violate the Equal Protection Clause\n so long as it is narrowly tailored to further that interest. E.g., Shaw\n v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908. Context matters when reviewing such\n action. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344. Not every\n decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny\n is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the\n importance and the sincerity of the government's reasons for using\n race in a particular context. 13-15.\n \n (c) The Court endorses Justice Powell's view that student body diversity\n is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in\n university admissions. The Court defers to the Law School's educational\n judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission.\n \n (d) The Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a\n narrowly tailored plan. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot \"insulat[e] each category of applicants with\n certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.\"\n Bakke, supra, at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.).

If a society's elite are dominated by racist white people, the cultural heroes are dominated by racist white people, and the mainstream media are dominated by racist white people, it follows that the mainstream white society is racist. Columbus is just one example of that. People who aren't racist don't celebrate racist genocidal murderers on a yearly basis.\n \n So, now it's your turn to explain the logic behind the freedom and peace and life for bananas and horsies and death exchange.",

That's a load of XXXX. You know as well as I do that few people mention what Columbus actually was or represented, unless of course they are against his being hero-worshipped.\n \n Not to mention that he wasn't the first \"of a European power nation to travel west\". Though I do appreciate you reformatting from \"he discovered America\", you're still not right.\n \n Ward Churchill on Columbus's racism, intent, and resemblance to Heinrich Himmler (Head of the Nazi SS)-\n \n\n It is time to delve into the substance of my remark that Columbus and Himmler, nazi lebensraumpolitik, along with the \"settlement of the New World\" bear more than casual resemblance to one another. It is not, as my two correspondents wished to believe, because of his \"discovery.\" This does not mean that if this were \"all\" he had done he would be somehow innocent of what resulted from his find, no more than is the scientist who makes a career of accepting military funding to develop weapons in any way \"blameless\" when they are subsequently used against human targets. Columbus did not sally forth upon the Atlantic for reasons of \"neutral science\" or altruism. He went, as his own diaries, reports, and letters make clear, fully expecting to encounter wealth belonging to others. It was his stated purpose to seize this wealth, by whatever means necessary and available, in order to enrich both his sponsors and himself.4 Plainly, he prefigured, both in design and by intent, what came next. To this extent, he not only symbolizes the process of conquest and genocide which eventually consumed the indigenous peoples of America, but bears the personal responsibility of having participated in it. Still, if this were all there was to it, I might be inclined to dismiss him as a mere thug rather than branding him a counterpart to Himmler.\n (...)\n [The Spaniards] made bets as to who would slit a man in two, or cut off his head at one blow; or they opened up his bowels. They tore the babes from their mother's breast by their feet and dashed their heads against the rocks.... They spitted the bodies of other babes, together with their mothers and all who were before them, on their swords.16\n No SS trooper could be expected to comport himself with a more unrelenting viciousness. And there is more. All of this was coupled to wholesale and persistent massacres:\n \n A Spaniard ... suddenly drew his sword. Then the whole hundred drew theirs and began to rip open the bellies, to cut and kill [a group of Tainos assembled for this purpose]-men, women, children and old folk, all of whom were seated, off guard and frightened.... And within two credos, not a man of them there remain[ed] alive. The Spaniards enter[ed] the large house nearby, for this was happening at its door, and in the same way, with cuts and stabs, began to kill as many as were found there, so that a stream of blood was running, as if a great number of cows had perished.17\n Elsewhere, Las Casas went on to recount:\n \n In this time, the greatest outrages and slaughterings of people were perpetrated, whole villages being depopulated.... The Indians saw that without any offense on their part they were despoiled of their kingdoms, their lands and liberties and of their lives, their wives, and homes. As they saw themselves each day perishing by the cruel and inhuman treatment of the Spaniards, crushed to earth by the horses, cut in pieces by swords, eaten and torn by dogs, many buried alive and suffering all kinds of exquisite tortures ... [many surrendered to their fate, while the survivors] fled to the mountains [to starve].18\n The butchery continued until there were no Tainos left to butcher. One might well ask how a group of human beings, even those like the Spaniards of Columbus' day, maddened in a collective lust for wealth and prestige, might come to treat another with such unrestrained ferocity over a sustained period. The answer, or some substantial portion of it, must lie in the fact that the Indians were considered by the Spanish to be untermenschen, subhumans. That this was the conventional view is borne out beyond all question in the recorded debates between Las Casas and the nobleman, Francisco de Sepulveda, who argued for the majority of Spaniards that American Indians, like African blacks and other \"lower animals,\" lacked \"souls.\" The Spaniards, consequently, bore in Sepulveda's estimation a holy obligation to enslave and destroy them wherever they might be encountered.19 The eugenics theories of nazi \"philosopher\" Alfred Rosenberg, to which Heinrich Himmler more or less subscribed, elaborated the mission of the SS in very much the same terms.20 It was upon such profoundly racist ideas that Christopher Columbus grounded his policies as initial governor of the new Spanish empire in America.21\n \n In the end, all practical distinctions between Columbus and Himmler-at least those not accounted for by differences in available technology and extent of socio-military organization-evaporate upon close inspection. They are cut of the same cloth, fulfilling precisely the same function and for exactly the same reasons, each in his own time and place. If there is one differentiation which may be valid, it is that while the specific enterprise Himmler represented ultimately failed and is now universally condemned, that represented by Columbus did not and is not. Instead, as Sale has observed, the model for colonialism and concomitant genocide Columbus pioneered during his reign as governor of Espa\u00f1ola was to prove his \"most enduring legacy,\" carried as it was \"by the conquistadors on their invasions of Mexico, Peru, and La Florida.\"22 The Columbian process is ongoing, as is witnessed by the fact that, today, his legacy is celebrated far and wide.\n",

It does not take into account the development of racism and the idea of race historically. Races as we know them now did not exist phlosophically at the time. You could argue that this means Columbus couldn't have been racist, if you want to be picky about semantics. However, if you know that the motivation for racism is based on power and economics, you will understand that the ideology of christian vs heathen was just the earlier manifestation of what became racism. Call it protoracism if you want. Fundamentally it doesn't matter, he killed them for being \"Indians\", which is the same thing as racism, however you slice it.  \n \n Either way, call it racism or religious intolerance, celebrating him sends a clear message as to the morals of the powers that be.

   "I have to say, some of the debate on this thread was very good, earlier on between dsadevil, wjim, mizmaxx, and uh... the person from hawaii(sorry, I forgot your screen name)\n \n I would sum up the pro affirmative-action veiw as...\n - because of historical racism, certain minorities are more often poor\n - because of current rasicsm, these minorities have difficulty getting jobs and live more stressful lives\n - therefore, to make it fair, we should adjust for this by preferentially hiring and admitting to colleges the same minorities\n \n Why not attack the racism itself?\n \n \n Mizmaxx\n \"IcePrincess, the problem is that places without affirmative action policies are not picking applicants based just on their abilities. Also, applicants from appressed backgrounds are less likely to have access to the kinds of activities and resources which would make their application more desirable. Of course, these factors should also be changed, but in the meantime doesn't it make sense to assume that people will succeed similarly regardless of race and therefore the racial makeup of a school should reflect the approximate social demographic?\"\n \n \n Not all places without AA are racist! But, I will agree that some are. So why don't we stop them from hiring preferentially?\n \n I agree that race won't affect performance, but previous education and wealth would. So if you are hiring/admitting preferentially these groups, who are currently less wealthy and educated, then you will be getting less performance.\n \n \nBesides, there is no way for a college to judge which applicants are \"smartest\". There is no standardised smartness test, or even an accepted concrete smartness standard to judge people against \n\n \n So we should go ahead and pick by race? You have stated that race does not affect performance, so it isn't a valid way to pick the best applicant!

   "No, I read it perfectly fine. What you did was not a survey.\n\n \n YOur source defines two statistical terms. The first is \"survey\":\n \n \nToday the word \"survey\" is used most often to describe a method of gathering information from a sample of individuals. This \"sample\" is usually just a fraction of the population being studied. \n \n For example, a sample of voters is questioned in advance of an election to determine how the public perceives the candidates and the issues ... a manufacturer does a survey of the potential market before introducing a new product ... a government entity commissions a survey to gather the factual information it needs to evaluate existing legislation or to draft proposed new legislation. \n \n Not only do surveys have a wide variety of purposes, they also can be conducted in many ways -- including over the telephone, by mail, or in person. Nonetheless, all surveys do have certain characteristics in common. \n \n Unlike a census, where all members of the population are studied, surveys gather information from only a portion of a population of interest -- the size of the sample depending on the purpose of the study. \n\n \n The second is \"bona fide survey\":\n \n \nIn a bona fide survey, the sample is not selected haphazardly or only from persons who volunteer to participate. It is scientifically chosen so that each person in the population will have a measurable chance of selection. This way, the results can be reliably projected from the sample to the larger population. \n \n Information is collected by means of standardized procedures so that every individual is asked the same questions in more or less the same way. The survey's intent is not to describe the particular individuals who, by chance, are part of the sample but to obtain a composite profile of the population. \n \n The industry standard for all reputable survey organizations is that individual respondents should never be identified in reporting survey findings. All of the survey's results should be presented in completely anonymous summaries, such as statistical tables and charts. \n\n \n Please show me how it was not a survey.\n \n \nFundamentally it doesn't matter, he killed them for being \"Indians\", which is the same thing as racism, however you slice it. \n\n \n So if Columbus had found members of the African race on the continent, he wouldn't have killed them?\n \n \nEither way, call it racism or religious intolerance, celebrating him sends a clear message as to the morals of the powers that be. It falls nicely in line with killing Afghanis and Iraqis for oil pipelines.\n\n \n I disagree with you, but that is off topic. If you want to debate that, find or start a thread on it and I will.\n \n \nYeah. He also supported affirmative action. Fancy that.\n\n \n Yeah. He also lived 40 years ago. Fancy that.\n \n \nYes, well, that's not how anyone gets into college, or gets jobs. You don't get a job because just you deserve it, or just because you work hard. You don't get into college just because you're as smart as the next person. You get jobs and college entrance through connections and opportunities.\n\n \n So what?\n \n \nAlso, having good grades won't pay your tuition. Between two equal candidates, the one with more money always gets in because they can pay their own tuition. Scholarships are few and hard to come by, especially for people who have to work to support themselves while in school.\n\n \n Then find an open-admissions university. Then you won't have to worry about not getting in. And why should lack of money be an argument for affirmative action? I don't see any connection between race and money.\n \n \nYeah, Columbus was gross. Try typing the words \"Columbus\" and \"truth\" into a search engine (I love google) for more on-line info on him.\n\n \n Don't believe everything you read online. Most of it is useless.",

I am going to make the fairly reasonable assumption that wjim's friends are likely to tend towards his point of view. Which, from your point of view mizmaxx, is somehow blatantly racist. Therefore, this survey showed that one third of 'rascist tending' people don't know the month Columbus day is in and therefore don't care about Columbus day.

If they had been intending to define two seperate terms, the rest of the definition after they said \"bona fide\" would not have simply said \"survey\".

It doesn't make sense, but to humor the questioner, yes of course he would have. Does that make him any less racist? No.\n \n The Spanish killed Africans as well, because they, like the Taino, were seen as less than human. Because of who they were.\n \n Why argue this point anyway?

   "Excuse my ignorance, but what does tokenistic mean?\n\n \n An example of tokenism is someone who is hired by an organization to give the impression of \"liberalism\" without having to deal with why they were segregated in the first place. Such a person is expected to \"toe the line\", because they \"made it\", and not in any way threaten to attempt to change whatever was problematic about the organization to begin with. The organization can then have one or two people of color (or women, or disabled people, or gay people, etc.) to justify their otherwise racist practices/policies. Take Condoleeza for example. \n \n \nIf white people aren't working against racism, then how can AA have ever been in place in the first place?\n\n \n People of color demanded it. Besides, some white people do work against racism. The vast majority do not.\n \n \nAA is hiring preferentially! It doesn't stop others from doing it. Why don't we take a look at hiring practices and if we find that a company hires preferentially, stop them?\n\n \n Tried that.

If you think people should just stay \"disadvantaged\" (as you put it), caught in the catch-22 of noschool=nojob=noexperience=nojob=noschool=nojob, than just say so. If on the other hand you believe that it is unfair to disadvantage a population, than something must change.\n \n mizmaxx - \"That isn't how aa works.\"\n Robbie - \"Then how does it?\"\n \n In my experience, aa just means that we consider the fact that someone had been disadvantaged in their application. So, race is not the only consideration, even in qualifying for aa. Further, if you only have one applicant who is a person of color, than there is a problem. Usually I've had the choice between several candidates, all of them qualified. If that isn't the case, you should re-advertise the hiring to get more candidates, extend the deadline, something.

Everywhere I've worked has.\n \n \nAnyone can get out, how many immigrants came over with nothing.\n\n \n It's real easy to say that if you aren't one of those people. Anyway, you seem to be missing the point- for hundreds of years white settlers and immigrants did everything in their power to explicitely exclude people of color from having any kind of equal access to employment. Union history in the US is all about that- if capitalists wanted to hire people of color (because they know they have no choice but to accept lower pay), the white unions would strike. White exclusivity was often as much a part of union requirements as wage increases, this is one reason why unions are so white-dominated in general. \n \n Therefore a white immigrant always has much more chance of making it, even if the person next door works just as hard as him or harder, the white immigrant will \"rise\" more quickly and easily.\n \n I don't know what you could possibly use as evidence to support your assertion that \"anybody can get out\"- obviously this isn't true, because certain people inevitably don't \"get out\". So you either choose to believe that people of color are inherently stupid and lazy, or you come to terms with the fact that the game is rigged from the get-go.\n \n \nIt is still giving preference based on race.\n\n \n People give preference for all kinds of things all the time.
