   "emoticon_wow \n I live / work in California. In job hunting, it is illegal for a prospective employer to ask me if I am gay. I work in a fairly conservative industry, and if a prospective employer asked me such a question, prospective discrimination would be an obvious thought.\n \n Now skip backwards to college applications. I grew up in a conservative state, and there was no \"Are you gay?\" block on my application.\n If there were, I would immediately wonder about prospective discrimination.\n \n I can't help but wonder if most colleges asking that, without any stated \"affirmative action\" plan, would be suspected of potential discrimination.\n \n But now, we are asking that as a potential \"affirmative action\" issue? emoticon_confused \n emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n SCOTUS had a case not too long ago about racial affirmative action. Their ruling was kind of vague, but essentially allowed it. I would have to review the ruling to see if it holds any gems on this issue, but my gut instinct is that any state that prohibits discrimination on the bounds of \"sexual orientation\" that has a public school adopting \"affirmative action\" for sexual orientation would be opening itself up for losing a court case.\n Again, I need to review the ruling, but I would think that to \"win\", such a school would have to show a historical need for gay affirmative action, and even then it may be moot as there is a difference between a black family having black kids, who have black kids, who have black kids...\n ... and gay people who are typically raised by heterosexual parents.\n \n \n < petitions message board moderator for scratching head smiley icon <\n \n \n I usually try to play an internal devil's advocate regardless of my position, and I just don't see where the pro-affirmative action side is coming from...\n \n \"Affirmative action\" for gays, in my perspective, has always been a boogeyman of the anti-gay cause. Colorado's amendment #2 was won under the false pretense that it was about cutting off potential employment affirmative action for gays, when the actual wording was much more severe than that.\n \n But in a quick google about this, I found this that just stopped me in my tracks.\n http://www.cacuss.ca/en/08-news/details.lasso?nid=1983\n (Note: College is Canadian) \"Middlebury College is this year for the first time giving students who identify themselves as gay in the admissions process an \"attribute\" - the same flagging of an application that members of ethnic minority groups, athletes, alumni children and others receive, according to Shawn Rae Passalacqua, assistant director of admissions at Middlebury.\"",

   "All this mantra about the article is ridiculous. As I pointed out in this post, you cannot infer from the fact that a person won't post an article that the article therefore must not exist. To do so is a fallacy.\n\n \n Oh please! He is saying that the article does not exist, after implying that one did exist. THAT is what he is being called out on.\n \n \nFurthermore, to keep the article issue going is of no use as steeeeve has said he will not post the article no matter what. Worst case scenario, the article doesn't exist. What then? The question still remains: should affirmative action status be given on the basis of sexual orientation? That's a simple question which should only illicit a simple answer.\n\n \n Well, considering that I responded to the poll, yes the question has been answered. \n \n What you seem to forget , however, is that this is a discussion board. Questions regarding the issue, which would include MOTIVE for putting up the poll, are totally appropriate.\n \n \nNow, I have no way to force people to stop talking about such a minimal issue as whether the article exists or not, but I do think it should stop. Someone has to get the last word. What would it hurt if it was not you?\n\n \n This deserves a rolling of the eyes. Are you kidding me with this?\n \n \ntonybrown - the article issue doesn't matter. Your answer to the question was no. That's all we care to know. Let it be.\n\n \n The non-existent article matters only to the fact that the poller brought it up as a motive for asking the question.
