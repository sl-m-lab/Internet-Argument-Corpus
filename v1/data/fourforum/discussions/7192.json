   "re: the tests derived by the courts over the last 50 years to determine what is and is not constitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n \n \n Would a reasonable observer, using the tests devised by the courts over the last 50 years, come to the conclusion that Thomas Jefferson's Virgina Act for Establishing Religious Freedon  is actually a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment? \n \n \"Well aware that Almighty God has created the mind free;that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring...\"\n \n \n \n Would a reasonable person applying the courts test also find Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance also unconstitutional?\n \n \"We the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serious consideration, a Bill printed by order of the last Session of General Assembly, entitled \"A Bill establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,\" and conceiving that the same if finally armed with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful members of a free State to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. We remonstrate against the said Bill, \n 1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, \"that religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.\" The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considerd as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governour of the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true that the majority may trespass on the rights of the minority.\"\n \n \n The below brief excerpt from the recent Kitzmiller decision includes numerous citations and some of the rationale behind the tests the courts employed.\n \"In elaborating upon this \"reasonable observer,\" the Third Circuit explained in Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 407, that \"the reasonable observer is an informed citizen who is more knowledgeable than the average passerby.\" Moreover, in addition to knowing the challenged conduct's history, the observer is deemed able to \"glean other relevant facts\" from the face of the policy in light of its context. Id. at 407; accord Capitol Square Review & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 779-781 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Knowing the challenged policy's legislative history, the community's history, and the broader social and historical context in which the policy arose, the objective observer thus considers the publicly available evidence relevant to the purpose inquiry, but notably does not do so to ascertain, strictly speaking, what the governmental purpose actually was. See, e.g., Selman, 390 F. Supp. 2d at 1306-07. Instead, the observer looks to that evidence to ascertain whether the policy \"in fact conveys a message of endorsement or disapproval\" of religion, irrespective of what the government might have intended by it. Lynch, 465 U.S. at 690 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"The central issue in this case is whether has endorsed Christianity by its . To answer that question, we must examine both what intended to communicate . . . and what message actually conveyed. The purpose and effect prongs of the Lemon test represent these two aspects of the meaning of the action.\"); Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Bd. of Educ., 975 F.\n Supp. 819 (E.D. La. 1997), aff'd, 185 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 1999); Selman, 390 F.\n Supp. 2d at 1305-06.\n We must now ascertain whether the ID Policy \"in fact conveys a message of\n endorsement or disapproval\" of religion, with the reasonable, objective observer being the hypothetical construct to consider this issue. Lynch, 465 U.S. at 690 (O'Connor, J., concurring). As the endorsement test is designed to ascertain the objective meaning of the statement that the District's conduct communicated in the community by focusing on how \"the members of the listening audience\" perceived the conduct, two inquiries must be made based upon the circumstances of this case.\"\n \n \n \n However an informed citizen who is also a reasonable person might attempt to evaluate the validity of the courts tests by applying them to legislative acts from the founding era. \n \n Does this convey an \"endorsement of religion\" under the courts' tests?\n \"It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considerd as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governour of the Universe...\".\n \n \n Does the legislative history of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment force us to conclude that it violates itself? (One of the rationales behind the Establishment Clause was to allow the practice of religion in general as well as the established religions in certain states to flourish apart from federal government interference -but applying the courts \"promotion\" test, this legislative objective would render the establishment clause a violation of itself) \n \n \n A review of history leads to the conclusion that the tests derived by the courts are seriously flawed and that the courts have stretched the meaning of the establishment Clause to an irrational degree.",
