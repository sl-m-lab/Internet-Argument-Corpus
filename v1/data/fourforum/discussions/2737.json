   "emoticon_xgood \n \n Have You Heard of Sheriff Arpaio?\n \n You gotta Love Sheriff Joe This is the way he is, and he has been \n re-elected several times.........Sheriff Joe Arpaio (in Arizona) is \n doing it RIGHT!!:\n \n \n He has jail meals down to 40 cents a serving and charges the inmates for \n them. He stopped 'smoking' and 'porno magazines' in the jails. He \n took away their weights. He cut off all but \"G\" movies. He started \n 'chain gangs' so the inmates could do free work on county and city \n projects. Then he started 'chain gangs' for women so he wouldn't get \n sued for 'discrimination'. \n \n He took away cable TV until he found out there was a federal court order \n that required cable TV for jails. So he hooked up the cable TV again \n but only let in the Disney channel and the weather channel. When asked \n why the weather channel he replied, so they will know how hot it's gonna \n be while they are working on my chain gangs.\n \n He cut off coffee since it has zero nutritional value. When the inmates \n complained, he told them.....this is a good one...... \"This isn't the \n Ritz/Carlton..... If you don't like it, don't come back!!\"\n \n He bought Newt Gingrich' lecture series on videotape that he pipes into \n the jails. When asked by a reporter if he had any lecture series by a \n Democrat, he replied that a democratic lecture series might explain why \n a lot of the inmates were in his jails in the first place. You have to \n love this guy!!\n \n More on the AZ Sheriff..... \n \n With temperatures being even hotter than usual in Phoenix (116 degrees \n just set a new record), the Associated Press reports:\n \n \n About 2,000 inmates living in a barbed-wire-surrounded 'tent'\n encampment at the Maricopa County Jail have been given\n permission to strip down to their government-issued 'pink' boxer\n shorts. On Wednesday, hundreds of men wearing boxers were\n either curled up on their bunk beds or chatted in the tents,\n which reached 138 degrees inside the week before.\n \n Many were also swathed in wet, 'pink' towels as sweat collected\n on their chests and dripped down to their 'pink' socks. \"It\n feels like we are in a furnace,\" said James Zanzot, an inmate\n who has lived in the tents for 1 1/2 years. \"It's inhumane.\"\n \n Joe Arpaio, the tough-guy sheriff who created the tent city and\n long ago started making his prisoners wear pink, and eat bologna\n sandwiches, is not one bit sympathetic. He said Wednesday that\n he told all of the inmates:\n \n \n \"It's 120 degrees in Iraq!! ... and our soldiers are living in\n 'tents' too, and they have to wear 'full battle' gear, but they\n didn't commit any crimes..............\n \n EDIT: My apologies to the forum. The \"offensive\" language was contained within a quote of the sheriff and it was not my intent to tell anyone to shut up. He was telling the prisoners to shut up.",

   "i've watched several dateline-type shows on Sheriff Arpaio. I love it. I think the guy has the right idea. I just wish more of our prison systems had this same mind frame. I think unfortunately today, too many criminals see \"doing time\" as a joke... a place where they can get 3 meals a day and a shelter over their head. \n \n It doesn't matter to me whether its just exercise or not to the hardened criminals...its better than them lifting weights, playing basketball, or using there \"free time\" to get in trouble. I think they should all be put to work, repaying their debt to society....why shouldn't they have to make a contribution, instead of just being a leach? \n \n Not only does things happen, work accomplished, the community cleaned and fixed up, but it keeps them out of trouble...work all day doing manual labor and most are too tired to cause trouble at night. take away the things that make prison life easy...and then it becomes more of a deterant. Besides, its hard, regardless of which prison gang you belong to, to look intimidating in pink boxers and pink socks....\n \n I say while we got em, use em. We have a much more scaled down version of that here...they work in our colisium, cleaning and repairing things, do trash details, where they pick up trash and clean weeds out of stream beds, but thats about the extent of it...make em work on the prison farm, providing food for the prison, make break big rocks into gravel...make them want to not return. \n \n I like what he said about our troops...and they volunteered for that.

Pink underwear....again, national news....again, several interviews. More recently, Joe announced that he was going to clean up prostitution in the county.....he rounded up dozens of hookers and jailed them....within weeks, every single case with every single hooker was dropped by the DA's office....the reason, all of the sheriff's officers had broken the law during their investigation. They actually committed sex acts with the hookers they were investigating....and here's the best part....they all did it with sheriff Joe's approval!! He told them to do it! This isn't a big secret either, the DA and Joe both got on the news and flat out said he told the officers to do this. So, once again, the hooker round up was just another way for Joe to get more publicity.\n \n I have little to no respect for this sheriff.

The line deputies hate him.\n \n In regards to who he locks up, he locks up criminals.\n \n In regards to the rant about DUIs. More people are killed annually by alcohol related traffic accidents than are murdered. Hundreds of thousands are serioulsy injured. We need to lock up the drunks because they are more of a threat than gang bangers.",

There shouldn't be severe jail time for a DUI. The reason it's such a problem is they don't have good judgement when under the influence. If they are drunk, they probably won't think about the consequences of their actions. Even if we gave the death penalty for a DUI I think it wouldn't cut down on DUI's, drunks don't think before they act.",

There are certain statutory minimums carried with the offense. If the one poster's wife spent 10 days in the clink, it was either her second offense, or was extreme DUI, .15 BAC or greater.\n \n Most people on a first offense are required to do 24 hours in jail, which they typically serve on a weekend day. To give them a taste of no freedom, without infringing on them too severely.\n \n I have zero sympathy for drunks. Until you have to walk up to someone's door and tell them their loved one isn't ever coming home because of some drunk XXXXX it's hard for a lot of people to appreciate the scope of the issue.\n \n Although this is off topic of Sherriff Joe.",
