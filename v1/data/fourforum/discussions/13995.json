The US is the world's only superpower because we believe in individual freedom, not socialism. The US would implode if our taxes were 45% of GDP.\n \n Here's what I found on your healthcare system. Tell me if it's accurate.\n \n\n Health Care Around the World: Norway\n April 18, 2008 in Health Care Around the World, International Health Care Systems\n \n All Norwegians are insured by the National Insurance Scheme. This is a universal, tax-funded, single-payer health system. Compared to France, Italy, Spain and Japan, Norway has the most centralized system.\n \n Percent Insured. 100%. All Norwegian citizens and residents are covered.\n \n Funding. The National Insurance Scheme is funded by general tax revenues. There is no earmarked tax for health care. The Norwegian tax burden is 45% of GDP. The government sets a global budget limiting overall health expenditures and capital investment.\n \n Private Insurance. Norwegians can opt out of the the government system and pay out-of-pocket. Many pay out-of-pocket and travel to a foreign country for medical care when waiting lists are long.\n \n Physician Compensation. Hospital and nonhospital physicians generally are paid on a salaried basis. Some specialists can receive an annual grant and fee-for-service payments. Reimbursement rates, however, are set by the government and, unlike in France, the physician can not charge higher rates than the centrally-set reimbursement rate.\n \n Physician Choice. Patients choose general practitioners (GPs) from a government list. These GPs then act as gatekeepers for specialist services. Patients can only switch GPs twice per year and only if there is no waiting list for the requested GP.\n \n Copayment/Deductibles. There are no copayments for hospitals stays or drugs. There are small copayments for outpatient treatment.\n \n Waiting Times. There are significant waiting times for many procedures. Many Norwegians often go abroad for medical treatments. The average weight for a hip replacement is more than 4 months. \"Approximately 23 percent of all patients referred for hospital admission have to wait longer than three months for admission.\" Also, care can be denied if it is not deemed to be cost-effective.\n \n Benefits. Very generous. The program also provides sick pay. \"As Michael Moore has noted, the Norwegian system will even pay for 'spa treatments' in some cases.\"\n \n Tanner, Michael D. (2008) \"The Grass Is Not Always Greener: A Look at National Health Care Systems Around the World\" Cato Policy Analysis no. 613. \n Healthcare Economist Health Care Around the World: Norway \n",

Don't believe the leftwing UK rags. \n \n\n In the days since President Obama signed the farthest-reaching piece of social welfare legislation in four decades, overall public opinion has changed little, with continuing broad public skepticism about the effects of the new law and more than a quarter of Americans seeing neither side as making a good-faith effort to cooperate on the issue. \n \n Overall, 46 percent of those polled said they support the changes in the new law; 50 percent oppose them.

I don't believe that for a minute. Rasmussen is notorious for conservative bias in its issue based polling (i.e. where it can get away with it).\n\n \n Look at his track record. It speaks for itself.\n \n \n\n 3. Automation. Before the election, we publicly doubted and privately derided Rasmussen and SurveyUSA, which used recorded voices to read their poll questions. We rolled our eyes when they touted the virtues of uniformity and when they complained that live interviewers \"may not know how to read or speak the English language,\" could \"chew gum,\" or might \"just make up the answers to questions.\" It sounded to us like a rationalization for cutting costs.\n \n Look who's laughing now. Rasmussen and SurveyUSA beat most of their human competitors in the battleground states, often by large margins. \n \n Let's compare the automated surveys to the three biggest pollsters who used live interviewers in multiple battleground states. We'll grade each pollster on two measures: 1) how far its final numbers for Bush and Kerry varied from the official returns, and 2) how far the gap between its final numbers for Bush and Kerry varied from the gap shown in the official returns. For example, suppose a pollster had Bush winning a state 48 to 46 percent, but Bush actually won the state 50 to 47. By the first measure&#8212;let's call it the sum&#8212;the poll missed Bush's number by 2 and Kerry's by 1, for a total error of 3. By the second measure&#8212;let's call it the spread&#8212;the poll's 2-point lead for Bush missed the actual 3-point lead for Bush by a total error of 1.\n \n Start with the sum method. Rasmussen and Gallup overlapped in four battleground states: the big three (Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) plus Minnesota. In all four, Rasmussen beat Gallup. Rasmussen's average error in these states was 3.3 points compared to Gallup's 6.2. SurveyUSA overlapped with Gallup in the big three states plus Iowa. Again, the automated pollster whipped Gallup. SurveyUSA's average error was 3.5 points. Gallup's was 6.4.\n http://www.slate.com/id/2110860/ \n\n \n \n\n If you really want to know what people in America (there, I didn't say it) think, you can't find a smarter guy to ask than Scott Rasmussen, or a better place to look than his Rasmussen Reports, which takes America's vital signs &#8212; and then some &#8212; every day. The Drudge Report calls today's results \"The Love/Hate Divide,\" but what strikes me most in the numbers is how many people don't have a clue. The honest folks.\n http://www.creators.com/liberal/susan-estrich/the-confused-american.html \n\n \n And here's the latest:\n \n\n Daily Presidential Tracking Poll\n Monday, March 29, 2010 \n The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Monday shows that 30% of the nation's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President. Forty-four percent (44%) Strongly Disapprove giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -14 (see trends). \n \n New numbers released this morning show that 54% favor repeal of the recently passed health care plan. That&#8217;s virtually unchanged from a week ago. The data also shows that 50% now believe passage of the law was bad for the country. \n While many in official Washington consider the Tea Party movement to be a fringe element of society, voters across the nation feel closer to the Tea Party than to Congress. Voters also tend to see the Tea Party Members as better informed and more ethical than Congress. \n http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll \n",

It's not frozen in 1786 like some I could name with every step forward dragged out with blood and sweat.\n\n \n I love your revisionist history. I hope that you aren't a history teacher. \n Let's take a look at British territories that had abolished slavery \"long before it was abolished in the US\". \n Let's start with Kenya. \n \n\n In their colonial conquest, the British followed a policy of divide and conquer, allying with some African groups against others. The Masai, who had suffered a series of 19th-century civil wars over water and grazing rights and had lost much of their livestock to disease and drought, were one group with whom the British allied in order to impose their rule. To aid colonial administration, the British divided Kenya's Bantu-, Nilotic-, and Cushitic-speaking peoples into ethnic classifications based on linguistic variations and locality. Thus, specific ethnic subgroups, called \"tribes,\" were created in a form that had not existed previously. The ethnic groups were assigned to live in separate areas of the colony. Within each subgroup, colonial administrators designated one \"chief,\" who became responsible for collecting taxes levied by the colonial state.\n To help make the new railway profitable, the colonial government encouraged the settlement of European farmers in Kenya. After 1902 white Europeans (mostly from Britain and South Africa) took up residence in the highlands. Land for European settlement meant the loss of land for some of Kenya's peoples, most notably the highland-dwelling Kikuyu. Many of the Kikuyu who lost land were forced to move onto European farms and estates as squatters and laborers, or to seek employment in urban areas such as Nairobi. By the time World War I ended in 1918, European settlers, desiring inexpensive farm labor, had convinced the colonial government to adopt measures that essentially forced Africans to work the farms. These included new, higher taxes on Africans, who, lacking money, were obligated to work the settlers' farms in order to pay them. By this time, the settlers had achieved considerable political influence in the territory, which was changed to a colony and renamed Kenya in 1920. The colony of Kenya was administered by a British governor, who was advised by an elected Legislative Council. Black Africans were not allowed to vote and were denied representation in the council until the mid-1940s, when a small number of blacks were nominated to the council. The colony's small Asian and Arab populations were given several seats in the council in the 1920s.\n British Colonization - History - Kenya - Africa \n\n Although slavery was technically abolished, it was practiced in Kenya because everyone was forced to pay a high tax either with money or through forced labor. I'd call that slavery, wouldn't most civilized people? And blacks weren't given the vote in their own country of Kenya until the mid-1940's? When did blacks get the right to vote in the US? Hum, it appears that we aren't as uncivilized as you would have us believe. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Should I go on with examples of British \"civilization\" in Asia? How about India, for instance?

   "I love your revisionist history. I hope that you aren't a history teacher. \n Let's take a look at British territories that had abolished slavery \"long before it was abolished in the US\". \n Let's start with Kenya. \n \n Although slavery was technically abolished, it was practiced in Kenya because everyone was forced to pay a high tax either with money or through forced labor. I'd call that slavery, wouldn't most civilized people? And blacks weren't given the vote in their own country of Kenya until the mid-1940's? When did blacks get the right to vote in the US? Hum, it appears that we aren't as uncivilized as you would have us believe. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Should I go on with examples of British \"civilization\" in Asia? How about India, for instance? Your record of civilization there is well known.\n\n \n when did the Blacks get the right to sit at the front of the bus, when did the Blacks get the right to stay at any hotel or eat at any restaurant or join any club in the USA?\n \n Martin Luther King lived in the XIXth century right ?",

   "Realistically in the 60s with the passage of the civil rights act. A more directly relevant question is when did the Puerto Ricans get the vote? Oh, that's right, they still haven't. \n\n For a teacher, you aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer. Puerto Rico isn't our 51st state, so why would they get the right to vote in the US?\n \n\n Talk about revisionist history. Using economics to force people to work is called capitalism, I would have thought you would recognise it. Wage slavery still exists in every developed country. Will you join me in trying to stamp it out?\n\n \n What the UK did wasn't capitalism, it was Imperialism. They took control of a country, imposed its laws on them, forced them to pay a tax that they were incapable of paying and then forced them to work to pay that tax. That isn't capitalism.\n \n \nWe don't let our government deliberately kill people. We make sure all our citizens get healthcare. If you can't see that that's an improvement then there's something wrong.\n \n As it happens I don't really believe the UK is much better in general. There are a lot of things I despise about the way this country is run, but the NHS is one of the best things about this country. I also see in the US the worst elements of British society writ large.\n\n \n I can see how you would view freedom-loving Americans as \"the worst elements of British society\" because you're used to being subjugated under the thumb of elites. We shed that yoke centuries ago. \n \n \nI get the right treatment, when I need it, without having to worry about what is costs. I'm happy with that. If you look at people who have actually used the NHS you find that levels of satisfaction are very high. How many Americans are happy with their healthcare provision? \n\n \n The majority are. That's why THE MAJORITY opposed this new travesty. Are there portions of our existing system that need fixing? Most definitely. But I'm sure there are many things that Brits would like see changed with yours as well.\n \n\n Providing basic healthcare for the entire world would not in itself be that expensive. Cuba has demonstrated that a pretty good budget system can be provided on $500 per head. That's about 3 trillion a year to get Cuban levels of healthcare for everyone in the world, from a GWP of around 70 trillion. We're talking less than 5% of the world's income to provide basic healthcare everywhere in the world.\n\n You've got to be kidding?! You want to hold Cuba up as an example of anything positive? It's one of the most poverty-ridden oppressive dictatorships in the world. You know what they call rich Cubans? Floridians.\n \n \nBush placed a heavy debt on generations to come for invading Iraq at the behest of the oily oil companies and the bill is still growing and growing not only in Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Pakistan \n \n Health cover is money well spent.\n\n \n The cost of the war against terror is chump change compared to the money spent on social engineering programs by the Left. LBJ's War on Poverty, for instance, has cost more than 7X what we've spent in the ME. \n \n \nwhen did the Blacks get the right to sit at the front of the bus, when did the Blacks get the right to stay at any hotel or eat at any restaurant or join any club in the USA?\n \n Martin Luther King lived in the XIXth century right ?\n\n \n Blacks in everywhere but the deep south enjoyed the same freedoms that whites had since the Civil War. MLK wasn't marching in Philadelphia, New York and Chicago. There was no need to. Maybe you should have paid attention to American History a little better and not been such a Pinochet cheerleader.",

I wonder what Jo's response to this is:\n \n\n In it, Mrs Brickell tells a reporter: \"I feel that the National Health Service has let me down because I feel that if I had had a smear test when I had asked for one originally I wouldn't have gone through everything that I have been through now and I feel that them raising the age limit has pretty much signed my death warrant.\"\n \n Yesterday she said she did not have any regrets about her comments: \"I would not like to have to rely solely on the NHS. I honestly do not think that I would still be here today if I had not had private healthcare. On the other hand, I would not have been able to afford that if it weren't for my employer's insurance,\" she said. \"I agreed to contribute to the debate. It is simply my own experience. I gave an interview and everything I said was truthful and subjective. I knew what their intention was when I did the interview and I was quite willing to be used as an example as to how the system doesn't always work.\"\n \n She said she was now in remission but feared the cancer could still return. \"I have had three clear scans in a row. The NHS staff do a wonderful job. But I would say to anybody in my situation now that if they had the money, they should go private.\n \"It is the Government which sets out the guidelines, not the nurses and the doctors on the front line,\" she said.\n \n 'The NHS pretty much signed my death warrant' - Health News, Health & Families - The Independent \n",

The US didn't send Americans into PR to run the government and exploit its natives, the UK did in Kenya.
