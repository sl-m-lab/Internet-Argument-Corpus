   "I still don't see why the officials of European Commission cannot take into consideration that the newly admitted EU members taking US support, make attempts to meddle into European politics and change the rules to the derogation of the Old Europe.\n \n The problem is that every other new EU member-state demands for its representatives to be not merely Commission middle headers but to occupy high offices (chief executive officer or assistant). Especially those in Poland are dissatisfied at being represented in EU by a too small number of higher officials.\n \n As for experienced Brussels headers, they are deeply surprised that the newcomers are misinformed about the advantage having representatives in the EU higher offices - as if it shall give more chances to defend concerns of the represented country.\n \n Though there is an element of truth there. But if one apprehends the situation from a wider angle of view, he will see it is nothing but clouded plan of Americans to weaken European Union operating from the inside. Not a single newcoming member-state would care even to ask for something - not to speak of demanding - but for they feel safe with the support of the US. All the world knows that belonging to this or that nation or even proficiency of an official makes absolutely no difference in the matter of occupying offices in European Commission. The only point to take into account is work experience and knowing of Young Europe representatives the specific characters of the sphere in the matter of all-European level",
