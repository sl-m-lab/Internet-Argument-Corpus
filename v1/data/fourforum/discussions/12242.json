NCAA Schedule of Revenue and Expenses are generally audited (probably by the state if it is a state school) and you can view them online to make sure. This is required by the NCAA! There should be a line item that says \"Direct State or other government support\" or similar if they are getting this kind of funding (normally 0). The revenue is normally ticket sales.\n \n This would save the school nothing and probably would cost the school since many schools rely on athletics to get donations and develop a loyal alumni base.\n \n I thought about giving you grief about this but this is a normal and understandable mistake on your part. Now you know.\n \n EDIT: I think you are in Michigan. I briefly looked at a 2005 NCAA Schedule for Univ of Michigan and they had $0 as government support, $31 million ticket sales, $16 million donations, $10.6 NCAA distrubutions, and $9.7 million in advertising revenue. Those were the most significant.",

I'm not sure that taxing internet sales has the same effect, though yeah, I guess most of them are already taxed.",
