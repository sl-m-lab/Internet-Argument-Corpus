   "I wonder if this will go down in the history books.\n \n Atlanta is likely not the only place that suffers from such misfit policemen. Overall, ours are top-notch, but every now and then a story hits about the drug-store-cowboy effect that a blue uniform has when some dicks put it on.\n \n Not too many weeks ago, an elderly lady was thown to the ground at the airport, after a parking violation. Just a few weeks ago, the narcs made a huge mistake and killed a totally innocent, aged lady who shot at (and hit) the plain-clothed undercover agents as they stormed her house with a mistaken \"no knock\" warrant to search for drugs that the police lied about obtaining there.\n \n Now we suffer international embarassment (well deserved) for wrestling a jaywalker (a historian from the UK, here on a historian convention stay) to the ground, cuffing him, holding him for eight hours and finally dropping the charges after the man refused to plead nolo contendre.\n \n How much of this kind of XXXX goes on in your area. Do your policemen appear to be more suited to work the Jerry Springer Show or repossess vehicles than to protect you from real criminals?\n \n \n \n \n http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/33779.html\n \n To be fair, let me say that the location of the transgression was at a notoriously unsafe, six-lane street. (That is the ONLY redeeming factor for the overly zealous cop.)",

   "Without question Jim, Atlanta has the most incompetent police force in the history of the U.S.. \n The result of course, of incompetent city management. \n Atlanta is the only place that would name a stretch of highway after a living, incompetent, embarrassing congressperson such Cynthia McKinney. \n But, somehow, among the clutter, it remains one of our most beautiful cities.",
