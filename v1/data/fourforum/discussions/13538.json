   "Judge: Mich. man can sue store he robbed\n The robber was shot twice and claims he was excessively beaten\n AP\n updated 11:46 a.m. ET, Wed., Nov . 4, 2009\n \n MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. - A Michigan judge says a man who claims he was chased, shot and beaten by workers at a store he'd just robbed can sue the men. But only if he comes up with $10,000 within two weeks.\n \n Scott T. Zielinski is serving an 8-year prison sentence after being convicted of unarmed robbery for the November 2007 heist at Nick's Party Stop in Clinton Township.\n \n The 23-year-old filed a lawsuit against the store, its owner and three employees in April. Zielinski was shot twice and claims he was excessively beaten.\n \n Circuit Judge David Viviano ruled this week that although Zielinski is indigent and imprisoned, he must post a $10,000 bond to cover the store and employees' attorneys fees if he loses the case.\n \n Zielinski is seeking $125,000.\n \n Coroborate this eh slim jim!\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33617028/",
