It would indeed be very hard for someone like bmittking to predict who will turn out to be worthy of being allowed to live and those who are not fit to have been born in the first place. I think we can be sure, though, that the advocates of bmittking's position without exception would themselves fit into the category of being worthy to live. \n \n \nAbortion is a bad thing but to say a woman has the right to do with her body what she wants is a weak arguement\n\n Agree 100%.\n \n \nbecause that in and of itself means prostitution would be legalized.\n\n This is not the reason why I agree above. For instance, if prostitution were to be legalized, would this change your belief that the argument that \"a woman has the right to do with her body what she wants\" is weak?\n \n \nHowever,we can not \"legally\" force women to have the child.\n\n If by \"legally force\" you mean that we could ensure that every pregnant woman would be guaranteed to give birth to the child, then no. But, if by \"legally force\" you mean institute laws outlawing abortion, then we most certainly can.\n \n \nIt is not a life until it is born.\n\n Oh really? Then what is it?\n \n \nIf it was a life at conception why doesn't anyone start doing the paperwork for social security numbers for the child at conception?\n\n I suppose anyone without a social security number is just out of luck. I mean, people residing in Africa don't start doing paperwork for social security numbers ever. Therefore, those things residing in Africa most cerainly can not be human lives.\n \n \nWhy does our drivers license refer to the date of birth and not conception?\n\n \"I'm sorry sir, you don't have a driver's license. I guess we can't tell if you're a human life or not.\"\n \n \nThe thing I do not like about abortion is that it is being used as a contraception or revenge on a loved one or even just a controling factor.\n\n The thing I don't like about abortion is that it is the willful and intentional killing of an innocent human being.

So what if it is only being used to get revenge on a loved one? So what if it is only being used as a controlling factor?\n \n \nA man has an obligation to pay for the child when it is born.\n\n Let me get this straight. We can't force a woman to give birth if she doesn't want the child, but we can force the father to pay for the child's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not? Interesting.\n \n \nHe also has the obligation to pay for her care while pregnant.\n\n What if he didn't want her to be pregnant?\n \n \nWith great rights comes great responsibilities.\n\n Far be it from me to make the following bold statement: abortion is not a great right. Also, responsibilty is a foreign concept to today's self-centered society.\n \n \nI must admit this debate there really is no good outcome.\n\n Sure there is. The good outcome would be the one that outlawed the willful killing of an innocent human being.\n \n \nIf abortion is outlawed what about the child born that needs major medical care for the rest of their lives?\n\n What about the healthy child that is allowed to be born who doesn't need any major medical care except for the last 10-15 years of their life?

If it were not the case, then there would be no religious argument justifying opposition to abortion. If the fetus is not a human life, then it is nothing more than a haphazard gathering of insignificant cells, much like the appendix is. In the same way there is no moral grounds for opposing the removal of a human appendix, there would be no moral grounds for opposing abortion if the fetus is not a living human.\n \nThere is no reason to oppose gambling,but people do.\n\n There certainly are legitimate reasons to oppose gambling.\n \nThere is no reason to oppose sex,but people do.\n\n I think you've made a bit of a sweeping generalization here. I haven't heard of many people opposing sex altogether. I have heard of people who oppose both sex before marriage and sex outside of marriage.\n \nThere is no reason to oppose drinking but people do. And I am not talking drinking and driving or having sex with a disease like aids.\n\n Some people do, and perhaps on religious grounds. All I'm saying is that opposition to abortion has to be rooted in the fundamental proposition that the fetus is uniquely different from any other entity in the human body. That difference has to be that the fetus is a living human, or else there is no reason to oppose it's removal from the womb.\n \n \nYes because it is \"officially\" a life.\n\n I fail to see how it is possible that something that wasn't a living human 1 millisecond prior to birth instantly becomes a living human 1 millisecond after birth.\n \nIf she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.\n If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.\n\n I think according to your logic that the man ought to have the right to force the woman to have an abortion. If abortion is a legitimate means for her to rid herself of the responsibilities of parenthood, then abortion is likewise a legitimate means for a man who desires to rid himself of the responsibilities of parenthood. You have failed to show why this isn't the case. You have merely made a statement unsupported by any reasons.\n \n \nHave you ever stepped on an ant?\n That is a life form\n Squashed a spider,Eaten a chicken,wear leather?\n And to say a fetus is a life how can you eat eggs?\n A fetus becomes a baby the baby becomes a adult and the adult becomes the elderly.\n A chickens egg becomes a chicken or breakfast.\n Why not defend the egg?\n We kill animals for luxury of their skin (leather)\n Not to keep warm but for the look and feel only.\n If life is that important that we dictate it is at conception why not defend all life.

There is a fundamental difference between human beings and the rest of the natural order which can be best expounded by the following proposition: \n \n \nWe hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n",

If it were not the case, then there would be no religious argument justifying opposition to abortion. If the fetus is not a human life, then it is nothing more than a haphazard gathering of insignificant cells, much like the appendix is. In the same way there is no moral grounds for opposing the removal of a human appendix, there would be no moral grounds for opposing abortion if the fetus is not a living human.\n \n There certainly are legitimate reasons to oppose gambling.\n \n I think you've made a bit of a sweeping generalization here. I haven't heard of many people opposing sex altogether. I have heard of people who oppose both sex before marriage and sex outside of marriage.\n \n Some people do, and perhaps on religious grounds. All I'm saying is that opposition to abortion has to be rooted in the fundamental proposition that the fetus is uniquely different from any other entity in the human body. That difference has to be that the fetus is a living human, or else there is no reason to oppose it's removal from the womb.\n \n \n I fail to see how it is possible that something that wasn't a living human 1 millisecond prior to birth instantly becomes a living human 1 millisecond after birth.\n \n I think according to your logic that the man ought to have the right to force the woman to have an abortion. If abortion is a legitimate means for her to rid herself of the responsibilities of parenthood, then abortion is likewise a legitimate means for a man who desires to rid himself of the responsibilities of parenthood. You have failed to show why this isn't the case. You have merely made a statement unsupported by any reasons.\n \n \n The fetus is a human being, the chicken egg is not. There is a fundamental difference between human beings and the rest of the natural order which can be best expounded by the following proposition:\n\n \n This will be alot shorter.\n I treat life as life and fetus as fetus I do not see a need to treat human life as better than non human life.\n So you are implying that life is only sacred when it is human.\n This God you seem to follow must have put animals here for our amusement.\n My belief tells me abortion is wrong.\n But (and I can not state this enough) why should \"my belief\" be forced onto others?\n As long as no law is broken it is fine.\n If people want to change the laws fine.\n Just don't cry when others want to change the laws against something you believe in.",

No person does or may own her, which is inconsistent with the position that she may own a person.\n \n 5). So the owning of a person is slavery? Then a pregnant woman, if she owns the developing child, is a slave owner. I'm glad you cleared that up.\n \n 6). Not excactly what I was talking about. What I was talking about was action induced by one party on another party so as to bring about that person's death. Granted, what happened to Terri Schiavo was euthanasia. But, she was only allowed to be killed because of a legal technicality. However, you may wish to ask \"Dr.\" Jack Kevorkian whether euthanasia is permissable or not. In his circumstance, he did what his \"patients\" asked him to do, that is, perform an action that would willingly and knowingly bring about their death. And in a jail he sits, even though the people he killed consented to being killed. You may not euthanize people in the United States.\n \n 7). This is a bit different from setting a trap that breaks the neck of an animal. Let's expound, shall we?\n \n Frank comes home one day to find that Speedy, a little mouse, has moved in to his house. Frank politely asks little Speedy to immediately leave. Speedy respectfully declines. Frank again asks little Speedy to leave. Speedy again declines. So Frank, disgusted by Speedy's refusal to leave his property, lays down a little mouse trap for Speedy. The next day, Frank checks the trap only to find that Speedy was dead underneath it, his little fragile neck being broken.\n \n Now, suppose we change the scenario and insert Speedster, a human being into the picture. Frank comes home one day to find that Speedster has moved into his house. Frank politely asks Speedster to leave immediately. Speedster respectfully declines. Frank again asks Speedster to leave. Speedster again declines. So Frank, disgusted by Speedster's refusal to leave his property, grabs Speedster in a headlock and snaps his neck, causing him to die.\n \n Now, it is blatantly obvious that in the first scenario, Frank has done nothing illegal. And it is just as clear that in the second scenario, Frank has committed murder. To deny that we treat animals differently than we do humans (looking at law is only one of a few ways of doing this) is simply to ignore reality, putting one's own little spin on it in order to justify an indefensible position.\n \n 8). And if all that wasn't enough, you may purchase a license that allows you to hunt animals for any reason. That is, you can pay money to receive a license to kill animals as a hobby if you like. Hunting animals is a legitimate sport, but hunting humans would carry with it a sentence of death in many states.\n \n \n[1] Why should I or anyone else be forced to say why they believe the way they do if they know it will be used for someone elses case by twisting the meaning. [2] I.E. forcing morals off on others.\n\n 1). No one is forcing you to do anything. But, I do not suppose this is the real reason why you won't say why because no reasonable person on these forums would ever think they could be forced to post anything.\n \n 2). What the heck? No reasonable person would suppose that one person can force another to believe anything merely by and through posting on these forums. However, it may turn out that if you were to post why you believe something, it may be challenged, and this I suppose is why you won't disclose why you believe abortion is wrong.\n \n \n[1] Murder is wrong yes unless it is for the greater good.\n Killing child molestors,murderers,etc..\n [2] Plus that is a loaded question. If I believe murder is wrong it is forcing a belief If I believe it is not wrong it is still forcing a belief.\n [3] You are just looking for a simple win.\n\n 1). Better not force this belief onto anyone.\n \n 2). No, it's not a loaded question. You would not be forcing your belief onto anyone unless you sought to try an force them to abide by your belief. For someone to be consistent when they say \"we shouldn't force our own personal beliefs onto others\" they would have to say that we shouldn't force other people to abide by our belief about murder.\n \n 3). No, I simply pointed out an obvious contradiction in how your practice aligns with your principle. It is not the case that you think that people shouldn't have other's beliefs forced onto them. You only use that argument when it suits your purposes\n \n \nJudges should be bound by law not make them\n\n Exactly, judges should not be able to invent new rights - like a right to abortion for example.\n \n \nWhich Gods?\n Bush? Reagan? Larry? Mo? Curley? Wapner? Dr. Phil? or Oprah?\n\n No, Supreme Court judges.",

   "1). Oh really? May I purchase a ward of the state for my own purposes? May they auction those persons off? Even wards of the state are not owned in the same sense that property is owned.\n \n 2). Obviously.\n\n \n If a pregnant woman owns the fetus/baby/little person/future tax payer that would mean she owns it until it dies.\n Or until she sells it or throws it out or gives it its freedom which implies slavery.\n \n \n\n 3). No, the destruction of a person is not the destruction of property, it is the destruction of a person. I was making the point that the only people who are allowed to own persons is pregnant women, that is, they can do whatever they wish to do with another person whereas no other body of people may do so.\n\n \n But if you own the person it renders the person the same as property.\n Unless you consider the fetus NOT a person YET then you are right.\n Pregnant women do not own persons at all.\n Owning a person in any state of birth or life is slavery if the fetus is deemed a person.\n And if she can do with it as she pleases that includes abortion.\n \n \n\n 4). No person does or may own her, which is inconsistent with the position that she may own a person.\n \n 5). So the owning of a person is slavery? Then a pregnant woman, if she owns the developing child, is a slave owner. I'm glad you cleared that up.\n \n 6). Not excactly what I was talking about. What I was talking about was action induced by one party on another party so as to bring about that person's death. Granted, what happened to Terri Schiavo was euthanasia. But, she was only allowed to be killed because of a legal technicality. However, you may wish to ask \"Dr.\" Jack Kevorkian whether euthanasia is permissable or not. In his circumstance, he did what his \"patients\" asked him to do, that is, perform an action that would willingly and knowingly bring about their death. And in a jail he sits, even though the people he killed consented to being killed. You may not euthanize people in the United States.\n\n \n And a boy beat his girlfriend with a baseball bat in the same state as jack kevorkian in order to abort the fetus causing the girlfriend (under age at conception) great physical harm and no charges were filed because she requested him to do that so it wasn't assault and they missed the fact he had sex with an underage girl.\n Each case is different because the judges are not following the spirit of the laws unless they want to at that moment.\n But if abortion is illegal women will give up all rights because if she smokes she can be locked up same goes if she drinks or parties too much.\n \n \n \n\n 7). This is a bit different from setting a trap that breaks the neck of an animal. Let's expound, shall we?\n \n Frank comes home one day to find that Speedy, a little mouse, has moved in to his house. Frank politely asks little Speedy to immediately leave. Speedy respectfully declines. Frank again asks little Speedy to leave. Speedy again declines. So Frank, disgusted by Speedy's refusal to leave his property, lays down a little mouse trap for Speedy. The next day, Frank checks the trap only to find that Speedy was dead underneath it, his little fragile neck being broken.\n \n Now, suppose we change the scenario and insert Speedster, a human being into the picture. Frank comes home one day to find that Speedster has moved into his house. Frank politely asks Speedster to leave immediately. Speedster respectfully declines. Frank again asks Speedster to leave. Speedster again declines. So Frank, disgusted by Speedster's refusal to leave his property, grabs Speedster in a headlock and snaps his neck, causing him to die.\n\n \n But if Speedster broke in and Frank felt threatened it would be justifyable self defense as long as Frand can show he thought Speedster would harm him.\n \n \n\n Now, it is blatantly obvious that in the first scenario, Frank has done nothing illegal. And it is just as clear that in the second scenario, Frank has committed murder. To deny that we treat animals differently than we do humans (looking at law is only one of a few ways of doing this) is simply to ignore reality, putting one's own little spin on it in order to justify an indefensible position.\n \n 8). And if all that wasn't enough, you may purchase a license that allows you to hunt animals for any reason. That is, you can pay money to receive a license to kill animals as a hobby if you like. Hunting animals is a legitimate sport, but hunting humans would carry with it a sentence of death in many states.\n \n \n 1). No one is forcing you to do anything. But, I do not suppose this is the real reason why you won't say why because no reasonable person on these forums would ever think they could be forced to post anything.\n\n \n I believe that abortion is wrong because of my religious upbringing plus I do not want to see anyone not have the child that will be born.\n But I do not feel the need to force this belief on others.\n \n \n 2). What the heck? No reasonable person would suppose that one person can force another to believe anything merely by and through posting on these forums. However, it may turn out that if you were to post why you believe something, it may be challenged, and this I suppose is why you won't disclose why you believe abortion is wrong.[/QUOTE]\n \n I don't mind challenge.\n In fact I love it.\n But it is when the extremely wrong idea is thought of as being my idea when that is not what I intend.\n For example when a person fights for the rights of strip clubs those people are assumed to be into child porn or regular porn and that might not be the case.\n In fact alot of people seem to think it is wrong to go to strip clubs but it is ok to get a woman drunk and take advantage of the situation but I feel the opposite way and that is seen as perverted but it is not.\n \n \n\n 1).
