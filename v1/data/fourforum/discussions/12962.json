   "How long the wait? In addition to the long wait just to get a decent health care plan through Congress, period? (Where these industry ghouls have been jacking us around since the Clinton administration. Even longer, if you consider what Harry Truman wanted to do right from the get-go.)\n \n For contrary to the myth the insurance industry likes to generate, people in America wait much longer for healthcare, on the average, whether it's for normal appointments with doctors (taking months to get in, at times) or the emergency room itself, where more and more are headed, and many can simply die on the floor, bleed to death, etc. Then there's the issue as to whether or not we get care at all, as the studies have already shown that, in the last 5 years, 105,000 people per year have died for lack of that care that's run-of-the-mill accepted practice in the rest of civilized (and even not-so-civilized globe).\n \n We are fast becoming the least civilized. \n \n As Americans well know by now (or should), plenty of countries are getting healthcare right (except us). But out of all the countries we should be emulating, which one is best to emulate for us? In this Boston Globe article recommended by Paul Krugman, the author looks particularly at the French and Dutch because of some insurance parallels. \n \n Good photo, btw, of the long wait in the emergency room at the Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, which gets 60,000 patients per year.\n \n ---------------\n \n (article excerpt)\n \n You could be forgiven for assuming, as Kyl and his allies suggest, that so much government control leads to Soviet-style rationing, with people waiting in long lines and clawing their way through mind-numbing bureaucracies every time they have a sore throat. But, in general, both the Dutch and French appear to have easy access to basic medical care - easier access, in fact, than is the American norm.\n \n In both the Netherlands and France, most people have long-standing relationships with their primary care doctors. And when they need to see these doctors, they do so without delay or hassle. In a 2008 survey of adults with chronic disease conducted by the Commonwealth Fund - a foundation which financed my own research abroad - 60 percent of Dutch patients and 42 percent of French patients could get same-day appointments. The figure in the US was just 26 percent.\n \n The contrast with after-hours care is even more striking. If you live in either Amsterdam or Paris, and get sick after your family physician has gone home, a phone call will typically get you an immediate medical consultation - or even, if necessary, a house call. And if you need the sort of attention available only at a formal medical facility, you can get that, too - without the long waits typical in US emergency rooms.\n \n This is particularly true in the Netherlands, thanks to a nationwide network of urgent care centers the government and medical societies have put in place. Not only do these centers provide easily accessible care for people who use them; they leave hospital emergency rooms free to concentrate on the truly serious cases. Tellingly, a Dutch physician I met complained to me that waiting times in her emergency room had been getting &#8220;too long&#8221; lately. &#8220;Too long,&#8221; she went on to tell me, meant two or three hours. When I told her about documented cases of people waiting a day, or even days, for treatment in some American emergency rooms, she thought I was joking. (In a 2007 Commonwealth Fund survey, just 9 percent of Dutch patients reported waiting more than two hours for care in an ER, compared to 31 percent of Americans.)\n \n Healthy examples: Plenty of countries get healthcare right - The Boston Globe\n \n -------------------------\n \n Personally, the U.K. system appeals to me most, and I think we should simply pass H.R. 676, and impervious to their tears, let the health insurance industry fend for itself without the Nanny State. (Set them free, let them be responsible for themselves, in the true spirit of capitalism. I'm sure their people won't bleed to death on any waiting room floors.) 3% out of your pay, matched by an employer, you get a national card, pick your doctor, go in when you need care, without paying. It would also cover basics like dental and periodontal, where we now place, not 37th, but 3rd world conditions, according to professionals in that segment (where the mind/body split took us).\n \n But .. I ain't gonna be fussy if we can do anything close to either of these nations. Which civilized world models do people like best? France? England? Netherlands? Sweden? Denmark? Canada? Norway? Germany? Others?\n \n (Any but ours, of course!)\n \n Discuss.",

The other point is that if I were on a low income, over 60, under 18 or living in Scotland or Wales I wouldn't even have to pay prescription charges. In any case taxation is a lot cheaper than private insurance, as the public system is far more efficient (90%+ bed occupancy vs less than 50%, to give one example).

When he was in enough pain to see a doctor, it was too late. He left a wife and two teenage sons in the prime of his life at 50 years old. The attending doctor said that if he had only sought treatment earlier he would still be alive.\"\n \n A woman in Eagle, Idaho, wrote of \"a beautiful, intelligent, hard working small business owner who died because she couldn't afford to buy health insurance for her family nor her employees. She was 53 and I will never forgive my county for allowing the greed of the insurance companies to limit her opportunity for preventable health care. A colonoscopy at 50 would have saved her life.\"\n \n A link to the booklet is available at the linked article by Bernie.

   "Amy Goodman has written an article on whistle blower, Wendell Potter, the former CIGNA VP Bill Moyers interviewed in the show earlier linked. http://www.4forums.com/political/health-debates/12962-long-wait-america-2.html#post360370 She says whistle blowers like him are their worst nightmare; he says their worst nightmare is single payer, and secondly, a public option. \n \n Doubtless, a close call between all three. \n \n YouTube - Judas Priest - Living Bad Dreams\n \n emoticon_cry \n \n Here is an excerpt from the Amy Goodman article:\n \n -----------------\n \n Insurance executives and their Wall Street investors are addicted to massive profits and double-digit annual rate increases. To squeeze more profit, Potter says, if a person makes a major claim for coverage, the insurer will often scrutinize the person's original application, looking for any error that would allow it to cancel the policy. Likewise, if a small company's employees make too many claims, the insurer, Potter says, \"very likely will jack up the rates so much that your employer has no alternative but to leave you and your co-workers without insurance.\"\n \n This week, as the House and Senate introduce their health care bills, Potter warns, \"One thing to remember is that the health insurance industry has been anticipating this debate on health care for many years ... they've been positioning themselves to get very close to influential members of Congress in both parties.\" Montana Sen. Max Baucus chairs the Senate Finance Committee, key for health care reform. Potter went on, \"[T]he insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry and others in health care have donated ... millions of dollars to his campaigns over the past few years. But aside from money, it's relationships that count ... the insurance industry has hired scores and scores of lobbyists, many of whom have worked for members of Congress, and some who are former members of Congress.\"\n \n The insurance industry and other health care interests are lobbying hard against a government-sponsored, nonprofit, public health insurance option, and are spending, according to The Washington Post, up to $1.4 million per day to sway Congress and public opinion.\n \n Don't be fooled. Profit-driven insurance claim denials actually kill people, and Wendell Potter knows where the bodies are buried. His whistle-blowing may be just what's needed to dump what's sick in our health care system.\n \n (full article at link)\n \n Health Insurance Whistle-Blower Knows Where the Bodies Are Buried | CommonDreams.org\n \n ---------------\n \n Yep, that's 1.4 million dollars per day, folks, to control our so-called representatives, hide the buried bodies and try to scare us with a lot of b.s.\n \n I have to say, however, that this is one campaign ITO of P.R., at least, the dogs ain't winning. Given what public sentiments have been shown to prevail.\n \n 65% of the public wants their bad bad dreams to come true, and 59% of American doctors. With 75% weighing in for their *lesser* nightmare of a public option.\n \n Because we also know where the bodies are buried.",

It looks all too possible.\n \n What&#8217;s especially galling is the hypocrisy of their claimed reason for delaying progress &#8212; concern about the fiscal burden. After all, in the past most of them have shown no concern at all for the nation&#8217;s long-term fiscal outlook.\n \n Case in point: the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which denied Medicare the right to bargain for lower drug prices, locked in overpayments to private insurance companies, and did nothing, nothing at all, to pay for its proposed outlays. How many of these six self-proclaimed defenders of solvency voted no on the crucial procedural vote? One. (Joe Lieberman, to my surprise.)\n \n And let&#8217;s not forget that Ben Nelson, who appears to be the ringleader, has fought tooth and nail against competition from a public option &#8212; which would almost certainly save a significant amount of money, as well as providing much-needed competition.\n \n If the Gang of Six really does kill reform, remember their names; they will bear the responsibility for vast, unnecessary suffering over the years to come.\n \n ---------------------\n \n One thing I especially like about this piece is his point on the lukewarm middle. Those who love to say they're \"moderates\". When they're really the grand saboteurs of any social, economic or political progress.\n \n I still say, along with some others on the web, that every single member of Congress --- starting with, especially these six -- should sign off on their luscious taxpayer supported healthcare benefits, for themselves and every member of their family, until they get the job done.\n \n If they think we can wait, then I think they can wait.",

When you try to be your own advocate, they do everything they can to undermine your credibility. They deluge you with multiple appointments that you can't keep, especially with the cost of gas. You get multiple doctors telling you different things and you don't know who to follow. Then they become accusitory of one thing or another. They take NO responsibility for messing us Vets up (and they mess up alot!). Please stay away from them if you can! If you can't....document EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I can prove what I'm saying here. BEWARE......GWN\n\n \n \n \n \n \nI was seen by the doctors at Portsmouth Naval Hosiptal in Virginia. It was determed that I needed hearing aids in both my ears. The hospital doctor told me that I should go to the VA Hospital because there I could receive my hearing aids at no cost to me. I am a Viet-Nam Verteran (1968) and I also am medically retired from the Army with a 50% disability at the time and still to this day, except the civilian side now has made me 100% disabled. Unable to work. I have a VA Hospital ID card from the VA hospital here in Hampton Virginia and have also been treated by them years ago. But now on this trip to the VA for my hearing aids the VA Hospital said I could no longer have any service from them? The reason they gave me was because my disabilityt comes straight from the Department fo the Army and not from the VA Hospital that I can no longer be seen by them????\n Is this rediculous or what? I need to find out the truth from someone? It didn't seem to bother them to pay for my service years ago when I saw them, But now it appears to have changed somehow. Either way I can't get a truthful answer from anyone here in this military town. Can anyone point me in the right direction??????\n \n SFC, USA Retired and Disabled Vet.\n\n \n There's plenty more there if you're interested.\n \n VA Hospital Horror Story - Topic Powered by Eve For Enterprise\n \n \n Or how about the quality of care once you DO get seen.....\n \n \nSoon after, the N.R.C. sent its own inspectors to Philadelphia. And the more the inspectors looked, the more they found. All told, 57 of the implants delivered too little radiation to the prostate, either because the seeds missed the prostate or were not distributed properly inside the prostate. Thirty-five other cases involved overdoses to other parts of the body. An unspecified number of patients were both underdosed in the prostate and overdosed elsewhere.\n \n From December 2006 to November 2007, the nuclear commission found, 16 patients received seed implants in Philadelphia even though computer interface problems prevented medical personnel from determining whether those treatments had been successful. The V.A.'s radiation officials knew of the problem but took no action, the nuclear commission charges. \n\n \n Free Internet Press :: V.A.

   "\"money can buy\" is the key phrase. Most people, including most Americans, have nothing like the resources required to retain the services of the best medical personnel. And actually most Britons who choose not to use the NHS will choose private services in the UK, continential europe or in India. The US is an unusual destination. There is no point in having the best doctors in the world if hardly anyone can afford their prices. Other countries provide an excellent service to their entire population. If this comes at the expense of a tiny minority of extremely wealthy people dying a little earlier I think on balance it's a price worth paying. It's like asking why so many people by a Fiat when people from all over the world flock to buy a Bentley or a Rolls Royce. The fiat may not look as pretty or be quite as comfortable, but it is cheaper, more efficient, and ultimately does the job just as well.\n\n \n Now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? But, I'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nGo to your evil W.H.O. Archangel and do your own homework for a change. So many people, including the health insurance industry, especially, have known these rankings and what they're based on (infant mortality rates, life expectancy, etc.), for years, now, that I'm not even going to humor what is quite evidently both of your deliberate and dishonestly employed ignorance of the matter.\n \n Explain this, for me, Archangel. How do you even consider yourself a Christian when you don't support healthcare reform in the United States and 105,000 of your fellow Americans have died each year for the last five years? While 50 million are uninsured, an additional 50 million have insufficient coverage? How do you even consider yourself an American? How do you salute an American flag and sleep at night?\n \n Do you think Jesus of Nazareth, as imaginedly or really described, would have taken your heartless and dishonest position?\n \n On the side of the health insurance industry and their Congressional whores?\n \n And opposite 65-75% of the good and decent American people and the majority of the medical profession who can't even practice medicine anymore under this system?\n \n You're not a Christian, or, you're exactly what \"Christians\" have become in America. Meaning I sure as Hades wouldn't want to be one! And I don't think Jesus would either!\n\n \n When logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right?\n \n \nArchangel cares more about what rich foreigners can buy than his fellow Americans standing on line for the cattle stalls in Wise, Virginia.\n \n How do you salute an American flag and sleep comfortably at night Archangel?\n \n Who or what do you really worship and pray to?\n\n \n And the ad hominen continues.....\n \n \nWhy would the American government be peculiarly incompetent, as compared to France or Sweden, for example?\n\n \n We're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need I go on?\n \n \nTwo things in the U.S. I can say here.

The text of the bill in question, as well the Senate version, in separate posts. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/health-debates/12962-long-wait-america-4.html?#post361293\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/health-debates/12962-long-wait-america-4.html?#post361311\n \n I say this mainly because it's not \"government\" healthcare, in the sense that I understand you as referencing:\n \n ------------------\n \n {excerpt}\n \n To begin with, it is NOT &#8220;Socialized Medicine&#8221;, far from it in fact. Also, it does not mean that our medical system will be taken over by the government and run like the post office as many of our opposition friends would mistakenly have you believe.\n \n Basically, House Resolution (H.R.) 676, the &#8220;New Expanded Medicare&#8221; bill now in the House of Representatives simply creates a new and far more functional &#8220;single payer&#8221; method of collecting and distributing payments for medical services while leaving the medical system itself completely alone and intact. This will eliminate the hundreds of complicated and redundant payment plans currently imposed on the system by private &#8220;for profit&#8221; health insurance companies and save literally BILLIONS of dollars every year by eliminating such wasteful duplication. This will allow your doctors offices and hospitals to function much more efficiently and serve your needs much more effectively as well. Just imagine what a huge benefit this will be!\n \n Taxes: We all know that nothing of any real value is ever free, but if you think of the taxes that will be required to support national health insurance as simply a lower cost alternative to the staggering private health insurance premiums that most of us already have to pay but which will be totally eliminated under the new system, then it becomes immediately clear that this could be a really good deal after all!\n \n -------------------\n \n I don't want to intrude on what I regard as anyone's right to privacy on the internet, but I have to remark, CU, that I'm a bit a-wonder at your unconcern over your own coverage (none) or that of your loved ones, married but no children yet. All you need is your 80. visit to a doctor recently, that covered any needed tests (of course, all is fine), and 50. dollars a month for pharmaceutical products that help you sleep. You've also indicated you're not a rich guy, you're knee-deep in credit card debt, yet so opposed to any reforms. How much would you pay in increased taxes, with the following:\n \n -------------------\n \n {excerpt}\n \n Check out some of the tremendous benefits that the new Medicare will bring and see what you think:\n \n \n Every resident of the US will be covered from birth to death.\n No more pre-existing conditions to be excluded from coverage.\n No more expensive deductibles or co-pays.\n All prescription medications will be covered.\n All dental and eye care will be included.\n Mental health and substance abuse care will be fully covered.(1)\n Long term and nursing home services will be included.\n You will always choose your own doctors and hospitals.\n Costs of coverage will be assessed on a sliding scale basis.\n Tremendously simplified system of medical administration.\n Total portability &#8211; your coverage not tied to any job or location.\n Existing Medicare benefits for those over 65 will be vastly improved.\n No corporate bureaucrat will ever come between you and your Doctor to deny your care.\n \n ---------------------------\n \n Just food for thought. It''s not my intention to pry.\n \n See you,\n \n Antonia",

   "Wise, Virginia holds its annual volunteer fair for medical care to Appalachian residents. Dailykos bloggers shared information from this article:\n \n -------------------\n \n By DEBRA MCCOWN\n Reporter / Bristol Herald Courier\n Published: July 25, 2009\n \n WISE, Va. &#8211; It&#8217;s not yet 5 a.m., but people are emerging from their cars, a few scurrying to pack up tents and camp stoves, bustling to be ready, hoping to have the opportunity to receive health care.\n As wisps of pink sunlight began coloring the clouds, the masses huddle at the gate under a misty dawn, waiting for their numbers to be called.\n \n The grassy parking lot is full. Beyond the fence, the cars are stacked up for miles. A snake of headlights is visible in the semi-dark along the curvy length of Hurricane Road, waiting to access the Wise County Fairgrounds.\n \n These are the modern-day breadlines: people desperate not for food, but for health care.\n \n &#8220;We are working taxpaying jobs, paying taxes, and we can&#8217;t get insurance because we make $6.55 an hour,&#8221; said Laura Head, 32, of Rogersville, Tenn., the first person in line Friday for the first day of the Remote Area Medical clinic, an annual three-day event offering free medical care. &#8220;This is really a great beneficial thing, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way; we could all have insurance.&#8221;\n \n A single mother of three who mows yards and moves trailers for a living, Head said she arrived at the fairgrounds Tuesday, to camp out at the fairgrounds until the health fair began Friday morning. Her motivation was simple: severe, constant pain.\n \n Close to two years ago, her boyfriend smashed her teeth, she said &#8211; but, without the $6,000 needed to have the teeth pulled she has endured infection after infection, making literally 100 visits to the emergency room for antibiotics and pain medication.\n \n She&#8217;s been billed between $240 and $290 a visit, she said &#8211; and, even after racking up bills far higher than the cost of extracting the teeth, she was stuck with them.\n \n &#8220;I wanted my teeth fixed and I wanted my health problems to be taken care of,&#8221; she said when asked why she took such great lengths to be first in line. &#8220;I wanted to make sure mine got done.&#8221;\n \n Scott Syverud, an emergency room doctor at the University of Virginia who came to volunteer at RAM, said Head&#8217;s problem is not unique; dental pain is the most common complaint at American emergency departments.\n \n &#8220;I see it every day and every night,&#8221; Syverud said. &#8220;This is what I see in the emergency department every day, it&#8217;s just bigger here. It&#8217;s harder to ignore.&#8221;\n \n The lack of access to health and dental care is not an Appalachian problem, he said &#8211; it&#8217;s a problem all across the nation.\n \n &#8220;Emergency rooms act as the safety net in this system,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that&#8217;s at the breaking point.&#8221;\n \n Even as a national health care reform bill is prepared for debate in Congress, more than 1,400 volunteers descended on Wise on Friday, with hundreds more signed up for the weekend &#8211; but even they were not enough to help everyone seeking care.\n \n &#8220;We&#8217;ve never had the traffic problem that we had this morning,&#8221; said Teresa Gardner, executive director of the Health Wagon, the local organization that coordinates the event. &#8220;It&#8217;s a record-setting day for sure.&#8221;\n \n The work will continue today and Sunday.\n \n Stan Brock, the founder of RAM, said 1,600 numbers were given out Friday to people seeking care &#8211; compared with 1,200 last year on the first day. He said the event here has grown every year.\n \n &#8220;It&#8217;s been like this for years and years and years,&#8221; Brock said. &#8220;This is not a recent phenomenon, and it&#8217;s not peculiar to Southwest Virginia. &#8230; Two weeks from now we&#8217;ll be in Los Angeles, Calif. &#8211; same problem.&#8221;\n \n The RAM event, in its 10th year in Wise County, is based on a model designed for the third world, Gardner said &#8211; but it&#8217;s needed right here in Virginia.\n \n &#8220;Our success is a failure of the health care system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get breast cancer [diagnoses] most likely, cervical cancer, lung cancer &#8230; about 40 to 50 percent of the patients will require follow-up.&#8221;\n \n She said she knows of a young woman, 19 or 20 years old, who is dying of cervical cancer for the simple reason that she didn&#8217;t have the money for follow-up care after an abnormal screening result.\n \n Paula Meade, a nurse with the Health Wagon, said she often sees patients who have cut back on their blood pressure medication or other needed care because of cost &#8211; and, as a result, come to her with permanent organ damage and worsening health.\n \n She said with economic troubles and rising bills, more people are trying to cut corners &#8211; and often they do it with their health, meeting short-term financial obligations at the expense of long-term well-being.\n \n &#8220;This is not the solution,&#8221; said R. Edward Howell, CEO of the UVA Health System, who also was at the event Friday. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been registering patients and they all ask the same question: &#8216;Can I get it all in today, or am I going to have to sleep in my car and come back tomorrow?&#8217; That&#8217;s not the way to do it.&#8221;\n \n (full article at link)\n \n Annual Free Clinic Set Up At Wise County Fairgrounds Sees Record-Setting Day | TriCities\n \n ---------------------\n \n More photos from Wise,\n \n Photo from Reuters Pictures - News, photos, topics, and quotes\n \n ---------------\n \n Kos'ers also quote from Kingsport Times coverage:\n \n -------------------\n \n \"Amanda Clarkston of Wise accompanied her husband, 26-year old John Clarkston, to RAM. She said her husband has been a diabetic since age four.\n &#8220;He comes here to get help with his diabetes because he has no health insurance, and he can&#8217;t get health insurance because he has diabetes. That&#8217;s so stupid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think they should give Medicaid coverage to people who need it. We have a pretty good income and he has insurance for other things, but he can&#8217;t get diabetes coverage. I think that&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;\n \n and then say,\n \n Failure to properly manage and treat diabetes can lead to severe complications--like blindness and foot amputations.#But our current system gives the people directly responsible for denying care to those who need it--the insurance bureaucrats--massive bonuses, even though this passing of the buck will inevitably cost the system more over the long-haul.\n \n -----------------\n \n A commonsense observation, for most of America, of course, meaning not the health insurance industry and not Congress. We the People desire a single payer system, and a public option, at the very least.\n \n When we will simply kick the health insurance executives out of the room? And pass the expanded and improved Medicare For All Act?\n \n After they pass campaign finance reform laws? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n July 30th, 2009, Thursday, lobby day in Washington, D.C. for a National Single Payer Healthcare System.",

   "One Sunday, last summer, I took the linens from the condos we take care of to the laundry mat.

   "I make less than the average salary in the US (by almost 20%) and I have a pre-existing condition, yet I am still able to have health care. Why? Because I pay for it. Because I haven't been unemployed since I was 15 years old. I have never taken a job that didn't offer health insurance. I make smart decisions and I manage my money well. I'm 29 years old and I still have to live with roommates because I can't afford my own place, but I still have health care. I managed to buy my first new car 3 years ago, and it gets about 35 mpg. I don't ever go hungry because I make smart food choices and cook a lot of my meals at home. I am always able to buy things I need, and usually things I want.\n \n I don't expect everybody to be like me.

   "This article may interest you:\n \n \n \nThe American health care system is expensive, ineffective and socially inequitable -- and it comes at an annual per capita cost of $7,500 -- twice as high as in Germany. Since 2000, doctors, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry have managed to achieve a 70-percent increase in earnings, which Obama calls \"health inflation.\"\n The health care industry already comprises a large and growing share of the American gross domestic product. That share is currently 16 percent, compared to only 10 percent in Germany. If nothing changes, it will increase to a monstrous 25 percent within the next 15 years.\n \n The high costs of the system are not matched by comparable benefits and services. The government has no real control over the health care system and pharmaceutical executives, chief physicians and hospital managers set their own salaries. The health care market is like a game of football without a referee. And the American superpower ranks a shameful 37th in international studies of health care systems. According to one such study, about 100,000 people a year die in American hospitals as a result of infections, while another 98,000 die because of incorrect treatment.\n \n America, as a Third World Country. Although the rate of return may not be as high as it is for Wall Street banks, where the US health care system does rank highly is in the profit margins of the medical-industrial complex. When advisors from the McKinsey management consultancy were hired to examine the system, they discovered $480 billion in profits that were not matched by performance.\n \n \"Pure Waste\" \n \n The renowned Institute of Medicine even estimates that almost one-third of all medical care in the US -- or about $700 billion worth -- is \"pure waste.\" This figure is one-and-a-half times the German federal budget and even exceeds the US military budget\n\n \n America's Reform of the Century: Will Health Care Be Obama's Legacy or Waterloo? - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International\n \n Chao",

   "Dental care is a very integral key part of health care. The fact that the American system, at the least, has separated the two -- \"dentists\"/\"doctors\" -- is due, in part, IMO, to the carryover of our delusional western mind/body split. As if \"dental\" being up there in the head (like eyes and \"vision\"), is not part and parcel of the body and just as key to our well-being. A good example is how there are infections in the mouth that can rapidly spread to the brain and kill a person. Without immediate attention (usually through antibiotics). But, better yet, good preventive dental care and cleaning, which can go a long way to stopping concerns and costs like that further down the road.\n \n I read an article that said that dental care in the U.S. is much lower ranked than 37th, internationally. On dental care, we are literally, at this point, third world conditions.\n \n It's pretty fugally sad. There are elderly people sitting out in the boonies with no teeth in their mouth and they can't get an appointment at bottom-line public oriented clinics because the clinics are so booked. What dental clinics there even are. Whereupon, if you visit one, you can see people waiting for hours upon hours to get in to see someone. The long wait in America they don't want you to know about.\n\n \n I don't know what planet you live on, but I find it amazing that neither I, nor anybody else I know, has ever had the problems you keep talking about.\n \n My health insurance doesn't cover dental. One Friday I woke up and a tooth hurt. I decided to wait to see if it got worse. It didn't get worse, but it didn't get better, so I called the dentist on Monday and got an appointment the same day. He saw me for $120, and told me to go to an oral surgeon because I had an infected wisdom tooth. So I went to the oral surgeon and paid another $150 to have my tooth pulled. Keep in mind, the original $120 included a 360 degree X-ray. The pain medicine was covered by my insurance. I think that prescription was about $5 or $10.\n \n I spent about $280 and had the tooth extracted in less than 24 hours after I called. There's no wait, the cost wasn't ridiculous, and everything was good. The dentist also charges $120 for cleanings, which I get twice a year. That's not an outrageous cost.\n \n Whenever I am sick and call my primary care physician, I am usually seen the same day. Now that I think about it, I cannot recall a time when I WASN'T seen the same day.\n \n I'm not special, so I imagine all of the patients of this practice can be seen the same day. In my daily life, I just don't hear about these long waits and denied claims. I only hear about it from people promoting the national health care agenda.",

   "From what I have read in American magazines and newspapers and also from brief reports in the 'foreign' media, everybody is out to milk the system hence the exorbitant costs. There are too many vested interests for any health reform to work.\n Obama is a compromiser and the more you compromise the less you achieve.\n \n Now, from the personal point of view as expressed in postings here in this forum, as long as you have health insurance and can afford your dentist's fee everything is kosher.\n Which is normally the attitude of the middle class-and the one above it : \"It is not expensive\".\n I think they mean what they say, for rich people and even middle class people are different from the rest of us : the poor, the 'battlers' as we are called here in Australia, for every day is a battle for us to make ends meet.\n The affluent are different from us, because they live in a different economic reality. And in their 'world' health insurance is cheap, dental care and all other life necessities easily affordable. Therefore when they say \"It is not expensive, everybody can afford it\" they mean it, for they don't see beyond their up turned noses. \n They skip the news about poverty and hunger when reading or watching the news, and don't let the 'real' world intrude in their comfortable lives. \n Collectively they are called the 'bourgeoisie\".\n Some times members of the 'bourgeoisie' for reasons unknown become activists, political activists, reformers, such as Antonia. \n Fidel Castro for instance came from an affluent, land holding family and the Marxist intelligentsia in Chile was an intellectual 'club' to which only members of the middle and upper classes could join.\n We the poor, barely literate have never heard of Marx apart from Groucho or read \"Das Kapital\". We the poor are so busy trying to subsist that involvement in politics is a luxury we can ill afford. Hence to topple a bourgeoisie regime you need other members of the bourgeoisie to do it for you, for we are too stupid, too busy, too tired to figure it out.\n We, the mob, just supply the brawn to break down the palace's wall. And when you think of it, we replace our masters for more of the same kind. We are dumb, that is why we are poor and end up becoming slaves in a Marxist country. \n We, the poor, never, ever win and therefore we will never become extinct and our ranks swell in every downturn of the economy.\n If I have only chosen to be born in a rich family ... sigh!",

   "Getting back to the long wait, Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, has written an excellent and cogent piece on why health care reform should go through, and what it means for average Americans, in a nutshell. It is printed at yahoo.\n \n ----------------\n \n Op-Ed: Health reform will empower families against market constraints\n \n Washington, DC &#8212; For decades, Washington has talked about fixing a broken health care system. And for decades Washington failed to act &#8211; allowing the special interests to stall reform while the cracks in the system turned into crevices, then craters.\n \n But today, we are closer than ever to the change we need. Key committees in Congress have reached a striking degree of consensus about how to control costs, guarantee coverage, and provide more choices for every American. America&#8217;s doctors and nurses have announced their support. And even hospitals, drug and insurance companies have pledged to do their part to control costs.\n \n Change is never easy and recently, some defenders of the status quo have made themselves heard. \n \n One Republican Senator said, &#8220;If we&#8217;re able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo. It will break him.&#8221; And a leading political strategist urged fellow Republicans to &#8220;resist the temptation&#8221; to be &#8220;constructive or, at least responsible,&#8221; and instead work to &#8220;kill&#8221; health care reform.\n \n These opponents of change may understand how to score political points in Washington, but they don&#8217;t seem to understand the stakes for the country. The health care status quo is unacceptable and unsustainable for our families, our businesses, and our nation as a whole. \n \n Today nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured and are one illness or accident away from losing everything. Millions more are under-insured. Since 2004, the number of under-insured families &#8211; those who pay for coverage but are unprotected against high costs &#8211; rose by 60 percent.\n \n Even Americans with insurance find themselves paying more and getting less. In the past decade, premiums have doubled, rising three times as fast as wages and leaving families scrambling to close the gap. Last year, more than half of Americans skipped their medications or postponed medical because they couldn&#8217;t afford it.\n \n Businesses &#8211; especially small businesses &#8211; aren&#8217;t faring much better. Skyrocketing health costs are making it even harder to compete in today&#8217;s global economy and forcing business owners to choose between staying afloat and providing health care for their workers. \n \n At the same time, health care spending today consumes 30 percent more of state and local budgets than it did 20 years ago, forcing governments to choose between cutting services and raising taxes. And our national budget faces the same threat, with health care costs representing the single largest contributor to exploding long-term deficits.\n \n America can&#8217;t afford to wait any longer for health care reform.\n \n Some opponents of reform will try to scare Americans into thinking they&#8217;ll lose what they already have. Millions of Americans are happy with the coverage they have now, so let&#8217;s be clear: under any plan the Obama administration will support, if you like your health insurance you can keep your health insurance; if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. \n \n In fact, the real threat to what works in our system comes from doing nothing. Without action, prices will continue to spiral out of control. More Americans will not be able to afford insurance at all, and those who can will continue to pay more for less.\n \n So what will reform actually look like?\n \n First, to provide Americans with more affordable choices, we&#8217;ll set up a marketplace where you can compare plans and pick the one that&#8217;s right for you. None of the plans would be allowed to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. And one of the options should be a public plan that would increase competition and keep private insurance companies honest.\n \n Second, we have to align incentives for doctors and hospitals so that they&#8217;re rewarded based on the quality of care they provide, not on how many tests or procedures they prescribe.\n \n Third, we need to move from a sickness system to a wellness system. By investing in prevention and emphasizing healthy lifestyles, we can save money while improving health.\n \n Finally, reform must not add to our deficit over the next ten years. To that end, we have already identified hundreds of billions of dollars in savings &#8211; savings from money that&#8217;s already being spent on health care, but is funding waste and overpayments to insurance companies.\n \n Put together, these changes will make quality, affordable coverage available to every American while bending the cost curve so that we don&#8217;t bury our children in debt. Fixing the system has never been so critical, and it has never been more squarely within our reach. Now it&#8217;s time to make reform a reality.\n \n Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of Health and Human Services in President Barack Obama's Cabinet. She was the Democratic governor of the state of Kansas from 2003 to 2009.\n \n Op-Eds by contributors do not reflect the editorial views of the Yahoo! News staff.\n \n ------------------------------------",
