   "3 Charged In Santa Fe Gay Bashing\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n Posted: March 1, 2005 7:30 pm. ET \n (Santa Fe, New Mexico) Three men have been charged in the beating of a Santa Fe gay man that was so vicious he was left unconscious. \n \n James Maestas, 21, and his partner Joshua Stockham 24, of Albuquerque had just finished lunch with several female friends at a Santa Fe restaurant and had gone outside for a smoke when five men drove into the parking lot. The men attempted to talk up the girls and at some point got into an argument with Maestas and Stockham.\n \n A police statement says that the argument escalated with one of the men calling Maestas and Stockham \"XXXXXXX\" and trying to provoke a fight.\n \n Stockham, Maestas and the females got into a car and began driving away. The men then began throwing rocks at the car according to the statement said. \n \n A man identified as the person who had waited on them in the restaurant, David Trinidad, 17, was just finishing work and came outside. The statement said that Trinidad knew the five men and joined in the rock throwing.\n \n Trinidad, the police statement said, learned the men were staying at nearby hotel while he was serving them. \n \n He told investigators that he and the five men followed the group to the hotel and along the way they \"pumped\" themselves up by talking about \"****ing those XXXXXXX up\". The statement also quotes Trinidad as telling investigators that they referred to Stockham and Maestas as \"****ing white boys.\"\n \n They arrived at the hotel just behind Stockham and Maestas and began beating the pair while yelling anti-gay epithets.\n \n Maestas fell to the ground unconscious. \n \n Three of the men were arrested based on witnesses accounts.\n \n Maestas remains in hospital in serious condition. His family is so concerned for his safety police will not identify the hospital.\n \n Stockham was treated and released.\n \n Trinidad, Gabriel Maturin, 20, and Isaia Medina, 19, each face charges of aggravated battery. Prosecutors have charged the 17 year old Trinidad as an adult. All three will face hate-crimes enhancements the prosecutor said Tuesday.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005 \n \n _______________________________________________________________\n \n Amazes me this still happens. A bunch of straight boys proving their manhood I guess. This is why we need hate crime laws, to send a message of how wrong this is, and that people will serve more than just assult charges, that get them a year or 2 with probation.",

   "Trial Set In Gay Serial Killings \n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff \n Posted: February 28, 2005 9:08 pm. ET \n \n (Trenton, New Jersey) A man accused of killing gay men and leaving their bodies along rural roads will stand trial in September.\n Jury selection will begin September 13 Superior Court Judge James N.Citta has ruled.\n Richard W. Rogers Jr., 52, a former surgical nurse is accused of killing two men and is suspected in other murders.\n The dismembered bodies were found nearly a decade ago along New Jersey roadways\n Prosecutors say Rogers killed Thomas Mulcahy, 57, of Sudbury, Mass., on July 10, 1992, dismembered his body, placed pieces in garbage bags and dumped them along Route 72 and at a Garden State Parkway rest area.\n Rogers is also charged with killing Anthony E. Marrero, 44, of New York, whose dismembered body was found May 10, 1993, on a road in Manchester Township.\n Two years ago a 'cold file' law enforcement team resubmitted finger prints that had been taken from crime scene evidence to a nationwide fingerprint database of criminal suspects and Rogers was identified.\n He had been arrested in Maine early in the investigation but when the prints were originally submitted to the database a decade ago Maine was not part of the system and he was let go.\n It was not his first brush with the law in Maine. He was arrested and stood trial in 1973 for the murder of his roommate, Frederick Spencer, who was struck on the head with a hammer, smothered with a plastic bag and dumped in a wooded area. Rogers claimed self-defense and was acquitted.\n After the DNA evidence pointed to him he was arrested in New York City and taken to New Jersey where he has been in jail ever since.\n Authorities say the nearly two-year delay between Rogers' arrest and indictment was not unusual because investigators from various agencies had to compare evidence and run numerous tests.\n At the time of his arrest, Rogers was living in Staten Island and had been a registered nurse at Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than 20 years.",

Would it be any different if it were right wing groups out hunting for '****ing commies', or 'patriots' out to get arabs or muslims?\n\n \n Yes, a very good question! In fact, there are already hate crime laws against attacking Arabs or Muslims. I would not be opposed to extending hate crime legislation to political beliefs, though it is not as important as not as many people are murdered because of their political beliefs.\n \n Hate crime legislation punishes those who attack people for being part of a specific group of people more than the standard punishment would be. Why not treat a hate crime murder the same as any other murder? Well, a hate crime is a motive, and we should treat different motives differently. Let me present three different murders: In the first, a man is attacked by another man and murders him in self-defense. In the second, a man is temporarily enraged when he finds out his wife is cheating on him, so he buys a gun and kills her. In the third, a white man meets a black man and kills him simply because he thinks black people should be killed. Do all of these people deserve to recieve the same punishment? Certainly not. A man who simply kills another for being of a specific race has committed a worse crime than a man who acted in self defense, and he is more likely to commit murder again than is someone who was temporarily angered by his wife cheating on him.\n \n The motive behind a murder be the difference between a hero and a cold-blooded serial killer. Different motives should be punished differently, and a man who kills another simply because the other is part of a group of people that he dislikes has a cold-blooded motive and has nothing stopping him from killing the next person from that group he meets.",

   "I disagree with hate crime legislation - I would have no problem with the motive being taken into account to level a harsher penalty (given the less personal motive the offender is more likely to have done it before and do it again), however it should be considered like that, rather than having its own set of laws around it.\n \n Of course if you do have existing laws that cover race and nationalty then it would make sense for them to cover sexuality as well to complete the list of these type of traits, and I certainly would be very cautious about adding religions and beleifs to this list. While I by no means advocate the beating up of people for these reasons I think you are starting to get a little closer in line with more 'traditional reasons' to commit a crime. Also as you move away from the phsyical crimes there starts to open up a huge grey area that covers essentially debating whether that idea is right as well as classing a riot that breaks out after liverpool win on a dubious penalty as a hate crime.\n \n Unlike race or nationality, homosexuality is a little closer to the borderline (at least in the eyes of those with the legislative power) to the religion/belief side, or at least isn't nessarily quite as clear cut as the traditional hate crime topics.",

The laws simply say that if a person's motive was an attack on a specific group of people, they recieve a harsher penalty. Yeah, it's not exactly the same thing, but I'm not all that nitpicky. I am far more concerned about areas where hate crime legislation exists to protect race, religion, disability and gender but does not exist to protect sexual orientation. Sexual orientation should recieve the same protections, and it seems you are in agreement.\n \n Whether sexual orientation is considered a race/nationality or a belief should not matter; I think every area with hate crime legislation protects against religion as well as race and nationality. and I don't see why it wouldn't.",

   "This is where the law in the UK and US must differ then, religion is left out of a few (if not all, not entirely sure) of the hate crime laws. Far as violent crimes go, any action directed at a member of a group because of their membership should really be covered. There is a big debate on at the moment over here about how far the hate crime label should extend to a variety of different potential crimes. Going purely off the law encitement to [racial] hatred has a lot of fuzzy areas around the side when not being applied to more black and white things like race. Especially as freedom of speech is not regarded as a right over here, just something generally nice.\n \n As for the church example, couldn't the fact that it was a hate crime equivalent still be taken into account during sentancing? Do the hate crime laws add an additional sentance in addition to the one from the crime or just increase the level of severity (i.e a hate crime gets maximum penalty)? (i.e the difference between smashing stuff up in a church and practically destroying and desecrating it - assuming the action was directed only at the church in question).",

Gay rights just doesn't divide people here compared to more mudane things (sad thing is I probably have a better knowledge of what the situation is on that front in the US rather than at home...think you can get civil ceremonies but don't think they get common law status or something like that).",

   "My copy of windows is undergoing its final death spasms so finding something from the history is not as easy as it should be so bear with me...ok here we go, as long as the marriage was legal in country of origin then it is legal under the laws of the UK.\n\n \n My condolences on the impending demise.\n \n Thanks for finding the link. Not to nitpick, but the devil, as they say, is in the details. Here's the pertinent line: \"It has emerged that same-sex marriages will be considered valid for immigration purposes in the UK, as long as the ceremonies are conducted in countries where they are legal.\"\n \n That policy decision early last year, though quite welcome, I'm sure, isn't the same as saying that a legal same-sex marriage outside the UK is legal inside the UK. Your immigration authority will recognize it for visa purposes (and residency, I assume) to get the spouse INTO the country or to let him/her STAY, but the marriage will have NO effect on issues unrelated to immigration.\n \n I suspect that this is somehow addressed in the pending Civil Partnership law, but frankly I'd hesitate to guess how. Is a Belgian marriage equal to a (lesser) UK CP? (If a Belgian marriage were EQUAL to a UK marriage, then most gay couples in the UK would just hop on over to the Continent and get hitched.) How about a Vermont CV -- does it have ANY weight at all?\n \n This points out one of the most irritating aspects of the argument to provide \"reasonable\" alternatives to same-sex marriage. The proponents of other solutions rarely, if ever, address the problems of transportability. Civil unions don't equal marriages don't equal domestic parterships, and none of these legal statuses necessarily equal those in other jurisdictions. \n \n IT'S A MESS just waiting to happen.",
