   "This gives a great insight into their philosophies and who they are fighting for.\n \n http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/06/12/GR2008061200193.gif\n \nObama and McCain Tax Proposals\n According to a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are both proposing tax plans that would result in cuts for most American families. Obama's plan gives the biggest cuts to those who make the least, while McCain would give the largest cuts to the very wealthy. For the approximately 147,000 families that make up the top 0.1 percent of the income scale, the difference between the two plans is stark. While McCain offers a $269,364 tax cut, Obama would raise their taxes, on average, by $701,885 - a difference of nearly $1 million.\n\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/09/ST2008060900950.html\n \n McCain claims Obama is a socialist who wants to redistribute wealth like Peter Pan, stealing from the rich and giving from the poor.\n \n McCain appears different at a glance because he wants to give tax cuts across the board. He says he will give tax breaks for small business as does Obama and the graph shows they both do since most small business earn less 250,000 a year, but McCain will give greater tax cuts to big business.\n \n One question I have is, does McCain's proposed tax cuts for big business undermine small business in a way and is it significant?\n \n I've also heard they will not be able to implement their tax plans because of the state of the economy. True?",

   "I've heard McCain's tax plan CANNOT be implemented without some sweeping cuts in governmental spending.\n So far, McCain has shown no real specific on what he has cut. He has made some campaign \"blah, blah, blah\" on cutting \"pork\", which I do agree with...\n ... however, his approval of the bailout package (with TREMENDOUS pork) without fighting against it makes me think his words are pretty hollow...\n \n I hadn't heard anything about Obama's tax plan being non-feasible.\n If you look at the \"average change in taxes\", that's pretty different. Obama's not in the same category of impact to the federal budget.\n \n As for \"business\", I find the whole \"business tax cuts\" thing just beyond amusing.\n WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of U.S. corporations paid no federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005, according to a new report from Congress.\n \n The study by the Government Accountability Office, expected to be released Tuesday, said about 68 percent of foreign companies doing business in the U.S. avoided corporate taxes over the same period.\n \n Collectively, the companies reported trillions of dollars in sales, according to GAO's estimate.http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CORPORATIONS_INCOME_TAX?SITE=AP\n \n We are talking about tax cuts for businesses that PAY NO TAXES.\n How do businesses that PAY NOT TAXES need \"tax relief\"?",

Essentially, this will be a tax increase...but legally, he doesn't have to call it that.\n\n Can you provide documentation of what Obama \"will\" do?\n Can I guess the answer is no?\n Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has called for the extension of all the tax cuts, while his Democratic rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have proposed extending them for everyone except high-income taxpayers.Bush: 43M families hurt if tax cuts expire - Jun. 2, 2008\n \n So as with many things conservatives are saying about Obama, this claim is just plain false...\n It's probable that for the upper crust 2%, who make more than most of us dream of, may see their taxes go back to PRE-BUSH LEVELS.\n And that's important to remember too. We're not talking about taxes suddenly jumping to unimaginable heights. We're talking about taxes returning to where they ALREADY WERE before Bush cut them, primarily for the rich... emoticon_emb\n \n And the rich did quite well under Clinton, so I think they'll somehow get by... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nRegardless of which thief gets elected, spending cuts will have to be implemented.\n\n I'm sorry, but again no.\n Under MCCAIN's plan, there will HAVE TO BE spending cuts in the government.\n Economic analyst after economic analyst have observed this as a requirement for his plan. And still, McCain refuses to state what specifically he would cut...\n Considering he routinely voted FOR Bush's spending plans, one would have to question whether he expects to cut any area, or just continue in Bush's over-spending foot-steps.\n \n As for Obama, the total impact on the tax revenues is far less than McCain. While I personally hate the massive deficit that Bush has created, it would still be conceivable to continue in that venue until the economy turns.\n \n McCain would rack up an unprecedented amount of debt without slashing large cuts.\n Obama? While cuts would help clean up Bush's mess, it's not impractical to avoid them. It's not a necessity.\n \n \n \nThe big difference in McCain's and Obama's plans are that McCain's will likely stimulate the economy while Obama's will cause a deep depression.

   "Obama has the right tax plan but for the wrong reasons.\n \n We don't need more taxes to pay for more stuff...we need more taxes to pay for stuff we already bought years ago and have to pay years into the future. Obama's plan for the economy is have the government buy us out of this problem which will probably work for a few years but leave us in the crappy position of having future tax hikes and stag growth. Private sector growth provides more job at better pay and with more creative thinking causing even more growth. Government provides jobs but no future benefit to the economy.\n \n Look at a simple example. If you work for a company that makes calculators and another company comes along and makes a better one, your company has to step up and make an even better one for compete in a different way. This creates creative ways to do things, stimulates jobs (in this case engineering) and generates knowledge for future economic benefit. This has proven true time and time again. Now a government will invest money in welfare. The person gets money and provides no economic benefit and contributes, at best, very little to generate future benefit. They can spend it on items that don't make much difference and you much less benefit. Investing in infrastruture is better but here you run into the problem of what you do when there is nothing left to build where the benefit outweighs the cost. \n \n One only needs to work for the government to understand that, in general, growth comes from the private sector and not the government. \n \n So Obama will screw our economy over by creating a mask for our economic problems by spending our way into short term growth. Will McCain be any different? Yes! McCain will screw us over in the same manner but at least richer folks will have a few years of extra money to store away off shore before it comes crashing down. \n \n Congrats everyone on picking two XXXXXX who might be president.",
