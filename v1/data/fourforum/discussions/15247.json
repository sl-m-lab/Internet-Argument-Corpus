   "Obama said, in his biography, he gravitated to Marxist professors in college, he had a Marxist preacher best friend for 20 years, said in his auto biography that when he worked on Wall Street he felt as if \"he had parachuted behind enemy lines\", was more liberal in the Senate the Bernie Sanders( an open socialist) and now, despite 200 years of gov't growth, his deficits will be bigger than all other American presidents combined, and, he also wants perhaps absolute control over health care (already mostly controlled by gov't), banking, and the auto industry. \n \n Through Frank Marshall Davis,( Communist Party number: 47544) Obama had an admitted deep and prolonged relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The record shows that Obama was in Hawaii from 1971-1979, where, at some point in time, he developed a close relationship, almost like a son, with Davis, listening to his \"poetry\" and getting advice on his career path. \n But Obama, in his book, Dreams From My Father, refers to him repeatedly as just \"Frank.\"\n \n \n Bernie Saunders is a Democrat and an open socialist. Obama is to the left of Saunders based on his voting record in the Senate. \n \n Oleg Klugian (head of KGB in cold war) said that when he wanted to recruit spies he looked among the liberals. When FDR's liberals went to the USSR they came back on a ship named the \"Leviathan\" to report, \"they had seen the future and it worked.\" \n \n Then of course BO appointed at least 4 communists: Mark Lloyd (supporter of communist revolution in Venezuela) and Van Jones who said \"give them the wealth, give them the wealth,\" and Annita Dunn who said, \"Mao is my favorite philosopher\" , and Bloom who said, \"free markets are nonsense.\" \n \n Obama: the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties....... it doesn't say what the federal government [our genius founders forgot?] or the state government must do on your behalf.\n \n I think that there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive [Marxist] change.\n \n Obama: \"I think we can say that the Constitution reflected an enormous blind spot in this culture that carries on until this day, and that the Framers had that same blind spot.\"\n \n Obama: the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties....... it doesn't say what the federal government [our genius founders forgot?] or the state government must do on your behalf.\n \n In an article titled \"The Impossible is Now Possible: Assessing the Obama Presidency,\" executive vice chair of the Communist Party United States, Jarvis Tyner hailed the President's \"drive to the left.\" \"The health care bill, the stimulus package, the cap-and-trade bill, the elimination of secret elections for union representation-it's a program we dared not dream possible only a year ago,\" Tyner wrote. \"But now it's on the verge of becoming the new blueprint for a truly socialist America.\"\n \n A quick visit to the CPUSA website yields: \n \n \"In some ways last night's State of the Union address by President Obama was a virtuoso performance. There were stirring moments, memorable turns of phrase, humor, a defense of activist government, and proposals that will be welcomed, and surely help, millions of people in need.\" Obama State of the Union: He got the ball rolling cpusa\n \n \n And, if all that is not enough BO wrote a book called \" Dreams From my Father\". His father was a drunken suicidal Marxist who dreamed to free the world from American imperialism. His mother married 2 communists and urged BO to follow is communist bio dad.\n \n \n And lets not forget that BO is openly for single payer socialist health care!!",

Conclusion: legislation to make Democrats illegal \n is urgently needed\n\n \n None of this indicates that FDR extended the great depression. IT shows that they were unable to end it. The two are NOT the same. \n \n Back in the real world, FDRs programs were a mix of horrible failures and incredible successes. While the depression was too deep to solve quickly with a few government jobs, the infrastructure that was built during the depression was instrumental in both winning WWII and in providing us the base we needed for the prosperity of the 50s and 60s. For all intents and purposes, the wealth of the next 50 decades of Americans was based on the infrastructure improvements put in place by FDR. \n \n Unfortunately we ended up keeping the worst of FDR (farm bill) and ended up letting the best of his policies lapse...like the idea that the government should make people WORK for money instead of just handing out 99 weeks of unemployment. \n \n Currently the US is in a bad situation. We desperately need to get our spending under control and our revenues up. At the same time, we desperately need to update our infrastructure if we want to be competitive in the world market. We also have a serious unemployment problem. Sure, the official number is around 8.5%.....if we counted unemployment today the same way we did during the depression, it would be be more like 27%. \n \n To any business man looking at those 3 problems, and taking into account that we are already paying the unemployed, the solution is pretty obvious. It was obvious to FDR. Every state in the country has their own highway work crews because it has been shown conclusively that it is MUCH cheaper than using contractors to do everything. The federal government is responsible for hundreds of thousands of miles of highways and does not have a single highway crew. \n \n We need to take a serious look at the last time we made a major infrastructure effort, which would have been when FDR was in office, look at what we did, and pick the best of those programs and fire them back up. Bring back the WPA. Create a REA type effort to bring actual high speed internet to Americans...you know...like the koreans and most Europeans already have. \n \n What we have been doing, just dumping money into the economy, has certainly increased corporate profits but has done very little actual good for the nation.",

You would consider Whigs conservatives. \n \n But actually, the government you know of from today didn't start until Lincoln's presidency.\"- blessed\n \n Newsvine - The founding fathers were liberals...\n \n \n This is really pretty easy to understand. I'm going to try to keep this as simple as possible.\n \n Conservative - adj - tending or disposed to maintain existing views, conditions, or institutions \n \n - noun - one who adheres to traditional methods or views \n \n Can someone please tell me what was traditional about the American democracy that was established in the Americas prior to and during the revolution. If the founding fathers were conservatives they would have set a theocratic monarchy in the new world. This is really pretty simple. \n \n Liberal - adj - not bound by authoritarianism, orthodoxy, or traditional forms \n \n - noun - one who is open-minded or not strict in the observance of orthodox, traditional, or established forms or ways\n \n Interesting. Liberal is a far better word to describe not only the ideas of the founders but also their actions. Then how can it be that the conservative wing of this country claims ownership to the founding principles?\n \n I'm not normally a fan of these short little articles, but I'm sick of hearing conservatives \"claiming the throne,\" so to speak, when it comes to the founding of this country and the people that brought the liberal idea of democracy across the Atlantic to establish a new country. \n \n As a caveat, I do agree it would be fair to say the founders were conservative by today's dichotomic standards. However, to claim they were conservative, specifically for the time is a horrendous misrepresentation of history.\n \n \n Bill Maher: Tea Party wrong - Founding Fathers were liberal elites (Video) - National Democrat | Examiner.com\n \n STFU, already.\n\n The natural meaning of the word liberal is what the word libertarian means now.

   "ah but freedom of speech has many limitations. Since liberals are opposed to American principles their speech can be considered treasonous. No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.\n\n \n You are right, there are limitations on freedom of speach. Libel, slander, speach inciting people to illegal action, yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theatre, dissemination of classified information. A dissenting political viewpoint does not qualify for limitation. The entire purpose of the first ammendment is so that every single individual is allowed their opinion and beliefs and the right to profess them without fear of reprisal. This is not only recoginized as law in the US, but is also recognized internationally as a basic human right in the Univeral Declaration of Human Rights. To punish those who do not share your opinion IS NOT FREEDOM. Period. \n \n You sir, are a facist. \n \n \nby making liberals illegal we would be preserving liberty since modern liberals are opposed to liberty and for government. \n\n \n Only the big bag liberal boogie monster in your head. You don't get to dump everyone who disagrees with you into a big pile called \"liberal\" and assign attributes to them. \n \n Not only are facist, you are xenophobic.\n \n \nNow you know why they gave Stalin the bomb, and why they took the 5th when McCarthy asked them if they were communist.

I do not regard you as a valid source of any kind of information. \n \n In adddition to facist and xenophobic, you are meglamaniacal.\n \n \nI know this is over your head but, for example, we don't want to encourage Nazis, because they would not be included in the realm of those who could take the oath of office wherein one pledges to protect the Constitution and its values. Liberals are the same. \n\n \n As disgusting as their ideas are to me, I support the first ammendment rights of Nazis as well. So does the law. \n \n Also, as the mother to a non-white child, I am offended by your mild attempt to compare me to a Nazi. So on a personal note - go to hell.\n \n \nso, Jefferson and the Founders were conservative!!! The Revolution was against statist liberalism. \n\n \n Compared to modern liberals I suppose an argument can be made that they were conservative. But if you look at them within their time, thinking they were conservative vs. government under the rule of the king. Thats a giggle.\n \n \nno for not thinking like a loyal American\n\n \n You are an extreme liberal hell-bent on making conservatives look bad, aren't you? Come on, give up the game.\n \n \nDo you want to be a liberal all your life?\n\n \n I am not interested in ensuring I am part of any club. I don't belong to churches or political parties.

Conservatives on the other hand are not trying to change much so they would have been more like Tories back in the day.\n \n That however is a really absurd connection because whether or not you are trying to change things is not some absolute constant of political position but a function of the way things are.\n \n As soon as Jefferson and his musket wielding pals implemented the U.S. his values then compelled him to preserve the status qua as best he could, everyone who has been 'conservative' in America since then have been trying to 'conserve' what he was after.\n \n Liberals claim him on a frankly totally irrelevant connection. A connection of values is much more logical.\n\n \n Ahem. \n Conservatism: The Politics Of Ignorance and Self-Interest\n \n What Is The Conservative Ideology?\n The conservative rallying cry is \"freedom.\" Freedom generally meaning freedom from government intervention in matters they do not want government interfering in (usually their own personal or professional lives). But as we shall see later in this essay, conservatives have an inherent mistrust of personal freedom, and can become quite uncomfortable when serious proposals are made to extend it to someone other than themselves. The problem here is that allowing personal freedom without allowing a similar degree of freedom to others violates to principle of 'greatest good for the greatest number.' It therefore creates a basic inconsistency.\n The essence of a free society is \"openness,\" which implies two things: the right to free speech, and the right, even the requirement, to think for oneself, make one's own decisions, and chart one's own destiny. While conservatives loudly proclaim these ideals, they do not mind circumscribing them in the name of their own ideology; restrictions on abortion, based on their own definition of human life, as if no other were possible, and the restriction on the civil rights of gays to marry the informed, consenting adult of their choice, presuming that their own definition of marriage is the only one that is worthy of being allowed by law. Such circumscriptions and many others that could be cited show clearly the distance that exists between conservative ideological rhetoric and actual practice. This is because in the headlong rush towards a laissez-faire economic model, it is easy to forget that the values and institutions of an open society are not neccessarily supported by the market, and need care and nurturing if they are to survive. This is because the conservative has failed to understand that by increasing his comfort level (ensuring that abortions or gay marriages don't occur) he has circumscribed the right of others to make their own decisions. Simply claiming that he is right is not enough; no evidence is ever provided to show that the greatest good for the greatest number is provided for by circumscribing the right of women to direct their own reproductive destinies or the right of gays or lesbians to marry the informed, consenting adults of their choice. \n \n The reason that the conservative doesn't nurture those values and instititutions of freedom for all, is that the concept of freedom to a conservative is a deeply personal one. It generally stems from personal experience or from personal history in which the conservative or someone close to him has had a negative experience with government or the intervention, perceived or real, of government in his life. Therefore, the language used by conservatives in relation to freedom is personal. It is replete with personal examples, such as personal forms of taxation, stories of government regulations or bureaucrats gone bad. In relation to the rest of society, it is always vague generalizations, such as \"getting government off the backs of the people.\" The disparity in the language reflects the personal nature of conservatism.\n \n Economically, conservatives hold only Adam Smith to be a true prophet of economic theory. Other, more modern economists such as Milton Freidman are held in esteem only to the extent that they echo Adam Smith's views. Why this is true is simply that Adam Smith propounded the most purely non-regulated economic model that has ever seen any degree of acceptance. This fits hand in glove with the conservative view that government is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The obvious synergy of the theories seems to verify for the conservative the sensical basis of conservative theory. Yet conservatives fail utterly to acknowledge that the regulations they so angrily denounce were put there originally for a reason. That reason is that free markets, unrestrained by government regulation, do not neccessarily lead to the greatest good for the greatest number -- in fact, they never do. To the extent that they don't, government regulation is often neccessary to prevent abuse. This is a patently obvious fact almost never acknowledged by conservative theorists.\n \n A persistent, dominant feature of conservatism is social Darwinism. In economic terms, it takes the form of declaring intervention in the market to be the ultimate evil, and that non-interventionism informs the social theories that underlie conservative philosophy. By claiming that the free market will solve the ills, social Darwinism becomes an easy extension of that view, by asserting that those who aren't successful in the market are morally inferior; i.e., they are unsuccessful because they are weak or lazy. The anecdotal evidence that others have made it after starting with few if any resources, is used to justify this view. \n \n While this view is a central tenet of conservative social philosophy, it fails to consider differences in individual temperment and talent, and that while some have \"made it\" after starting from nothing, it presumes that all are equally equipped to do so, which is obviously not the case. The fact that some have, however, presumes to alleviate the conservative of any responsibility towards those who can't. Therefore, any notion of government support of the weak, infirm, or defective becomes anathema.\n \n This social Darwinism stands in stark contrast to the view of religious conservatives that Darwinism is the ultimate expression of the evil of secular science, which declares that humanity arose from the primates from just such a system of survival of the fittest. The irony that on the one hand, the view that Darwinism is an insult to what the religious conservative regards as the divinity of human creation with the disregard of that portion of that creation which is other than self, seems lost on such conservatives.\n \n In social theory, conservatism harks back to what it considers a simpler and somehow better time. More modern problems, such as feminism, gay rights, multiculturalism, urban decay, economic decline and political instability are considered by conservatives to simply be evidence that society has strayed from what it believes to be the non-interventionist wisdom of the past. To cure these ills, conservatives suggest simply returning to what they presume the values of the past to be, neglecting the obvious fact that the problems of today are quite different from those of past generations, and that the egregious moral and political inequities of the past are too unpleasant to be worth returning to, and that the past was nowhere near as non-interventionist as they presume. Nor do they consider that the interventions of the state were made neccessary by very real problems.\n \n These social theories are often lumped together under the banner of \"traditional family values.\" That term is never carefully defined, but usually is taken to mean a rejection of feminism, gay rights and even the right of women to control the destinies of their own reproductive lives in some cases. It also decries the decline of the two-parent family, while totally ignoring the factual reasons that the two-parent family is in decline. Again, government is often blamed, even though the problem is primarily an economic one. And conservative economic policies are largely to blame. The fact that these values have no effect at all on inner city decay, illegal drugs, street crime, collapse of the educational system, etc., are lost on the conservative, because he never stops to actually think about how these values would actually affect these problems. He simply accepts that they will, on face value, because such has been the pronouncement of conservative pundits.\n \n Running through all of this is a common thread of patriarchialism. There is an unspoken objectification of women and sexual minorities, in which they are regarded as less than men in terms of their rights within society. This view takes voice in such statements as \"A woman's place is in the home\" as if she weren't competent to run her or her family's affairs. Homophobia is considered quite acceptable, even honorable among many conservatives, as homosexuals don't quite seem to be men or even women, so are therefore something less that totally human (or even downright evil and perverted), and therefore don't deserve human rights. Many of the more outspoken and extreme conservatives will even give voice to this Fascist sentiment. There is also an assumption, false as it turns out, that the male was programmed by evolution to be the head of the family and by extension, head of everything else too. Even female conservatives, who from their own experience ought to know better, often buy into this mistaken view.\n \n The nostalgia for an earlier, and presumed better time takes a particularly virulent turn when it links up with a need for an enemy. Conservatives need enemies simply because of the failure of conservative policies to produce the nirvana predicted for them. Finding a scapegoat and blaming the problems of society on that scapegoat are vastly easier and more comfortable than the introspection and self-examination required to determine just where the root of society's problems lie, and whether conservative policies can actually affect the problems. To an extent, government intervention fills the role of scapegoat, but in cases were government obviously can't be blamed, another scapegoat must be found. In the \"golden age\" of the 1950's, that enemy was communism, the nostalgia was for a pre-world war II innocence, and together the virulence took the form of McCarthyism. Today, communism is dead, but the need for a scapegoat still exists, so in casting around for scapegoats, conservatives seem to have found twin evils in the gay community and providers of services needed by and used exclusively by women, particularly family planning services. Never minding, of course, the bigotry and stereotyping that the use of this particular scapegoat betrays.\n \n A priceless quote from a conservative \"intellectual\" about the gay community can be found in the November, 1996 issue of Commentary, a conservative intellectual journal. Norman Podhoretz wrote: \"Men using one another as women constitutes a perversion. To my unreconstructed mind, this is as true as ever; and so far as I am concerned it would still be true even if gay sex no longer entailed the danger of infection and even if everything about it were legalized by all 50 states and ratified by all nine justices of the Supreme Court.\" Of course, he might as well have said that to his pre-Enlightenment mind, it didn't matter how effectively he was proven wrong, he'd still believe he was right. As gay men and lesbians come out of the closet and prove such stereotypes wrong, the \"unreconstructed\" minds of such \"intellectuals\" start looking like the sorry lot of just-plain bigots they are. Yet such is the neo-conservative mentality of holding prejudices more dearly than the truth, just because it is so very, very comforting to believe yourself right in spite of all evidences to the contrary.\n \n In international relations, the laissez-faire ideology promotes the openness of borders and the internationalization of markets. It is doctrine that everyone benefits by the reduction of trade barriers on the assumption that the doctrine of \"comparative advantage\" will cause everyone in the world to do what is most economically advantageous.\n \n What this doctrine fails to consider is that, although about the only comparative advantage Bolivia has in international trade is in beef production, not everyone in Bolivia wants to be a cowboy. Nor the fact that while Mexico can build car engines cheaper than the United States, it may not be in America's strategic interests to become dependent on Mexico for all of its car engines. It was no surprise during the North America Free Trade Agreement debate that predictions were made that many American jobs would be lost to Mexico. Indeed, the threat of moving production to Mexico is routinely used by American manufacturers to extract wage and benefit concessions from American workers. Is this really in the workers' interests? \n \n The result of NAFTA as of this writing has been a net loss of about 112,000 American jobs to Mexico. One might think that Mexico has benefitted greatly, but the reality is that most of the profits earned by American business operating in Mexico have been repatriated to the United States. Investment in native business in Mexico has been stifled by competition from American businesses seeking the resources for their own operations. How Mexico has benefitted by this is difficult to see. Indeed, Mexico has seen a net loss of nearly a million jobs, because of stiff competition from American and Canadian businesses, who have deprived the native companies of their markets. So even the gains of the 'maquiladora' employment has been more than offset by the loss of employment in local businesses. That this situation has led to a net loss of opportunity for both Mexican and American workers is easy to see, in spite of the fact that the non-interventionist doctrine would claim that the opposite should have occurred. \n \n Why Do Conservatives Believe What They Do?\n As has been mentioned, conservatives often come to their views through personal experience and familial socialization. Seldom does a conservative arrive at that point of view through rigorous intellectual discourse. Here's why:\n When you're hurt by someone, it is easy and natural to lash out at the person who hurt you. The same obviously holds true of being hurt by government. When you've been audited by the tax authorities, been fined for driving a polluting car or had difficulty getting a building permit, government is easy to blame. With government being a ubiquitous presence, it isn't surprising that large numbers of people end up being hurt by it at one time or another.\n \n Government in your mind then becomes the problem, and if others tell you that you're right in assuming that government is the problem, it isn't hard to accept an economic or social theory that agrees with that point of view. Indeed, it even becomes \"common sense\" in that the synergy of components of the emerging world view become self evident.\n \n Hence, the social theories that, on the face of it, decry \"social engineering\" (even though frequently engaging in it, usually in matters relating to sexuality or drug use), sound like a logical extension of this world view. Social problems, therefore, become the fault of a meddling government (hence the favorite conservative saying, \"a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged\"). Unfortunately, as we shall see, the world isn't quite that simple.\n \n This is especially true of conservative economic theories. Capitalist free enterprise as a model is very appealing to those who entertain this anti-government bias. Adam Smith claimed in his classic, \"The Wealth of Nations,\" that unrestrained accumulation of capital is good for the economy, because it allows the creation of large pools of investment capital. Thus, conservatives are given a reason for restraining government from intervening in the accumulation of wealth. Smith also argued that the most efficient way of arriving at the true value of a good or service is to see what price it will bring in an free and unrestrained market. Again, reason for keeping the meddling hands of government out of the market. But again, the world isn't that simple. No reasonable conservative would argue that the most efficient way to keep the price of paramedic service to a minimum, for example, is to allow the free market to set the price. When you're having a heart attack, you're not going to argue with the ambulance driver over the price of the ride to the hospital. Yet the reality is that this is what many conservatives unthinkingly propose.\n \n Conservatives often ask me, what is the problem with personal experience? Well, nothing, actually. It's perfectly fine as far as it goes. It's useful, even neccessary. The personal experience of the upper-class privileged male is just as valid as is the experience of the poor, the woman, the minority. As far as it goes.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \"It is no accident that conservatism has arisen at the same time the public education system in the United States has declined.\n It is also no accident that conservatism is strongest in the same parts of America where education is weakest.\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The problem is that personal experience is far too limited a basis on which to try to build a philosophy with which to run the world. It is my contention that no one, no matter how diverse his life experiences, is ever going to learn enough about the complexity of the world around him to build a coherent philosophy of politics in the absence of a good education. Indeed, it is the increasing rarity of good education, in my opinion, that is reason that conservatism is not only increasing in popularity, but increasing in influence as well. Liberalism, having been built over the centuries by the more educated, is more inclusive of this different knowledge, not gained by experience. And this is why conservatives have always been generally suspicious of institutions of higher learning.\n \n Ahem.",

All creaky and over 70 or 80?\n\n \n \n actually they have one member sitting in the White House who began life with 2 communist parents and grew up to vote to the left of Bernie Sanders. Our communists gave the bomb to Stalin and took the 5th when poor Joe McCarthy merely asked them if they were communists.\n \n They succeeded however in establishing the principle that its rude to ask treasonous communists if they are treasonous communists. Still, the communists were largely driven underground and now surface as liberals but with the same creeping socialist agenda:\n \n Norman Thomas[American Communist presidential candidate] quotes: \n \"The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism. But under the name of 'liberalism' they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist program, until one day America will be a Socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.\"",
