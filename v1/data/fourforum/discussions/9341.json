   "Lets break this down. Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights. The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state.\n \n Now, if I sat a flower pot down next to you, would you tell me it should have rights and that we should make pot smashing murder? Probably not. BUT, what if that pot started to talk to you. Started to ask you questions about life, and started to ask you where it was and what its purpose was. What if you had a casual conversation with this pot? Now, obviously, this pot should have rights, am I not correct? Since I'm a hardcore trekkie (and I know quoting star trek isn't the best debate, but its a good analogy), I can relate to what Commander data was going through. In case you didn't know, Commander Data is an anderoid, a Robot. But, he is hard to tell apart from a human. When he was first being built, he was not considered a sentient being. He was a bunch of parts, but when those parts were put together and he was activated, it was then he was considered a sentient being deserving of rights. This can very much relate to an embryo. An embryo is in early stages. It is like commander data in parts. They did not consider data a sentient being deserving of rights. However once he was activated, the captain and the crew had to defend his rights on numerous occasions. An embryo can also be like a flower pot. Even though that flower pot may have the capability to develop intelligence, it lacks intelligence. But, as i said before, if that flower pot started talking to you, then it obviously has developed intelligence and is deserving of rights. The same goes with your computer. If it becomes self aware, and starts talking to you, it is then that it deserves rights.\n \n \n Simply because an embryo shares some human DNA is no excuse to grant it an exception. I know many of you will bring up eugenics and the mentally ill, but the mentally do posses intelligence. Maybe not as much as you or I, but they still posses it.",

   "Shooterandproud,\n \n I would be a bit wary of using the word \"intelligence\" as a criteria for personhood. Since you alternatively mentioned \"sentience\" and \"self-awareness\", I assume that you also allow for sub-conscious mental existence to qualify for personhood. After all, when we sleep, we still mentally exist. Perhaps you could try to clarify, then, what your minimal criteria is for that mental existence.\n \n Steeeeve,\n \n I know that, from earlier discussions, you claim that you present no minimal criteria for personhood since you view that any such criteria would be arbitrary (if I am mis-stating that, then please reclarify). However, I know that you also agree that an unfertilized egg is not a person. Since you believe that an unfertilized egg is not a person (or an entity deserving of rights) and a fertilized egg IS a person (deserving of rights), then, logically, this means that something in that transition from unfertilized to fertilized egg (i.e. conception) turned a non-person into a person.

Better safe than sorry would not be good enough. Religious reasons would not be acceptable since not everyone follows the same religion. \n \n Since Scientific knowledge about the details of the development of the fetus (particularly the development of the mind) are limited, there is the question whether one should err on the side of caution in determining fetal rights or on the side of certainty. With my stance of a rudimentary mental existence being required for \"personhood\" or a right to life, and given the understanding of Science that this cannot happen BEFORE the third trimester, I am willing to err on the side of caution and set my views of the limit on abortion to the beginning of the third trimester (when a first possibility of mental existence can emerge). This leaves a lot of time for women to decide to have their abortions - indeed 99% do have abortions before that time and the rest generally have them for valid reasons (risk to life, etc.). If the highly improbable event happens that there comes to light some Scientific finding suggesting that a rudimentary mind could start earlier, then the closer that hypothetical finding would come to conception, the more certainty I would expect in the finding - i.e. I would err less on the side of caution and more on the side of certainty.\n \n My thought on that was meant to be joined with the previous which referred to humans. An unfertilized egg is by no means a human and will never grow into one as an unfertilized egg no matter how much care it is given.\n\n So do I understand you correctly that the critical change from non-person to person is that the growth process starts?

The main point I make is that human and person are the same.\n\n Ok then. I guess that, for you, the significant transition that leads to the new classification of personhood is the beginning of the growth process. For me, it is the beginning of a rudimentary mind. Now that we have outlined what we each consider the critical transition, perhaps we could go on to the question of WHY that particular transition is critical for us. I'll start.\n \n For me, a rudimentary mind is important since that is what makes a \"something\" into a \"someone\". I cannot empathize with a thing (even if it is alive) as I can with a mental entity. I do have compassion for animals that can feel emotions, fear, suffering but do not place their lives and rights on an equal basis with humans - I am prejudiced that way toward my own species. \n \n A zygote cannot feel pain or emotions or hope or even any sense of self - it is thus still a \"thing\". A near term fetus, however, does feel pain, emotion, thought similar to that of a newborn. An early third trimester fetus (soon after the cerebral cortex reaches sufficient development) might start to have some sense of self, thought, emotion - even if they are rudimentary and subconscious. That is significant to me because that is when they might start to mentally exist - a \"something\" has the possibility of becoming a \"someone\" with whom I might empathize. If I empathize with a thing, then I would just be attaching a personality or individuality where one doesn't exist. Therefore, I cannot rationally have any sympathy or empathy with a zygote, embryo or early fetus. I can respect the potential of that zygote to grow and become more, but that potential for growth does not in itself give it rights, in my view.\n \n So, why is the initiation of the growth process so critical for you?",

   "A completely non-biased site is hard to find. The first page and a half of Google results were all Christian pro-life sites and one Christian pro-choice site. This one was the first that seemed to present a less one-sided opinion. I guess it is all a matter of degree.\nI have yet to find a site regarding abortion that is even remotely fair. The problem with \"religioustolereance\" is that they don't try to figure out truth...they try to present \"both sides\" in an effort to be tolerant even if the other side is way off base. Plus it is poorly researched as seen with their Exodus quote.\n \n \nOk then. I guess that, for you, the significant transition that leads to the new classification of personhood is the beginning of the growth process. For me, it is the beginning of a rudimentary mind. Now that we have outlined what we each consider the critical transition, perhaps we could go on to the question of WHY that particular transition is critical for us. I'll start.\nI don't like looking at it this way. A person is no different from a human in my view. Yours goes from cell to human to person (ie conception is where human begins). I just don't find a difference in the term so the last step doesn't exist. So one transition vs. two transitions is what we are looking at.",

I just don't find a difference in the term so the last step doesn't exist. So one transition vs. two transitions is what we are looking at.\n\n Both of us have decided upon a point within the pregnancy when a non-person becomes a person. For you, that is conception (the unfertilized egg - a non-person - becomes a fertilized zygote - a person). For me, it is the approximate period when a fetus starts to have a mental existence - sometime during the third trimester (which, erring on the side of caution, I allocate as the beginning of the third trimester). \n \n When you say that, for you, a person and a human are the same thing, that is not telling me anything.

I tend not to use the term \"a human\" because it seems to have conflicting definitions.

   "Lets break this down. Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights. The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state.\n\n \n And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter.\n \n \nBut, i would much rather have late terms legal than have them banned.\n\n \n So, whether the embryo/fetus/whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue. Because, for pro-choice folk, even if it has rights, it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed.\n \n Of course, it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections. But I'll let that slide for now.\n \n \nNow, if I sat a flower pot down next to you, would you tell me it should have rights and that we should make pot smashing murder? Probably not. BUT, what if that pot started to talk to you. Started to ask you questions about life, and started to ask you where it was and what its purpose was. What if you had a casual conversation with this pot? Now, obviously, this pot should have rights, am I not correct? Since I'm a hardcore trekkie (and I know quoting star trek isn't the best debate, but its a good analogy), I can relate to what Commander data was going through. In case you didn't know, Commander Data is an anderoid, a Robot. But, he is hard to tell apart from a human. When he was first being built, he was not considered a sentient being. He was a bunch of parts, but when those parts were put together and he was activated, it was then he was considered a sentient being deserving of rights. This can very much relate to an embryo. An embryo is in early stages. It is like commander data in parts. They did not consider data a sentient being deserving of rights. However once he was activated, the captain and the crew had to defend his rights on numerous occasions. An embryo can also be like a flower pot. Even though that flower pot may have the capability to develop intelligence, it lacks intelligence. But, as i said before, if that flower pot started talking to you, then it obviously has developed intelligence and is deserving of rights. The same goes with your computer. If it becomes self aware, and starts talking to you, it is then that it deserves rights.\n\n \n The pro-life side does not try to sort out what/who DESERVES rights. The real question is whether something/someone HAS rights. For the pro-life side, it is a forgone conclusion that all human beings have rights (whether they deserve them or not). Pro-lifers consider human beings as rights-holders, but they do not believe they are rights-givers.\n \n Thus, for pro-lifers, human beings hold rights by virtue of what they are (human beings), not by virtue of what they can do (think or speak?). Thus, for pro-lifers the only question that is important in the abortion debate is whether the embryo is a human being. And, so long as this question is at least debatable (as it clearly is), then the pro-life view exercises caution.\n \n \nSimply because an embryo shares some human DNA is no excuse to grant it an exception. I know many of you will bring up eugenics and the mentally ill, but the mentally do posses intelligence. Maybe not as much as you or I, but they still posses it.\n\n \n For pro-lifers, it is not simply because an embryo shares human DNA. It is because the embryo is a human being. It makes no differences whether the embryo is developing, for it is then simply a developing human being.\n \n \nFurthermore, if a pot started talking to you then perhaps you should lay off of the pot yourself.\n\n \n I also happen to believe that this is the best response that could be made to this thread.",

   "And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable.\n\n If you don't mind, I would like to jump in to make a comment here. I have heard some people argue here that, if third trimester abortion bans were allowed, that would lead to a slippery slope of ALL abortions being outlawed and that, either way, there are very few third trimester abortions (~1% of abortions) and most of those are done for valid reasons (ex. risk to mothers life, health, etc.). \n \n I can understand the concerns and arguements behind these arguements and understand that political realities can sometimes lead to political choices that do not match ones morality. However, what we say on these forums has very little if any influence on what will actually happen in political reality so I think it is important for us to be intellectually honest here about what state of abortion rights we would ideally prefer to exist. Some people are just too scared of the slippery slope of the opposition to allow themselves to be intellectually honest. This actually works both ways, since I have heard that there are pro-life people who would otherwise accept abortion in the very earliest stages (first weeks, etc.) but are themselves afraid of the opposite slippery slope.\n \n I personally would make third trimester abortions illegal for most cases except for a few exeptions, including high risk to the mother's life or severe health reprecussions. If you are interested in the views of pro-choice people in general on this issue, the numbers come out of the statistics. From the most recent poll I have seen touching upon this subject: a CNN/USA Today Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3. , http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm\n (quote is reformatted since it does not cut/paste well)\n \nThinking more generally: Do you think abortion should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the following stages of pregnancy? How about [see below]?\n \n In the first three months of pregnancy:\n 66% Legal, 29% Illegal, 3% Depends, 2% Unsure\n \n In the second three months of pregnancy:\n 25% Legal, 68% Illegal, 4% Depends, 3% Unsure\n \n In the last three months of pregnancy:\n 10% Legal, 84% Illegal, 4% Depends, 2% Unsure\n\n \n Though I might disagree with the majority about the legality of second trimester abortions, most people in the US (2/3rds) believe that first trimester abortions should be legal while the great majority (84%) believe it should be illegal in the third trimester. What this 84% statistic tells me is that the great majority of pro-choice people also believe that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal - I would estimate that 68% of them believe that. (Here, I assume that 50% of people are pro-choice and 50% are pro-life and that all pro-life people think third trimester abortions should be illegal. So (84% - 50%)/50% = 68%).\n \n \nThus, for pro-lifers, human beings hold rights by virtue of what they are (human beings), not by virtue of what they can do (think or speak?). Thus, for pro-lifers the only question that is important in the abortion debate is whether the embryo is a human being. And, so long as this question is at least debatable (as it clearly is), then the pro-life view exercises caution.\n \n\n That may be all well and good but what exactly do you mean by \"human being\"? Every time I hear that term used, it implies a mental existence. What is your definition of \"human being\"? What qualities do you ascribe to that term that you use and which of those qualities do you value?",

Science can show a limit when mental existence can first start but cannot yet show what level of mental existence happens at which stage of human development.\n\n \n Even the term mental existence needs to be defined somehow (which you have done). Some pro-choicers have told me that self-awareness (which comes after birth) is when you are a person. Some have said the ability to reason is the point but \"reasoning\" develops from just before birth to well into your 20s. All of these ideas are about picking a point though and it is the picking of a point that I disagree with.\n \n And yeah, I am in dead agreement with Phyllis...she pretty much seems to speak for me (sometimes)...and probably does a better job at it too :).\n \n You just made a few comments to Phyllis about people's views. I honestly think that people don't understand the abortion debate and what they are talking about. I think if people really understood the issue and related to their own life the numbers would probably be different (and probably not benefit me any)...but that's neither here nor there :)\n \n \nThat may be all well and good but what exactly do you mean by \"human being\"? Every time I hear that term used, it implies a mental existence. What is your definition of \"human being\"? What qualities do you ascribe to that term that you use and which of those qualities do you value?\nI think Phyllis and I agree that this term means what it has always meant which is the meaning in the dictionary.\n \n \nhuman being\n -noun\n 1. any individual of the genus Homo, esp. a member of the species Homo sapiens.\n 2. a person, esp. as distinguished from other animals or as representing the human species: living conditions not fit for human beings; a very generous human being.\n",

   "Some pro-choicers have told me that self-awareness (which comes after birth) is when you are a person.\n ...\n I think Phyllis and I agree that this term means what it has always meant which is the meaning in the dictionary.\n\n Self-awareness perhaps may come after birth but many people might confuse that term with \"sense of self\", which is different. Just like most animals feel pain but don't analyze it as a separate reaction of the body (it just makes them feel bad), late-fetuses and early babies might have a sense of self without recognizing it as the intellectual concept \"I\". It is a hard concept to verbalize since we don't have a proper language to describe it, but it is that central center of mental existence which registers the pain, which either feels or controls the emotions or thoughts, etc. If (in a hypothetical but impossible scenario) each of our cells were independent and didn't communicate with the other, then we would have no sense of self - just a functioning body. That sense of self is the core of our mental existence - the very minimum necessary for it to exist - and it does not exist in the newly fertilized egg. There is no \"somebody\" in there yet and won't be for a long time.\n \n The trouble I have with arguements from the pro-life camp (including you and Phillis) about the value of \"human beings\" or \"a human\" is that most of the emotional appeals which are made to these terms presuppose a mental existence. I highly suspect that there is a lot of anthropomorphising (attaching of personality or mental existence where there is none) going on when it comes to pro-life people calling a zygote a \"human being\". Indeed, I have even read fictional letters from the early unborn that attach to it a very wide range of feelings and emotions which it is impossible for it to have. \n \n I can understand how people can empathize with living beings, human or otherwise, that can feel, have emotions, pain, etc. What I cannot understand is how people can have sympathy or empathy for entities that have no mental existence - i.e. objects - without falsely attaching a non-existent personality to it. I can understand that such false attachments of personality can be part of human nature - I do it myself. For example, if a tree is cut down, there is a part of me that feels sorry for the tree and imagines it suffering. There is no logical reason for those thoughts - I am simply falsely attaching a personality to that tree. The same thing goes for images of mangled manicans, scenes of suffering shown in the movies, etc. We imagine that the images we see are scenes of real suffering. I understand those emotions. However, the issue of abortion rights is far too important to let those emotions stand as they are. We have to have strong logical reasons if we are going to take someone's rights away and the imagined sufferings of a zygote are not in the least bit logical.\n \n Anyway, all this comes down to is that I have a strong suspicion that this false attachment of an imagined personality is the main reason behind the pro-life view restricting abortion from conception on. Lacking another compelling arguement from the pro-life camp, I believe that this is the main emotional draw to its cause - an emotional draw that may well be valid in late stages of pregnancy but is just a symptom of overactive imagination when it comes to early stages. Otherwise, it is simply an assumption that mental existence can already be present in the zygote with the presence of a supernatural soul - but those are religious arguements that the pro-life camp is wise not to introduce.",

Emotions, mental existence, and all of that stuff is really irrelevant.\n\n There is a difference between having emotions about something and having emotions for something. You may have emotions about a watch because it gives you pleasure, it may have been a gift that you feel responsibility in keeping, etc. All of those emotions revolve around your needs, your desires. You are not feeling sorry for the watch itself. It is not the rights of the watch which are being trampled if it is destroyed, it is your rights.

Would they have the right to retaliate against you for what they imagined you had done? All this says is that it is not sufficient to make a law simply because you feel emotional about an issue.

I know that many who are strongly religious follow a moral code that is not based on a mixture of rationality and empathy but one that is dictated to them by their religion - with the assumption of that code being passed on from an all-knowing, all-powerful being - i.e. God - and that it must therefore me unquestioned. Perhaps your view of the \"fundamental value for human life...and all human life\" comes from just such an externally dictated code and you are simply unwilling to admit to that since you know the reprecussions in debate if you admit to that code coming from religion.

You can call me a goat if you like but I still am what I am even if I'm now called a goat.\n\n Yes, I know that she is referring to the beginnings of human life - i.e. when the newly fertilized egg, now with a full set of DNA, starts to grow into what will become something similar to you, me and all of us. That definition was bland enough that \"member\" probably does just mean part (as opposed to individual, or person). \n \n One problem I have is that terms like \"a human\", \"a person\", \"a human being\" have almost purely been used for born people in general discussions other than the very narrow discussions of the abortion debate. Therefore, in general useage, they have often acquired the assumption of mental existence - an assumption that is outside of the textbook definition for \"a human\" or 'human being'. I know that I am far from being the only one that makes that connection with those words. Therefore, when an appeal is made to value the life of \"human beings\", many may not have a zygote in mind because that does not match their own definition of human being.\n \n Anyway, as you say, I know what Phyllis means by that. The main question I have to both of you is \"Why should we cherish the lives of human beings, given the specific definition that you use?\" or perhaps I can be more specific: \"Why should we cherish the lives of zygotes?\".

   "I will comment right now that the idea of a \"fundamental value of human life\" is a religious belief. But any value for anything is a belief of some kind (and probably a religious one...although maybe not from an organized religion)...there is no rationality for morality and at some point we just generally have to agree or disagree on certain fundamental principals.\n\n I don't really agree with you there. Rational arguements can and do play a large role in our moral stances - not that we always use that rationality. The philosopher Kant came up with a general moral guideline that works fairly well. He called it the Categorical Imperative and was summed up as \"Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it would become a universal law.\". This is fairly close to the \"treat others as you would be treated\" guideline that many, including myself, try to follow. There is a logic to those guidelines.\n \n You might possibly argue that, if we do not base our morality on strictly defined unquestioned proclamations and leave it up for interpretation and debate, then moral anarchy would result. If so, then I would disagree. There are definite trends in human morality independent of religion. Don't you think that it is more than a coincidence that the great majority of cultures in the world have moral rules against murder, theft, rape, and other such crimes? It is generally the biologically originated human emotion of compassion which tends to drive many of these commonalities in world morality. Compassion or empathy coupled with logical analysis are a great combination for use in determining moral codes.\n \n The trouble with basing morality on unquestionable proclamations is that many such proclamations might be arbitrary. For example, the proclamation that Homosexuality is wrong seems quite arbitrary, not only to homosexuals, but to a large portion of those of us who are heterosexual. The proclamation that \"human life needs to be cherished above all from the moment of conception onward\" is also a somewhat arbitrary proclamation. Many would disagree about when that human life becomes developed enough to join the human community of people and have its life so strongly cherished. Islam is full of unquestioned proclamations that has, in some cases, resulted in rather oppressive societies - especially oppresive for women. I believe strongly that we have to have good reasons behind our moral stances. This may not lead to full agreement, but at least discussion of moral issues will help us all gain some common ground, while preventing unjust moral stances from taking power.",

   "I don't really agree with you there. Rational arguements can and do play a large role in our moral stances - not that we always use that rationality. The philosopher Kant came up with a general moral guideline that works fairly well. He called it the Categorical Imperative and was summed up as \"Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it would become a universal law.\". This is fairly close to the \"treat others as you would be treated\" guideline that many, including myself, try to follow. There is a logic to those guidelines.\n \n You might possibly argue that, if we do not base our morality on strictly defined unquestioned proclamations and leave it up for interpretation and debate, then moral anarchy would result. If so, then I would disagree. There are definite trends in human morality independent of religion. Don't you think that it is more than a coincidence that the great majority of cultures in the world have moral rules against murder, theft, rape, and other such crimes? It is generally the biologically originated human emotion of compassion which tends to drive many of these commonalities in world morality. Compassion or empathy coupled with logical analysis are a great combination for use in determining moral codes.\n This still doesn't show a logical reason for these things. You just gave me a \"natural law\" which is still a religion in the sense that it is a set of beliefs but \"logic\" and \"reason\" play no rule in the development of these. \n \n \n\n The trouble with basing morality on unquestionable proclamations is that many such proclamations might be arbitrary. For example, the proclamation that Homosexuality is wrong seems quite arbitrary, not only to homosexuals, but to a large portion of those of us who are heterosexual. The proclamation that \"human life needs to be cherished above all from the moment of conception onward\" is also a somewhat arbitrary proclamation. Many would disagree about when that human life becomes developed enough to join the human community of people and have its life so strongly cherished. Islam is full of unquestioned proclamations that has, in some cases, resulted in rather oppressive societies - especially oppresive for women. I believe strongly that we have to have good reasons behind our moral stances. This may not lead to full agreement, but at least discussion of moral issues will help us all gain some common ground, while preventing unjust moral stances from taking power.\nNo good reason behind it at all and you haven't shown one either. You can't say \"everyone has these basic ideas so therefore these morals are right\". That uses circular reasoning which is unreasonable. Beliefs are not based on logic and reason but faith that they exist. I don't see a problem with this...in fact, if \"everyone had the idea that slavery is ok\" (which was once a true thought) then I'd still say it is wrong. There is no logic and reason in a belief system that is relative.",

The idea was apparently never considered that, if one were to take an infant from that less succesful African nation and nurture him in the same conditions as a white infant from a successful European nation, he would very likely be just as successful as the white infant. The illogic was in ignoring logical analysis when it didn't match with preconceived notions that were convenient for racists to hold.

What is it that you don't understand about this point that I am making? \n \nwell ok...if I have a moral system that says all humans are worthy of life then abortion would obviously be the only consistent rule from that.\n\n If all of the people in your group held the same goal of protecting all human life (including zygotes), then that moral system might work for them since no one would be hurt by those rules. The problem with strictly defined moral systems comes in when there are disagreements - differences of opinion on the goals that individuals want in the group, etc. Logical analysis and empathy (trying to understand what the issue is from the other person's point of view) helps prevent one group from imposing arbitrary or purely self-serving rules on another group.\n \n ---\n \n I have presented two approaches to morality - logical analysis and empathy/compassion - which have the capability of excluding many of the most nasty aspects of human societies (nasty in that they have caused a lot of un-necessary and involuntary human suffering). \n \n The only alternative you propose is an alternative that is almost purely arbitrary - i.e. the imposition of rules on society based on religion. You can present no evidence that any rules based on religion would be superior. All you have is a list of rules that have been passed down from generation to generation. The only observable facts are of fallable people simply making unsupported claims that these rules are divinely inspired. There would be many things you would have to prove to justify those religious rules:\n 1) You would have to prove that God exists\n 2) If God is proven to exist, you would then have to prove that the rules which you follow were indeed passed down unaltered from God\n 3) If the rules were proven to have come directly from a proven God, you would also have to prove that those rules from God were indeed what is best for humanity (for example, it may turn out that the God that you worship is a mischievous God).\n \n You have evidence for none of those points. Therefore, your rules are nearly arbitrary. I say \"nearly\" since the alternative to rules being devinely ordained is that rules were created by humans. Humans do have limits on the illogic or arbitrariness of rules they come up with (limits of imaginations, limits to their capability for cruelty, etc.) so even the most extreme religions have some limitations on the arbitrariness of their rules. \n \n I do not claim that all religious rules are bad. Many rules have made life easier for a large number of people. Many have calmed the cruel impulses of those who would otherwise cause a lot of human suffering. However, others have un-necessarily caused human suffering. I just don't see how you can categorically claim that the moral rules of religion are in the least bit better than moral rules based on logic and compassion. You have no evidence to justify that claim.",

IF compassion is your number 1 goal then you still can't derive abortion as being right or wrong. Perhaps you might say \"well you can only have compassion for something with a mental existence\". This isn't a logical conclusion based on anything...just belief.\n\n Compassion and empathy have similar definitions. They imply trying to understand the situation / issue from the other persons point of view. If there is no other point of view since no other mentality exists, then how can you have compassion or empathy?",

I still do not know whether or not you agree that having completely arbitrary moral systems would be a bad?\nHuman suffering is probably bad....my moral system happens to agree there. \n \n Logic doesn't make a moral system completely not arbitrary but it does help with coming up with conclusions based on that moral system so you are at least not arbitrarily making moral judgments. So in that sense we both wouldn't have an arbitrary moral system. Someone that didn't would be called a moral relativists as this is based on the idea that morals are arbitrary (meaning there is no right and wrong).

Things can be interpreted so many ways its not even funny.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI shudder to think what that document would have said if your view had been the predominant one.

In fact, we really have no purpose in life, we just life to not kill other lives.\n \n \n \n \n \nYour worldview is one of elitism where you get to decide who deserves rights. But how does one determine this?\n\n \n My worldview is of logic and mathematics. It just takes common sense. If I was the lead chef in a fancy resturant, and i was making steak for some very important guests and there were two stakes (or stake, whichever is proper plural). Lets say the president was sitting at one table, even though i dislike our president, i still respect him. Now, there are two stakes I can use in his dinner. One stake is fresh and succulent and very tasty,uncooked. I'm not going to go \"eeny meeny miny mo\" on the stakes, just because they're stakes and should obviously give him the cooked stake over the uncooked, as the uncooked will harm him. Now, some call that \"elitist\" or \"discrimination\", i call it common sense.\n \n \n \n \n \nDo rights actually exist? I doubt you can say so since you are asking how to determine if something DESERVES rights.\n\n \n What is our purpose in life if they do not exist.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a human being.\n\n \n Who determines that?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat's what is so important about it. I'll say it again because you seem to have missed it the first time: the embryo is valued by virtue of what it is (a human being), not by virtue of what it can or cannot do (solve math problems, or perform chemical experiments).\n\n \n However, the only proof you have that an embryo is a human is that it shares human DNA. Thats a pretty flimsy argument.\n \n \n \n \n \nI don't doubt it. The fundamental problem I have with this thread is that it seems to presuppose that rights do not actually exist.\n\n \n It presumes that rights do exist, but for sentient beings.

I haven't read your post yet but I really do hate philosophy so is it possible for us to narrow this down to the following:\n \n 1) My worldview states we value from the beginning of human life (conception)\n 2) Your worldview states we value from the beginning of a \"mental existence\"\n 3) From our worldview, our stance on abortion makes logical sense\n 4) Both worldviews are arbitrary but nontheless are there\n \n That would make my half day at work so much better :) But if you want me to read your post and go on just say \"please reply\" and I'll suck it up haha.\n\n I agree with most of that summation. I do think that, ultimately, there are trends in moral philosophy that keep our worldviews from being completely arbitrary. I suspect that there probably does exist some common core view of morality that we share that we can work off of. That is part of what I was hoping to get out of the discussion - a common starting point from which we could try to reach some consensus. \n \n However, I admit that, yes, it does delve pretty deeply into philosophy and, though ultimately quite relevant to the abortion debate, does stray fairly far from common abortion topics. So, I guess I agree with you to just leave things as things stand and go back to the usual topics. Besides, I will be travelling for the next days and will only have limited time for forum discussion.\n \n Happy holidays.",

This is generally why I respect your posts above many others (such as large red print man)...the idea that you \"want gay rights\" and \"want the death penalty\" and \"want abortion\" and \"love the Iraq War\" and then you go and try to form a worldview to accomplish that is just stupid.",

Sorry if I sound mean, but I take debate serious.\n \n \n \n \nI agree. It is the beginning. Not a human life, at least not yet.\n\n \n How wrong you are.\n \n \n \nWhere did you get this idea?

Animals don't share the same right as humans (human humans, not embryos). I cannot legally vote. The mentally ill cannot legally drive. And embryo cannot overpower a woman's body.\n\n \n Of course an embryo cannot overpower a womans body. If it could, there would be alot less abortions. In certain circumstances, intelligence is the basis of rights. But in the instance that the person cannot think for themselves, then the rights of that person would be entrusted to someone who can make a decision for them, until they can make it for themselves. \n \n An example is with young children, babies, and toddlers, who cannot make decisions for themselves. At the moment they are incapable of making sound decisions based on their health, their living conditions, and their all around welfare. So parents make those decicions for them. That is the same with an embryo. At the moment it cannot think for itself, because it has yet to develop to that stage. So the mother must make decisions for the baby forming in her womb. \n \n That dose not mean that it has no right to live, but merely that it needs to mature in the belly. Just as we don't take a toddler off and kill it, because it can't make important decisions. We shouldn't do that when it comes, to an embryo. BTW, you're asking for my sources, let me see yours, backing up what you're saying.\n \n \n \n \n \nIn that case, you better start having sex right now, because every moment you're not, you're denying a human a right to exist.\n\n \n This is a premature statement, and has nothing to do with the topic. If you feel it dose, then enlighten me. Otherwise, just leave it alone.\n \n \n \nSee above. My sperm can become a human, but masturbation isn't illegal. Its not illegal for girls (or women) to have periods. I still don't understand your logic here.\n\n \n As you also don't understand your own statements that you just made. Because if you did, then you would not have made such a folly, as to say what you said in the above statement about periods, and masturbation. So let me break this down to you.\n \n Masturbation- Stimulating oneself, through the playing of ones genital areas. \n \n Now, this has nothing to do with abortion. I see where you're trying to go with the mention of this, but I'm sorry buddy. It makes no sense. Expecially sense, you are not killing an embryo. Yes sperm is vital for reproudution. You have billions, upon billions of sperm in each testical. So whatever comes out, in the instance that a very desprate person trys to please themselves. It is not enough to empty the testicals, and render the person from having children. So this has nothing to do with abortion. Since men are constantly generating sperm. Unless they have a low sperm count.\n \n Periods- The cleaning out of the uterus, overies, and other female organs.\n \n Why is this so important?! Because if a woman has not used her eggs(meaning has not gotten pregnant) Then the unfertilized egg is discarded, leaving room for a new egg to drop, and be fertilized. In order for women to have healthy pregnancies, they must have a healthy reproductive system. If they don't, then they as well as any embryo can beocme very sick.This also has nothing to do with abortion, since this is not an instance where an embryo that was fertilized is being aborted. \n \n I think its better if you had more knowledge of the things you pin-point so that you are not making claims that have nothing to do with the topic at hand.\n \n \n \nShe did. That such a coincidence, because she did watch a lot of star trek with my dad while she was pregnant. And I mean, A LOT.\n\n \n That explains your opening statements.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nAnd here's an example why our culture has not embraced logic yet. What if your parents had a headache when they were going to have sex and decided not to and you weren't concieved? Think about all the things you enjoy now, they would've never happened if your parents had a headache and decided not to have sex.\n\n \n That would have been alot differant then having intercourse, see that you are pregnant, and aborting it. At least if they decided to have intercourse later, I would still have had a chance to born. Since they both still hold the dna that would be useful in making me. Wheher they had sex that night or not, they still could have had me anytime, they had intercourse. So I can see where your argument is flawed, and lacks logic. \n \n \n \n \nIf they did decide to abort me, it would've been before I existed. You can only legally abort in the first and second trimester, and that was before I existed. \"I\" came to exist somewhere in the third trimester, when I gained mental existance and awareness. Before that, the embryo was just a cellular watersack. Your logic is extremely flawed, more so that most of the pro-lifers on these forums. I would think a bit deeper about your position before coming and posting it onto here.\n\n \n \n On the contrary. If I were you, I would think more deeply before I uttered another statement on this topic. It is your logic that is flawed. And that is why you are making so many mistakes when it comes to your posts. Because everything you said, is extremely flawed. And don't worry, I'll take the time to break down why that is, with every statement you post up here. Ending on this note.\n \n You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement. And shows an illogical viewpoint. Non-exsisting is when there is no evidence of any life form once-so-ever in the womb. Meaning no cell forms, and no water sack.\n \n But the fact that you yourself stated that you would only be a watersack, shows that there dose exsist a life form in the womb. The water sack is protecting the cells that are forming in the womb. Which is an early stage of life. If there was no lifeform there would be no watersack, and no cell formation. So to say a human life form is non-exsistant at that stage is a falsehood. People say that only to justiify their actions when deciding to abort. \n \n I think maybe you should explain why a water sack and cells would be in the womb, if nothing exsisted in there, at the first and second trimesters. \n \n Also explain what the cells forming represents, since as you put it, the embryo is non-exsistant in the first and second trimester. Remeber, for something to be non-exsistant, there must be nothing there. No sign of life. Explain why the cells that are supposed to be non-exsistant at the first and second trimesters are there.",

If you poke him/her with a stick he/she will feel pain. If you take his/her toys away he/she will feel sad. A toddler has a brain, and a toddler can think for itself, even though his/her judgment is impaired. And embryo on the other hand, is just a sac of organic material.

I see where you're trying to go with the mention of this, but I'm sorry buddy. It makes no sense.\n\n \n It makes perfect sense.

Ending on this note.\n\n \n Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them. You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek, you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods, and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply.\n \n \n \n [quote]You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement.[quote]\n \n Let me rephrase that. The beginnings of my body existed. What you know as \"me\" the person who's saying this, did not exist. My brain, which is really \"me\" did not exist.\n \n \n \n \nAnd shows an illogical viewpoint. Non-exsisting is when there is no evidence of any life form once-so-ever in the womb. Meaning no cell forms, and no water sack.\n\n \n Its not illogical, you misunderstood. See above.\n \n \n \nBut the fact that you yourself stated that you would only be a watersack, shows that there dose exsist a life form in the womb.\n\n \n I would not have existed without the embryo. But if someone surgically removed my brain and kept me alive by artificial means, I would be dead, regardless of the state of my body.\n \n \n \n \nThe water sack is protecting the cells that are forming in the womb. Which is an early stage of life. If there was no lifeform there would be no watersack, and no cell formation. So to say a human life form is non-exsistant at that stage is a falsehood. People say that only to justiify their actions when deciding to abort.\n\n \n Whether there is a life form or not is not whats being debated. Its whether that life form deserves rights. So many rights that can make another human life form, with intelligence, suffer. That is a debate, i never denied the existence of life inside of the womb.\n \n \n \n \nI think maybe you should explain why a water sack and cells would be in the womb, if nothing exsisted in there, at the first and second trimesters.\n\n \n Something existed in there, but no one existed in there. Do you see what I'm saying?\n \n \n \n \nAlso explain what the cells forming represents, since as you put it, the embryo is non-exsistant in the first and second trimester.\n\n \n Where do you get this crazy idea that the embryo does not exist? I mean theres no one in the embryo, theres no brain, theres no person. I do not deny the existence of basic tissue cells in the embryo\n \n \n \n \nRemeber, for something to be non-exsistant, there must be nothing there. No sign of life. Explain why the cells that are supposed to be non-exsistant at the first and second trimesters are there.\n\n \n Please point out where I said that nothing existed. I said no one existed. There is no neural energy. There is no synaptic pathways. There is no brain for that matter. No one exists. Sure, a cellular structure exists, but that is in no way a person, let alone deserves rights over a woman. It pretty much meets the definition of a parasite, and a woman has every right to remove any parasite or cancer from her body.\n \n \n You still haven't posted a logical reason that an embryo should take a woman's right to choose.\n \n \n And for the record, the \"Star trek\" series demonstrates a very, very high respect for all intelligent life, whether organic, non organic, animal, or humanoid life. You should watch it sometime before making blind insults.",

With our current technology, it also ends up roughly corresponding to the time at which the fetus starts to possibly gain mental existence.

My personal approach to morality does not corrsepond to this.\n 2. The practical reason: Technologies change so at some point the fetus might be artificially supportable outside the womb at a much earlier date (ex. after a few weeks). \n \n If laws were to be set up to outlaw abortion when a fetus CAN be artificially supported, this brings up a whole new can of worms since many poorer women would still be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies since they wouldn't be able to afford having the fetus sustained artificially and I highly doubt that the government would pick up the tab.\n \n That is just my take.

   "Still not good enough for a serious debate like this. Because this is serious, mention of tv characters, and flower pots, seems like your leading the debate off to shaky grounds. Part of starting up a debate is to state your opinons on solid facts. Not Data from star trek, and visions of talking flower pots. Anyone could poke holes in that, and its not based on anything solid. Sorry if I sound mean, but I take debate serious.\n\n I understand why Shooterandproud chose those examples (Shooter, I hope you don't mind me jumping into this debate) - it is because they are examples that people might be familiar with which simultaneously illustrate his point. The trouble is that there really aren't too many good examples out there to illustrate the same point without going into science fiction (i.e. artificial intelligence) and the like. What alternate examples would you have picked to illustrate the same points?\n \nIn certain circumstances, intelligence is the basis of rights. But in the instance that the person cannot think for themselves, then the rights of that person would be entrusted to someone who can make a decision for them, until they can make it for themselves. \n\n The examples you give are of people who cannot think for themselves having decisions made for them (ex. people whose thinking is affected by severe mental illness or children). All of these examples that you might reference are examples where we also would give that person rights because they still have a mental existence. The case of zygotes, embryos and early fetuses is different since they never yet had a mental existence. \n \n You seem to say that POTENTIAL people also deserve rights. We disagree. However, even if you say that anything that CAN become a person deserves rights, then there is still the arbitrary decision to be made about where to draw the line on potential. For ex., why isn't the personhood potential of unfertilized eggs important? \n \nYou said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement. And shows an illogical viewpoint. Non-exsisting is when there is no evidence of any life form once-so-ever in the womb. Meaning no cell forms, and no water sack.\n\n To Shooterandproud and I, existence means mental existence. It comes down to the essence of the sense of self. In a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the point, if your arm were chopped off and artificially kept alive, there would be no sense of \"you\" left in that arm. People could do whatever they liked with that arm and you wouldn't know since it would no longer have anything to do with \"you\". The same with any other part of our body outside our brains (which those of us who follow science claim determines the main essence of thought, emotion, etc.). The core of \"you\" or \"I\" resides in that mental self. Without that mental self, there is nobody yet existing in the body to speak of - just a body (as with that artificially supported severed arm example I gave). That is why we put so much importance on mental existence as the beginning of the existence of people. Physical life is far less important than mental life.",

In what way would you view that severed arm example as being still \"you\" (outside of any sense of ownership)? Namely, in what way are \"you\" still in that arm? \n \nThe cells in the womb are constantly forming, so they are not dead. Nor dose it have any indication of being dead.

They are alive and, yes, that life is human. Why is that so critical? What are the specific attributes of the newly fertilized egg that make it so precious to you? I can understand that it has the POTENTIAL to become someone who we cherish but at that moment, it is still just a thing with the potential of becoming more.\n \n If there were no real person involved in the process of growth of that potential person, then there would probably be no reason to kill it. Most pregnancies are at least attempted to be carried to term since the mother AGREES to carry that pregnancy - her rights (the rights of a real person) are not being violated. The abortion debate centers around the balance of rights between that REAL person and that POTENTIAL person. I choose the real person because I believe what IS is more important than what MIGHT BE. \n \n As for brain activity, science has found that it is in the cerebral cortex that our thought processes, emotions, etc. happen. That is where we EXPERIENCE the pain or other senses that are fed into our brains by our bodies. The cerebral cortex does not develop sufficiently to function in this way until the third trimester. \n \nOur kidnys, and liver, and vital organs, have no mental exsistance of their own. So why not get rid of them huh? They are not mentally aware.

   "I've found that semantics take centerstage in many other forums (I agree it is a pointless exercise). It had thankfully not been the case here. Until now :(\n\n I think that in this and other forums, the reason that the religious right insists on definitions is that many do base much of their morality on unsupported proclamations, so the exact wording used in the proclamations and the definitions of those words are important. For many, such proclamations are based on religion. I am guessing here, but I think that they do not question the proclamation itself (since it is assumed to come from God and, as such, cannnot be questioned) but, if the wording is not absolutely clear, then they think that there must be an authority that can make it clear. They are, in general, much more open to placing their trust in a respected authority without questioning that authority.\n \n For myself, and I suspect you and many others, we do not automatically think a respected authority is right because they are an authority. We find it important to think for ourselves - independently of any authority. Certainly, there are experts in fields that know far more than we do, but we respect them and trust their view not as much for their official authority but for their knowledge and our knowledge that they have answers on hand. Certain institutions have more respect than others only because they have a track record of competence. \n \n Bottom line: we think it is important to think for ourselves and judge for ourselves so reasons behind moral and other issues are more important to us than those on the religious right, who do not think it is as important to think for themselves (since they believe in blind faith in both God and in respected authority). It is a fundamental difference in psychological approach which, among other things, makes those on the religious right dwell on official definitions (i.e. meanings dictated by an authority) as being more important than the underlying substance and reasoning.\n \n Anyway, that is my take on it. Yes it is a generalization. Not all on the religious right are blind in their faith and I do not begrudge those of strong faith their blind devotion. However, I do begrudge them their imposition of their views on others in law when all they base those views on is that blind devotion.",

   "I think that in this and other forums, the reason that the religious right insists on definitions is that many do base much of their morality on unsupported proclamations, so the exact wording used in the proclamations and the definitions of those words are important.\n Well you think wrong.

I respect the fetus for what it is not for what he/she can do or for what you call it.\n \n\n For many, such proclamations are based on religion. I am guessing here, but I think that they do not question the proclamation itself (since it is assumed to come from God and, as such, cannnot be questioned) but, if the wording is not absolutely clear, then they think that there must be an authority that can make it clear. They are, in general, much more open to placing their trust in a respected authority without questioning that authority.\nWhat is with this proclamation kick?

I respect the fetus for what it is not for what he/she can do or for what you call it.\n\n I don't think anyone here is arguing that we should not respect the rights of an early fetus because of a definition of the word \"a human\" or \"person\" not including that. I suppose that one could argue what the law means by \"person\" or what the founders meant by \"person\" but that is another discussion. I think that, in this forum, we are arguing the underlying morality behind abortion rights, not their current legal status.\n \n When arguing about the morality of abortion rights, most of us on the pro-choice side are stating that \"mental existence\" is critically important to us and many of us have stated why that is so critical to us. Whether your definition of \"a human\" involves mental existence or not is not ultimately important.\n \nWhat is with this proclamation kick? A morality system has a basis for development...if you call these 'proclamations\" then you have them too...so big deal if mine is from a God and yours is from yourself or nature or whatever.\n\n I have no problem with people leading their own lives based on moral proclamations.

By the way, you still haven't outlined specifically what proclamations I make.\n \nYet this makes you the authority and thus create your own morality...a reject this idea.\n\n You have every right to reject the idea where your own life is concerned. However, when you try to impose your moral views on others through law, you need to have reasons for those laws. Otherwise, you are imposing your religious views on them - which is something the founders were trying to avoid (given their experience with the Church of England being forced down their throats).\n \nIn all fairness everyone here has dwelled on it ;) You were doing ok until you think definitions matter...they really don't. Even you dwell on definitions of person and things like that. \n\n I didn't mind a short discussion on definitions just so we could communicate. However, I am seeing threads being hijacked by LONG and boring discussions on this topic. If you are arguing definitions so you can communicate, then why not just find some terms you can both agree with so the discussion can continue - meaning BOTH sides compromise (including you) to find some other terms to use or some modifying terms that can keep both sides satisfied. Otherwise, if you think definitions carry meanings that underly the debate, then why not argue the validity of the meanings - not their attachments to particular definitions?",

A woman has the right to her own body. She can do whatever she wants with it unless there are other people involved. In the first and second trimester, nobody else is being hurt since nobody yet mentally exists.

No one would think that a person would stop exsisting without a limb. But a fetus, exsists, the minute the egg is fertilized. Also, if we are talking about brains, the mothers brain, which is mentally aware. Is actually working for the fetus, while it is in her womb. How do you think that the fetus is being formed?! The activity in the mothers womb, is being caused by her mentally aware brain. The functions inside of the mother, is what is helping the womb to function. That is why a baby can only, live for a certain time after a mother dies, because once her brain ceases to work, the baby dies. Because it is depenant on the mothers mental functions, to keep it alive. You may say,\" Thats when a baby is fully developed.\" But I gave that example to show,that even when a baby is a fetus, it has a brian, its mothers. And that is how it develops.

They usually can get the help they need there.\n ...\n Welfare helps young mother with children. Giving them a place to stay, foodstamps,etc. \n ...\n There are ways. Wanting to explore, those ways is another thing.\n\n Currently, relatively few women take advantage of such programs so it certainly might be possible that a woman who searches out help might be able to find it. If abortion became illegal, then such programs would easily become over-run, without being able to handle the volume. \n \n As for whether or not women are weak who do not choose to keep a child, that depends on what you mean. If someone wants to do something or has the responsibility to do something and they cannot because of psychological weakness, then yes, you could call them weak. However, for these unwanted pregnancies, women mostly neither want to have a child nor feel the responsibility that they have to have it, so their decision is not based on weakness. It is based on other factors. The bottom line is that they do not feel the responsibility that they have to raise such a child. You have given no compelling reasons as to why they should feel that responsibility in the first place.\n \nI understand your point about not exsisting without mental awarenes. Even though I disagree. \n\n This is the very issue I was trying to bring out with my arguements - the idea that we do not exist without mental awareness. I am glad to hear you understand it. Now, why do you disagree?\n \nBut a fetus, exsists, the minute the egg is fertilized. Also, if we are talking about brains, the mothers brain, which is mentally aware. Is actually working for the fetus, while it is in her womb. How do you think that the fetus is being formed?! The activity in the mothers womb, is being caused by her mentally aware brain. The functions inside of the mother, is what is helping the womb to function. That is why a baby can only, live for a certain time after a mother dies, because once her brain ceases to work, the baby dies. Because it is depenant on the mothers mental functions, to keep it alive. You may say,\" Thats when a baby is fully developed.\" But I gave that example to show,that even when a baby is a fetus, it has a brian, its mothers. And that is how it develops. Through the functions of its mothers brain, and the sack that it is in, which serves as food, and protecion for the baby.\n\n The mother's brain is not causing the fetus to have any mental awareness. All it is doing is causing her own body to supply the necessary nutrients and environment for the fetus to continue to grow and develop. This arguement is irrelevant to the discussion about the state of the fetus itself. The discussion is not on the general category of \"brains\" but specifically on what characteristics the fetus develops at certain stages of growth - in this case, the sufficient development of the brain to support the mental processes that constitute our mental existence.",

   "Just because your mother was able to take care of your family under the circumstances of poverty does not mean that all women can accomplish that. There are different levels of poverty - ranging from homelessness to situations that are financially stable but lacking in almost all luxuries. I am not sure what level your mother was at, but I doubt that she was in the lowest level.\n\n \n How can you doubt anything without even knowing me?! And what is the cause for your doubt?! Were you there when we were walking the cold streets of New York without any place to stay?!(During a blizzard might I add) Were you there when we went knocking from door to door begging for food?! Or how about opening up a cabinet, and taking a can of babyfood someone left, and feeding it to your kids, while you yourself starve?! Oh and here is one, you go to get help from family, and they turn you away!! So how DARE you say you doubt anything!!! You haven't began to know me, nor what my mother went throught to provide for us!! If it was just a matter of not having luxury, I would not have said anything. But it went further then that. Care to eat you condecending words now?! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlso, your mother may have been a much psychologically stronger individual than many women who find themselves pregnant. I commend her on that psychological strength but you have to understand that not all women are capable of that. People range in abilities - including psychological strength to withstand adversity.\n\n \n Well if they can't stand adversity. How are they dealing with life?! If its not a baby causing the adversity, it will be something else. So they may as well shut themselevs up somewhere. Life is full of adversity. That is what makes it life. Granted, there are a few sweet, tender moments. But there is also some hard knocks.\n \n \nCurrently, relatively few women take advantage of such programs so it certainly might be possible that a woman who searches out help might be able to find it.\n\n \n Thats is exactly my point. And that is why I feel that abortion is not really justified. Alot of women just want a easy way out. They don't take advantage of the help that is in front of them. \n \n \n \nIf abortion became illegal, then such programs would easily become over-run, without being able to handle the volume.\n\n \n Since we are talking about an IF here, that is irrelevant. Lets talk about the now. And the now is, that these programs are there. And they are avalible to those who need the help. Taking into account that if abortion was illegal, that these programs would be over run, is not a steady bases for abortion. Nor does it hold any ground to what my point is. My point is, that there is help, and that more women should take advantage of it. Instead of getting rid of a fetus. \n \n \nAs for whether or not women are weak who do not choose to keep a child, that depends on what you mean.

It is based on other factors. The bottom line is that they do not feel the responsibility that they have to raise such a child. You have given no compelling reasons as to why they should feel that responsibility in the first place.\n\n \n I believe I have given a reason for why they should be responsible. And I'm not taking about the rape victims here. I'm taking about the ones you said feel they are not responsible. Because that is their seed within them, they should feel the need to keep it. Not to mention that there is no excuse for why they should not keep it, because they can get help from various places. In order to provide for their children.\n \n Also, how do you judge who is pychologicaly weak?! We are not talking about mental illness here either. Someone who is pychologicly weak, is someone who cannot handle, any kind of struggle, any kind of challenge. Like you said, about the women who just don't want the responsibility of a child. So they have an abortion. To me that IS pychologicaly weak, because they are not willing to do what it takes to properly provide for a child. Rearing child takes time, effort, patients, and mental ability. I know because I practicly raised my Newphews, since they were little. Thier mm valued partying. I had to with my mom raise them. So I know the time and effort it takes to raise kids. And some women can't deal with that. Thus I call them weak. \n \n \n \nThis is the very issue I was trying to bring out with my arguements - the idea that we do not exist without mental awareness. I am glad to hear you understand it. Now, why do you disagree?\n\n \n I'll answer that with an example. If you see a sugar jar, sitting on the table, but it was not filled with sugar. Dose that sugar jar cease to exsist, just because it has no sugar in it?! No it would not. Dose it cease to be a sugar jar, just because at the moment it is void of sugar. No, it is still a sugar jar. Just without the sugar. And later on someone will come along and fill it up, and it no longer be incomplete as to what it is, it will be a sugar jar, that is now completely being used for what it was purposed for. No one ever(or at least I hope not) throws a sugar jar out, just because it is empty. Expecially if it is make of fine china. So now, why just throw away a human, just because it may be incomplete when it comes to mental awareness. In time, like that sugar jar, the fetus will be complete. And become what it was purposed to become. Having no mental awarness at a certain stage, in my book, does not mean a fetus does not exsist. It is just not compeletly formed yet. That is why I disagee with your example, of the severed arm, and your claim as to mental awareness.\n \n \nThe mother's brain is not causing the fetus to have any mental awareness.

I said that it does have a mentally aware brain working in for it. Also, how can you throw out the discussion of a brain, when you brought up mental awareness?! You can't be mentally aware without a brain. And you can't have emotions without one either. So no one can throw out the discussion about the brain.

   "Well if they can't stand adversity. How are they dealing with life?! If its not a baby causing the adversity, it will be something else. So they may as well shut themselevs up somewhere. Life is full of adversity. That is what makes it life. Granted, there are a few sweet, tender moments. But there is also some hard knocks.\n\n It is clear to most people that dealing with a very adverse situation with a helpless child is harder than doing it on ones own. People can take care of themselves more easily than they can take care of a family. Children are a huge responsibility to take one - not all people can do it in all situations. It is just too heavy an extra load for them.\n \nThats is exactly my point. And that is why I feel that abortion is not really justified. Alot of women just want a easy way out. They don't take advantage of the help that is in front of them. \n \n Since we are talking about an IF here, that is irrelevant. Lets talk about the now.

My point is, that there is help, and that more women should take advantage of it. Instead of getting rid of a fetus. \n\n I was under the assumption (and perhaps I'm wrong here) that you want to have abortion outlawed. If that is the case, then the IFs are VERY relevant.\n \n However, if your goal is not to have abortion outlawed and simply want to use this forum to convince women not to have abortions, then your point about help being available IS relevant, but ONLY for those women who would want the child or who feel the responsibility that they should have the child but who don't do it for fear of difficulty. \n \nI believe I have given a reason for why they should be responsible. And I'm not taking about the rape victims here. I'm taking about the ones you said feel they are not responsible. Because that is their seed within them, they should feel the need to keep it. Not to mention that there is no excuse for why they should not keep it, because they can get help from various places. In order to provide for their children.\n\n So your reason for why they should feel responsible is \"that is their seed within them\"? I fail to see how having an unwanted seed within one makes one have to feel the responsibility of sacrificing ones body for that unwanted seed. (Note: wanted seeds are something else entirely since the sacrifice is voluntary).\n \n As for excuses, as you call them, if there is no responsibility, then the term \"excuse\" is irrelevant. If someone told you that \"You SHOULD donate 16 hours a week of your time volunteering to help the homeless\" (which we probably agree would be a nice thing to do) and you don't feel a responsibility to do that, is it an \"excuse\" on your part when you give reasons why that is not your highest priority? Unless you can demonstrate valid reasons why women SHOULD carry out an unwanted pregnancy, then the reasons they give are not \"excuses\", just reasons.\n \nI'll answer that with an example. If you see a sugar jar, sitting on the table, but it was not filled with sugar. Dose that sugar jar cease to exsist, just because it has no sugar in it?! No it would not. Dose it cease to be a sugar jar, just because at the moment it is void of sugar. No, it is still a sugar jar. Just without the sugar.

That is why I disagee with your example, of the severed arm, and your claim as to mental awareness.\n\n That was why I was differentiating between the CORE of what we are vs what we are in general. In the general sense, our bodies are part of ourselves. However, imagine that you get major brain damage so that you no longer have any mental existence and only your body is alive - nothing else - and that will be the state of that physical body forever after (i.e. no mental existence will ever re-emerge). Do you view that \"you\" would still be there? Note: this type of situation happens all the time and officially medically determines time of death.\n \nI never claimed that the mother brain made the fetus mentally aware. I said that it does have a mentally aware brain working in for it. Also, how can you throw out the discussion of a brain, when you brought up mental awareness?! You can't be mentally aware without a brain. And you can't have emotions without one either. So no one can throw out the discussion about the brain. Expecially since you brought up being mentally aware.\n\n I am throwing out the irrelevant aspects of discussion on brains. There are lots of irrelevant aspects to the discussion of brains - ex. their color, how big they are, etc. The discussion about the mother's brain is irrelevant to the discussion of how developed the embryo or fetus's brain is.",

To me that is weak too. Get it?! I was not condoning it, I was speaking against it!\n\n \n I think what Thelmoose is saying is along the lines of the following: Most suicide is the result of severe, untreated mental illness. One can not just talk themselves out of schizophrenia or dibilitating depression any more than one can just talk themselves out of cancer. The perception that mental illness is somehow overcomable without treatment is the reason that is remains secondary and overlooked in health care. \n \n A MN soldier recently returned from Iraq committed suicide about a week ago due to post traumatic stress syndrome. He tried on several occasions to get help and was denied. \n \n A couple of years ago a woman with severe depression tried to get help for herself and was repeatedly turned away. She unded up throwing herself and her twin babies in the Mississippi. One of the babies died.\n \n Suicide is not an \"easy way out\". It is frequently a scream for help and too often the fatal end of a serious untreated illness.\n \n \nAnother thing, you are a bad reader!!

But that does not excuse the lack willingness to except responsibilties.\n \n \nI was under the assumption (and perhaps I'm wrong here) that you want to have abortion outlawed. If that is the case, then the IFs are VERY relevant.\n\n \n No, I never said that it should be outlawed. I was just stating that there is no excuse for abortions. But come to think about it, they should be. But all this time I was just arguing that the reasons, used to abort children, and the actions taken were wrong. \n \n \n \nHowever, if your goal is not to have abortion outlawed and simply want to use this forum to convince women not to have abortions, then your point about help being available IS relevant, but ONLY for those women who would want the child or who feel the responsibility that they should have the child but who don't do it for fear of difficulty.\n \n \n Fear of difficulty is what I'm attacking. What got me going was the fact that people said, they had jobs, and a home, but still could not afford a baby. That is not an excuse, because of the fact that there IS help out there. So many women are aborting, because they fear they have to take off of work, and won't be able to pay for the hospital visits. To me that is not an excuse. Just use the help given.\n \n \n \nSo your reason for why they should feel responsible is \"that is their seed within them\"? I fail to see how having an unwanted seed within one makes one have to feel the responsibility of sacrificing ones body for that unwanted seed. (Note: wanted seeds are something else entirely since the sacrifice is voluntary).\n\n \n This is another thing that I'm attacking. Its not just a seed, it is a part of the person carrying that seed. It has part of her DNA. The fact that a women can seperate herself, and be void of all feelings, from the fetus in her womb. Is something very detestable to me. Whether you planned for it or not. Its yours. The very CORE, of the reason they don't want it. Is because the fetus represents responsibility. And THAT, is what they are running away from. You tell me, what a fetus represents, if it does not represent responsibility?! \n \n \n \nAs for excuses, as you call them, if there is no responsibility, then the term \"excuse\" is irrelevant. If someone told you that \"You SHOULD donate 16 hours a week of your time volunteering to help the homeless\" (which we probably agree would be a nice thing to do) and you don't feel a responsibility to do that, is it an \"excuse\" on your part when you give reasons why that is not your highest priority? Unless you can demonstrate valid reasons why women SHOULD carry out an unwanted pregnancy, then the reasons they give are not \"excuses\", just reasons.\n\n \n Reasons, is just a pretty word for excuses.\n \n Also, homeless people are a part of the community, that we live in. If people were made to donate time. Then it would be the benefit of the whole community. But that is not a good example, since homless people, who are strangers to you, are not growing in my stomach. So that is not exactly the samething as seperating yourself from a fetus that is growing inside of you. But if you want to talk about homeless people. I think everyone in a community, is to a certain degree is responsible for the help of these people who have less. Because it could happen to us. And we would want the help. Also, alot of programs run on volenteers. So in this instance you are speaking to the wrong person. I think people should help them out. Since they are apart of the community that we live in. Not trying to sound holyier then thou, but thats the way I look at things.\n \n \n \nThat was why I was differentiating between the CORE of what we are vs what we are in general. In the general sense, our bodies are part of ourselves. However, imagine that you get major brain damage so that you no longer have any mental existence and only your body is alive - nothing else - and that will be the state of that physical body forever after (i.e. no mental existence will ever re-emerge). Do you view that \"you\" would still be there? Note: this type of situation happens all the time and officially medically determines time of death.\n\n \n But without a body, the brain is nothing. So they are both are equally important, when it comes to making a human complete. So just because a fetus has not yet developed a brain, does not make it non-exsistant. Also, if a person becomes brain dead, that is entirely different from not letting a brain form at all. Because you aborted a fetus. The whole notion of being mentally aware, to exsist, is just to justify the action of aborting. Plus, you never really got into the dianamics of my example. I made the point about people not throwing away a sugar jar because it was empty. And then I emphasised how they really wouldn't throw it away if it was fine china. My point being, they still value their sugar jar as valuable, even when it has no sugar in it, and would think it absured to throw it out, when you can just put sugar in it again. So if we can put such value on something that is not living, how much more so, should we put value in something that has the potential of becoming a human. That empty sugar jar has the potential to become full again. What is the difference?! Peoples view of life has changed, the value of life, whether you want to admit it or not, has diminished.\n \n \nI am throwing out the irrelevant aspects of discussion on brains. There are lots of irrelevant aspects to the discussion of brains - ex. their color, how big they are, etc. The discussion about the mother's brain is irrelevant to the discussion of how developed the embryo or fetus's brain is.\n\n \n I was just bringing out the fact that the mothers mentally aware brain is working for the baby. I never speak about the color, or size of the brain. You just said that. You spoke of the baby, not having mental awareness. I spoke of it having a mentally aware brain working for it. In my eyes that counts for something. But if you don't want to continue to discuss this aspect. Then we can leave it be.",

You tell me, what a fetus represents, if it does not represent responsibility?! \n\n There are many potential responsibilities that people can take on. However, we, as free people, can CHOOSE which responsibilities we take on and which we don't. Every single person alive chooses not to take on certain potential responsibilities. You can't volunteer 16 hours a week to the homeless, plus hold down a job to support yourself, plus help out neighbors, plus be politically involved, plus volunteer to tutor underpriviledged kids, plus ... - there is just not enough time in a persons life or enough energy to accomplish all of that. One picks and chooses which responsibilities to take on.\n \n You can argue that some responsibilities are required if you are not going to be an utterly imoral person. For example, intentionally causing suffering to an innocent person when that can be avoided would be something that we probably all agree would be immoral. Where abortion is concerned, I would agree that, in the third trimester, abortions should be very limited (except with risk to mother's life, etc.) since, at that point, you probably ARE intentionally causing suffering to an innocent person where that suffering can be avoided. However, prior to the third trimester, there is no suffering, there is no mentally existing person that we can sympathize with. All there is is potential. Those on the pro-choice side, for the most part, don't feel any compelling reason to take on that responsibility since we don't view abortion during those stages as immoral. Some on the pro-choice side may place so much value in that potential that they themselves would not get abortions, but they realize that that is their own judgement call and would not impose that judgement call on others through law by outlawing abortion.\n \n As for a woman feeling for the embryo / fetus in her womb, what exactly is she imagining and feeling? If she is imagining the fetus with sympathy for what it might be feeling, then prior to the third trimester, that imagination would be based purely on fiction. First trimester abortions are much easier for women to allow themselves because nobody has suffered yet for that abortion. Nobody yet existed with whom she might sympathize except possibly in her imagination. If the woman with the embryo/fetus in her womb is imagining what that embryo/fetus will become, then we are talking about the value that the woman places in the potential of the fetus. I personally think potential is important, but a woman's right to her own body is far more important and, if she decides that her reasons for an abortion are more important than her value of that fetus's potential, then she should have the right to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nBut without a body, the brain is nothing. So they are both are equally important, when it comes to making a human complete. \n\n Why do you say that? If all that was left of you (in that earlier hypothetical scenario) was your functioning brain, then you could still dream, imagine, think, feel emotions of anger, joy, love, etc., analyze, have creativity, enjoy your memories, etc. You would be VERY limited in what you could DO and would probably be pretty lonely, but you would certainly still be around.\n \nAlso, if a person becomes brain dead, that is entirely different from not letting a brain form at all. \n\n The only difference is in potential. One (the fetus) will, in the future, almost surely become mentally aware while the brain dead body will never become mentally aware. Potential is important but those of us on the pro-choice side view it as much less important than the rights of the mother, for whom we have a lot of sympathy.\n \n Plus, you never really got into the dianamics of my example. I made the point about people not throwing away a sugar jar because it was empty. And then I emphasised how they really wouldn't throw it away if it was fine china.

A sugar jar that is not beautiful or useful except when it holds sugar is worthless if it never will hold sugar again (like the brain dead body). Its only worth, while it is sitting on the shelf without sugar, is in its POTENTIAL to hold sugar in the future. As I mentioned before, I also value potential, but not nearly as much as I value a woman's right to her own body. \n \nI was just bringing out the fact that the mothers mentally aware brain is working for the baby.

In my book, women who get pregnant have an automatic responsibility to the fetus. But faulty logic, and \"so-called\" severed arm examples, tend to make women feel it is ok to just abort babies until they feel they have time for them, in their so-called busy life. \n \n \n \nYou can argue that some responsibilities are required if you are not going to be an utterly imoral person.

But I would not be oppossed to it, if they should decide to take it to the level of making abortion illegal.\n \n And yes! I firmly believe in POTENTIAL, because without it we are nothing. Everything starts with potential. And then becomes something better.\n \n \nAs for a woman feeling for the embryo / fetus in her womb, what exactly is she imagining and feeling? If she is imagining the fetus with sympathy for what it might be feeling, then prior to the third trimester, that imagination would be based purely on fiction. First trimester abortions are much easier for women to allow themselves because nobody has suffered yet for that abortion. Nobody yet existed with whom she might sympathize except possibly in her imagination.\n\n \n I'm not talking about a woman feeling something in her stomach. If that is what you're alluding to. I'm more or less, talking about the obligation she feels towards that child. As to feel that she needs to protect it, and be responsible for it. Get it now?! \n \n And why would feeling an obligation, have to be fiction?! Actually, that should be reality. If it were a reality, there would not be so many abortions.\n \n \n \nIf the woman with the embryo/fetus in her womb is imagining what that embryo/fetus will become, then we are talking about the value that the woman places in the potential of the fetus. I personally think potential is important, but a woman's right to her own body is far more important and, if she decides that her reasons for an abortion are more important than her value of that fetus's potential, then she should have the right to terminate her pregnancy.\n\n \n If she feels that the potential of her baby, takes no place in her life. And can without guilt, get rid of it. Then in my opinion, she does not value life. If she can just get rid of a child, like you get rid of an empty can of soda. Then in that persons eyes, a life is like that of an empty can. Worthless. That kind of mindframe is one that I will forever question. \n \n \nWhy do you say that? If all that was left of you (in that earlier hypothetical scenario) was your functioning brain, then you could still dream, imagine, think, feel emotions of anger, joy, love, etc., analyze, have creativity, enjoy your memories, etc. You would be VERY limited in what you could DO and would probably be pretty lonely, but you would certainly still be around.\n\n \n Enjoying those memories from where?! A glass jar?! Listen, I think you missed my point. At no fault of your own, because I did not explain myself clearly.\n \n What I meant was this, you do not consider the bady as anything important, without mental awareness. I'm saying the two go hand in hand. Wiithout the physical body, the brain could not exsist on its own. It would have nothing to protect it, and nothing to send impulses to. My point is this. How can you see the value in one, and not the other. To say that you only exsist with mental awarenss is not all together true in my book. Because the being is starting to form, which makes a way for the brain o be able to function. Without it the brain is useless. The two are equally valuable. You can't have one without the other. So the body of a fetus, forming, should be looked at as equally important.\n \n BTW, if the only thing that a person had left was his mental awareness. And could think about his nice memories. What good would that do them? They would just have time to sit and think about how limited they are. Then their dreams become nightmeres, and they become depressed. I know, because I work with older ones. The only ones who don't feel that way, are the ones who have constant support, from family. But lets face it, there is a limit of families wanting to put up with older ones. So in this instance, the brain being aware, doesn't do jack if the person is incapable of moving. Only cause depression. How well the brain works, without the body!emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nThe only difference is in potential. One (the fetus) will, in the future, almost surely become mentally aware while the brain dead body will never become mentally aware. Potential is important but those of us on the pro-choice side view it as much less important than the rights of the mother, for whom we have a lot of sympathy.\n\n \n A brain dead body in alot of instances did not start that way. It was caused by an accident later on in life. My point being, that at least that life/brain had a chance to thrive as much as it could, for as long as it could. With a fetus, you are stopping it at the starting line. Your not even giving it a chance to thrive as much as it can. So there is a BIG idfference.\n \n Plus, I don't feel sorry for a grown woman who can take care of herself, and does not run the risk of someone scraping her out. But I do feel sorry for the fetus who has no choice but to die, at someones command.\n \n \nThis is the issue of potential again. A sugar jar that is not beautiful or useful except when it holds sugar is worthless if it never will hold sugar again (like the brain dead body). Its only worth, while it is sitting on the shelf without sugar, is in its POTENTIAL to hold sugar in the future. As I mentioned before, I also value potential, but not nearly as much as I value a woman's right to her own body.\n \n \n Come on now! Lets not play games here buddy! I have never had anyone refer to a sugar jar, as a potential sugar jar just because it was empty. Lets use some reality here. Plus I'm not talking about a sugar jar that is not beautiful unless it has sugar in it. I spoke of a sugar jar the is made of fine china. I used fine china, to attribute it to a childs worth.\n \n I have never seen a woman throw out, a sugar jar made of crystal, just because it is empty. Because it is a valuable piece of china. She will not see it any less valuable when it is empty, as oppossed to when it is full. She will think of the value as being equal, sense the piece in itself is pricless. \n \n How much more should we think of a fetus as pricless? We can deny the value of a human life. And pass it off as if it was valueless, because it has yet to hit the third trimester?! But we can value a piece of fine china, that does not, have the potential to breathe,see, think, and feel?! Come on! Something is wrong here.\n \n And I have never heard of a sugar jar, unless it is cracked. Never being able to hold sugar again. And even if no one filled it up, it would not be worthless. Because it could still carry out what it was purposed to do if someone let it. A fetus can become what it was purposed to become if someone lets it. Just because someone does not want a fetus, does not make it any less valuable. Its just that the PERSON, lacked seeing the value. \n \n \nI was just giving the brain color and size as examples of non-relavant brain discussions - I did not intend to suggest that you brought up those points.

THAT, my dear, is a very irresponsible thing to do, especially if you already have kids that you can barely support. Better to terminate the growth of a foetus that does not have a mental existence or any sort of life than to cause more hardships for yourself and your already mentally existing and living children than to force them to suffer by your \"man up\" that you seem so obsessed with.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "Yeah well, in my opinion, a fetus/baby is not just some object task/responsibility that you just choose to NOT take on. In my book, women who get pregnant have an automatic responsibility to the fetus. But faulty logic, and \"so-called\" severed arm examples, tend to make women feel it is ok to just abort babies until they feel they have time for them, in their so-called busy life. \n\n You have the right to make your own judgement calls. For you, the embryo and early fetus are so precious that you think all women should have to carry them. You present no logical reason WHY they should - you just present a lot of statements of your idea of what they SHOULD feel based on your own views and your own value judgements. They have other value judgements.\n \n Different people have different moral approaches. For many if not most of us, our treatment of others depends on how we would expect ourselves to be treated in their situation. Too often, people don't try to put themselves in the other person's shoes and approach life purely selfishly but, in the ideal, they do try to empathize with the other person and limit or direct their own behavior based on that empathy. \n \n Most people can empathize with a third trimester fetus, which is a main reason why the great majority of people - on both sides of the abortion debate - would be against most third trimester abortion. However, the fact that the great majority of people (2/3rds) support first trimester abortion shows that they feel much less if any empathy toward first trimester embryos/fetuses (the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester). You have presented no arguements about why they should feel empathy in that first trimester while your value of an embryo's potential over the rights of the mother is a value judgement on your part that others don't share. You will not convince them by insults or statements of indignation alone. With unwanted pregnancies, there is too much at stake for women to care what those on the pro-life side feel about them. You have to present solid reasons (not just value statements) about WHY they should value potential over their own rights.\n \nAnd yes! I firmly believe in POTENTIAL, because without it we are nothing. Everything starts with potential. And then becomes something better.\n\n Potential is a nice thing. Note that unfertilized eggs also have potential. But how much we value potential of a fetus over the rights of the mother is a value judgement. You value that potential over the rights of the mother whereas those of us on the pro-choice side value the right of the mother more. \n \nI'm not talking about a woman feeling something in her stomach. If that is what you're alluding to. I'm more or less, talking about the obligation she feels towards that child. As to feel that she needs to protect it, and be responsible for it. \n\n I am not talking about the woman feeling something in her stomache (I have no idea how you could have gotten that from what I had written). You talk about a feeling of obligation but why should she feel such an obligation?\n \nAnd why would feeling an obligation, have to be fiction?! Actually, that should be reality. If it were a reality, there would not be so many abortions.\n\n Read my post again. I was not saying anything about a feeling of obligation being fiction. I was saying that any sympathy she would feel for that embryo or early fetus would be based on fictional assumptions that there actually was someone there in that embryo/early fetus that could suffer, feel, etc. You can't feel empathy for something that doesn't have a mental existance unless you are fictionally imagining one (i.e. anthropomorphizing). As for your \"should\" statements, you have your own opinions and that is fine. However, if you want to convince others or impose that opinion on others, you have to be a lot more convincing than just throwing out \"should\" statements, indignation or insult.\n \nIf she feels that the potential of her baby, takes no place in her life. And can without guilt, get rid of it. Then in my opinion, she does not value life. If she can just get rid of a child, like you get rid of an empty can of soda. Then in that persons eyes, a life is like that of an empty can. Worthless. That kind of mindframe is one that I will forever question. \n\n Most pro-choice advocates seem to value life once they can empathize with it - i.e. once they think it has at least some mental existence. They place much less value on life they can't empathize with and your indignation is irrelevant to them and to me. We don't care if you are indignant just like you don't care if we are indignant. It is the underlying arguements that are important and that is why most of us are here debating.\n \nWhat I meant was this, you do not consider the bady as anything important, without mental awareness. I'm saying the two go hand in hand. Wiithout the physical body, the brain could not exsist on its own. It would have nothing to protect it, and nothing to send impulses to. My point is this. How can you see the value in one, and not the other. To say that you only exsist with mental awarenss is not all together true in my book. Because the being is starting to form, which makes a way for the brain o be able to function. Without it the brain is useless. The two are equally valuable. You can't have one without the other. So the body of a fetus, forming, should be looked at as equally important.\n\n I see the value in the body only in how it benefits our mentally existing selves. The body on its own, without any mental existence, is useless and of no value except for its potential to have a mental existence.\n \n As for the brain being useless and of no value without the body (assuming it could still be functioning to give us mental existence), then you probably just have a very different point of view on what is valued. I would value someone who is deaf, blind, mute and so paralyzed that they have no use of their body other than to sustain their mental existence. I would feel sorry for them because I would imagine that their existence is pretty miserable, but I think that they are no less people than you and me. That individual would have just as much functionality as a \"functioning brain in a jar\", so I would value that functioning brain in a jar as much as I would value that paralyzed, deaf, blind, mute - i.e. as a person worthy of rights just like you and me. Are they useful to others? Probably not. Are they useful to themselves? It depends on whether they would have sunk into extreme depression and want to die. Some might be strong enough psychologically, that they could even find some contentness in such an existence - the imagination can be a powerful thing.\n \nSo in this instance, the brain being aware, doesn't do jack if the person is incapable of moving. Only cause depression. How well the brain works, without the body!emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Does that mean that you only value people who are useful or only would give rights to people who are useful ?!?!\n \n With a fetus, you are stopping it at the starting line. Your not even giving it a chance to thrive as much as it can. So there is a BIG idfference.\n\n Before it gains a mental existence, it is impossible for it to experience any difference between whether it is continued or not, so why should we be so concerned? It has potential but it is potential that we might care about be cause we place value in what it will become. An unfertilized egg also has potential to become something and those couples who really want a child value its potential so much that they try hard to get it fertilized. It is all a matter of how much you value potential and you, personally, simply value that potential much more than do most pro-choice people.\n \nCome on now! Lets not play games here buddy! I have never had anyone refer to a sugar jar, as a potential sugar jar just because it was empty. Lets use some reality here. Plus I'm not talking about a sugar jar that is not beautiful unless it has sugar in it. I spoke of a sugar jar the is made of fine china. I used fine china, to attribute it to a childs worth.\n\n Well, the way that you were using that analogy was not clear from your post. I saw your analogy as saying that the sugar jar with sugar is like the fetus with mental existence but that the sugar jar without sugar is like the fetus without mental existence - which you, personally, considered like fine china, meaning that you value it. To me, the fetus without mental existence is not worth anything on its own, which is why I would not compare it to a sugar jar made of fine china. If a fetus will never gain mental existence, then it has no value in my book - unlike a sugar jar made of fine china, which is why I compared it to a sugar jar that is unattractive and only has usefulness if it holds sugar. \n \n Perhaps I am still getting your analogy wrong, in which case what exactly is your analogy? Namely, what specifically are you symbolizing as the sugar jar and what specifically are you symbolizing as the sugar?",

   "I don't mean having different morals and such from me. But Pro-Choicers have lost all sense of morality based on their choices.\n\n \n And what choices would those be?

   "Another Opinion- The sugar Jar does symbolize the fetus, and the sugar the mental awareness. But just like people value their fine china. Why is it that they cannot value something that is more valuable?! That is my point.\n\n You choose to value the potential of the fetus more than women's rights to their own bodies. Those on the pro-choice side have the opposite value choice - we value a woman's right over her own body over the potential of a fetus. Speaking for myself, the main reason for this is that I can empathize with a woman whereas I cannot empathize with an early fetus or embryo that does not have a mental existence and it is empathy that drives most of my moral decisions.\n \nAnother thing is this. Why is it that you speak of a fetus that will never have mental awareness?! How would you know if you kill if before it can even develop mental awareness?! \n\n I think you are referring to my quote: \"If a fetus will never gain mental existence, then it has no value in my book - unlike a sugar jar made of fine china, which is why I compared it to a sugar jar that is unattractive and only has usefulness if it holds sugar. \". Here, I was presenting a hypothetical of a fetus that can never gain mental existence to show that, if it never gains mental existence, then it has no worth in my book. Real fetuses, on the other hand, DO have the potential to gain mental existance and it is that potential alone which defines their worth. However, again, those of us on the pro-choice side, including myself, value that potential less than the rights of the woman over her own body.\n \nAlso, I never said that I do not value someone who is not able to move. or think. Where did you get that from?!\n\n You said:\n \nWhat I meant was this, you do not consider the bady as anything important, without mental awareness. I'm saying the two go hand in hand. Wiithout the physical body, the brain could not exsist on its own. It would have nothing to protect it, and nothing to send impulses to. My point is this. How can you see the value in one, and not the other. To say that you only exsist with mental awarenss is not all together true in my book. Because the being is starting to form, which makes a way for the brain o be able to function. Without it the brain is useless. The two are equally valuable. You can't have one without the other. So the body of a fetus, forming, should be looked at as equally important.\n \n BTW, if the only thing that a person had left was his mental awareness. And could think about his nice memories. What good would that do them? They would just have time to sit and think about how limited they are. Then their dreams become nightmeres, and they become depressed. I know, because I work with older ones. The only ones who don't feel that way, are the ones who have constant support, from family. But lets face it, there is a limit of families wanting to put up with older ones. So in this instance, the brain being aware, doesn't do jack if the person is incapable of moving. Only cause depression. How well the brain works, without the body!\n\n Perhaps I misread your intentions in writing that second paragraph. You seemed to imply that uselessness of a brain without a body makes a difference on whether you value it. Otherwise, why did you bring up that point since it is obvious that a brain without a body is very limited? We were talking about value and what is inherently the core of you and me.\n \n As for the brain existing without the body, that is why I brought up the artificially sustained brain. If the brain is artificially sustained, then you don't need a body. You don't even need all the parts of the brain to be functioning - just those that deal with mental processes. The bottom line is that I view us as existing if we only have mental existence and nothing else. If one speaks of religion, then this is the equivalent of saying that we could exist after life if our souls continue on. Though one concept is philosophical and sci-fi scientific (the artificially sustained brain) and one is religious (the soul), they both address the same issue - namely, our core is our mental self. The rest of the body is optional (obviously extremely useful, but optional).",

   "[Aside:I know this is wildly off the subject for an abortion forum. But please, it's the same old thing, post after post, so...]\n \n \nPrayers are answered. Look around you at how many people have made miraculous recoveries in d*adly operations or undergoing chemotherapy, all because their members of their church prayed for them. Take my Grandpa, for instance, he had to undergo a serious operation regarding a tracheotomy and kidney failure. He was in the hospital for nearly a month and no one was certain if he was going to live; The doctors weren't even sure... However, after my entire family, as well as the two churches that my family attends, prayed for him, he recovered fully after the 1st week in March of last year, and he went in on the last week in January. The doctors were even amazed that he lived. \n\n It always gets indelicate talking about the life and death of people you know, do I truly mean no offense. I am happy for you that Grandpa lived. But, please answer these questions:\n 1. Did it ever occur to you that his survival had nothing to do with the prayer?\n 2. People who are not prayed for get better all the time. How do you account for that?\n \n \n \nSo, yes, miracles are possible... You don't just \"think\" that they happen or believe that they happen, you know that their there all around you. Look at a newborn infant, for instance, or your children. They are miracles in themselves.\n\n \n I am convinced. Good argument. I am not as smart as you, though, so two more questions:\n 1. How can I tell the difference between thinking something is true, believing it to be true, or knowing it to be true? \n 2. Does this relate to supporting evidence or is it all inside your head?",

Surely it cannot make the jar have memories. You have taken the brain out of context. Only inside of a body can the brain be truly useful.

However, I think that, in many cases, there ends up being an obstacle that cannot be crossed. Two obstacles that I have encountered here in the abortion forum in trying to find a compromise is:\n 1) Differences in approach to morality. This came up in discussion with Steeeeve where his morality is based on that dictated by his religion, where his faith has him assume that the moral code of his religion is the correct one, in an absolute sense. My moral code is based on essentially treating others as I would expect myself to be treated if I were in their shoes. These are two completely different approaches to morality where no large compromise seems to be possible. I would be interested in hearing about the basis of your moral code - is it based on religious rules or on some other structure?\n 2) Different Value Judgements This is the main difference between our views. You, and I think Jyoshu as well, value the potential of the fetus more than the rights of the woman over her own body, and those of us on the pro-choice side, including myself, have the opposite view. I think such value judgements might leave more room for compromise than do differences in moral approach.\n \n Either way, even if a compromise is never reached, I still think that it is useful for our two sides to participate in reasoned debate - if only to realize that there ARE reasons behind our mutual views and that reasonable people can disagree. \n \n The abortion debate is a topic that can very easily get emotional. I personally find it important to try to keep emotion out of the debate and keep it at a respectful level since, when both sides respond emotionally and/or disrespectfully, it is so very easy to let those emotions escalate and then all one has left is a pointless flame war. I think we all agree that calm and rational debate is a lot more useful than a flame war.\n \nYou stated that even if a brain were to work, and a body could no longer function.

Fine china.\n\n I am probably still not making myself clear about where I was headed with this point about mental existence being our core. Namely, yes the body is valuable in that we would be extremely limited and probably very miserable without one (assuming we would still mentally exist). My main point was that we, as people, would still exist if we were only mentally existing. I personally think that if we only had mental existence and no physical existence, then we should still be viewed as people with rights. On the opposite spectrum is the existence of our bodies without any mental existence. As a hypothetical arguement to take potential out of the picture, if our bodies were alive with none of our mental existence inside and if no such mental existence could ever be in that body again, then I think that living mindless body would have very little value in my book. The hypothetical extends to a fetus without mental existence. The only value it has in my book is its potential to grow into a being which does have mental existence. We already know each others stance on potential vs a woman's right to her body. Do you claim that there is some value to that fetus other than in its potential?\n \nOh really?! Now that is a weird way of looking at it. How much use is a brain doing a person, outside of the body?!

If all we had left were those mental processes, then we would still exist (we could dream, remember, have emotions, think, etc.) but, yes, our existence would be largely useless. However, I fail to see how usefulness plays any role in the abortion debate. \n \n The whole reason I brought up the issue of brain without a body is to illustrate how our mental selves form the CORE of who we are. The \"core\" of something is a thing which is necessary for that something to exist. In this way the core of us as people is our mental existence since our mental existence is necessary for us to exist as people. I used to hypothetical artificially sustained brain example to show that, without a body, we would still exist. Even if we were never to gain a new body, we would still exist as long as we have a mental existence. The opposite is not true. Namely, if the only thing that would exist is our bodies (no minds, and no potential for mind), then we cannot be said to exist as people. THAT is why I keep stressing that we are, at our very core, our mental selves. \n \n Potentiallity of that body to have a mental self is a second issue and that is where we draw our different value judgements. Again, though, I have to ask: is there anything in the fetus that you value outside of its *potential* to become a being with a mental existence?",

Thank goodness I feel better now.\n \n Yes, I do think that structured debate, that deals with facts, and is void of emotions, is the best way to debate. I have let other people's immature behavior, rub off on the way I conduct myself in a debate. I like to keep emotions out of a debate. But have recently been guilty of flaming, for which I'm truly ashamed. And apologise for messing up our positive debate with sheer and utter, senseless, chaos. So lets resume this debate in a mature manner.\n \n To answer your question. Yes, I have one standard moral code that I go by, and it is relious based. And I would agree that even though we cannot find common ground. A reasoned debate on why we feel the way we do about our stance is in order. Because it is intreasting to find the different reasons why people feel the way they do on a specific topic. Hearing your reasons, has been very intreasting. \n \n \nI am probably still not making myself clear about where I was headed with this point about mental existence being our core. Namely, yes the body is valuable in that we would be extremely limited and probably very miserable without one (assuming we would still mentally exist). My main point was that we, as people, would still exist if we were only mentally existing. I personally think that if we only had mental existence and no physical existence, then we should still be viewed as people with rights.

The hypothetical extends to a fetus without mental existence. The only value it has in my book is its potential to grow into a being which does have mental existence. We already know each others stance on potential vs a woman's right to her body. Do you claim that there is some value to that fetus other than in its potential?\n\n \n The fact that a fetus IS a life, is in my eyes valuable. The fact that it is a part of the mother aborting it, is something that is valuable to me. But what is the most important to me, is the general view of a life, and what it stands for. \n \n The very fact that people can rationalize, that at a cerain stage it is okay to get rid of a life, because it has no mental exsistance as of yet. Makes me quiver. Because the value of life seems to have come to the point of deterioration. We are at a time where people value everything as expendable. That is the very thing I tend to fight aganist. And that is something in my eyes, that I find to be worth fighting, and worth stating my claim for. So yes, I do find more value in a fetus, then just potential. I think the whole outlook of a life it valueable, and it shows by how you treat life. If a person can without guilt, abort a life. Then there is a serious problem, with their preception of a life.\n \n Here is where I'm confused. You stated that, a body is \n vauleable, in that we would be extremely limited, and misrable without one. And then you stated(assuming we would mentally exsist).\n \n Here is my problem with that statement. I never made a claim that the body is our core. And I did follow you when you spoke of mental exsistance as being our core. I do agree. What I don't agree on is how you would mentally exsist without a body. And how the body, is not looked at just as valueable as the brain. I will elaborate on this further below.\n \n Now your statement, made it sound as if you were doubting that the brain could exsist without a body. But judging from your earlier points, I know better then to assume that.\n \n \n \n \nThe brain controls both the functioning of our bodies (the external messages that you were mentioning) AND our mental processes (which do not need any external messages). If all we had left were those mental processes, then we would still exist (we could dream, remember, have emotions, think, etc.) but, yes, our existence would be largely useless. However, I fail to see how usefulness plays any role in the abortion debate.\n\n \n Now I'll elaborate. Usefullness plays a major role in the abortion thread. Actually, it is the core of my argument. How?! Because, you are saying that the body without mental awareness is useless. So therefore that justifies, aborting a fetus at a certain stage. My point is to pin-point why at the frist trimester the fetus is STILL valueable. And why the beginning of a formation of a body is still important. I find that in order to have a core, you have to have a outerlayer. And that outerlayer protecte the core. In order to have a healthy brain, and healthy emotions, and feelings. One must have a healthy outerlayer. If a person(which I have said before.} Only has a brain that pocesses happy memories, and emotions. How much different is that, from stepping into a simulated machine?! It can take you on a joyuos ride, and even make you feel great. But is that reality?! No it is not. If a person used to have those memories from when they where able to move around. That is good to a certain extent. But that is not the current reality. Which only serves as a temporary fix. The fact that the body is limited, will eventually kick in. And the happy memories, and emotions, will no longer surffice. So, the brain, cannot function alone, without coming short. The brain, is only a simulation, of emotions, and feelings. What good is it, if a person cannot act upon these?! Thus making a body, just as valueable. Meaning that, if you don't want to abort a fetus while in the third trimester, when the brain is forming. Then you should not want to abort it while the body is forming. Putting the same value on the body itself. Because it works hand in hand with the very core of what makes us, who we are. \n \n \nThe whole reason I brought up the issue of brain without a body is to illustrate how our mental selves form the CORE of who we are. The \"core\" of something is a thing which is necessary for that something to exist. In this way the core of us as people is our mental existence since our mental existence is necessary for us to exist as people. I used to hypothetical artificially sustained brain example to show that, without a body, we would still exist. Even if we were never to gain a new body, we would still exist as long as we have a mental existence. The opposite is not true. Namely, if the only thing that would exist is our bodies (no minds, and no potential for mind), then we cannot be said to exist as people. THAT is why I keep stressing that we are, at our very core, our mental selves.\n \n \n And I understand where you are coming from. I just don't agree. The example you used about us exsisting, even without a body. And only on our mental exsistance. If we never had a body, and our brain was in a glass jar. From what memories would the brain gleem, these happy memories from?! They would be simulated memories. As if to say you were to constantly, viewing a movie. And from where would you feel, and see these emotions, without a body?! I brain, is an organ that is nothing alone. The actions that we make, according to what our bodies do. Is what makes us have these fond memories. Ex.....\n \n A boy running in the feilds with his father. Spending hours playing, and rolling in the grass, with his father makes him happy. After losing his father. He tends to think about those times. And thinks about how it felt to have his father embrace him.\n \n Two things, play a major roll in this boys memories.\n \n 1. Brain\n \n 2. Body.\n \n If, the boy had not used his legs, to run, and his father use his arms, to hold his son. How could they have generated the memories that the boy now holds of his father?! Those memories could not have begun, if they were only mentally aware. How would the father have embraced his son?! How would they have ran together?!\n \n The body and the mind are both the core, of a human. The brain is the core. But so is the outerlayer, the body. It is what makes us, human. The ablity to move, and generate memories. Is what makes us human. Not the fact that we can think about memories. If we cannot move to make fond memories. Then what memories are we possing?!\n A simulation?! That is not reality. \n \n \n \nPotentiallity of that body to have a mental self is a second issue and that is where we draw our different value judgements. Again, though, I have to ask: is there anything in the fetus that you value outside of its *potential* to become a being with a mental existence?\n\n \n The potential of the body, takes on the same importance as a mental self. My points above should deminstrate why I feel that a body forming, is just as important as a brain forming. I hope I'm understood in my stance.",

   "Yes, I do think that structured debate, that deals with facts, and is void of emotions, is the best way to debate. I have let other people's immature behavior, rub off on the way I conduct myself in a debate. I like to keep emotions out of a debate. But have recently been guilty of flaming, for which I'm truly ashamed. And apologise for messing up our positive debate with sheer and utter, senseless, chaos. So lets resume this debate in a mature manner.\n\n Sounds good. I've also let myself flame in previous discussions with posters, much more so in the past - but flaming tends to destroy any positive content to discussions, which is why I try to avoid it nowadays.\n \nTo answer your question. Yes, I have one standard moral code that I go by, and it is relious based. And I would agree that even though we cannot find common ground. A reasoned debate on why we feel the way we do about our stance is in order. Because it is intreasting to find the different reasons why people feel the way they do on a specific topic. Hearing your reasons, has been very intreasting. \n\n I have also been interested in hearing your point of view. Discussions with well known and established posters can certainly be interesting and useful, but it is good to hear new opinions from new posters as they come in - especially if, as you, they are willing to go beyond the initial statements and present supporting arguements for their case.\n \nThe fact that a fetus IS a life, is in my eyes valuable. The fact that it is a part of the mother aborting it, is something that is valuable to me. But what is the most important to me, is the general view of a life, and what it stands for. \n \n The very fact that people can rationalize, that at a cerain stage it is okay to get rid of a life, because it has no mental exsistance as of yet. Makes me quiver. Because the value of life seems to have come to the point of deterioration. We are at a time where people value everything as expendable. That is the very thing I tend to fight aganist. And that is something in my eyes, that I find to be worth fighting, and worth stating my claim for. So yes, I do find more value in a fetus, then just potential. \n\n The idea of cherishing all life is an idea that sounds nice but what does it really mean? Specifically, there are many types of life. Which specific ones do you cherish and which don't you cherish? I know that this gets bogged down in details but those details are important. If you take away the idea of potential of mental existence from a fetus then all you have left is a living, partly formed human body that does not have a mental existence and never will. There is \"nobody home\" in that body. It would be quite similar to the artificially sustained body of someone who sustained such severe brain damage that they are no longer mentally existing. I just don't see the value of a body with neither a mind (i.e. nobody is home) nor the potential for a mind. Some people have compared the early fetus to an organ. I have stayed away from such comparisons because an early fetus has potential and an organ does not. However, if you take away the arguement of potential, then that comparison is valid. Why would the life of a hypothetical fetus that can never gain mental existence be more valuable than the life of an organ?\n \nHere is where I'm confused. You stated that, a body is \n vauleable, in that we would be extremely limited, and misrable without one. And then you stated(assuming we would mentally exsist).\n ...\n Now your statement, made it sound as if you were doubting that the brain could exsist without a body. But judging from your earlier points, I know better then to assume that.\n\n If that is how it sounded, then I mis-spoke. Though the technology to do this does not exist yet, it is scientifically possible (to my knowledge) that the brain could exist without the rest of the body if it were artificially sustained. In a purely philosophical sense, one could speak of a mind independent of any body (which is ultimately what I claim our core is - i.e. our mental selves) but science tells us that we need the brain to have this mental self - or at least those portions of the brain controling those mental processes. \n \nNow I'll elaborate. Usefullness plays a major role in the abortion thread. Actually, it is the core of my argument. How?! Because, you are saying that the body without mental awareness is useless. So therefore that justifies, aborting a fetus at a certain stage. My point is to pin-point why at the frist trimester the fetus is STILL valueable. And why the beginning of a formation of a body is still important. I find that in order to have a core, you have to have a outerlayer. And that outerlayer protecte the core. In order to have a healthy brain, and healthy emotions, and feelings. One must have a healthy outerlayer. If a person(which I have said before.} Only has a brain that pocesses happy memories, and emotions. How much different is that, from stepping into a simulated machine?! It can take you on a joyuos ride, and even make you feel great. But is that reality?! No it is not. If a person used to have those memories from when they where able to move around. That is good to a certain extent. But that is not the current reality. Which only serves as a temporary fix. The fact that the body is limited, will eventually kick in. And the happy memories, and emotions, will no longer surffice. So, the brain, cannot function alone, without coming short. The brain, is only a simulation, of emotions, and feelings. What good is it, if a person cannot act upon these?! Thus making a body, just as valueable. Meaning that, if you don't want to abort a fetus while in the third trimester, when the brain is forming. Then you should not want to abort it while the body is forming. Putting the same value on the body itself. Because it works hand in hand with the very core of what makes us, who we are. \n\n I never said that the body is not valuable - just that it is not valuable without a mind, except for its potential to have a mind. The body is certainly valuable to the mind that possesses it since, as you say, it supplies the senses which offer it memories and experiences, it supplies motion, etc. My lack of value placed in the mindless, potential-less body is not an arguement about it not being useful. Heck, on a quasi-humorous note, if one hypothetically added computer control to that living body, then one could have a very useful living machine. Attempts at humor aside, the reason I don't value a mere body that does not have a mind or potential for one is that the base of my moral stance lies in empathy and empathy can only exist for mentally existing beings. I can place value in things that do not have a mental existence (ex. in the beauty of a particular mountain or national park, etc.), but I value that life of mentally existing humans above that because I can empathize with mentally existing humans - the value judgement places them higher.\n \n I understand your value of the body, but the values of the body that you mentioned (the senses it can offer to give experiences and memories of, for ex. the love of a father holding his son) were values that the body has to the mind that possesses it. If a body does not contain a mind that can benefit from it, then why would it be valuable (outside of the arguement of potential). I guess that I still don't understand what you would value in a fetus that would never gain a mental existence (this being a hypothetical case presented to eliminate the arguement of potential, since we've already discussed potential).",

But sometimes people can push those buttons. A method I'm going to use is this one, \"If I think that a person is not going to be a person worth debating. Because they like unstructured arguments, I will tend to ignore them.\" I've ignored one person continuosuly already.(no its not jitobear) lol. \n \n \nI have also been interested in hearing your point of view.

I hate to be one of those newbies that either start, or enter into a debate, say a few things, and then leave. It is important for other posters to understand where you are coming from when you post. If you don't take time to help people understand where you're coming from. Whats the point in coming on and debating right? I've seen new comers do this, and I think its a shame. Who cares if no one agrees with your stand. At the end of a debate, the fact that you can understand someone elses view a little better is worth it. And then you can both just agree to disagree if no common ground is found. \n \n \nThe idea of cherishing all life is an idea that sounds nice but what does it really mean?

Why would the life of a hypothetical fetus that can never gain mental existence be more valuable than the life of an organ?\n\n \n Well let me start off by saying that I cherish every kind of life. From human life, with or without mental exsistance, to plant life, to animal life. The very dynamics of life is what I cherish. No matter what form it comes in. The fact that it is not a inanimate(I probably spelt that wrong) object, means that it has value in my eyes.\n \n But why are you taking the mental exsistance away?! When women abort before the third trimester. They do not know whether their fetus will be disadvantaged when it comes to mental exsistance. So we can conclude that the fetus, would have a healthy mental exsistance. Unless mental illness ran through the family. That is the only indication that the fetus may have problems mentaly. But if that is not the case, then we can conclude the fetus that is aborted, will be one of healthy mental exsistance. If given the chance.\n \n I agree with you on not really wanting to get into the organ issue. Because an organ is merely apart of a human being. It has not potential of becoming a human. Which places its value, beneath that of a fetus.\n \n \nIf that is how it sounded, then I mis-spoke. Though the technology to do this does not exist yet, it is scientifically possible (to my knowledge) that the brain could exist without the rest of the body if it were artificially sustained. In a purely philosophical sense, one could speak of a mind independent of any body (which is ultimately what I claim our core is - i.e. our mental selves) but science tells us that we need the brain to have this mental self - or at least those portions of the brain controling those mental processes.\n \n \n But what use, would a brain be outside of the body?!\n It would no longer be the core of anything outside of the body.\n \n \n \nI never said that the body is not valuable - just that it is not valuable without a mind, except for its potential to have a mind. The body is certainly valuable to the mind that possesses it since, as you say, it supplies the senses which offer it memories and experiences, it supplies motion, etc. My lack of value placed in the mindless, potential-less body is not an arguement about it not being useful.

I can place value in things that do not have a mental existence (ex. in the beauty of a particular mountain or national park, etc.), but I value that life of mentally existing humans above that because I can empathize with mentally existing humans - the value judgement places them higher.\n\n \n Just to give more light on your statement about computer control. We know that with a computer, it posses no sort of emotion, or feeling. It only posses information. So one would only have a walking computer, if motion was put on a computer. The body holds much more value, then a walking computer. \n \n If your moral stance lies on empathy. Which mines tends to lean that way as well. Then why not take empathy for something that is in a small form, a life?! And will be a life. In my opinion, empathy is something that can be extended to all life forms. Ones at the beginning, middle, and end of life.\n \n \nI understand your value of the body, but the values of the body that you mentioned (the senses it can offer to give experiences and memories of, for ex. the love of a father holding his son) were values that the body has to the mind that possesses it. If a body does not contain a mind that can benefit from it, then why would it be valuable (outside of the arguement of potential). I guess that I still don't understand what you would value in a fetus that would never gain a mental existence (this being a hypothetical case presented to eliminate the arguement of potential, since we've already discussed potential).\n\n \n That just shows that the mind and body go hand in hand. And that they are equaly valuable. Becaus like you said, the mind benefits from the memories the body generates. Without that brain, the body has no mental awareness. Without the body, the brain has no memories, and no emotions. It is only reduced to an organ. The brain cannot be independent of the body.",

Two important criteria that I use are mental existence (since I can empathize with it) and humanity (partly a bias toward my own species, partly since only humans can reciprocate morality).

In your metaphor of the sugar jar, you seemed to imply that the fetus has some value outside of its potential and that is what I was questioning with my hypothetical example.

Otherwise, you might have the feeling of empathy toward something without mental existence but then you are just projecting a personality where there is on (i.e. anthropomorphizing). For example, I can feel sorry for a tree that is being cut down and can have a false feeling of empathy for it. That feeling is false since the tree is not feeling pain or loss - no thoughts, no emotion, no suffering (in the emotional/sensation sense that we usually speak of it). Similarly, one cannot have a true feeling of empathy for a fetus prior to its gaining mental existence. I have seen some pro-life supporters post fictional letters from a suffering early fetus but those are purely figments of their imagination - as is any personality that they attach to that fetus.

Lets not take my statement out of context here. I would for the obvious reasons view a fetus as more valuable then a bacteria, because a fetus if allowed to grow, will develop into a human. But a bacteria will not. Not to mention that bacteria is microsopic. You purposely exaggerated my statement. When I said I value all life I meant, Human life, from a fetus to an adult. Animal life, and plant life. I didn't think I would have to break down what I meant by my statement.

You yourself said you would no envy such a brain. Which shows the brains function would not be as functional, or human as it should be. As a matter of fact, if it does not have any sense inputs, anything it would hold, would be only a simulation. A manmade program it would go by. And that does not constitute a person. In that case robots must be human then. They are also simulated objects, that hold no feelings, only what is programed in them. I see alot of science talk here, but not alot of humanity. If a doctor asked if he could take out your brain and put it in a jar tomorrow. Would you let him?! In your mind you'd still be human.

Because I never did. I'm stating the value in the fetus. So lets stick with the claim I have personaly made. And not drown it out with the claim others have made. Whether the fetus feels pain was never the core of this debate. Its value was. Let me tie up my closing statement with an example.\n \n A funeral occurs, because our loved one has passed on. They are not longer aware. Their body no longer has any mental awareness. But still, people who love their family member do not just throw the body in a back yard, or just leave it laying wherever and just forget about it.(at least I hope not) People usually throw a funeral and bury or cremate their loved ones. And they pay their respects before they bury them. Why is that since the body has no mental exsistance?! Since it is void of a mental aware mind, should people just regard ther loved one as no longer valuable and just ignore the death of their family member?! If someone you love died, would you just say they are worthless now, an not pay your respects at their funeral?! If the answer is no, then why would you pay your respects to a dead loved one?! Why honor them with a proper funeral?! They have no mental exsistance?\n \n And like you said, a mentaly unaware baby is like a dead person. Not aware. So why honor a dead loved one, and not a fetus?! So a fetus is lower then a dead person?! I'm intrested in hearin your response.",

   "Come on now. Lets not take my statement out of context here. I would for the obvious reasons view a fetus as more valuable then a bacteria, because a fetus if allowed to grow, will develop into a human. But a bacteria will not. Not to mention that bacteria is microsopic. You purposely exaggerated my statement. When I said I value all life I meant, Human life, from a fetus to an adult. Animal life, and plant life. I didn't think I would have to break down what I meant by my statement. Since it is not advantageous to concider bacteria along the same lines as you would a human, animal,and even a plant.\n\n You mentioned a blanket statement of valuing all life. I know fully well that you do not value all life equally so I was just trying to get you to state some criteria to determine your value scale. Even in you last paragraph , you mention that you value human life from fetus to adult, animal life and plant life. I assume that you do not value a plant as much as you value a human. So, please state the criteria you use to determine what you value and what you don't. I cannot read your mind to determine that criteria so please outline it. \n \n Stating that one values all life is a nice sounding phrase but I suspect that, as with many pro-life advocates, you throw out such phrases without having thought about the details behind them. So, either admit that you have not put much thought into the substance of that phrase or outline your detailed value system behind it. \n \nAs far as I'm concerned, those are the only two reason for why a fetus is valuble. And have done well explaining my stand. If you do not agree, then fine. But those two reasons are good enough for me. \n\n I understand your valuing the potential of the fetus. I also do but to a lesser extent than you do. As for valuing all life, you have yet to explain that in more detail, as I wrote in my previous paragraph.\n \nI'm wondering how you would think a brain would be able to posses emotions without sense inputs. You yourself said you would no envy such a brain. Which shows the brains function would not be as functional, or human as it should be. As a matter of fact, if it does not have any sense inputs, anything it would hold, would be only a simulation. A manmade program it would go by. And that does not constitute a person. In that case robots must be human then. They are also simulated objects, that hold no feelings, only what is programed in them. I see alot of science talk here, but not alot of humanity. If a doctor asked if he could take out your brain and put it in a jar tomorrow. Would you let him?! In your mind you'd still be human. So why not let your brain be put in a glass jar tomorrow? \n\n First, even without any sense input (real or artificial), the mind in a jar would still have its mental functions - functions that are a natural not artificial. I am not suggesting that it be supplied artificial sense inputs. However, even if it were supplied with artificial sense inputs, then the mind itself would not be a simulation. New technologies are coming out now (I have seen them discussed in technical conferences) and are starting to become more and more used which use microelectronic means to supply hearing to the deaf or sight to the blind. For those real currently existing people who use those technologies, do you think that they are just a simulation just because their sensory inputs are being supplied artificially?! I just don't see the logic in that reasoning.\n \n Also, of course I wouldn't agree to a doctor putting my brain in a jar tomorrow (assuming that it would still function). I have stated numerous times that the body is very useful to the mind that possesses it. My point, which you are ignoring again, is that we still exist if our minds still exist. I wouldn't let a doctor amputate my leg un-necessarily since I could certainly use that leg. However, even if my leg was amputated, I would still exist. Similarly, I would fight tooth and nail against my brain being \"put in a jar\" since my body is obviously extremely useful to me, but I would still exist if that happened. \n \nI would still consider them a person. I just don't consider a brain in a jar a person.\n\n But that person - deaf, blind, paralyzed, without a sense of touch - would be equally functional as a \"brain in a jar\". Why would you consider one a person and one not?\n \nLet me tie up my closing statement with an example.\n \n A funeral occurs, because our loved one has passed on. They are not longer aware. Their body no longer has any mental awareness. But still, people who love their family member do not just throw the body in a back yard, or just leave it laying wherever and just forget about it.(at least I hope not) People usually throw a funeral and bury or cremate their loved ones. And they pay their respects before they bury them. Why is that since the body has no mental exsistance?! Since it is void of a mental aware mind, should people just regard ther loved one as no longer valuable and just ignore the death of their family member?! If someone you love died, would you just say they are worthless now, an not pay your respects at their funeral?! If the answer is no, then why would you pay your respects to a dead loved one?! Why honor them with a proper funeral?! They have no mental exsistance?\n \n And like you said, a mentaly unaware baby is like a dead person. Not aware. So why honor a dead loved one, and not a fetus?! So a fetus is lower then a dead person?! I'm intrested in hearin your response.\n\n We humans have the capability of loving other humans, and when those humans die, we feel a strong sense of loss. The funeral is meant to ease the emotional loss for those people who are left. It gives them a sense of closure. It does nothing for the person who has died (unless one assumes an afterlife). \n \n Also, most of us who are living would like to be remembered well after we die so that we can feel like we accomplished something in life - it is tied in with the goals we set for ourselves in life and our self worth. This touches upon the other reason that we give nice funerals. Namely, it is a show of respect for the memory of the dead. Some believe that the soul of the departed loved one looks on at a funeral. Others don't have that belief. However, most people would like to have some dignified ceremony done after they die - to show the world that they had good aspects to be remembered for. Part of respecting a loved one during their lives is for them to be able to trust you that you will remember them after death - a funeral being the first and most critical step of that process. \n \n The fetus that is aborted never had a mental existence that wanted to be remembered or honored so there is no reason to honor their bodies for their sake. As for honoring their bodies for the sake of the ones who are left, that depends on what emotional attachment the others have toward that body. If a woman has an abortion because she knows that it is by far the best decision in her circumstances, then she might or might not feel a sense of loss. If she felt a sense of loss, then she might want to also perform some ceremony to lighten that loss. However, that would be only for her sake (or the sake of other people involved). As I mentioned before, any such ceremony or honoring of the fetal body would have nothing to do with the desires of the fetus itself since, prior to mental existence, the fetus never would have had any desires to begin with.\n \n I was questioning how Another Opinion said that a fetus without mental exsistance is worthless. So aborting it is not a big deal. \n\n I have stated numerous times that I do value the potential of that fetus - just not as much as you do. The thing I would place little value on is a hypothetical fetus that would be incapable of gaining mental existence - namely, a fetus without potential - which is not a real situation, just a hypothetical one presented for the sake of arguement. The potential is the only thing which I do value in the early fetus.",

So, please state the criteria you use to determine what you value and what you don't. I cannot read your mind to determine that criteria so please outline it.\n\n \n I have already told you what life forms I value. So lets not get funky. I said, \"human life, from fetus to adult.\" \"Animal life,\" and \"plant life\". You brought up bacteria, when I never said that. But come to think about it, there are some bacteria that SHOULD be valued, because some bacteria are good for you. So guess what?! I value bactria as well. And I never said anything about valuing plant life over that of a human. It should be obvious which order they should go into. As a matter of fact I lined them up in proper order, putting human life first, and animal life secon, with plant life trailing in at third. Got it?! I sure hope so. \n \n \nStating that one values all life is a nice sounding phrase but I suspect that, as with many pro-life advocates, you throw out such phrases without having thought about the details behind them. So, either admit that you have not put much thought into the substance of that phrase or outline your detailed value system behind it.\n\n \n Now I find that to be a BIG insult! How dare you say that I used a blanket statement. Without putting much thought into it? I have been debating with you for some time on this topic, and none of my arguments have been without full detail, and have never been just a pretty phrase. You on the other hand resulted to talking about sci-fi, and other off-topic things that really had nothing to do with reality. I will not admit that I used a phrase without putting any thought into it. Because I never use any thought, example, or phrase without being able to debate it in full detail. So either you just want to be insulting, or you have been blind to seeing anyone elses reason but your own. So why don't you admit that?! BTW I have already OUTLINED my reasons behind it. Just open your eyes. You will see where I put it up there.\n \n \nI understand your valuing the potential of the fetus. I also do but to a lesser extent than you do. As for valuing all life, you have yet to explain that in more detail, as I wrote in my previous paragraph.\n\n \n You are being redundant!! That is wasting a reply. If you have to say that you wrote something in your previous paragraph, then that should show you that you're not debating, you're being redundant. Something I hate.\n \n \n \nFirst, even without any sense input (real or artificial), the mind in a jar would still have its mental functions - functions that are a natural not artificial. I am not suggesting that it be supplied artificial sense inputs. However, even if it were supplied with artificial sense inputs, then the mind itself would not be a simulation. New technologies are coming out now (I have seen them discussed in technical conferences) and are starting to become more and more used which use microelectronic means to supply hearing to the deaf or sight to the blind. For those real currently existing people who use those technologies, do you think that they are just a simulation just because their sensory inputs are being supplied artificially?! I just don't see the logic in that reasoning.\n\n \n We are not talking about people who are being helped with artifical inputs, for hearing or seeeing. Which I myself am aware of. I to have seen these techniques put into play. And they are very limited. They place the inputs in the part of the brain that supplies sight, and they send electronic inpulses to that part of the brain, that generates shapes, and forms for a person who cannot see. First of all, that is beyond limited. Because the person still hardly sees anything, only vauge images. \n The person is still in darkness so-to-speak.\n \n This is different from your example of a brain in a jar. It has not memories, and no emotions. It is simulated. Even you yourself said you would not envy such a brain. Sounds like you are contridicting yourself here. And the logic behind my reasoning is clear......\n \n My reasoning helps me to see that a brain is put into a body for a reason. To be the main centeral network for the body. It works along with the nervous system. The brain works by way of inpulse to send messages. Without its network, it is nothing but an organ. The so-called memories it may posses while in the body, will no longer exsist. Because of the loss of blood supply to the brain. Which means it will become brain dead. Any information that it may have possessed will be gone! They can put it in the jar, and even put solution in there as well, and the brain will still be a useless organ. Why?! Because it is not in the proper place for it to even begin to function. If there have been studies where a brain functioned in a jar, showed emotions, and memories. Then show me your sources. In this case one would need sources to make this claim believeable.\n \n Of course a person who had a artificial input in their brain, is not looked at as less of a human. Why?! What is my logic behind this?! Because they still have a brain in its proper postion, that is working on their behalf, as well as a body, not a glass jar. All the things that are needed to be a human. Not a non-functional organ in a glass jar. \n \n And of course I consider people who have lost limbs to be human. Why not?! They are human. They only just lost a limb. Or cannot see, or hear. But they are still a functioning human being. Just with limits. A brain in the jar, does not function, if you say it does, give me the proof. Now you are using a statement that you possibly had not thought through. If not, then it should be no problem for you to show me proof of this claim.\n \n \nAlso, of course I wouldn't agree to a doctor putting my brain in a jar tomorrow (assuming that it would still function). I have stated numerous times that the body is very useful to the mind that possesses it. My point, which you are ignoring again, is that we still exist if our minds still exist. I wouldn't let a doctor amputate my leg un-necessarily since I could certainly use that leg. However, even if my leg was amputated, I would still exist. Similarly, I would fight tooth and nail against my brain being \"put in a jar\" since my body is obviously extremely useful to me, but I would still exist if that happened.\n \n \n But, all you need is your brain to be human. So why fight tooth and nail for a body that you can do without?\n \n Also, why do you keeep putting(if it would still be functional) in brackets. It seems as if you are second guessing or are not sure yourself if a brain would be functional once removed and put into a glass jar. But this is the claim you have been using all along. And if you ask me, your claim has been used by many pro-choice people. And I think this is a blanket phrase, one that you are not sure of yourself. Since you keep on alluding to whether it would still be functional or not.\n \n You may have stated once or twice that the body is useful to the brain that possess it. But you also turned around and stated that the body is not as valuable as the brain. But by the statement you made about fighting tooth and nail about putting your brain in a glass jar, you in my eyes re-tracked that statement, whether you realize it or not. Just by stating that you would fight to keep your brain in its body. \n \n Meaning that the body is just as valuable as the brain. Meaning that it does not matter whether a fetus has no mental exsistance, it still is valuable, because the body is forming. \n \n \nBut that person - deaf, blind, paralyzed, without a sense of touch - would be equally functional as a \"brain in a jar\". Why would you consider one a person and one not?\n\n \n LOL! I'm intrested in hearing why you would think that a person who is deaf,blind, paralyzed, or without a sense of touch would be compared to a brain in a jar. I want your reason behind this before I answer this question. \n \n \nWe humans have the capability of loving other humans, and when those humans die, we feel a strong sense of loss. The funeral is meant to ease the emotional loss for those people who are left. It gives them a sense of closure. It does nothing for the person who has died (unless one assumes an afterlife). \n \n Also, most of us who are living would like to be remembered well after we die so that we can feel like we accomplished something in life - it is tied in with the goals we set for ourselves in life and our self worth. This touches upon the other reason that we give nice funerals. Namely, it is a show of respect for the memory of the dead. Some believe that the soul of the departed loved one looks on at a funeral. Others don't have that belief. However, most people would like to have some dignified ceremony done after they die - to show the world that they had good aspects to be remembered for. Part of respecting a loved one during their lives is for them to be able to trust you that you will remember them after death - a funeral being the first and most critical step of that process. \n \n The fetus that is aborted never had a mental existence that wanted to be remembered or honored so there is no reason to honor their bodies for their sake. As for honoring their bodies for the sake of the ones who are left, that depends on what emotional attachment the others have toward that body. If a woman has an abortion because she knows that it is by far the best decision in her circumstances, then she might or might not feel a sense of loss. If she felt a sense of loss, then she might want to also perform some ceremony to lighten that loss. However, that would be only for her sake (or the sake of other people involved). As I mentioned before, any such ceremony or honoring of the fetal body would have nothing to do with the desires of the fetus itself since, prior to mental existence, the fetus never would have had any desires to begin with.\n\n \n Nice speech. But I know all of that already. The memories, and the times one spent. The name the dead loved one made for themsleves. But the end result is the same, whether the fetus has a desire or not. The situation is the same. You are giving a person honor without mental exsistance, at the end of their life. That standard should be the same at the beginning of \n their life. Memories or not. Mental exsistance or not.\n Its a shame that a person gets more love when they die, then when they are just beginning.\n \n \n \nI have stated numerous times that I do value the potential of that fetus - just not as much as you do. The thing I would place little value on is a hypothetical fetus that would be incapable of gaining mental existence - namely, a fetus without potential - which is not a real situation, just a hypothetical one presented for the sake of arguement. The potential is the only thing which I do value in the early fetus.\n\n \n Thats the thing, I'm not talking hyothetical. I'm talking reality. Since abortions are not hypothetical, this debate should not be either. You state one thing, and state all of these hypothtical examples, and never bring it down to where its place is in reality.\n \n And since you say the potential is the only thing in which you value in a fetus. Then you should understand my stand, and other pro-lifers stand when we stay potential is important. You spending all of this time trying to discredit the potential argument, and then saying you value potential, leaves people to wonder what your stance really is. Although you say you don't value it as much as we do. You should still be able to gather where pro-lifers are coming from when we say potential is important to us.",

   "I have already told you what life forms I value. So lets not get funky. I said, \"human life, from fetus to adult.\" \"Animal life,\" and \"plant life\". You brought up bacteria, when I never said that. But come to think about it, there are some bacteria that SHOULD be valued, because some bacteria are good for you. So guess what?! I value bactria as well. And I never said anything about valuing plant life over that of a human. It should be obvious which order they should go into. As a matter of fact I lined them up in proper order, putting human life first, and animal life secon, with plant life trailing in at third. Got it?! I sure hope so. \n\n You are, once again, missing the point. Of course I know that you value humans over plants - I even stated that in my post. The issue is WHY. You have still not detailed WHY you value humans over plants. \n \nNow I find that to be a BIG insult! How dare you say that I used a blanket statement. Without putting much thought into it? I have been debating with you for some time on this topic, and none of my arguments have been without full detail, and have never been just a pretty phrase. You on the other hand resulted to talking about sci-fi, and other off-topic things that really had nothing to do with reality. I will not admit that I used a phrase without putting any thought into it. Because I never use any thought, example, or phrase without being able to debate it in full detail. So either you just want to be insulting, or you have been blind to seeing anyone elses reason but your own. So why don't you admit that?! BTW I have already OUTLINED my reasons behind it. Just open your eyes. You will see where I put it up there.\n\n I was getting frustrated by you avoiding the question of which criteria you use in valuing one type of life over another. That is why I presented the challenge: \"So, either admit that you have not put much thought into the substance of that phrase or outline your detailed value system behind it.\" If you are unable to detail why you value one type of life over another, then it is clear that you are unable to because you haven't given it enough thought. Otherwise, perhaps you are unwilling to present the detailed analysis, in which case the question is why you would be unwilling to present the details. You could avoid all of this speculation by just coming out with it - Namely, again WHY specifically would you value a human over a plant.\n \n As for my using sci-fi hypothetical examples, that was presented to argue the philosophical point that I view the core of ourselves as being our mental existence. When real life does not present examples to fully illustrate a philosophical point, one goes to hypotheticals. This is commonly done in philosophical discussions, with which it seems that you are unfamiliar.\n \nWe are not talking about people who are being helped with artifical inputs, for hearing or seeeing. Which I myself am aware of. I to have seen these techniques put into play. And they are very limited. They place the inputs in the part of the brain that supplies sight, and they send electronic inpulses to that part of the brain, that generates shapes, and forms for a person who cannot see. First of all, that is beyond limited. Because the person still hardly sees anything, only vauge images. \n The person is still in darkness so-to-speak.\n \n This is different from your example of a brain in a jar. It has not memories, and no emotions. It is simulated. Even you yourself said you would not envy such a brain. Sounds like you are contridicting yourself here. And the logic behind my reasoning is clear......\n\n I see no logical reason why you think that a \"brain in a jar\" would have no emotions. As for memories, it would have no sense memories but we cannot conclude that it could have no imagination of any sort and no memory of the things it imagined. I don't think we have the scientific understanding to try to guess what a mind would imagine if it had no sense memories. As for your claim that I contradicted myself since I would not envy such a brain, that makes no logical sense. Once again you are missing the point. I do not envy a person whose leg is cut off but I still consider them a person. I would certainly not envy someone who is deaf, blind, and paralyzed, but I would still consider them a person. Where does envy fit into your picture of whether a person exists or not?!\n \nMy reasoning helps me to see that a brain is put into a body for a reason. To be the main centerl network for the body. It works along with the nervous system. The brain works by way of inpulse to send messages. Without its network, it is nothing but an organ. The so-called memories it may posses while in the body, will no longer exsist. Because of the loss of blood supply to the brain. Which means it will become brain dead. Any information that it may have possessed will be gone! They can put it in the jar, and even put solution in there as well, and the brain will still be a useless organ. Why?! Because it is not in the proper place for it to even begin to function. If there have been studies where a brain functioned in a jar, showed emotions, and memories. Then you me your sources. In this case one would need sources to make this claim believeable.\n\n You obviously have forgotten that our arguement was about a FUNCTIONing brain, not a non-functioning one. You had brought in the expression \"in a jar\", not I, but originally you talked about a FUNCTIONing brain in a jar. If you drop the FUNCTIONING part, then of course there is nothing left. \n \nOf course a person who had a artificial input in their brain, is not looked at as less of a human. Why?! What is my logic behind this?! Because they still have a brain in its proper postion, that is working on their behalf, as well as a body, not a glass jar. All the things that are needed to be a human. Not a non-functional organ in a glass jar. And of course I consider people who have lost limbs to be human. Why not?! They are human. They only just lost a limb. Are cannot see, or hear. But they are still a functioning human being. Just with limits. A brain in the jar, does not function, if you say it does, give me the proof. Now you are using a statement that you possibly had not thought about the details. If so, then it should be no problem for you to show me proof of this claim.\n\n Once again, it is you who are suddenly dropping the \"functioning\" part of our brain in a jar discussions. Up until now, I have always been speaking of a FUNCTIONing brain. If your memory is faulty in this discussion, that is not my fault. \n \nBut all you need is your brain to be human. So why fight tooth and nail for a body that you can do without?\n\n For the same reasons that I would fight against someone trying to un-necessarily amputate my functioning legs. Namely, I am quite attached to those functions I do have and would be quite unhappy if those functions were taken away. This is such an obvious point that I am surprised that you are continuing to bring this up.\n \nAlso, why do you keeep putting(if it would still be functional) in brackets. It seems as if you are second guessing or are not sure yourself if a brain would be functional once removed and put into a glass jar. But this is the claim you have been using all along. And if you ask me, your claim has been used by many pro-choice people. And I think this is a blanket phrase, one that you are not sure of yourself. Since you keep on alluding to whether it would still be functional or not.\n\n This is getting frustrating. The arguement that I presented that started this part of our discussion was that I view our mental existence as our core. I presented the artificially sustained brain as a hypothetical example to illustrate that, if all we had left was our mental existence, then I viewed that we would still exist. YOU are the one who introduced the term \"in a jar\". I often wrote in parentheses about it still being functional since I was assuming that the hypothetical example hadn't changed - i.e. that we were still talking about a FUNCTIONAL brain. I am getting frustrated enough with your lack of understanding of this hypothetical example that I think we should just drop it. I just do not feel like explaining it over and over. \n \nYou may have stated once or twice that the body is useful to the brain that possess it. But you also turned around and stated that the body is not as valuable as the brain. But by the statement you made about fighting tooth and nail about putting your brain in a glass jar, you in my eyes re-tracked that statement, whether you realize it or not. Just by stating that you would fight to keep your brain in its body. Meaning that the body is just as valuable as the brain. Meaning that it does not matter whether a fetus has no mental exsistance, it still is valuable, because the body is forming. \n\n That does not logically follow. Without a functioning body but with a functioning brain, I would still exist - probably fairly miserably but I would still be around and, who knows, might even learn to adapt to that situation and appreciate such a life. On the flip side, if my functioning body continued but my brain did not, then I wouldn't even be around. So, of course the brain is more critical - without it I don't even exist! Just because I value my brain more than my body does not mean that I do not also value my body. Of course I do. It gives me functions that I greatly appreciate. However, you might say that my brain supplies me the characteristic of even existing in the first place, which is a characteristic which I prize above all others. \n \nLOL! I'm intrested in hearing why you would think that a person who is deaf,blind, paralyzed, or without a sense of touch would be compared to a brain in a jar. I want your reason behind this before I answer this question. \n\n What use is a body (other than the brain) to a person? I see it as supplying them with their sensory inputs, with motion, and with a means of interacting with others, and supplies the life support system for itself and for the brain. If someone were born with no sensory inputs - including touch - because their body was so defective, and if they were also fully paralyzed, then the body would be of no use to them apart from supplying a life support system to the brain. I compared this with the hypothetical example of a functioning brain \"in a jar\" (as you had described it), since it similarly has no functioning body but has the same mental capabilities as that born person paralyzed and with no senses. From the point of view of the mind of either person, their experience (or lack thereof) would be pretty similar.\n \nNice speech. But I know all of that already. The memories, and the times one spent. The name the dead loved one made for themsleves. But the end result is the same, whether the fetus has a desire or not. The situation is the same. You are giving a person honor without mental exsistance, at the end of their life. That standard should be the same at the beginning of their life. Memories or not. Mental exsistance or not.\n Its a shame that a person gets more love when they die, then when they are just beginning.\n\n A person gets honored after they die because of what they did during their lives. It is part of our culture that people get credit for their accomplishments. This is part of what drives humans to try to accomplish little or great things to begin with. If we thought that we would be forgotten as soon as we died, then we might not try as hard for those accomplishments. We care about how we are remembered after death so we remember loved ones well after death as well.\n \n A fetus doesn't care in the least bit what is thought of him because it doesn't have any mental existence at all from which to do the caring. That leaves the value that others place on the fetus. As I said before, I value the potential of the fetus in that I can imagine that it could have become a full human and think of it as a loss that that human never came to be. However, unfertilized eggs also have the potential to become humans - they are farther away from that realization so the sense of any loss is quite small. People get emotionally attached to a wide variety of things. Some women have such a strong emotional attachment to their image of that fetus and what it might become that they would never abort. Others have less attachment. It is part of that value judgement about its potential which, as we have already discussed, you value more than do most pro-choice advocates.\n \nThats the thing, I'm not talking hyothetical. I'm talking reality. Since abortions are not hypothetical, this debate should not be either. You state one thing, and state all of these hypothtical examples, and never bring it down to where its place is in reality.\n\n To debate the morality of an issue, sometimes one has to go to hypotheticals to outline the philosophical underpinnings of that morality. \n \nAnd since you say the potential is the only thing in which you value in a fetus. Then you should understand my stand, and other pro-lifers stand when we stay potential is important. You spending all of this time trying to discredit the potential argument, and then saying you value potential, leaves people to wonder what your stance really is. Although you say you don't value it as much as we do. You should still be able to gather where pro-lifers are coming from when we say potential is important to us.\n\n I am not trying to discredit the potential arguement. I just value it less than you do in that I value a woman's right to her own body more than I value that potential. You seemed to suggest that there is more to the arguement than this difference in how we value potential. Is there or is there not more?",

I'll answer the questions you asked, and then I'm dropping this debate. Because I believe we have said all we need to say.\n \n You asked me why I would value a human over a plant. Why ask the question if you so-called know I never said I valued a plant over a human. But I will humor you and answer.\n \n Because as a human, we are the most intelligent speices, over animals, and plants. Human are over animals, because animals go by instincts. But humans are a more intelligent design so we use reason, and discrenment, to govern how we act in everyday life. A plant has no sense of reason, emotions, it only grows and feeds itself on sunlight and water. Thus making human more intelligent then a plant, and animals. I would think you would know these facts.\n \n I brought up the brain in a glass jar, because you seemed to be convinced that a brain can function on its own. I said, it could not function in a glass jar. And you proceeded to say that it could. So I went on to dispell those false statements. For which you only tend to repeat yourself and never come to any realistic terms as to proving this statement true. Also, you never responded when I spoke of a brain being brain dead once removed from the body. Therefore if talking about a brain in a jar, we could not be talking about a functioning brain. On the contrary, it would be reduced to a non-functional organ. Which you tend to disagree with.\n \n The fact that people feel an obligation to the dead loved one, is the point I'm trying to make. If they can feel and obligation to someone dead. Then the same would be for those fetuses that are being aborted. Also, answer me this. Why is it that family members who have not made a name for themselves, and who have not made much of their lives, are still mourned by family members after they have passed?! And this has been the situation with some in real life. So all so-called reputation aside, the family feels obligated to care for their loved ones even after death. The same should be applied to a fetus.\n \n I want to pin-point these things only, because everything else seems redundant. And I'm growing wary of it. If you feel that you cannot continue to debate this, without saying what has already been said. Then just let me know. Because that seems to be the trend going on here.",

If you feel that you cannot continue to debate this, without saying what has already been said. Then just let me know. Because that seems to be the trend going on here.\n\n Our mutual frustration in this debate is starting to escalate, so perhaps it is better to cool down or even potentially stop the discussion and also see if there is anywhere left to go with it. Perhaps because of this mutual frustration, it seems that you are not trying to understand my points and I might not be getting your points. It makes no sense to continue the debate at this level of emotional frustration. However, if there is something left to debate that can be done with cool minds, it might still be worth continuing. \n \n I personally think it is worth stepping back away from all the digressions and summaring both of our views, as I see them so far:\n \n My main points:\n 1. The core of our existence is our mental existence. Therefore, we, as people, do not exist until we mentally exist (beginning around third trimester) and stop existing once we stop mentally existing (death of higher brain functions). \n \n 2. Mental existence of humans is what I value most - mainly because I myself would like to be valued and the basis of my morality has me try to treat others as I would expect myself to be treated. This is a stance which is based on empathy and real empathy cannot exist without a mental existence in those with whom we are empathizing.\n \n 3. The fetus, prior to mental existence, still has value in that it has the potential of gaining that mental existence. However, I place less value in this potential than I do in a woman's right to her own body - a judgement call which partly determines my stance on abortion rights.\n \n 4. Our bodies also have value, but a body is only of value to the mind that possesses it. Without a mind, a body has little or no value, except for its potential to develop a mind. Therefore, the value I place in a fetus is in its potential to become more. \n \n 5. Any honoring of a body of a loved one after death is a statement of our appreciation of that deceased loved one coupled with a ceremony giving us a sense of emotional closure. The two motivations seem to be (a) we would want to be honored after death so we honor others after death (b) honoring others after death gives us a sense of emotional closure for our grief and sense of loss. Point (a) is not relevant for the fetus since the fetus aborted prior to mental existence had no desires one way or the other. With no mental existence, desire or any other feeling or emotion is impossible. However, point (b) still applies but is relative to the people in question since it relies on a value judgement. Some people place far more value in that pre-mentally-existing fetus than others and will feel a larger sense of loss. Though I would place some value on that fetus and feel some sense of loss, it is clearly less than what you would feel - because we judge that value differently.\n \n \n My understanding of your view so far:\n 1. You highly value the potential of the fetus - indeed, more so than the value (if any) that you place on a woman's right over her own body. This partly determines your stance on abortion.\n \n 2. You claim that the body is very valuable and that it is equally as valuable as the mind. I am not clear whether you think that we as people can exist as just bodies without minds, but you can choose whether or not to address this point. \n \n 2. You claim to value life independent of whether it has mental existence. It is not clear to me why mental existence does not matter to you in whether or not you favor life - particularly since you do place a scale on which forms of life you value:\n \nBecause as a human, we are the most intelligent speices, over animals, and plants. Human are over animals, because animals go by instincts. But humans are a more intelligent design so we use reason, and discrenment, to govern how we act in everyday life. A plant has no sense of reason, emotions, it only grows and feeds itself on sunlight and water. Thus making human more intelligent then a plant, and animals. \n\n This scale suggests that the values you place on various types of life depend on its mental capabilities. Logic would suggest that this scale of yours would also apply to different levels of human development - which seems contradictory to me given your arguement that you value life independent of mental existence. You may or may not wish to clarify this point.\n \n 3. You think that the fetus without mental existence should get at least the same type of value as is placed in a body of a loved one after death - which also has no mental existence. \n \n An important point which I would bring up in reference to that is that, in honoring the body, it is the memory of the person which we honor, not the body itself for its own sake. The body gets either buried, or burned, etc. If the body is on life-support, then, once a certain level of brain death determines lack of mental existence, then most of us would disconnect that body - causing its death. At that stage, where funerals are concerned, the body only acts as a symbol of the person who once resided in it. If we really valued the body itself, we would keep it on life-support forever, or keep it refrigerated forever - anything to keep it from degrading. We don't do that. It is just a symbol at that point. Also, honoring the body as a symbol does not hurt anybody - unlike a fetus, if you honor its body for what it WILL become, then you are hurting the woman who unwillingly carries it if you force her to carry it.\n \n Anyway, that is my summary of how I see things so far. If you disagree or think that I have not understood your point, then you are welcome to continue the discussion. I will restrain myself from snide comments as long as you do as well since our recent posts have demonstrated how such snide comments can escalate into frustrating posts where little gets accomplished. I think we were both to blame in letting our recent posts escalate. It is up to you now whether you wish to continue.",

But I also do not think that a brain can survive without a body. I think that they should be looked at as equaly valuable. Because they are both essential to making a fully funtional human being.\n\n I would agree that, with our current technology, the brain cannot exist without the body. Also, given the future hypothetical of a brain artificially sustained without the body (real or artificial), that mind would be VERY limited in what it could do. However, my main point in bringing up that hypothetical is to stress that I view our core as being our mental selves - independent of what functions we are capable of. So, perhaps we can address that more directly.\n \n My view of the core of ourselves being our mental selves comes from self observation. My body is something which is controlled by my mind (consciously or subconsciously). I can see it, control it, appreciate it for its function, recognize it as \"me\" in the most general sense. However, if various parts of it were taken away through amputation or loss of function, I would still be me. I would feel a strong sense of loss, but I would still be around. I don't view the opposite as being true, which makes the body ultimately optional from a philosophical point of view of our existence. From a practical point of view, which might be where you are coming from, our body is currently necessary for that mental existence, which is why it is currently required.\n \n The reason I bring this up again is to address the issue of when we as people start to exist - an issue which is important to the abortion debate. Ultimately, in addressing this question, it is not that critical whether one thinks the body is required or not. The most critical question is whether or not you think that a mind is necessary for our existence. If so, then, scientifically speaking, you would have to admit that we as people would not exist before the third trimester. The only alternatives are:\n A) You do not require a mind for our existence as people.\n B) You do not think the scientific consensus is correct that our minds cannot exist before the third trimester.\n \n So, let me ask you the following questions:\n (1) Do you think that some level of mind (a.k.a. mental existence) is necessary for our existence as people?\n (2) If the answer to (1) is yes, then when do you think that mind begins during the pregnancy? Namely, do you agree with the scientific view that it would not start before the third trimester or do you take a more supernatural stance?\n (3) If the answer to (1) is no, then would you view the following as a person. Specifically, if someone had such severe brain damage that he no longer had any mental existence and never could have it again and the only thing left alive was his mind-less body artificially sustained by machines. Would that living body without a mind or possibility of a mind still be a person in your view?\n \n2. The life forms that I stated as valuable, were not contridictory. I did mention Humans, and animals. But plants have no mental exsistance, and I value them as well. Trees have no mental exsistance, but I value their worth. For their beauty, and their oxygen, and their shade. The reason I put more value in humans, and animals, is not just the fact that they have a functioning brain. But the fact that they have functioning bodies, that move and generate sensation and emotions,(to a limited extent with animals.) While plants do not have these functions. So I'm still valuing the mind, as well as the body, when I choose to value one over the other. \n\n Both plants and early fetuses lack a mental existence. You mentioned a few characteristics which you value in plants. What characteristics do you value in early fetuses outside of their potential to become more? You mention its value in generating sensations and emotions but these functions only happen once a mental existence is there. It can, however, move in a random fashion before a mental existence comes into play. Is this part of what you value? What else do you value in the body of a fetus prior to mental existence?\n \nI feel that mental exsistance is very important. But that is not the only thing that should determine a person, or a things worth. I feel that when a fetus is at its early stages, that is a vital time. Because a body, which represnts a human is being formed. Which is just as valuable as brain is, in my view. And that is all that I'm trying to say.\n\n If I am reading you right, you are again stating your value in the potential of that body to become more. I think we both agree that, once it has mental existence, it is a person worthy of rights. However, I still am not clear whether or not you consider a fetus a person *at that moment* - i.e. before it gains that mental existence. If so, why? What specific characteristics would you require as a minimum for a person with rights?",

   "Lets break this down. Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts, or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights. The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state.\n \n Now, if I sat a flower pot down next to you, would you tell me it should have rights and that we should make pot smashing murder? Probably not. BUT, what if that pot started to talk to you. Started to ask you questions about life, and started to ask you where it was and what its purpose was. What if you had a casual conversation with this pot? Now, obviously, this pot should have rights, am I not correct? Since I'm a hardcore trekkie (and I know quoting star trek isn't the best debate, but its a good analogy), I can relate to what Commander data was going through. In case you didn't know, Commander Data is an anderoid, a Robot. But, he is hard to tell apart from a human. When he was first being built, he was not considered a sentient being. He was a bunch of parts, but when those parts were put together and he was activated, it was then he was considered a sentient being deserving of rights. This can very much relate to an embryo. An embryo is in early stages. It is like commander data in parts. They did not consider data a sentient being deserving of rights. However once he was activated, the captain and the crew had to defend his rights on numerous occasions. An embryo can also be like a flower pot. Even though that flower pot may have the capability to develop intelligence, it lacks intelligence. But, as i said before, if that flower pot started talking to you, then it obviously has developed intelligence and is deserving of rights. The same goes with your computer. If it becomes self aware, and starts talking to you, it is then that it deserves rights.\n \n \n Simply because an embryo shares some human DNA is no excuse to grant it an exception. I know many of you will bring up eugenics and the mentally ill, but the mentally do posses intelligence. Maybe not as much as you or I, but they still posses it.\n\n \n Is a computer with AI deserving of rights?",
