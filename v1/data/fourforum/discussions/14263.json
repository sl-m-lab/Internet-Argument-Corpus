   "Messianic Jews!\n \n I know I haven't been very active on the religion forum, so I'll make my views on religion clear now. I categorize myself as an agnostic. I'm not anti-religion, but I see alot of doctrinal problems with modern Christianity. They don't practice the bible as well as they think.\n \n They don't follow the Holy Days in Leviticus 23 or the Kosher Food Laws in Leviticus 11 that the Jews and Messianic Jews practice. They also keep Easter, which is only mentioned in Romanized versions of the bible and Christmas, which isn't mentioned in the Bible.\n \n In his own Words, Yeshua said:\n \n \n\n 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\n 18 For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\n \n",

   "Given that there is no consistant position with respect to the believer and his/her relation to the Law in the books of the bible as a whole, it's somewhat unfair to say they do not follow it as well as they think. For, although Matthew and his community are undoubtedly Torah-observant, the message of others (particularly Paul) is decidedly not, at least not in whole.\n \n If that's true, one's position has to be grounded differently. Are those passages in Matthew the words of Jesus or the words of the Evangelist? David Sim has argued that Matthew is filled with anti-Pauline polemic, e.g. Did Jesus ever take a firm, explicit position on gentiles in the kingdom of god? If he did and he thought they needed to undergo full Jewish proselytization -- an entirely reasonable position and one we know some early Christians took -- how are we to explain the relatively easy conversion of Jesus' disciples and family to Paul's position?",

   " Did Jesus ever take a firm, explicit position on gentiles in the kingdom of god? If he did and he thought they needed to undergo full Jewish proselytization -- an entirely reasonable position and one we know some early Christians took -- how are we to explain the relatively easy conversion of Jesus' disciples and family to Paul's position?\n\n \n It's simple - Jesus' position had a great deal in common with Paul's position.\n \n Did Jesus and Paul teach the same thing?\n \n Some critics of Christianity try and set Paul against Jesus. They will often claim that what Paul taught is not what Jesus said and that present-day Christianity is derived not from Jesus, but from Paul's teaching. This is an erroneous claim that does not fit the facts. It is easy to take various scriptures out of context and try and set one person against another -- as many critics of Christianity have done. Nevertheless, we can confidently expect that Jesus and Paul taught the same thing. Granted, Paul focused more on theological issues than Jesus did, but nothing Paul said is contrary to Christ. \n \n Luke wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. In Acts 9 Luke records the events surrounding Paul's conversion. We see that Jesus himself called Paul and sent him to be an apostle. If Paul and Jesus are not in agreement, then why would Jesus call Paul to be his apostle? Jesus is God in flesh and would therefore know all things. Jesus would certainly have known what Paul would teach which, it seems, is one of the reasons Jesus called him.\n \n In addition, we can quickly see by examining what Jesus said and finding parallels in what Paul said. Following is a brief alphabetical list comparing the words of Christ with the words of Paul. We can clearly see that they were indeed in agreement and that the critics who would set Paul against Christ don't know what they're talking about.\n \n Alive in Christ\n \n Jesus\n \"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes,\" (John 5:21). \n \n Paul\n \"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive,\" (1 Cor. 15:22). \n \n Anxiety\n \n Jesus\n \"For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, as to what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, as to what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than clothing?\" (Matt. 6:25). \n \n Paul\n \"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God,\" (Phil. 4:6). \n \n Atonement\n \n Jesus\n \"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep,\" (John 10:11) \n \n Paul\n \"and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma,\" (Eph. 5:2).\n \n Deity of Jesus\n \n Jesus\n \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am,\" (John 8:58). Compare with Exodus 3:14, \"And God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM\"; and He said, \"Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, &#8216;I AM has sent me to you.&#8217;\"\n \n Paul \n \"For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,\" (Col. 2:9). See also, Phil. 2:5-8. \n \n Forgiveness\n \n Jesus\n \"For if you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,\" (Matt. 6:14). \n \n Paul\n \"And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you,\" (Eph. 4:32).\n \n Jesus is the only way\n \n Jesus\n \"Jesus *said to him, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me,\" (John 14:6). \n \n Paul\n \"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,\" (1 Tim. 2:5). \n \n Justification by faith\n \n Jesus\n \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life,\" (John 5:24). See also John 3:16-18; Luke 18:9-13. \n \n Paul\n \"Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\" (Rom. 5:1). \n \n The Law\n \n Jesus\n \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill,\" (Matt. 5:17).\n \n Paul\n \"Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law,\" (Rom. 3:31).\n \n \"What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise,\" (Gal. 3:17). \n \n Living the Law\n \n Jesus\n \"You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; 19 Honor your father and mother; and You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" (Matt. 19:18).\n \n Paul\n \"Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 9 For this, \"You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,\" and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" 10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; love therefore is the fulfillment of the law,\" (Rom. 13:8-10) \n \n Resurrection\n \n Jesus\n \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men; 23 and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day,\" (Matt. 17:22-23). \n \n Paul\n \"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,\" (1 Cor. 15:3-4).\n \n Rewards and Punishment\n \n Jesus\n \"For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and will then recompense every man according to his deeds,\" (Matt. 16:27). \n \n Paul\n \"who will render to every man according to his deeds,\" (Rom. 2:6).\n \n Sinfulness of man\n \n Jesus\n \"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. 20 \"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man,\" (Matt. 15:19). \n \n Paul\n \"There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one,&#8221; (Rom. 3:11-12). \n \n Tradition\n \n Jesus\n \"And why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?\" (Matt. 15:3).\n \n Paul\n \"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ,\" (Col. 2:8). \n \n Works Righteousness denied\n \n Jesus\n \"Many will say to Me on that day, &#8216;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?&#8217; 23 \"And then I will declare to them, &#8216;I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness,\" (Matt. 7:22-23).\n \n Paul\n \"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, \"The righteous man shall live by faith,\" (Gal. 3:11). \n \n Did Jesus and Paul teach the same thing? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry",

   " Did Jesus ever take a firm, explicit position on gentiles in the kingdom of god? \n\n \n I don't know if you want to call it a \"firm\" position, but it looks to me like his plan for the gentiles was quite similar to what he had for the Jews, including salvation and baptism in Christ:\n \n God relates Jesus' future mission to the Gentiles: \n \n \"It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.\" (Isaiah 49:5,6) \n \n Jesus fulfills Isaiah's prophecy concerning his revelation to the Gentiles of Galilee: \n \n Matthew 4:13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali-- 14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: 15 \"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- 16 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.\" \n \n Jesus preaches to large crowds of Gentiles and heals many: \n \n Matthew 5:23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 24 News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them. 25 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him. \n \n Jesus heals the Gentile Centurion's servant:\n \n As he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him and saying, \"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.\" And he said to him, \"I will come and heal him.\" But the centurion answered him, \"Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" (Matthew 8:5-10) \n \n Jesus heals a deaf Gentile: \n \n Mark 7:31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. 32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. 33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\"). 35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. \n \n Jesus witnesses to the Greeks: \n \n John 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. 21T hey came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" 22 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. 23 Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 25 The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.... 34 The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?\" 35 Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. 36 Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\"\n \n Jesus visits Samaria and teaches there: \n \n John 4:39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 41 And because of his words many more became believers. \n \n Jesus commands his disciples to take his Gospel to all nations: \n \n Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. \n \n Elsewhere, Jesus heals the Gentile Woman's daughter (Matthew 15), appoints Paul as a witness to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), and suffers on the Cross of Calvary for the sins of all men (Jew and Gentile alike).",

   "This copypasta bears little resemblance to anything I said above, nor to the OP. It is, additionally, largely wrong:\n \n Isaiah 49 has nothing to do with Jesus. Matt 4 is clearly not describing \"his revelation to the Gentiles of Galilee\" (what gentiles of Galilee?) but the geography of his ministry, the centurian is not obviously a gentile even in Matt's redactional context, the context of John 12 is artificial, Samaritans were/are not gentiles, it isn't at all clear why your source thinks the deaf-mute in Mark 7 is a gentile, since the clearest sense of the Greek -- &#949;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#951;&#957; &#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#951;&#962; &#947;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#945;&#957;&#945; &#956;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#962; -- is that he is presently in the area around the Sea of Galilee (&#949;&#953;&#962; [into] &#964;&#951;&#957; [the] &#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957; [Sea] &#964;&#951;&#962; [of the] &#947;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#945;&#962; [Galilee]) having gone through the middle of the Decapolis region (&#945;&#957;&#945; [up] &#956;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#957; [middle] &#964;&#969;&#957; [of the] &#959;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#957; [region] &#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#962; [of Decapolis]), not to mention that the entire verse is clearly redactional.\n \n So, the point is the same.
