These are the same people that would champion the rights of criminals and rapist and trample those of the victims on the same stage. I bet they would do away with the death penalty if given the chance. They put the lives of criminals over the lives of the victims. I wonder what this truck drivers rap sheet looks like. Let a truck driver try this on me. He will see my gun when it is too late for him to back off. He was probably just mad becuase he could not rape this woman becuase she was not defenceless so he called the police.",

   "Well I cant tell if you are serious or are being sarcastic but this will also tell everyone who comes accross it.\n \n Ron Dixon is a computer egineer and a Veteran of the U.S. Navy where he was a munitions expert. He has 2 children and a girlfriend. One night Ivan Thompson 40 (a man with a 14 page rap sheet) broke into his house. Mr. Dixon found him at the door of his two year old son's room and shot him twice with a legally purchased 9mm that was in the process of being registered according to state law. The registration had not gone through yet but he had done everything necessary, just waiting on the registration. \n Then the Brooklyn DA (Hynes to be exact) decided to charge him for possesion of an un-registered firearm which carries a 1 year prison sentence. Mr. Dixon's Attorney Andrew Friedman has said that any ammount of time behind bars is unacceptable and I tend to agree. \n You can contact the Brooklyn DA's office (Hynes does not have a direct emial to him) schmetj@brooklynda.org or you can call \n (718) 250-2300\n Your support is appreciated.",
