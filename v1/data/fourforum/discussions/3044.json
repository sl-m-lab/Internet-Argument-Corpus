   "The impression that I have gotten from the news is that the majority of people who have been exonerated by DNA, years after their initial conviction have been African Americans. Given that African Americans make up what about 40% of the prision pop, this would seem to indicate a possible racist attitude with regards to the legal system towards African Americans who are accused of crimes.",

   "The US is very racist. The nation is over 200-years old and schools have been integrated for only 40-years. That took violence and federal troops to accomplish, providing an insight as to how deeply seated racism actually is in a country trying to force democracy down the throats of (not my words, but a common US expression) ungrateful ragheads. The social problem of blacks comprising a majority of the prison population is, according to many sociologists, a direct result of decades of ongoing discrimination using social engineering in the form of subsistence level financial and material aid to ignore the problem.",

   "Just recently in Illinois 13 inmates on death row were exonerated and released from prison before they were executed. There is no proof that innocent people were executed ever, but the investigations end after the execution, so who knows for sure.\n \n Anyway, the Republican governor at that time stayed the executions of all on death row in his state. If I remember right, it appeared that some of the DA&#8217;s purposefully ignored evidence that could have cleared some of the defendants. They were not interested in justice as much as furthering their careers.\n \n Here is the story:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/11/illinois.death.row/\n \n \n Capital punishment in Illinois came under the microscope after a group of journalism students at Northwestern began looking into the case of Anthony Porter in the late 1990s. \n \n The students, working with their professor and a private investigator, found evidence that cleared Porter after 17 years on death row. Ryan vowed he would do whatever it took to \"prevent another Anthony Porter.\" \n \n Ultimately, 13 inmates who had been sentenced to death were exonerated, and Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in the state.\n \n \n \n \n Listen to what some people said even after 13 innocent people were almost executed:\n \n \"Everybody has had not their day in court, they've had their years in court,\" Lyons said. \"It's shameful that the victims of this state, in fact, have to not fear the courts, not the defense lawyers, not the defendants, but they have to fear their very own governor.\"\n \n What are they saying? Do they just want someone to pay, even if the person executed is not the right person? They had their day in court. Sure.",
