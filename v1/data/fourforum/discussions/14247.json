   "Is D.C.&#8217;s Continued Fight Against Handguns Constitutional? - Law Blog - WSJ\n \n \nBack in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court gave gun-rights advocates a big win when it found Washington, D.C.'s ban on handguns unconstitutional.\n \n The ruling also gave federal courts something: the likelihood of a lot more challenges based on the Second Amendment.\n \n The WSJ's Gary Fields examines this dynamic in a page-one story on Monday. He starts with this: that although the handgun ban in D.C. was shot down two years ago, D.C. hasn't exactly made buying a handgun as easy as snapping up some Redskins paraphernalia.\n \n According to Fields, legal gun owners must be registered by the city. The District limits the number of bullets a gun can hold and the type of firearm residents can buy. It requires that by next year manufacturers sell guns equipped with a special identification technology-one that hasn't yet been adopted by the industry.\n \n But are these types of restrictions constitutional? Gun-control supporters say yes, that Heller didn't outlaw all gun control. \"From our perspective, there's a broad range of gun-control steps that can be taken that would be constitutional post-Heller,\" said Chad Ramsey of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n \n Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, said the city's new rules strike against the spirit of the Supreme Court's decision. \"Can you go out and buy guns in D.C. and defend yourself as the Supreme Court said you should be able to? No. The citizens can't experience the freedom from a practical level. What good is winning it philosophically?\"\n \n Right now, writes Fields, the legal advantage lies with the District. In a federal District Court ruling in March, Judge Ricardo Urbina upheld the city's gun law, writing that the Supreme Court didn't rule gun registration \"unconstitutional as a general matter.\" The judge concluded the city had the power to limit the kinds of firearms permissible and the size of ammunition magazines.\n \n Gun-rights groups and several plaintiffs are appealing the ruling.\n \n That said, the battle in the District stands in contrast with other areas of the country where gun-rights advocates have been enjoying success. Last month, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law permitting residents 21 years and older to carry concealed weapons without permits. On April 19, armed protesters assembled in federal parks in Virginia, including Gravelly Point Park directly across the Potomac River from Washington, taking advantage of a law signed in 2009 by President Barack Obama that allows visitors to carry loaded firearms into national parks as long as the state allows it.\n",

Maybe not even a substantial decrease.\n\n \n I tend to agree with this forecast. I don't see the Court striking down too many current laws. We see challenges in Va already over felon in possession laws and laws punishing armed drug dealers. None of these challenges will succeed even if McDonald applies the 2nd. Amendment against the states. Heller was never about an \"all or nothing\" absolute right. Heller itself talked about \"longstanding\" prohibitions like those above in a way that clearly suggests these limits will survive.\n \n Here is where I see the primary future impact of Heller. Before Heller the argument was we had no individual right, and therefore the only hindrance to gun control fanatics was a legislative disinclination to adopt their Christmas wish list of gun ban proposals. The real significance of Heller (and I ultimately hope McDonald) is that SCOTUS has finally decided to cross several things off the gun ban wish list by recognizing the right does indeed exist. Now we finally have a real line drawn in the sand. It's not very long yet, and it is still needs a lot of filling in which will by necessity come on a case-by-case basis. But as a general forecast of what SCOTUS is likely to do I don' think the court will take the line very far backwards from where we are now, and I think it will even permit further restrictions beyond where we are now (like registration-which Heller clearly mentioned).\n \n The real battles will continue to be fought in the legislatures. SCOTUS will only build the foundation of the house and say to the Brady Campaign \"This is the bedrock of the right. Thou shalt not dig any deeper into the right.\" It's up to all of us to continue to fight to build the frame of the house on top of the floor SCOTUS will lay for us.",

Why is a gun store any different from any other business? It is not! \n \n Texas avoided the issue by explicitly ruling out zoning or the fire code as excuses to regulate guns and the right to carry. Once the city of Ft. Worth, where Cheaper than Dirt operates, was hit with a notice that the store which ships literally million of rounds of ammo a day and sells OTC many thousands of rounds of ammo not counting other accessories was told it had to limit it's practices because of Fire Dept. ordinances. To make a long story short, the legislature or part of them any way, threatened to take the mayor, council and Fire Dept. to court in a suit. The city and all involved restructured in a hurry and beat a hasty retreat. So now when you order from CTD, you will, as Paul Harvey used to say, know the rest of the story. That is the beauty of having a State pre-emption declaration. \n I would guess that DC is making every effort to not obey the law nor the SCOTUS ruling and is playing games at the expense of the people.

   "I am against training requirements for the exercise of one's 2A rights for this very reason.\n\n \n Then you are standing on proper Constitutional ground. To Wit:\n \n \"The Right is General. - It may be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation NOT warranted by the INTENT. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision UNDOUBTEDLY is, that THE PEOPLE, from whom the militia must be taken, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, and THEY NEED NO PERMISSION OR REGULATION OF LAW FOR THE PURPOSE. But this enables the government to have a well regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for VOLUNTARY discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.\"\n \n - Thomas M. Cooley, LL.D., THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA [1880], FOURTH EDITION EDITED BY JON ROLAND, (Constitution Society), 2002. (Mr. Cooley was Dean of the University of Michigan's Law School, Michigan Supreme Court justice, and a nationally recognized scholar. As well as one of the authorities quoted in the recent U.S. District Court of Appeals case before the U.S. Supreme Court).",
