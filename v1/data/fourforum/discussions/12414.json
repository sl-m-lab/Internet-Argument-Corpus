The conservative was one seat behind him, also sitting next to the window. Pretty soon, the bus came to a red light and stopped. As both the liberal and the conservative watched out the window, a businessman in a brand new Rolls Royce pulled up next to the bus.\n \n The conservative thought to himself, \"Wow. I bet if I work hard, focus on doing better in school in order to improve myself, and strive for success, someday, I too can ride in a Rolls Royce just like him.\"\n \n The liberal thought to himself, \"Wow.

How dare they desire to limit radical, left-wing, indoctrination! Why do they want us to stop letting people like Ward Churchill brainwash them about the THEORY of evolution and global warming, while the righties spout off about history and the Founders and reading about the constitution and all that nonsense?), and , forcing poor mothers to work rather than raise their kids, (Yeah! Why do they always insist on people earning their keep? Don't those cold hearted righties know that the reason they paid all those expensive tuitions to those ivy league schools in order to make all that money was so they could spend it on programs for those of us who decided not to apply ourselves, get pregnant, skip school, and generally fail to make decisions for the future...unless, of course, said decision was to get pregnant in order to get on the public dole.) preventing public health care (Yeah! Cause public health care is the epitome of efficiency! Plus, it's one more thing the rich can be responsible for. Private health care actually requires one to have A JOB in order to afford it. Who wants one of those? Even if you do, nobody's hiring thanks to the huge amount of taxes we're going to make those rich bastards pay....oh....wait.....uh) and numerous other measures designed to keep the poor in their place and the rich, rich. (Yeah! Cause the way to enable the poor to elevate themselves sure isn't to provide an incentive to do so. Who wants to be required to apply themselves and manage their own affairs by taking responsibility? Who wants to work hard, get an education, and strive to make money? Those are the people we need to tax more! That way, all the effort, decision making, and hard work those evil rich people undertake throughout their lives will be REDISTRIBUTED to those who do absolutely nothing but sit on their butts, watch American Idol, eat Cheetos, and take handouts! Why get a job when those rich people can do all the work, while we receive the benefits? Woo-hoo! EAT THE RICH!\n \n I just have one question:\n \n When you finally achieve your goal of taking it all away from the rich so the poor can squander it on Twinkies and generic cigarettes, who will you take it from next when we're all living in a van down by the river?\n \n Seems like the free handouts will stop after there's nobody left to take it from. Then what?\n \n I really like the quote in Daewoo's signature: \nIf ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you; May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen. &#8212;Samuel Adams \n\n \n Just as the \"bail-outs\" have bound he future of those companies that took them to the whims of those who \"bailed\", \"hand-outs\" bind those that take them to the will of those that \"handed\". Your indignation at those that are taken from is self-demeaning. Oh how you hate the very people that you require to exist in order to keep your binding government programs. If it weren't for those very rich you require to take from, you'd be eating dirt, yet you desire the rich to no longer exist.",

What about that big bad ol' national debt that evil Bushie was so horribly adding to?\n \n Oh yeah. Now, there's a liberal president that has created a BLACK HOLE of national debt. TRILLIONS upon TRILLIONS of dollars. A debt so large that the calculated interest will far outstrip the means to even print money fast enough to keep up with it. (The interest on the trillions of dollars per day will be more than the full capacity our mints can print in one day....leading to more trillions in debt = BLACK HOLE) I'm sure this will work wonders for the value of the dollar. \n \n Funny, that moaning and wailing about the national debt has become eerily quiet, has it not?\n \n \nThere's a new sheriff and posse in town\n\n \n Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

Executive pay of PRIVATE COMPANIES? How about that AIG bonus fiasco, huh? Wasn't there a 90% tax rate passed just to recoup those specific bonuses? Weren't those executives guilted into giving the money (that Democrat Chris Dodd insured was in the stimulous bill himself) back? Isn't that \"severe economic and social regimentation\"? \n \n \nforcible suppression of opposition.\n Google \"Fairness Doctrine\".\n \n Yeah. It's 1984. Doublespeak rules the day.
