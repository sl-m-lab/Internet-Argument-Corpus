   "UN Concludes: White Nations are the Best Places to Live\n \n Source:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3362\n \n \n [If Malaysians can do it, then why can't Americans and Europeans?]\n \n Malaysia to expel illegal workers\n \n The Malaysian government says it plans to expel more than a million illegal migrant workers.\n \n The country's Home Minister says 400,000 members of Malaysia's volunteer corps will be mobilised and special squads are already being trained to enforce their removal.\n \n No official reason has been given, but there is widespread concern in Malaysia about rising levels of crime. \n \n Home Minister Azmi Khalid warned the businesses that employ the illegal immigrants not to complain when their workers are rounded up. \"We are serious,\" he said.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3889217.stm\n \n \n Zimbabwe Goes High Tech: Ox-Drawn Ambulances\n \n President Robert Mugabe's government, which faces acute foreign currency shortages and a collapsing health sector, has introduced ox-drawn ambulances to ferry ill people to health centres in rural areas.\n \n Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe News Service (ZNS) has reported that the Zimbabwean government has banned the colour red from the state-run national television because it is the official colour of the opposition party MDC.\n \n The first casualty of the \"no red\" directive has been the Red Ribbon, the internationally recognised HIV and Aids awareness symbol.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=vn20040713031123194C268674\n \n \n Whites flee Zimbabwe in droves\n \n The exodus of Zimbabwe's small and anguished white population is under way with record numbers leaving their homeland, mostly for Britain or Australia.\n \n They say they have hung on during the past four tumultuous years hoping President Robert Mugabe's \"hate\" campaign against them would ease, but it did not, and two months ago when he shut down private schools for a week for raising fees, they lost their nerve.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=vn20040711105647390C223448\n \n \n \n .",
