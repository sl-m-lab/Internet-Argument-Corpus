   "No doubt there is a simple explanation here.\n ========================\n \n Fri, April 29, 2005\n \n Dynamite found in truck\n Former Calgarian charged in Kelowna with explosives\n By MIKE D'AMOUR, CALGARY SUN\n \n Dynamite, fertilizer and fuel oil -- the same deadly combination used in the Oklahoma City bombing a decade ago -- were found in the possession of a former Calgarian who was arrested in a stolen truck. Kevin West Kisby, 39, who used to live in the city's northeast, was pulled over by an alert Kelowna Mountie April 21, said RCMP Cpl. Reg Burgess.\n \n \"The member, who's a dog handler, saw a nice new truck and didn't like the looks of the driver,\" Burgess said.\n \n The cop's instincts were correct -- the 2005 Ford F-350 Kisby was driving was reported stolen April 18 in Innisfail. But police are now more concerned where the 97 sticks of dynamite and a 10-kg mixture of fertilizer and fuel oil found in the box of the truck were destined.\n \n \"The suspect isn't what you'd call real talkative on the subject,\" said Burgess.\n \n Neither were Joseph Thelonius Embra and Kim Jeanette Keilback, two people who were arrested in the truck with the former Calgarian, who now lives in Winfield, a small town north of Kelowna.\n \n All three are charged with possessing stolen property.\n \n Kisby and Keilback are both charged with making or possessing explosives. Kisby is also charged with possessing a firearm contrary to a court order.\n \n Burgess said it's possible the trio planned to sell the explosives for drugs or money, or something more sinister.\n \n \"If we caught a couple of Alberta farmers with some dynamite, it wouldn't be unusual because they use it to blow up stumps,\" said Burgess. \"But when we find ammonium nitrite and fuel oil, you don't use that to blow up stumps.\"\n \n B.C. explosives expert Louis Marton said what was found in the truck would be enough to destroy a three-storey building if distributed among key support columns and used in a confined space.\n \n The fertilizer/fuel oil mixture has almost the strength as low-grade dynamite.\n \n However, it is a blasting agent and requires dynamite to explode.\n \n The same mixture was used in the Oklahoma City bombing April 19, 1995,..\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/CalgarySun/News/2005/04/29/1017826-sun.html",

   "\n I would have gone throught the Coutts (sp) boarder crossing in the middle of the night (no guards)\n\n \n You had better watch doing that. I hear from frinds who live in the northern US and cross the border often that now they have cameras at those crossings, and they mail you a ticket. Pretty harsh.\n \n Why bother bringing it from canada anyway? I buy dynamite about once a year at the local coop. It is $100 per case (a case is 100 sticks.,...wonder where the other 3 sticks went in this case...) and all that is required is a drivers licese to get it, unlesss you are obviously over 18, then you just need $100.\n \n Ammonium nitrate is also available in any quantity you may wish to purchse, htough if you purchse over a ton you might get a visit from the FBI, which is interesting.....2 well dressed FBI agents looking very sheepish standing on your porch, looking at your freshly fertilised fields, asking what you did with the fertilizer you bought. Even they seem to know it is a rediculous exercise in futility. \n \n 50 LB bag of ammonium nitrate, 2 gallons of fuel oil (kerosene will work fine) and a stick of dynamite = instant duck pond. String it out in a line about 8\" wide, and you can make a pretty fine instant irrigation ditch.\n \n I know these guys were probably up to some dastardly deed (or just looking to have some fun with some big fireworks), but you have to wonder what they were plannign to do with such a small amount of explosives. contrary to what you may have seen in the movies, a stick of dynamite is not an all powerful device, adn 20kg of ANFO is not even enough to make a decent duck pond. \n \n I like the part in the article that says:\n \n \nB.C. explosives expert Louis Marton said what was found in the truck would be enough to destroy a three-storey building if distributed among key support columns and used in a confined space. \n \n \n You would think the tenants of the building would wonder why the guys were drilling the columns and putting sticks of dynamite in, since dynamite tied to a support column (or any substantial piece of concrete) simply breaks off a small chunk, and the explosion is focused away by the mass of the column (in fact, a piece of dynamite laying on a 4\" concrete slab and detonated will not even break the slab, just put a little crater in it about 1.5\" deep and 6\" around...YES, I ended up having to take the damn walkway out with a bobcat).\n \n I would almost bet this is just another example for the books of idiot criminals. If they were plannign on doing somethign spectacular with it, they needed a LOT more explosives.",

What happened to the good old days when bikers just hit each other with chains and ball peen hammers?\n\n \n For years most of the quality Western US pot was grown in N. California, S. Oregon and parts of Idaho. As the US federal government became more influenced by the political clout of religion money began to flow to law enforcement in those states to contain the 'deadly weed'. First National Guard helicopters with infrared technology began working with local LE and put a crimp in those crops. When that was deemed successful, any podunk county that could bust a one plant grower became eligible for federal helicopter grants. $3-600k chopper grants were and are approved in a matter of weeks. That pretty well ended most large scale cultivation. \n \n Supply and demand being what it is, production migrated to BC, now known as the supplier of premium cannabis for Canada, the US Western and upper Midwestern states. Big, tax free money always develops intense competition for market share. Let's face it, once again the US is behind the curve; bombs are much more effective than handguns in intimidating the competition.",

As for BC, younger Canadians are proup of the crop known as BC bud, supposedly having a THC concentration of 3 times that of normal weed\n\n \n Medium-large US hydroponic and soil growing operations are now somewhat limited to artificial lights in rented, private residences, making law enforcement simple from the aspect that they (LE) have utility providers employ their software to note electricity usage considered abnormal for single residence locations. Each month local utilities upload those lists to the appropriate LE. \n \n More popular has been the utilization of 40' shipping containers, $1000, buried underground with $3000 generators and diffused emission to evade infrared detection. I've read a couple of articles about the investment to return on a single, two-tiered harvest and it boggles the mind. Again, demand creates supply, distribution being the control point, with violence as required to establish rights. What an absolute tax revenue system gaping hole. \n \n Canadian BC bud seeds from culled plants sold openly are also an amazing market.",
