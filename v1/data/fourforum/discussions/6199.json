Let's think a bit about what's really involved here. \n \n Well, for starters, (as the skeptic might observe) does the United States seriously believe that it can \"build a nation\" in its own image and likeness in a space of three or four years - even if the co-operation of the educated elite of Iraq could be counted on ? Just a cursory glance at the history of the British Empire will reveal that transforming a \"protectorate\" into an independent state with the approved democratic institutions takes years - many years. There is no quick fix in an enterprise of such political complexity.\n \n To bring Iraq \"up to speed\" as a fully-fledged democracy complete with an American seal of approval, would require an incalculable investment of money, people, and patience over an indefinite time span. Administrators - preferably specially trained at Ivy League universities - would have to be prepared to spend the best years of their lives in Iraq establishing the political, judicial, financial, educational, and economic institutions that are fundamentally necessary in a modern state and before they could be handed over to Iraqi control.\n \n I suggest that thinking about the long term nature of the \"official\" task they have set themselves in Iraq, is alien to the American psyche - which demands quick results and hankers for immediate gratification of the desire for ideal solutions.",

A good theoretical question would be US public acceptance of Iraq occupation if US gasoline prices were going down?\n\n Your reminder that the engine of imperialism is driven by market forces - perhaps with a veneer of altruism to cover the naked economic exploitation - resonates with my unbridled cynicism.\n \n However, let's put aside our many points of agreement on the nature of the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle that the US has managed to contrive in Iraq, and examine a few \"novel\" proposals which you might like to smash out of the ball park.\n \n Supposing the US asked for and was granted a UN mandate to annex Iraq and govern it as a \"protectorate\" for say 50 years. The economic payoff for America is pretty obvious - it would have privileged access to the second largest proven reserves of oil in the world. There's probably enough oil under Iraq to keep the US economy ticking over very smoothly for two or three decades - if, of course, the US managed the whole industry and had preferential terms for investment and exploitation. \n \n But what would Iraq get in return for seeing its only valuable natural resource devoured by the Americans ? Well, following the precedent set by British imperialism, at least in some colonies, they would get government by an impartial American bureaucracy whose \"mission\" would be to create the political, legal, and financial infrastructure that would encourage free capital flows, free trade, free information flows, and (possibly) free migration to the USA. Eventually, a stable political environment resulting from the establishment of the rule of law, responsible fiscal and monetary policies, etc., would attract substantial inflows of US investment so the diversification of the Iraqi economy would gather pace and, hey presto, there should be a viable semi-industrialised state in which people could prosper when the oil finally dries up and the Americans depart.\n \n A pre-supposition that I have not included (because it's too absurd to insinuate) is that the US would have to get the upper hand in the ongoing insurgency before any colonial administration could materialise.\n \n You're going to laugh at all this - but isn't it a way out that would avoid what looks like an inevitable humiliation of the US when it evacuates Iraq in a rerun of the last days of Saigon ?",

   "Workable, the primary challenge being US public short attention span considering the 400,000 troops (with increased death rate from block to block fighting) with probably two-years to fully annihilate resistance before oil flows in a big way. We had 500,000 troops in Vietnam and estimates were well over 1mm to successfully occupy the entire country if China hadn't spoken out. \n \n Could the US and world economy afford that is another big if as true imperial occupation and resultant world Islamic resistance would create a real terrorist war against the US while sending oil prices into the stratosphere. Every tiny country in the world with a drop of oil would also be seeking nuclear weapons out of fear of US occupation. This current administration is capable of anything to benefit special interests but that would backfire as resistance would seek soft targets for retaliation; US population centers. \n \n I'm all for getting out of Iraq while the getting is good. We're (US) encouraging a tyrannical situation, money and power as objectives between three distinct and differing ideological groups, that will probably make Saddam's reign look placid while involving Turkey, Iran and a high probability of the Sauds and Pakistan.

In July of 2004, this rose to around 800. The mortuary records the violent death toll for June of this year as 879 - 764 of them male, 115 female. Of the men, 480 had been killed by firearms, along with 25 of the women.

Iraq was pumping 2.5 million bbl/day prior to the invasion, as of May 05 production was 1.9 million bbl/day. Most reports state that this is the expected production for the next 2-3 years due to production equipment deficiencies and security disruptions. If internal stability is achieved within two years, and S. Africa now holds the security contract for Northern pipelines, estimates are 4 million bbl/day by the end of this decade if stability justifies capital investment. \n \n The major trigger in debt forgiveness by the Paris Club is Iraqi stability by 2007. As Turkey consumes almost 1/3 of Iraqi oil exports through Iraq's largest pipeline (and forecast increases) and large quantities of Iraq's natural gas production, Kurd autonomy with complete independence by 2012 and desire to control Kirkuk is a major factor in constitutional differences that present additional potential instability. Turkey is not a happy camper. \n \n A very rough road ahead for Iraqi sovereignty.",

The importance of how that revenue is distributed between the three Iraqi entities overshadows, IMO, all other constitutional issues including citizenry individual welfare and rights.\n\n \n Can the intangible ideological benefits of a democratic future in Iraq - even if the constitutional machine didn't have a Sharia ghost in it - defy the objective logic of numbers ?\n \n Promises of prosperity, platitudes about freedom, etc., may introduce a warm glow into the hearts of the optimists; but if the economic fundamentals are in contradiction to pious political aspirations, the impartial spectator must take the view suggested between the lines of your observations.",

Kurds, at 20% of the population, are demanding approximately 35% of oil production and reserves. Shia, 60% of the population, want 65%. Sunni are currently holding an almost empty bag. At 20% of the population and now well experienced in guerrilla warfare, military costs just attempting to control the Sunni and ensure present oil production would devour a majority of oil revenues, just as containing the three entities did during Saddam's reign. \n \n Iraq's economy has always been dominated by oil, 95% of national revenues. Lack of water and unsuitable terrain have historically made Iraq a net importer of food, which means a noteworthy portion of oil production will continue to be a trade requirement just to feed the country.\n \n $50billion USD in current annual oil revenues is $1836/person based on a population of 26million. $100billion in oil revenues, the highest annual oil revenue Iraq could be expected to produce by the end of the decade, assuming a stable government, would be $3672/person. After deducting military expenses (currently a US expense) and food costs, the standard of living margin becomes very thin before even considering reconstruction of a devastated infrastructure, social costs and debt service. \n \n As a contrast, the Sauds, identical population, export about 8.5million bbl/day of oil. That's over $200billion/yr, $7800/person in a modernized country with limited dissension, no debt and fixed costs.\n \n A very long, bitter road for Iraq regardless of constitutional issues. Another four-years of US occupation, as recently announced by US media quoting the US military chief of staff, would aggravate the situation to where it wouldn't make much difference what the constitution says.",

   "An imperialist crusader is someone who thinks America should stop occupying Iraq. Individual self determination means being ruled by a socialist islamic government. Letting someone choose for themself means sending an army to back a particular party. The doublespeak is almost as bad here as in the constitution itself.\n\n An imperialist crusader is also one who thinks his way of existence is better than another, seeking to impose it. Almost as bad as a cultural relativist, who doesn't thnk anything is better than another. Almost but not as bad.\n Respecting individual choice for self determination include allowing them to make what may seem a poor choice. While the army stand to guard them against others who would seek to choose for them, such as theocracy of the new caliphate.\n I've read the constitution posted. You should read it again.\n \n \nThat you think freedom means being able to vote for something speaks volumes.\n\n Nope. Democractic freedom means able to vote for the loser and not fear repercussions. \n \n \nThen why claim Iraqis want this for themselves?\n\n Because Iraqis are writing it, and voting on it. Remember that the constitution still needs to be approved.\n \n \nYou still have been unable to back up your claim that Iraqis are happier now than under Saddam, indeed all you can say is you \"don't care\" about a snapshot in time; the important thing of course is that more Iraqis are dying by the day, and democratic islamic socialism (which we shall from now on call \"freedom\") is on the march.\n\n Come now Symbiote. The burden of posting link is way beyond the norm of this forum. But what the hell, down load the pdf from here and go to page 30.\n Is Iraq moving in the right or wrong direction? \n Right Direction: \n 51%@05/04, \n 51%@07/04, \n 42%@09/04 (only time where wrong @45% is more than right, and this is probably within margin of error), \n 54%@11/04, \n 49%@12/04, \n 62%@02/05, \n 67%@04/05. \n I would say the trend is up. Wouldn't you?\n \n How do you think your life will be a year from now?\n Better: \n 65%@05/04, \n 67%@07/04, \n 65%@09/04, \n 66%@11/04, \n 59%@12/04, \n 70%@02/05, \n 82%@04/05. \n I would also say the trend is up here as well.

   "Surely it's obvious now, even if it wasn't before, that the whole project of installing a \"western style\" secular democracy in Iraq is a fantasy. Politicians whose authority is virtually confined to the Security Zone under American protection, continue to discuss the future consitutional arrangements for parts of Iraq where the local police cower in their bunkers while a full-scale insurgency rages outside. The whole exercise, which in any case must submit to the over-arching sanction of Sharia law, is opposed by the Sunnis root and branch.

Due to US public polls showing Americans are disgusted with our Iraq policy, a majority of Bush's speeches are now presented at US military facilities in an attempt to shore up flagging reenlistment numbers and reported by the media for public consumption.\n \n This is reminiscent of Nixon's claims of victory over Vietnam and stemming the tide of communism as that policy was in its failing throes.
