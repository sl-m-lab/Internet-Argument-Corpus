   "Title: Critically understanding politics leads to eventual enlightenment \n \n by Eugene Ramirez (.....Vegan, graduate student, Latino, spiritual, progressive-liberal residing in San Antonio, Tx -- More of my editorials can be read at http://www.EugeneRamirez.com/html/editorials.html)\n \n As I mentioned in my August 2003 editorial, \"The Power of One Voice to Change The World,\" I voted in favor for my school district's bond proposal (in my high-school auditorium) at the age of 18. Even before then, in June 1994, an entire segment on Flag Day was devoted to my comments, which I called in to KSAT 12's \"What's Driving You Crazy\" when I was 14 years old.\n \n But my activism did not stop there. Since then, I have had more than 10 letters to the editor published in the San Antonio Express-News, (some trivial) and two in the San Antonio Current. \n \n Also, during the Gore-Bush presidential 2000 election, I dragged my Dad, sister and the kids out to the voting polls at a local elementary school. I know if I had not taken them with me, they would have never voted during that crucial election. Before the vote, I even went a step further and helped them get signed up with the voter registration cards and told them which candidate to vote for in each category.\n \n I am a progressive-liberal so when I vote, of course, I vote Democrat. I will never vote Republican. Society has changed a lot in 50 years and continues to change in unison with \"popular opinion.\" As progressive-liberals, we look toward the future and acknowledge the growth and strides that society goes through. To increase evolutionary societal-change, we remain cognizant with reference to breaking through \"complacency\" or the \"status quo\" in order to further more progress in society.\n \n Regrettably, Republican ideology generally avoids change that occurs in society and instead pushes for things to \"stay the same,\" or for them to \"go back to the way it used to be.\" But if people \"go back\" to the way things used to be, they will again unleash many of society's ills that we continue to desperately fight against. Moreover, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to re-elect our current Republican president once more.\n \n Among many other things, earlier this year, Bush advocated writing discrimination into the Constitution, he has been handed nearly everything to him in life because of his last name, he cannot sufficiently articulate on par with most other politicians, he continues to push through legislation and tax cuts that benefit the very rich, and he has aligned himself with extreme right-wing organizations and people.\n \n As a matter of fact, one of the nation's most powerful driving force is deeply embedded into the Republican Party: The Religious Right. In my May 2004 editorial, \"Learning From Religious Fanaticism Can Prevent Future Atrocities,\" I cite how religion has been used for hundreds of years to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion. \n \n Today, of course, we do not experience the extreme religious fanaticism that occurred centuries ago. Nevertheless, with the Religious Right backed by millions of dollars and millions of faithful followers, they easily continue lobbying their agenda to Washington. As it is now, it is also a very threatening situation when seven of the highest-ranking Republican senators receive a 100 percent scorecard from the right-wing organization, the Christian Coalition.\n In his book, \"The Most Dangerous Man in America?: Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition,\" Robert Boston sheds much light on Robertson's theocratic rhetoric, which threatens the separation of church and state on many interrelated issues. Most absurdly, during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice in 1993, Robertson commented, \"There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.\" \n \n The author also makes known many of Robertson's sordid actions and claims, which include his ability to communicate with God directly, and the insensitive comments he made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that were also very similar to Jerry Falwell's. Unfortunately, President Bush has certainly done his part to please the Religious Right. For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general. \n Regarding Ashcroft, in my letter-to-the-editor published in the San Antonio Current on Jan. 25, 2001, I said, \"During his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft sponsored unconstitutional legislation violating the Bill of Rights. He is against the Fourth Amendment. He refused to protect abortion clinics from right-wing organizations. He praised Confederate soldiers for fighting to uphold slavery. He blocked the nomination of a gay man for an ambassadorship. He fought federal judgeship of an African American, and blocked efforts to bring an end to racial profiling.\"\n \n Despite all that, whenever people start to discuss politics, I still cringe inside and smile patiently with poise. I say this because, inevitably, I know I will witness a heated and passionate debate about which political party is \"better\" or \"right\" for our country. I hear the familiar drivel all the time, \"Republicans are better than Democrats,\" and, \"no, Democrats are better than them.\" Undoubtedly, Democrats prevail as the better choice. However, I feel compelled to remind people of a more obscured reality they too would see if they delved deeper into the financial aspect of our political parties.\n \n First, both Republicans and Democrats rely heavily on corporate-interest money to intensify their campaign presence in mass media. A visit to the website, OpenSecrets.Org, shows the thousands or millions of dollars in contributions categorized by election-year that wealthy financiers give to both Democrats and Republicans. For this reason, I am doubtful that in my lifetime America will elect an \"average\" Joe or Jane, who works a blue-collar job, to become president. It appears the powerful in this country need only ensure they possess a sufficient amount of money in order to be heard or hold elected office.\n \n Additionally, in the past, both parties did their share of wrong, which some apologized for. All we need to do is look back to the Iran-Contra scandal with Reagan (Republicans), and the Lewinksy affair with Clinton (Democrats). I remember the uproar among Republicans when Clinton pardoned some questionable people before leaving office in 2001. However, I was quick to remind those Republicans that the first President Bush pardoned Regan, himself and others involved in Iran-Contra. Bush also issued those pardons on Christmas Eve, (a strategic move) on a least-conscious news day, when Clinton did not do such a thing.\n \n Political parties aside, my question is: What can millionaire politicians (or their billionaire lobbying allies) do for us citizens that they did not already promise in the past? And how in the world can they say they can relate to my life? Can they really empathize with my struggles growing up when I was homeless at times or days when we had very little food and lived in very small apartments or living quarters? \n \n Since many politicians always say they are \"of the people,\" will they also take the city bus with me to school like I have done ever since middle school? Furthermore, I am positive my vegetarian (almost vegan) lifestyle will not be a problem with them, but when they discover I do not live a luxurious lifestyle, will they find it odd when I decline to eat at their lavish restaurants so I can save my money for the rent? Indeed, can they truly relate to me? I do not think so.\n \n Unfortunately, for many others, the result of this political facade leads to increasing voter apathy and general complacency and particularly among minorities who can see through the \"I'm just like you\" pretense. Despite all this, it is very important to vote. As I said in my August 2003 editorial, many people have died or walked miles just for the right to vote. Clearly, everyone has an opinion, yet not all of them vote during elections. So, if you want to see change in the world, do not just sit there and debate. Get out and vote! \n \n In the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. I know this will not happen this election year in November, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.",

I credit you for your ambition. You are absoluetly right about the need to get out and vote.The more people you can bring to the polls the better. \n Special interest groups do play a huge part in politics today. They do certainly provide alot of money for the candidates to fund their campaign. However, they do not control the vote. The citizens still reserve that right.\n \n That sums up the extent of our agreements concerning your post. I cannot agree with your politics or your summary of the Republican Party. \n \n First of all, why is the president, or anyone else in the government, responsible for putting food on your table or providing you with a home to live in? Where is your sense of self responsibility? If you wish to reside in an enormous home with lavish surroundings,as most of us do, then I recommend redirecting your ambition towards a productive job where you will earn a paycheck and pay your own way. If you are waiting for a government that is all providing, I suggest you do not hold your breath. I will do every thing in my power to keep the likes of \"Liberal -progressives\" out of office.\n \n The right does have it's extremists. Extremists of any kind are generally misguided. So, where I do not agree with Farwell and the religous right I do recognize that the majority of America worships in one fashion or another and therefore looks to a person with faith to lead their country. \n \n Your assesment of the Republicans to \"go back to the way things were\" is incorrect. Those of us on the right or conservative side, (many of us are distancing ourselves from the current definition of \"Republican\") wish not to go back to anything. Rather we wish the government to stay out of our affairs. We prefer to handle our own concerns instead of relying on the government to provide for us. We prefer to provide ourselves health care, food, clothing, housing, retirement bennefits, and the other daily nessecities.\n \n If you wish to continue this discussion I'd be gald to present more of the falacies of Liberial-Progressiveness and the reason they are not American.",

It appears the powerful in this country need only ensure they possess a sufficient amount of money in order to be heard or hold elected office. \n\n \n Another liberal classic, the evil rich. Money happens to be the best measure we have of success. Inheritances, lotteries, our out-of-control legal system, and a few other things can muddy the waters, but as a rule, people with money have contributed something to our society.\n \n \n \nPolitical parties aside, my question is: What can millionaire politicians (or their billionaire lobbying allies) do for us citizens that they did not already promise in the past?

Have you ever attempted to relate to a millionaire's life? How hard they may have worked, what they've done without as they climbed the ladder, the ideas they may have had to make so many people's lives better. They can probably relate to you, as most of them have at least partially been there, better than you can relate to them. Have you ever tried to imagine what it must be like to be so jealously hated, to have so many people wanting what you have rightfully earned?\n \n \n Get out and vote! \n\n \n You have reason to be optimistic - the left seems to be succeeding in recruiting voters. Unfortunately, their target voters are seldom hard workers (rich or poor) The vote of someone dependent on government is equal to someone who works hard. That keeps me from lamenting the lack of voters as much as liberals. Thank God for the Electorial College! It's not specifically called that in the constitution, but the process is defined in the constitution. Does Hillary's comment (several years ago) about doing away with it bother you as much as your accusations about John Ashcroft and the fourth amendment??",

For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general. \n \n \n His \"ability to communicate with god directly\" is called \"prayer\". A very large percentage of the country believes in it, and Robertson ran a pretty highly ranked TV show (for its type) for years devoted to it. Lets not try to make the guy into some kind of schitzo (or at least admit that if he is, most of the country is as well).\n \n \nFirst, both Republicans and Democrats rely heavily on corporate-interest money to intensify their campaign presence in mass media. A visit to the website, OpenSecrets.Org, shows the thousands or millions of dollars in contributions categorized by election-year that wealthy financiers give to both Democrats and Republicans. For this reason, I am doubtful that in my lifetime America will elect an \"average\" Joe or Jane, who works a blue-collar job, to become president. It appears the powerful in this country need only ensure they possess a sufficient amount of money in order to be heard or hold elected office.\n\n \n Probably not, and this is too bad, since so many of those who aspire to power are so undeserving of it. We can actually agree on this point.\n \n \nPolitical parties aside, my question is: What can millionaire politicians (or their billionaire lobbying allies) do for us citizens that they did not already promise in the past? And how in the world can they say they can relate to my life? Can they really empathize with my struggles growing up when I was homeless at times or days when we had very little food and lived in very small apartments or living quarters? \n \n \n the best they can do for us is leave us alone as much as possible. Saty out of our lives and our paychecks as best they can and we will all be better off. That would be the one thing they could promise us that they never have before, and I would vote for the nazi party if they promised just that.\n \n I don't particulalrly care if, as a chgild, you were homeless or had very little food or lived in small living quarters. It seems that you or your parents must have worked hard and gotten back on their feet. Good Job! Making it easier to do this would be a good thing, but probably isn't worth the cost of having the government run around and pull people out of the gutter.\n \n Consider this. For most of Americas history, social programs were very small or non existant, yet we are seeing a much higher rate of homelessness and hunger than we did in previous years. This is beacuse for generations, charity was carried out by churches and civic groups, not by government drones. It wourked well. Now, by the time the government eats up 56% of our GDP, there is not enough money left in the hands of your average joe to contribute much to church or community aid programs. Instead, the government has taken over these functions, and upwards of 70% of the money is burnt up on administrative costs. This is one place where we would all be better off rolling back the clock.\n \n \nIn the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. I know this will not happen this election year in November, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.\n\n \n Some of the other mumbo jumbo you may get , but not the corporate interest one. That is what our political system hs turned into, a bunch of special interest whores pimping themselves tot he American public. Unfortunatly, to change the system at his point will take a major revolution, either political or violent, depending on how lucky we happen to be. In the case of a political revolution, it seems unlikely that you would get your progressive liberal in office, since the American public seems to like hard working people with common sense, and many of the progrssive liberal viewpoints make little or no sense. In the case of a violent revolution, you will certainly not get what you want, since most of the vegan, progrssive liberal GG's will likely have been shot by their redneck, gun toting neiborghs.\n \n Calling this the \"final word\" on politics is almost a joke. You are not making any revelations here. You are going to have to do a lot better in order to impress people on most political forums (the fact that they are here generally mewans they already know enough about politics to know that politicians tend to be billionaire $#@%heads and special interest whores. That is a no brainer).",

   "[QUOTE=AcrossTheUniver][SIZE=2][B]Title: Critically understanding politics leads to eventual enlightenment \n \n by Eugene Ramirez (.....Vegan, graduate student, Latino, spiritual, progressive-liberal residing in San Antonio, Tx -- More of my editorials can be read at http://www.EugeneRamirez.com/html/editorials.html)\n \n As I mentioned in my August 2003 editorial, \"The Power of One Voice to Change The World,\" I voted in favor for my school district's bond proposal (in my high-school auditorium) at the age of 18. Even before then, in June 1994, an entire segment on Flag Day was devoted to my comments, which I called in to KSAT 12's \"What's Driving You Crazy\" when I was 14 years old.\n \n But my activism did not stop there. Since then, I have had more than 10 letters to the editor published in the San Antonio Express-News, (some trivial) and two in the San Antonio Current. \n \n ..... Since you were compelled to begin your \"editorial\" with a bio, you should have mentioned that you are also the president of your fan club.\n \n Also, during the Gore-Bush presidential 2000 election, I dragged my Dad, sister and the kids out to the voting polls at a local elementary school. I know if I had not taken them with me, they would have never voted during that crucial election. Before the vote, I even went a step further and helped them get signed up with the voter registration cards and told them which candidate to vote for in each category.\n \n ........We really need more informed voters like that.\n \n \n Undoubtedly, Democrats prevail as the better choice. \n \n ...... Some university campuses notwithstanding, where is this prevailence taking place .... other than in your mind? \n \n A polisci teacher of mine once told me when I turned in a very wordy paper, \"I do not grade by the pound\". You might consider that.\n \n \"I would never vote Republican\". Never is a long time, and closing your mind limits your chances to expand your knowledge. I can promise you that many of the opinions you hold today will not be the same years from now.\n \n Another thing a teacher told me, \"You learn to write by writing\". Keep it up and I'm sure you will get better. Good luck.\n Dono",
