And, because of his exposure to some of the best education of the day, I am impressed by many of the things that he had to say.\n \n As a student in preparation for Lutheran Catechism, I was exposed to a quite balanced treatment of what was going on during the time of Reformation, careful consideration of the Calvinistic movement in Britain--I believe that Lutherans felt that the Anglican Church was flawed, based as it was on the lust of King Henry VIII and I don't remember any reference to Anglicanism, the quasi-communistic Christian movements on Continental Europe, the Hutterites, Moravians and so forth. Because the tone of the classes were slightly balanced in favor of the Continental movements I have always felt closer to the intellectual discourse of the Continent, as opposed to the many developments in the British Isles.

But this single-mindedness, this enormous self-confidence and strident belief in the rightness of his arguments, allowed him to stand against opposition, indeed, to harden his position in the face of death by fire, the usual punishment for heretics. Luther became an Augustinian monk in 1505, disappointing his equally strong-willed father, who wished him to become a lawyer. He earned a doctorate in theology from the University of Wittenberg, but instead of settling down to a placid and scholarly monkish life or an uneventful university career teaching theology, he began to develop his own personal theology, which erupted into outright blasphemy when he protested the use of indulgences in his 95 Theses. . . .\n \n In 1521, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, demanded that Luther appear before the diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms. Luther was asked to explain his views and Charles ordered him to recant. Luther refused and he was placed under an imperial ban as an outlaw. He managed to escape, however, and he was hidden away in a castle in Wartburg where he continued to develop his new church. . . .\nObviously, Luther was given shelter in this castle by a prince of the worldly realm.",

But since I learned that those miserable and accursed people do not cease to lure to themselves even us, that is, the Christians, I have published this little book, so that I might be found among those who opposed such poisonous activities of the Jews and who warned the Christians to be on their guard against them. I would not have believed that a Christian could be duped by the Jews into taking their exile and wretchedness upon himself.

Amen. \n Grace and peace in the Lord. Dear sir and good friend, I have received a treatise in which a Jew engages in dialog with a Christian. He dares to pervert the scriptural passages which we cite in testimony to our faith, concerning our Lord Christ and Mary his mother, and to interpret them quite differently. With this argument he thinks he can destroy the basis of our faith. \n This is my reply to you and to him. It is not my purpose to quarrel with the Jews, nor to learn from them how they interpret or understand Scripture; I know all of that very well already. Much less do I propose to convert the Jews, for that is impossible. Those two excellent men, Lyra and Burgensis, together with others, truthfully described the Jews' vile interpretation for us two hundred and one hundred years ago respectively. Indeed they refuted it thoroughly. However, this was no help at all to the Jews, and they have grown steadily worse. \n They have failed to learn any lesson from the terrible distress that has been theirs for over fourteen hundred years in exile....\" \n From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Martin_Luther#as_his_answer_to_an_anti-Christian_pamphlet_of_Jewish_origin",

In 1523 he made his own views of secular government plain in an important treatise Von weltlicher Obrigkeit (\"Of Earthly Government\"), in which he firmly asserted the duty of a Christian prince and the place of secular government within God's ordinances for mankind; he distinguished between the two realms of spiritual and of temporal government, through which the one rule of God is administered, and stressed the duty of civil obedience and the sinfulness of rebellion against lawful authority.\"\n http://www.hfac.uh.edu/gbrown/philosophers/leibniz/BritannicaPages/Luther/Luther.html\n \n \n Obviously, Luther was given shelter in this castle by a prince of the worldly realm.\n\n He was abducted against his will for his own safety, as Frederick felt he needed protection, which he certainly did:\n \n \"Luther's disappearance during his return trip was planned. Frederick the Wise arranged for Luther to be seized on his way from the Diet by a company of masked horsemen, who carried him to Wartburg Castle at Eisenach, where he stayed for about a year. He grew a wide flaring beard, took on the garb of a knight, and assumed the pseudonym Junker J\u00f6rg (Knight George).

Had he lived a hundred miles west/east/north/south, chances are he'd have been another no-one. He'd be as \"famous\" as Huss.
