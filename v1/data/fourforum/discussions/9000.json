   "The link seems to require registration at the LA Times site.\n \n I think this link may bypass that.\n http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/admark/la-me-hiv30sep30,1,3264429.story?coll=la-headlines-business-advert&ctrack=1&cset=true\n \n It's a very complex issue.\n \n On the one hand, something needs to be done. In some ways, I applaud the effort to make progress. In some ways, I think of it like Bill Cosby's efforts to try to get the black community to address certain issues which seem more prevalent to them.\n \n But overall, I think it's an arrow that is going to miss the mark. Bill Cosby's attempts (IMO) have a major center around an effort to not BLAME OTHER PEOPLE for the difficulties of black people. That's not really the problem for gays and HIV.\n \n I don't think there is any real issue of not \"owning\" the disease. I see it more as an issue complacency regarding some just don't see it as that big of a problem to be worried about. A disjoint between the 80's tragedy whereby people watched their friends die, and the 21st century \"reality\" whereby people take a pill and they live longer. The next generation isn't learning the lessons that were learned in the 80's...\n \n \n And in another potential problem that is summed up in the article...\n \"In the study, published last week in the journal Annals of Medicine, the city's public health officials interviewed more than 4,000 men.\n Of the more than 90% who identified themselves as heterosexual, one in 10 later disclosed that they had had sex with a man within the past year.\n Lead author Preeti Pathela said that means that any campaign aimed only at men who identify themselves as gay or bisexual could miss as many as 10% of the people it is meant to reach - and keep their partners in the dark as well.\"\n \n I would love to see such a study examine WHY they classify themselves as \"heterosexual\" when they have had sex with a man in the past year. Obviously, there is an area where sexual ATTRACTION and sexual ACTION do not overlap. If I masturbate, that doesn't mean I'm \"attracted\" to my hand.\n \n But by the same token, the numbers themselves point to some underlying phenomenon which is not named amongst self-proclaimed \"heterosexuals\".\n \n Another question which is not included is the relative frequency of these interactions. Of these \"heterosexuals\" who had sex with men in the last year, how many times did they have sex with men? How many times did they have sex with women?\n \n \n And on another level, perhaps an aggressive (and objective) poll needs to be done on HIV attitudes to determine precisely how many people are taking precautions (and what precautions) regarding HIV, and how serious they think the disease and their risk to the disease is. A means to help identify the root cause of the issue.",
