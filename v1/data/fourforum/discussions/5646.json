   "The word \"fascist\" is tossed around here pretty regularly. I've been called one a time or two, as have others I generally agree with. Since there's not much agreement on what the words \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" mean, the word fascist seems like a vague, general term that doesn't have much meaning to many here. I think it's been cultivated as a put down word for traditional conservatives. Here's the Webster's definition of the word;\n \n FASCISM; A political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.\n \n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/mussolini-fascism.html\n \n http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/b/benito_mussolini.html\n \n From his quotes, Mussolini seemed to think fascism was the opposite of socialism. It's also clear that fascism is not about peace, yet Mussolini said that men are \"tired of liberty\". When Jefferson said \"......the tree of liberty must be nourished from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants...\" he seems to advocate both liberty and war. Does that make him a fascist?\n \n http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/britt_23_2.htm\n \n This seems to be a modern day liberal trying to redefine fascism so that it can be applied to many of today's conservatives. In part;\n \n \n \n4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism. Ruling elites always identified closely with the military and the industrial infrastructure that supported it. A disproportionate share of national resources was allocated to the military, even when domestic needs were acute. The military was seen as an expression of nationalism, and was used whenever possible to assert national goals, intimidate other nations, and increase the power and prestige of the ruling elite.\n\n \n If that's fascism, what is it if it's rewritten with only a few word changes?\n \n The supremacy of environmentalism / safety. Ruling elites identified closely with the EPA and NHTSA. and the trial lawyers that support it. A disproportionate share of natural resources allocated to it, even though domestic needs (tax relief) is acute. Safety and cleanliness are seen as an ever increasing problem, and are used whenever possible to redistribute wealth, punish capitalism, and increase power and prestige of the ruling elite.\n \n If Britt's paragraph is fascism, isn't much of what is advocated by today's liberals / Democrats also fascism? Are not most of the domestic, big government programs advocated by today's Democrats not \"autocratic\"??",

   "Stumbled across this and found it interesting...\n \n Definition of Facism:\n \n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  \n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  \n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  \n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.  \n 6. Controlled Mass Media  - Sometimes to (sic) media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  \n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed \n to the government's policies or actions. \n 9. Corporate Power is Protected  - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.  \n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.  \n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.  There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n \n Source",

As in that first definition, I think we can all agree that what has always been the most basic tenet of fascism was exaltation of the state, going all the way back to the coining of the term in relation to the Roman Empire.\n \n In a fascist system, the individual's worth is determined by his relation to the state. Under true communism, if you want to set that as the opposite of fascism, the state's worth is determined by its relation to the individual.\n \n Nationalism and socialism combined for a fascist result. Socialism itself cannot. Nationalism itself is most often likely to, as it is often coupled with racism and general conformity in a homogenous society. Individuals in a socialist society are still allowed individualism, racially and culturally. Individuals in a nationalist society are more likely to identify with the state, as it is made up of their racial/cultural peers.\n \n To say that Mussolini created a liberal fascist state is to put the focus on social programs and away from his nationalist ideology. Bush inspires fascism through intense nationalism. But his programs do not reflect Mussolini's or even Hitler's. Bush is far more Tojo than any of the other fascist examples available. Nationalism, intense patriotism, identification of the individual with the state. \n \n This is why so many accuse him of fascism, and perhaps a bit more accurately than those who might accuse Gore of being an enviro-fascist, or any of the other bizarre misuses of the term which are meant to be instantly dismissive and degrading.",
