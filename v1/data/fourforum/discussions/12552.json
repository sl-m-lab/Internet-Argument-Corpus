   "EDITORIAL: &#39;We want them registered&#39; - Washington Times\n \n \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, announced last week that she wants to register guns. Her next move will be to try to confiscate them.\n \n The speaker picked a television show with a viewership of 4.6 million to float the Democrats' coming gun-control push. Questioned on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" about the prospect of new gun-control laws now that \"it's a Democratic president, a Democratic House,\" she responded, \"We don't want to take their guns away. We want them registered.\"\n \n Politicians and bureaucrats routinely claim that registration helps solve crimes. If a registered gun is used in a crime and left at the crime scene, registration supposedly lets the police trace the gun back to the criminal. Though this turn of events might work on fictional TV crime shows, it virtually never occurs in real life. Criminals' guns are rarely left at crime scenes. When guns are left behind, it usually is because a crook has been seriously injured or killed and the police are poised to catch him anyway.\n \n The few guns left at crime scenes rarely - if ever - are registered to the perpetrator. If they are registered at all, it is to someone else, whose piece was stolen. Despite what Mrs. Pelosi might think, those who use guns to commit major crimes such as robbing and killing are unlikely to respect her request to file paperwork so the government can catalog the tools of their trade.\n \n Numerous examples disprove gun-control propaganda. Hawaii has had licensing and registration of guns for about 50 years. After all of the administrative expenses and inconvenience imposed on gun owners, police there cannot point to a single crime that has been solved as a result of those programs. Given Hawaii's remote island geography, this should be an ideal place to keep track of guns because movement in and out of the state is limited and legal importation is controlled. If registration is going to work anywhere, it should work there. Unfortunately, criminals seem to be able to get their hands on guns virtually anyplace in the world.\n \n Other jurisdictions with a history of strict handgun bans, such as the District of Columbia and Chicago, have even required registration of hunting rifles and shotguns for more than 20 years. Neither the District nor Chicago can point to any crimes that have been solved using registration records.\n \n The same rules apply across the border. Canada, which has imposed registration of handguns since the 1930s, does not have much to show for it. In 2006, when the Liberal Party under Prime Minister Paul Martin controlled the government, it was admitted in parliamentary debate that just three crimes in 70 years had been solved as a result of registration. A couple of those cases were debatable because other independent evidence helped solve the crimes. According to the Canadian Ministry of Public Safety, just 4 percent of Canadian handgun murders in 2005 and 2006 were committed with registered handguns, and none of those were registered to the people who committed the crimes. As for long-gun registration, at least as of 2006, not a single violent crime had been solved through registration.\n \n Because registration doesn't help solve crime, it is important to ask why government wants to register the people's firearms. History provides the answer. In countries from Australia to England, registration has been used to create lists of guns that later were confiscated by their governments. Despite Mrs. Pelosi's assurances to the contrary, Americans' fear that registration will lead to confiscation is well-founded. Indeed, Mrs. Pelosi's own state of California already has used existing registration lists to confiscate so-called assault weapons just a half-dozen years ago.\n \n The speaker claims registration won't lead to gun confiscation because of the Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down the District's handgun ban last June. She knows full well that this judgment was based on a narrow 5-4 decision that could be reversed when President Obama gets his opportunity to appoint an additional liberal justice to the court.\n \n A Gallup poll released Wednesday shows that support for gun control is \"at an all-time low\" since the issue started being surveyed nearly 50 years ago. According to Gallup, just 29 percent favor handgun bans. Now that Democrats are in control of the legislative and executive branches of government, even the will of the people won't keep them from going after the guns of law-abiding Americans.\n",

   "Confiscation would be unconstitutional at present.\n\n \n The same would be true (I respectfully argue) for a mandatory registration requirement.\n \n Mandatory firearm registration cannot be justified simply because a government functionary wishes to satisfy his curiosity about what firearms I own. To be justifiable, mandatory registration must serve a legitimate and obtainable crime deterrent goal that outweighs my right to privacy. \n \n I am being told that mandatory registration will do nothing to me, but that it will help catch and punish those who cannot lawfully have firearms. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 922, those persons are someone who: \n \n (1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)); (4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution; (5) who, being an alien - (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26))); (6) has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; (7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced his citizenship; (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that - (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and (B)(i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or (9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. \n \n I have been told many times that a mandatory registration requirement would prove to be an important tool to help keep guns out of the hands of these persons. But in my opinion mandatory registration must be enforceable to be effective, and the only way I can see to enforce it is to make failure to register a firearm a criminal offense. \n \n So what happens if we pass a universal registration requirement and people simply refuse to register their firearms? The answer involves a direct conflict with the 5th. Amendment's right against self-incrimination-and it may surprise you. \n \n A similar question was asked of SCOTUS in Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968). Haynes dealt with portions of the old National Firearms Act. In that act Congress declared certain firearms to be those \"used principally by persons engaged in unlawful activities.\" In the NFA Congress required registration of all such firearms, and Congress also made the unregistered possession of such firearms illegal. Both failing to register and possession of an unregistered firearm were made criminal offenses. Now Haynes was an ordinary citizen in this sense-he was not a felon or someone who was already prohibited from possessing a firearm. \n \n The legal history of the Haynes case as presented to SCOTUS on appeal was as follows:\n \n Petitioner was charged by a three-count information filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas with violations of the National Firearms Act. 48 Stat. 1236. Two of the counts were subsequently dismissed upon motion of the United States Attorney. The remaining count averred that petitioner, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851, knowingly possessed a firearm, as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848(1), which had not been registered with the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841. Petitioner moved before trial to dismiss this count, evidently asserting that \u00a7 5851 violated his privilege against self-incrimination, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. \n Id. at 86.\n \n The issue raised by the case was as follows:\n \n At the outset, it must be emphasized that the issue in this case is not whether Congress has authority under the Constitution to regulate the manufacture, transfer, or possession of firearms; nor is it whether Congress may tax activities which are, wholly or in part, unlawful. Rather, we are required to resolve only the narrow issue of whether enforcement of \u00a7 5851 against petitioner, despite his assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, is constitutionally permissible.\n Id. at 90.\n \n After much discussion, SCOTUS ultimately ruled as follows:\n \n We hold that a proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.\n Id. at 100.\n \n Haynes dealt with a mandatory registration requirement of only a small class of firearms. Now some 31 years later we are presented with the same problem-this time on a demand for a much broader mandatory registration requirement for all firearms. \n \n I cannot see how Congress could draft a mandatory registration law-enforced by punishing those who did not do so-which could circumvent the \"full defense to prosecutions\" provided by the right against self-incrimination. \n \n In fact, the very people the law would be designed to get at-those persons (felons, stalkers, etc.) who are already prohibited from having firearms-would have an even greater claim to immunity from prosecution because of compelled incrimination. The mere act of registering their firearms would be forcing them to admit that they were also committing an additional felony offense punishable by up to ten years in prison.\n \n So here are my questions:\n \n 1. Can anyone here propose a mandatory registration scheme which could work without compelling registration on pain of some form of criminal punishment?\n \n 2. Otherwise, can someone tell me how they can punish a refusal to register, or possession of an unregistered firearm, without violating the right against self-incrimination?\n \n ---\n \n \"We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal.\" Nelson T. Shields, founder of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and former Chairman of Handgun Control, Inc. (which is now generally referred to simply as the \"Brady Campaign\"), in The New Yorker magazine, July 26, 1976, at Page 53f.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).",

   "I want to talk about this some more because I am not sure I fully laid out the self-incrimination issue.\n \n The specific problem of registration in the Haynes case dealt with this quandary: The statutes required registration and punished those who failed to register, and at the same time it made possession of an unregistered firearm possessed \"at any time\" an offense. Haynes was therefore placed on the horns of a dilemma. If he did not register, then he could be caught and prosecuted for both failure to register and possession of an unregistered firearm. But if he did comply with the registration requirement, then he would be forced to admit the criminal offense of already owning an unregistered firearm. \n \n SCOTUS narrowed the issue to this:\n \n If, as petitioner urges, his conviction under \u00a7 5851 (possession of an unregistered firearm-Bryan) is essentially indistinguishable from a conviction premised directly upon a failure to register under \u00a7 5841, and if a prosecution under \u00a7 5841 would have punished petitioner for his failure to incriminate himself, it would follow that a proper claim of privilege should have provided a full defense to this prosecution.\n Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 90 (1968)\n \n In short, the law was written so that it forced everyone, no matter whether they could legally have a firearm or not, to incriminate themselves by registering guns they already held if they were of the type restricted by Congress (like, for example, the sawed-off shotgun in U.S. v. Miller)\n \n But let me come back to the stated purpose of mandatory gun registration. I have never violated a gun law before, and my possession of firearms is completely legal. Mandatory registration is not intended to punish me. It is intended to require registration of all firearms in the hopes that it will either deter or prevent felons and others who cannot have a gun in the first place from having one. But for them, registering the possession of a gun would be a confession to committing a felony offense for even having the gun. \n \n With that in mind, consider the following 5th. Amendment related discussion in Haynes:\n \n a prospective registrant realistically can expect that registration will substantially increase the likelihood of his prosecution. Moreover, he can reasonably fear that the possession established by his registration will facilitate his prosecution under the making and transfer clauses of \u00a7 5851. In these circumstances, it can scarcely be said that the risks of criminal prosecution confronted by prospective registrants are \"remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law,\" Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131, 144; yet they are compelled, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide to the Secretary both a formal acknowledgment of their possession of firearms, and supplementary information likely to facilitate their arrest and eventual conviction. The hazards of incrimination created by the registration requirement can thus only be termed \"real and appreciable.\" Reg. v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330; Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 599-600.\n Id. at 97\n \n So how does this apply to felons, for example, who refuse to comply with a newly minted mandatory registration requirement? If I were defending a felon who got caught with and was being prosecuted for having a unregistered gun or refusing to register his gun, then I would argue this (with italics being language lifted directly from the SCOTUS opinion): \n \n My client, as a felon, can be prosecuted for simply having a firearm. And, as a prospective registrant realistically can expect that registration will substantially increase the likelihood of his prosecution for possession of a firearm as a felon. Moreover, he can reasonably fear that the possession established by his registration will facilitate his prosecution for possession of a firearm as a felon. In these circumstances, it can scarcely be said that the risks of criminal prosecution confronted by my client are \"remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law,\" Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131, 144; yet  he is compelled, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide to the Secretary both a formal acknowledgment of his possession of firearms, and supplementary information likely to facilitate his arrest and eventual conviction  for possession of a firearm as a felon.

Therefore, prosecuting my client for either having an unregistered firearm, or for failing to register his firearm, is in effect punishing him for his failure to incriminate himself.\n \n Under these circumstances, the Court's ruling must be: \n \n We hold that a proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm or for possession of an unregistered firearm. \n Id. at 100\n \n Therefore, assuming for the moment you could craft a law which could compel me to register any firearm I possess, you cannot create a mandatory registration requirement which would affect possession by felons or others who cannot by law have a gun. In other words, the very people a mandatory registration scheme seeks to deter or prevent from having a firearm would have an automatic exemption from complying with the law.",

   "I fail to see why one must register an automobile but not a lethal weapon which is used solely to kill or maim.\n\n \n \n Yet, nobody can ever explain why we allow these inanimate objects \"used solely to kill or maim\" to be carried by police officers.\n \n According to this logic, police officers carry guns to murder people, right? After all, since these lethal weapons are only used to kill or maim, the police must only carry them to kill or maim, huh?\n \n Maybe simone would care to explain why the police carry these evil things since they only exist to kill.\n \n I would think someone with any intelligence would realize that inanimate objects are THINGS made of UNALIGNED MATTER. THINGS have no inherent evil or goodness. (Unless some kook believes that ethical purpose is embodied in wood, metal, rock, dirt, etc.) It is the PURPOSE to which they are used BY THEIR HOLDER that determines whether the ACT THEY ARE USED FOR is evil or good. Is a candle holder evil? It just holds candles, which is good, right? Unless someone bashes another's head in. Then does the candleholder become evil? NO! It is the ACT it is used for!\n \n Yet, somehow, simone cannot make that mental leap. Evidently, the blame, the ethics, all that is bad, gets focused on an INANIMATE OBJECT. The OBJECT embodies evil. The PURPOSE gets selectively \"swept under the rug\". \n \n Yet, simone will undoubtably argue that \nwhich is used solely to kill or maim.\n is a gun's sole purpose. As if the gun decides who to point itself at, who to go off while pointed at, and what goal (death or disfigurement) to achieve. The purpose is removed from the person wielding it and attributed to the object itself! So if this is logical for one inanimate object IT LOGICALLY HAS TO OCCUR FOR ALL!\n \n MATCHES (not arsonists) BURN DOWN HOUSES!\n CARS (not drunk drivers) KILL PEDESTRIANS!\n KNIVES (not rapists) SLASH RAPE VICTIMS!\n CANDLE HOLDERS (not murderers) BASH SKULLS IN!\n \n The responsibility of THE PERSON WHO USES is removed! After all, according to simone, it's not the purpose of the user. It's the purpose of the USED ITEM! \nlethal weapon which is used solely to kill or maim.\n\n \n But, now simone is in a pickle. Is there an explanation as to why police officers carry these things? (OH! Now we switch to the purpose of the USER! How convenient! I wish I could determine that an item is bad using one train of logic, and then SWITCH LINES OF LOGIC to suit my argument!\n \n I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest \"logic switching\". (or, at least attempting to)\n \n Rather than admit wrongness, (very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end. Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical \"detours\". \n \n After all, if objects have no inherent evil or goodness, it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used.\n \n If this is so, you can't call guns bad. This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen. Therefore, since simone's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object (a gun) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these \"evil\" items are not \"evil\" when used by police. If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error, you will have no choice but to arrive in error's destination: make believe land! Where matches burn down houses! And knives cause slashings! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls!....AND......AND.....GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS!\n \n Well, simone. We're down to brass tacks. Is a gun bad, or is it the determination of the person who uses it?\n \n Because if a gun is bad, then we live in la-la land. And if a gun is an inanimate object who's user is responsible for how it is used, you have no argument for why law abiding people can't posess them and be capable of the determination (As police do) for using them in a responsible manner. Just like matches, or cars, or candle holders.\n \n So, simone............",

Canada has been having amnesty after amnesty because Canadians only registered about 3/4th of them.

   "Thank you, Sinjin. I enjoy your posts as well.\n \n \nWhat if registration was simply intended to allow tracing for purposes of identifying illegal transfers? \n\n \n That sounds like a fine policy goal to me. I think we would need a requirement that all guns be registered, and a separate registration requirement for secondary sales, gifts, etc. \n \n But the real question is could you make the registration system work to fulfill this goal? The Government requires that I pay taxes every year. Many, many people hate doing this. The government, being sensible to the widespread animosity which taxation creates, chooses to enforce the taxation requirement by threat of criminal prosecution for non-compliance (or in the alternative it threatens defaulters with appointment to high political office). But how much less money would our government receive to throw around if the tax code was strictly voluntary? The same massive refusal problem exists with mandatory firearm registration. You cannot expect any meaningful compliance with mandatory registration without also making it a crime to refuse to comply. \n \n And if you try to force compliance by making a refusal to do so a crime, then you run into the 5th. Amendment problem-a likely problem in regards to \"ordinary\" citizens-an absolute problem in regards to felons and others who already cannot legally possess a firearm. \n \n So, if the purpose of mandatory registration is to identify illegal transfers, then let me create an example of such a transfer and see how it would play out:\n \n Say Mr. A decides to sell a gun to Mr. B, who is a known convicted felon. Both A and B are committing a felony offense with this transfer. The likelihood of compliance with the registration requirement is very low, for neither A nor B will want to announce this crime by registering the illegal transfer and new possession of the firearm. And yet the 5th. Amendment would render both A & B immune from prosecution for avoiding the registration requirement because the requirement forces them to incriminate themselves. So when A & B get together to make the sale, their choices are (1) register and report the fact that you have committed a new crime, or (2) refuse to register the transaction with the knowledge that the government is powerless to punish you for it.\n \n When faced with this kind of choice, both A and B will go quietly into the night, and yet another illegal transfer would easily evade the law designed to help prevent them. If detecting and/or preventing these illegal transactions is the goal, then I believe the law would be powerless to promote it. \n \n \nDo we really need to charge someone being tried for armed robbery or worse with an additional petty weapons charge? \n\n \n Actually, in regards to possession by felons, they are not petty weapons charges-at least in Virginia. Say for example you catch a crack dealer with a gun. He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack, but in my experience if he pleads guilty it would be a very, very rare occurrence for him to receive an active sentence of more than 2 years per charge for being a drug dealer. This is because the judge can suspend any part of or all of his sentence, and pursuant to this judicial authority the average sentence I see for per count of selling crack is 12-18 months. But if you catch him with a gun while he is selling, then the punishment for just on offense of having the gun is an automatic 5 years which cannot be suspended. I have seen many instances where the defendant gets far more time for having a gun than what he received for the actual underlying crime he commits either with or while having the gun. \n \n But to come back to the issue, if registration is aimed at identifying and/or preventing illegal transfers and illegal possession of firearms, then in my opinion that goal cannot be reached because it cannot be enforced. Felons found in possession are already prosecuted for having the gun without a requirement to register them. A registration requirement will not aid in either their detection or prosecution because they will not comply with the registration requirement's command that they incriminate themselves-and no law can force them to register their guns so long as the 5th. Amendment remains a part of the Constitution.",

   "In early America the main military defense of the nation was the militia which was composed of the adult citizenry and usually armed with their own weapons. Thus the federal government had a reason to have some knowledge of the private arms owned by citizens in order to determine the nation's military readiness in case it was attacked by the British again or another foreign power. The federal government was also given some authority over the militia to ensure it was an effective fighting force as recognized by the Supreme Court:\n \n \"Two conflicting themes, developed at the Constitutional Convention and repeated in debates over military policy during the next century, led to a compromise in the text of the Constitution and in later statutory enactments. On the one hand, there was a widespread fear that a national standing Army posed an intolerable threat to individual liberty and to the sovereignty of the separate States, 5 while, on the other hand, there was a recognition of the danger of relying on inadequately trained soldiers as the primary means of providing for the common defense. 6 Thus, Congress was authorized both to raise and support a national Army and also to organize 'the Militia.'

Show us the requirement of what must be done, or what to do, if your registered firearm had been destroyed, or lost in the woods, and the duty to inform the commander of your new Registered firearm. Surely there must be some record of this stuff if the Government required it. \n \n Then show us why, when, and where it all stopped. I mean, we don't do it any more. Surely you can provide the documentation of the dissolution of the requirement, if it were true. After all Bryan laid out Haynes where the Supreme Court called it Unconstitutional because it violated the 5th Amendment.\n \n Or perhaps you can show us where someone was prosecuted for not registering their weapons. \n \n Maybe you are saying that all of our judges, all throughout our history and time, have just been Constitutionally negligent. \n \n But let me say that I agree with much of the rest of you post.\n \n Your reasoning does not follow for registration Galileo.

   "Held: \n \n Article I's plain language, read as a whole, establishes that Congress may authorize members of the National Guard of the United States to be ordered to active federal duty for purposes of training outside the United States without either the consent of a State Governor or the declaration of a national emergency. Pp. 347-355. \n \n \n (a) The unchallenged validity of the dual enlistment system means that Guard members lose their state status when called to active federal duty, and, if that duty is a training mission, the training is performed by the Army. During such periods, the second Militia Clause is no longer applicable. Pp. 347-349. \n \n (b) This view of the constitutional issue was presupposed by the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 375 , 377, 381-384, which held that the Militia Clauses do not constrain Congress' Article I, 8, powers to provide for the common defense, raise and support armies, make rules for the governance of the Armed Forces, and enact necessary and proper laws for such purposes, but in fact provide additional grants of power to Congress. Pp. 349-351. \n \n (c) This interpretation merely recognizes the supremacy of federal power in the military affairs area and does not significantly affect either the State's basic training responsibility or its ability to rely on its own Guard in state emergency situations. Pp. 351-352. \n \n (d) In light of the exclusivity of federal power over many aspects of military affairs, see Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, the powers allowed to the States by existing statutes are significant. Pp. 353-354. \n \n (e) Thus, the Montgomery Amendment is not inconsistent with the Militia Clauses. Since the original gubernatorial veto was not constitutionally compelled, its partial repeal by the Amendment is constitutionally valid. Pp. 354-355. \n \n 880 F.2d 11, affirmed. \n \n Held is what court's decision is.\n One would think that in attempting to make a case for registration it should be mentioned in the link(s). ",

   "However, if Mr. A is selling a gun that is legally registered in his own name then wouldn't it be easier for the police to trace it back to be Mr. A if the gun is ever used by Mr. B in a crime and thus determine that an illegal transfer had happened? If the police recover a gun at a crime scene that is registered in Mr. A's name then they would naturally want to question Mr. A. The knowledge that that may happen may be enough to deter Mr. A from selling to convicted felons.\n\n \n No, I must disagree. That very same risk of detection (and by implication deterrence) already exists in our most problematic illegal transfers-the straw man purchase. We already have too many Mr. A's buying guns from FFL dealers and then giving or selling them illegally to felon Mr. B's for a profit. Mr. A already knows his name is forever kept as the original purchaser, and that if the gun he bought and sold/gave away illegally is ever dropped at a crime scene then a BATFE trace will identify him as the purchaser and the man who's got some explaining to do. That risk, by itself, has not deterred these straw man sales. Your argument suggests that mandatory registration would bring that same level of deterrence to the secondary private sales market. But if it does not meaningfully deter illegal transfers starting at a gun shop, then I do not see how it would have any greater deterrent effect on illegal sales in the privacy of someone's basement. \n \n In any event, your scenario assumes A will register the gun he already owns when the registration law takes effect. And this is the central problem for proponents of mandatory registration. For registration to have any effect it must command widespread compliance. There is no reason to believe that the government can receive widespread compliance with its demand to register \"all the guns out there\" without an effective means of penalizing those who simply refuse to do so. No one has yet offered a model of punishing non-compliance that does not run afoul of the right against self-incrimination.\n \n Let me address some other posters here. I know some here complain that we register cars but not guns, and they argue we just need to register guns-as though wishing it were so does away with the constitutional deficiencies of the law. But brushing aside the self-incrimination issue is nothing more than making a simple \"the end justifies the means\" argument. That style of argument did not serve well in the attempt to destroy the 2nd. Amendment by labeling it a \"states\" right-and the \"ends justify the means\" philosophy cannot be taken any more seriously when it is now used to push aside the 5th. Amendment for hindering the goal of mandatory registration. \n \n And so my question to everyone is: How are we not wasting our time talking about whether the government should require mandatory registration when no one is able to tell us how the government could do it?",

Assuming they even bother. One of the provisions of this bill is the computerization of medical records. Not so bad in and of itself. The kicker comes in the appoinment of a board to determine who gets what treatment. Under the guise of further economic \"recovery\" it would be no problem to slip in a provision for manditory firearm registration with appropriate criminal penalties for failure to do so. I am sure the BATF would be having orgasms in carrying out the registration. I don't think anyone could find a judge to restrain this in time to do any good. One or two Obama appoinments to the supreme court and its a lock on guarantee that the registration is constitution.

To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss.

The serial number must be placed in a manner not \n susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must \n not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For \n firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, \n the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number \n must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller \n than 1/16 inch; and \n (2) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise \n conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped \n (impressed), or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain \n additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not \n susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered or removed. For \n firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, \n the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information \n must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information \n includes: \n (i) The model, if such designation has been made; \n (ii) The caliber or gauge; \n (iii) Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when \n applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer or maker; \n (iv) In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State \n (or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer \n maintain your place of business, or where you, as the maker, made the \n firearm; and \n [[Page 189]] \n (v) In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in \n which it was manufactured and the city and State (or recognized \n abbreviation thereof) where you as the importer maintain your place of \n business. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see \n Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134. \n (b) The depth of all markings required by this section will be \n measured from the flat surface of the metal and not the peaks or ridges. \n The height of serial numbers required by paragraph (a)(1) of this \n section will be measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of \n the character impression bottoms (bases). \n (c) The Director may authorize other means of identification upon \n receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, \n showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder \n the effective administration of this part. \n (d) In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize \n other means of identifying that weapon upon receipt of a letter \n application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that engraving, \n casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon would be dangerous or \n impracticable. \n (e) A firearm frame or receiver that is not a component part of a \n complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed \n of by you must be identified as required by this section. \n (f)(1) Any part defined as a machine gun, muffler, or silencer for \n the purposes of this part that is not a component part of a complete \n firearm at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you \n must be identified as required by this section. \n (2) The Director may authorize other means of identification of \n parts defined as machine guns other than frames or receivers and parts \n defined as mufflers or silencers upon receipt of a letter application \n from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other identification \n is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this \n part.\n \n \n as a note, the ATF NFA Handbook is available HERE:\n \n http://www.atf.gov/firearms/nfa/nfa_handbook/\n \n the ATF currently has this in thier regulations book under Chaper 7 \n \n Section 7.4 The identification of firearms.\n \n 7.4.1 Serial numbers. \n Each manufacturer of a firearm must legibly identify it by engraving, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing on the firearm's frame or receiver an individual serial number not duplicating any serial number placed by the manufacturer on any other firearm.120 \n \n The requirement that the marking be \"conspicuously\" placed on the firearm means that the marking must be\n wholly unobstructed from plain view. \n \n For firearms manufactured on or after January 30, 2002, the serial number must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller than 1/16 inch.\n \n 7.4.1.1 What is an acceptable serial number? \n \n Alpha characters (letters), for example a name,\n are not acceptable as a serial number. A proper serial number may contain such characters or\n letters, but it must have at least one numeric character (number). \n \n ATF takes the view that marking \"legibly\" means using exclusively Roman letters (A, B, C, and so forth) and Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, and so forth).121 \n \n Deviations from this requirement have been found to\n seriously impair ATF's ability to trace firearms involved in crime.\n \n 7.4.2 Additional information. \n \n Certain additional information must also be conspicuously placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel of the firearm by engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), that is, they must be placed in such a manner that they are wholly unobstructed from plain view. \n \n For firearms manufactured on or after January 30, 2002, this information must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch.\n The additional information includes:\n (1) The model, if such designation has been made;\n (2) The caliber or gauge;\n (3) The manufacturer's name (or recognized abbreviation); and\n (4) The city and State (or recognized abbreviation) where the manufacturer maintains its place\n of business.122\n \n 7.4.3 Measuring the depth of markings. The depth of all markings is measured from the flat surface\n of the metal and not the peaks or ridges. The height of serial numbers is measured as the distance\n between the latitudinal ends of the character impression bottoms (bases).\n \n This seems pretty cut and dried to me. Without identifying marks, HOW ELSE would you identify an item? By nomenclature? O.K., I'll go pull a horseweed out of my back yard, write down my name and \"firearm\" description\" (HSWD model #1) and TA-DA! According to you, I've just registered my \"firearm\"! Like the question you never answered above, \"Is this all you want?\" I never knew such a tiny little thing would appease the Brady Campaign. All this carping and moaning, and all they want is for us to write down our names and what nomenclature of firearms we have? Then why-oh-why does the ATF go through all that nonsense about putting numbers on our horsewee....um...er...firearms if nobody even wants us to use those numbers? I guess, since you could care less about serial numbers, you'll have no problem contacting the ATF and telling them to stop that goofy paractice. I mean, why all the hubbub about \"90% of guns used by Mexican gangs being shipped from the U.S.\" if all they had to do is look up the nomenclature? \"Hey this guy's got a horseweed! This must have come from Superlite!\" (Unless, of course, this isn't ALL YOU WANT?) Is it? Well? \n \n Oh, I forgot to ask: When I legally sell my horseweed to Tither, how does this nomenclature \"registration\" work? Does my record of horseweed ownership get destroyed while he creates his horseweed record? How do you know it was my horseweed? What if Tither dug up his own horseweed? There are about 50 gazillion horseweeds out there. What if 100 of us killed someone with our horseweeds, then traded? After all, without a serial number, which horseweed killed who? How do you know it was THAT horseweed owned by ME that did it? I just sold mine to Tither. After all.....all I have to do is register the nomenclature. How do you know this particular horseweed is the one you're talking about? It's a horseweed isn't it? That's all you need. Right?\n \n \nNow show me a definition of registration that says it must include the serial number or shut up.\n\n \n Does this work both ways?",

To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable.

OK. \n \n Is this the proof that you have that our Founding Fathers allowed our Government to registered every gun our Founders owned? Is this really what you offer as proof? I say it is what Daewoo called it. an Inventory. \n \n \nHow do you define register?\n\n I don't know. Gun registries exist all over this world, but NONE of them chose the way, and what you guys are calling a gun registry. That much is fact! \n \n Now let me ask you, is this what you guys want? I think not! If this were to be proposed as a gun registry, you guys would ridicule it endlessly, and say this is not a gun registry. This is nothing but BS! Just like we are. :) \n \n \nHow do you explain the evidence already presented to show that lists of privately owned guns were made and required by law? \n\n How? An Inventory.

You and Daewoo did, and claimed it was gun registration. All I asked you guys to do, was prove it. Are you satisfied with the proof you laid before us? Then tell us that this is what you got, although I think you guys just did. \n \n \nSuch oversimplified history doesn't prove anything one way or the other about gun registration. The Founders feared too little government as well as fearing too much government. \n \n Daewoo said that We the People trusted their government impliedly. How about this as an addition.\n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n that further declaratory and restrictive clauses it says. Restrictive against whom. The Government. Doesn't sound very trusting to me. They wanted guarantees that the government was limited. \n \n   Ninth Amendment - Unenumerated Rights \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n Rights Retained by the People\n \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions. \n\n If they trusted the government so impliedly, why did so many appose ratification until the Bill of Rights were promised? I mean, they could not even get the Constitution passed until the promise was made.\n \n Ths Constitution Society says this.   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n\n Now I know you do not agree with this last part but the Supreme Court did in Heller.",

You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control, the gun registration model precisely. This form of \"gun control\" isn't about guns, it's about control. I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited. For criminals that is. Gun registration is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the \"news\" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office. \n \n Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime. For without criminal penalties how do you enforce registration? Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since the beginning makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's registration list. Is that the American way?

When it comes to the practicality I agree with you entirely. It is a worthless idea that would make no sense. That is also why I am willing to use registration as a bargaining chip. Let them spend a few billion dollars on a nonsensical charlie foxtrot...as long as we get something good in return. \n \n The only thing good we could get in return would be a signed irrevocable legal document that would make them instant spare parts if they even proposed any form of confiscation.\n \n Crtiminals do not have the \"right\" to not register firearms.

It remains to be seen in a court of law.\n \n Granted, registration makes no sense at all since it can not apply to criminals, but that is hardly the point.

If you can some how make the words \"actual situation\" mean registration then you have a case. As far as the leap of illogic from this to the sheriff idea that dog just doesn't hunt. I could carry my musket, firelock, rifle to muster. I could in no way carry my \"cache\" to the sheriff for him to determine their \"actual situation\". If the sheriff was wanting to take my word for what I had in my \"cache\" I'd be honest. As far as showing private weapons being inventoried by militia commanders, you may have a case for the ones carried to muster. As far as ALL weapons being inventoried you have a long way to go. In the case of a single man, maybe he has one firearm. In the case of a married man with family there is a good chance he will have more than one. No where with in the law does it state that all weapons be carried or brought to muster. Only that he provide himself with a good musket or firelock and other accoutrements. That is to be brought to muster or when called up. \n \n Of course the star struck one has a problem with the usual and accepted meaning of the word register as it pertains to firearms. He wasn't sure serial numbers played a part in it. Of course with moral relativism and situational ethics clouding the issue for him I am not suprised.",

   "I fail to see how what is described in the militia laws I quoted from is not gun registration according to the usual and accepted meaning of the word register. I tried to get clarification from Tither about how he understood the word register but was told \"I don't know.\"\n\n Although accurate, that is absolutely unfair, because I told you that several countries on this World have gun registration, and what you guys are describing (An Inventory) doesn't look like any of the gun registry in the world today. It is called humor, and irony. :) \n \n Also the burden of proof is on you, not me, to prove your allegations. \n \n Although I am through kicking this subject around, because I am embarrassed that I might look like a bully, no anti-gunner would accept this as gun registration today. Therefore it is, what it always was, an inventory.\n \n However, you could also answer the other questions I posed to Daewoo, if you believe I have wronged you, but I, and every reader of this thread who is honestly seeking the truth, already knows, that no acceptable proof exist. \n \n \nProve your case! Like proof that would be acceptable in a court of law. \n \n 1. Perhaps you can show us the requirement to record the serial numbers of each weapon, and what other information must be included for each weapon. Since you say the rest was registered too, then maybe you could show us the requirement to record the serial numbers of each bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch,.. knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder.\n \n 2. Show us the requirement of what must be done, or what to do, if your registered firearm had been destroyed, or lost in the woods, and the duty to register your new firearm. Surely there must be some record of this stuff if the Government required it. And there must be a method of expunging the old serial number since the gun no longer exist. I am not going into the rest of what you claim was registered. :)\n \n 3. Show us the regulations to register multiple firearms that the Citizen might own. \n 4. Then show us why, when, and where it all stopped. I mean, we don't do it any more. \n 5.Surely you can provide the documentation of the dissolution of the requirement, if it were true. \n \n 6. Or perhaps you can show us where someone was prosecuted for not registering their weapons.\n \n Or maybe you are saying that all of our judges, and our Congressional representatives all throughout our history and time, have just been Constitutionally negligent.\n \n \n \nFinally, I'm not trying to advocate that we return to the way things were 200 years ago. \n\n Yep! I'm done. The NFA does not use the method you described either! emoticon_smile I am going to stick a fork in it! It is cooked!",

They did a lot more drinking than drilling. I remember reading an account of the militia when I was in college and while I do not recall the details, the basic gist of the story was that some important federal functionary was passing through and the local militia was scheduled to muster. The guy went to the parade grounds where they were supposed to muster and waited until noon and nobody showed up.

   "That there were armories or arsenals prior to the militia act of 1792 is not in doubt. In fact the events of what came to be known as Shay's Rebellion reinforce that fact. \"General Lincoln had moved westward from Boston to defend the Worcester court while Shays and nearly 1,500 Regulators marched on the Arsenal late in the afternoon of January 25th, 1787. It was on the grounds of the Springfield Armory National Historic Site that the high-water mark of this violent and wide-spread rebellion, or \"Regulation\" as it was known at the time, crested in the bloody clash at the arsenal in an effort by the rebels to seize the barracks, cannon, muskets, and ammunition stored there.\" Springfield Armory National Historic Site - Shays Rebellion 1787 (U.S. National Park Service) \n \"General Shepard's forces were unpaid and without food or adequate arms. Shepard had requested permission to use the weaponry in the Springfield Armory, but Secretary of War Henry Knox had denied the request on the grounds that it required Congressional approval and that Congress was out of session. Shepard reached the armory before Shays, and, ignoring Knox, Shepard's militia commandeered the weapons stored there.\" KELTLADY SPEAKETH: Shay's Rebellion\n Thus we have an example of the militia not having their own arms but seizing those of the Continentals to perform the defense of the armory. \n \n By the Act of April 2, 1794, Congress established a national armory at Springfield, Massachusetts and the following year authorized construction of another national armory at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Springfield, Massachusetts had established itself, during the American Revolutionary War, as a potential center for the manufacture of arms. So its selection was a logical choice. For political reasons one armory was established in the north and the other in the south. This raises the question of for whom did the armory manufacture its arms. Were the militia in fact allowed to purchase firearms made there? \n \n United States Rifle Model 1803 - One of the key U.S. shoulder firearms, the .54 caliber Model 1803 flintlock rifle, was originally thought to be the weapon issued to the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Louisiana Territory. The graceful lines and Kentucky rifle styling is evident in this early weapon and the unique length of its stock caused many to refer to it as a \"half stock\" rifle. A total of 4,023 Model 1803 rifles were manufactured at the Harpers Ferry Armory, Virginia between 1803 and 1807. This would be in excess of the needs of the 2 regiments of the regular establishment. And what of the Springfield Armory, how many firearms were manufactured there during this period? So were these in fact issued or sold to militia members? \n \n In any event the period of inventory of privately owned weapons of the militia was a short one. An Act making provision for arming and equipping the whole body of the Militia of the United States, 23 April 1808.\n That the annual sum of two hundred thousand dollars be, and the same hereby is appropriated for the purpose of providing arms and military equipments for the whole body of the militia of the United States, either by purchase or manufacture, by and on account of the United States. \n SEC. 2. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized to purchase sites for, and erect, such additional arsenals and manufactories of arms as he may deem expedient, under the limitations and restrictions now provided by law: Provided, also, That so much of any law as restricts the number of workmen in the armories of the United States to one hundred men, be, and the same hereby is, repealed. \n SEC. 3. That all the arms procured in virtue of this act shall be transmitted to the several states composing this union, and territories thereof, to each state and territory, respectively, in proportion to the number of the effective militia in each state and territory, and by each state and territory to be distributed to the militia in such state and territory, under such rules and regulations as shall be by law prescribed by the legislature of each state and territory. \n [Approved, April 23, 1808.] \n \n One could safely conclude that it was the intention of the fledgling government to arm their military with government weapons. The militia act makes no mention of cannon. Those were certainly government owned. With the requirement of having the militia members purchase their firearms only as a temporary measure. \n \n \n ",

   "I for one do not say that registration of all privately held firearms would violate the constitution. I cannot find any amendment, be it either the second or otherwise, which would prevent such a law. SCOTUS said as much in Haynes:\n \n At the outset, it must be emphasized that the issue in this case is not whether Congress has authority under the Constitution to regulate the manufacture, transfer, or possession of firearms; nor is it whether Congress may tax activities which are, wholly or in part, unlawful. Rather, we are required to resolve only the narrow issue of whether enforcement of \u00a7 5851 against petitioner, despite his assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, is constitutionally permissible.\n Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 90 (1968)\n \n The issue is not whether registration is constitutional, but rather whether enforcement of that law against those who choose not to register would be unconstitutional. To this end, SCOTUS did not strike down the registration law, but it did say a proper assertion of the 5th. Amendment right against self-incrimination presented a bar against prosecution for failure to register or possession of an unregistered firearm. \n \n There is nothing in the record which suggests Haynes was a felon or someone else who could not lawfully possess a firearm. He was, apparently, an ordinary \"Joe Citizen\" as far as the ability to have firearms goes. His 5th. Amendment claim arose from the law declaring the possession \"at any time\" of the unregistered firearm an offense, which made his obligation to register a firearm he already possessed a requirement that he incriminate himself by announcing that he had, in fact, possessed an unregistered firearm \"at any time.\" \n \n There may well be a way to avoid this 5th. Amendment problem for the mass of \"Joe Citizens\" some want to force into a registration system-but no one has offered any solution to date....\n \n In any event, there is an absolute bar to requiring felons, domestic assaulters, stalkers, etc. from registering their firearms. Their firearms are exempt from any registration scheme, and they could thumb their noses at the registration requirement. \n \n I've heard quite a lot about why some people want mandatory registration. What I'd like to hear now is how will you do it. Someone tell me how they will deal with the 5th. Amendment issue.",

You are the one making careless statements. The burden of proof is on you. No? Why in the world is it now on us? \n \n I asked, \"Is this stuff registered too?   Militia Act of 1792, \n a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder;\n\n \nIn a way, yes. You and nato are making gun owners look like unreasonable, illiterate lunatics. As a gun owner, I resent that.\n\n Maybe you could answer the other questions on the list, since you still claim it was gun registration. I'll take out, \"Show us an inventory list kept by these commanders.\" And \"Perhaps you can show us the list of these Serial Numbers from our government archives.\" \n \nProve your case! Like proof that would be acceptable in a court of law. \n \n 1. Perhaps you can show us the requirement to record the serial numbers of each weapon, and what other information must be included for each weapon. Since you say the rest was registered too, then maybe you could show us the requirement to record the serial numbers of each bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch,.. knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder.\n \n 2. Show us the requirement of what must be done, or what to do, if your registered firearm had been destroyed, or lost in the woods, and the duty to register your new firearm. Surely there must be some record of this stuff if the Government required it. And there must be a method of expunging the old serial number since the gun no longer exist. I am not going into the rest of what you claim was registered. :)\n \n 3. Show us the regulations to register multiple firearms that the Citizen might own. \n 4. Then show us why, when, and where it all stopped. I mean, we don't do it any more. \n 5.Surely you can provide the documentation of the dissolution of the requirement, if it were true. \n \n 6. Or perhaps you can show us where someone was prosecuted for not registering their weapons.\n \n Or maybe you are saying that all of our judges, and our Congressional representatives all throughout our history and time, have just been Constitutionally negligent.\n\n Prove your case.\n \n And also there is this. This is the one slam dunk thing that you have that might help you build at least a little credibility. Maybe you just missed it. I'll give you another chance. \n \nBad news. The militia act of 1792 is also in the national archives. \n \n \nOK Fair enough, however, I don't think you ever linked it. Lets start with you proving something. You said The militia act of 1792 was at the National Archives. Link the one from our National Archives. That should be easy enough. Then we will go on from there, having you prove other things. OK? \n \n I mean come on, this one is a nothing.",

The presumed right to travel, however, is firmly established in U.S. law and precedent. In U.S. v Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966), the Court noted, \"It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.\" In fact, in Shapiro v Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), Justice Stewart noted in a concurring opinion that \"it is a right broadly assertable against private interference as well as governmental action. Like the right of association, ... it is a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all.\" It is interesting to note that the Articles of Confederation had an explicit right to travel; it is now thought that the right is so fundamental that the Framers may have thought it unnecessary to include it in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\n Things That Are Not In the U.S. Constitution - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net\n \n Btw I am mildly interested in the \"politics involved\" but it's tiresome having to deal with under-educated, mean-spirited provincials who spend more time fondling firearms than women. \n \n And I meant a US passport.

   "The possibility that registration could lead to the confiscation of guns from criminals like Wong does not mean it will lead to the confiscation of guns from everyone. \n\n   Why Gun Rights Advocates Oppose Gun Registration \n A centralized registration system is the one usually proposed by gun control activists, and it is the type most feared by gun rights advocates. At the heart of resistance to registration is the belief that it encourages firearm prohibitions and ultimately leads to confiscation. (It is also why many choose not to comply and register weapons already owned.) \n \n Those who favor more gun control often accuse gun owners of being paranoid, but the track record of firearms registration is not a good one. The poor record of gun control and registration in countries without democratic traditions is discussed in these two sources and will not be elaborated upon here:  Of Holocausts and Gun Control, Washington University Law Quarterly, 1997. \n \u00b7   Book review of Lethal Laws, N.Y. Law School J. Int'l & Comp. L., 1995. \n \n Democratic societies have also used registration to confiscate what were once previously legally-owned firearms. Many gun rights advocates \"believe that a nucleus of anti-gun activists will agitate for restrictions and bans on the 'most dangerous' type of firearm in common use. When that gun is banned they will move on to the next model which will in turn become the 'most dangerous' type. Firearms owners fears are supported by what has happened recently in the UK, Australia, and Canada, and has previously happened in NZ [New Zealand].\"   (The Registration of Firearms: A Compendium of Available Fact From Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, 1998) \n \n Gun Confiscation in Democratic Societies \n New Zealand has had some form of firearms registration since 1921. In 1974, all revolvers lawfully held for personal security were confiscated. (Same source as previous paragraph) \n \n In May of 1995, Canada's   Bill C-68 prohibited previously legal and registered small-caliber handguns. Current owners of such guns were \"grandfathered,\" which means the guns are to be forfeited upon death of the owner. Bill C-68 also authorizes the Canadian government to enact future weapons prohibitions. \n \n On 10 May 1996, Australia banned most semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic and pump shotguns. Prior to this law, many Australian states and territories had firearms registration. Owners of these newly outlawed firearms were required to surrender them (with some monetary compensation). All such firearms are to be confiscated and destroyed after a 12-month amnesty program. Roughly 600,000 of an estimated 4 million Australian guns have been surrendered to authorities and destroyed. \n \n \"Since 1921, all lawfully-owned handguns in Great Britain are registered with the government, so handgun owners have little choice but to surrender their guns in exchange for payment according to government schedule...The handgun ban by no means has satiated the anti-gun appetite in Great Britain.\"   (All the Way Down the Slippery Slope: Gun Prohibition in England and Some Lessons for Civil Liberties in America\", Hamline Law Review, 1999) \n \n Even in the United States, registration has been used to outlaw and confiscate firearms. In New York City, a registration system enacted in 1967 for long guns, was used in the early 1990s to confiscate lawfully owned semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. (Same source as previous paragraph) The New York City Council banned firearms that had been classified by the city as \"assault weapons.\" This was done despite the testimony of Police Commissioner Lee Brown that no registered \"assault weapon\" had been used in a violent crime in the city. The 2,340 New Yorkers who had registered their firearms were notified that these firearms had to be surrendered, rendered inoperable, or taken out of the city.   (NRA/ILA Fact Sheet: Firearms Registration: New York City's Lesson) \n \n More recently, California revoked a grace period for the registration of certain rifles (SKS Sporters) and declared that any such weapons registered during that period were illegal.   (California Penal Code, Chapter 2.3, Roberti-Ross Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 section 12281(f) ) In addition, California has prohibited certain semi-automatic long-rifles and pistols. Those guns currently owned, must be registered, and upon the death of the owner, either surrendered or moved out of state. (  FAQ #13  from the   California DOJ Firearms Division Page) \n",

   "The possibility that registration could lead to the confiscation of guns from criminals like Wong does not mean it will lead to the confiscation of guns from everyone.\n\n \n That's not what the article talked about though, it talked about the confiscation of firearms if their registration expired. The article talked about the taking of legally owned firearms if a person didn't continually renew their registration.\n \n \nSo what's your solution? How do you propose to disarm dangerous people like Wong or are you soft on crime?\n\n \n For starters, I don't propose anything that has the potential to adversely affect those that aren't breaking the laws and putting others in the way of harm.\n \n Second, there's absolutely no way to disarm dangerous people. No matter what you propose or try, dangerous and criminal individuals will always find ways to arm themselves. The black market has access to tens of millions of illegally acquired firearms that're already circulating in the illegal channels and impossible to find or track or \"get off the streets\" so proposing we make it harder for innocent people to buy guns will have no measurable affect of any sort.\n \n Mexico is a prime example of this. Only about 11% of ALL guns recovered can be traced back to America, of which they refuse to say how many were sold by the American government to the Mexican government. The other 89% is coming from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Africa, Colombia, Central America, Germany, etc. And this 89% of weaponry is true weapons of war, they're the anti-tank cannons, the rocket propelled grenades, and anti-aircraft missiles, the fragmentation grenades, etc. all the #### you can't buy anywhere in the states. And the rest of the country has an arms trade treaty, but it ain't doing any good.\n \n You wanna know how to disarm criminals and stop being soft on crime? STOP BEING SOFT ON CRIME! Those two bastards responsible for the North Hollywood Shootout back in 1997, they were arrested for, amongst other things, transportation and possession of an IED. \n \n Possession of an IED is a serious felony offense and carries a penalty of at least five years in a federal prison. But instead they were given a plea deal and spent 100 days in a county jail! And on top of that, as soon as they finished their sentence, the court agreed to give them back all of their weapons.

   "Her husband is one of NY elite that carries a handgun. She probably does too but won't admit it any more than Di Fi or Brady.\n \n \nQuotes from Those Who Believe Criminals Should Be Protected From Law-abiding Citizens\n Instead of the Other Way Around \n BRITISH MAJOR JOHN PITCAIRN (Commander of Advance Guard of British forces marching to Concord, MA)\n \n \"Disperse you rebels; damn you, throw down your arms and disperse.\" (order to American militiamen at Lexington, 1775)\n \n \n BILL CLINTON (42nd President of the United States): \"We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles...that we are unable to think about reality.\" (USA Today, 11 March 93, pg. 2A)\n \n Reply: \"The last time I checked, the Constitution said 'of the people, by the people and for the people.' That's what the Declaration of Independence says.\" Reuters News Agency\n \n Editors note: actually those words are in neither of those documents, but part of The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln.\n \n Clinton, again:\n \n \"I don't think the American people are there right now. But with more than 200 million guns in circulation, we've got so much more to do on this issue before we even reach that. I don't think that's an option now. But there are certain kinds of guns that can be banned and a lot of other reasonable regulations that can be imposed.\" (When asked of the possibility of a federal law banning handguns, interview in Rolling Stone magazine, 9 Dec 93, pg. 45)\n \n \"We've banned these guns ['assault' weapons] because you don't need an Uzi to go deer hunting, and everyone knows it.\" (Weekly radio address, 15 Nov 97, the Roosevelt Room, the White House)\n \n \n \n RONNIE EDLEMAN (Department of Justice, Clinton Administration): \"The current state of federal law does not recognize that the Second Amendment protects the right of private citizens to possess firearms of any type. Instead, the Second Amendment is deemed to be a collective right belonging to the state and not to an individual. Accordingly, the Second Amendment is interpreted by this administration as prohibiting the federal government from preventing a state government from forming or having a state recognized militia force. With this understanding in mind, the source of citizens' authority to possess a handgun has never been particularly identified in American law.\" In a letter written on behalf of President Clinton\n \n \n JANET RENO (U.S. Attorney General) \"Gun registration is not enough.\" (Associated Press 10 Dec 93): \" I've always proposed state licensing...with some federal standards.\" (ABC's \"Good Morning America\" 10 Dec 93).\n \n Reno, again: \"[Assault weapons] are used on school yards, at airports, in bank lobbies, on trains, in traffic and in front of the White House. They have no legitimate sporting purpose, and you won't find them in a duck blind or at the Olympics.\" (The Washington TimesThe Washington Times, 22 March 96, A4)\n \n \n \n JOYCELYN ELDERS (U.S. Surgeon General) ...on gun ownership: \"I want to make it as hard as possible. Gun owners would have to be evaluated by how they scored on written and firing tests, and have to pass the tests in order to own a gun. And I would tax the guns, bullets and the license itself very heavily.\" (Mother Jones magazine, Jan/Feb '94)\n \n \n FIDEL CASTRO: \"Armas para que?\" (\"Guns, for what?\") (Response to a Cuban citizens who said the people might need to keep their guns, after Castro announced strict gun control in Cuba)\n \n \n \n MAJOR OWENS (U.S. Congressman): \"My bill...establishes a 6-month grace period for the turning in of handguns.\" (Congressional Record 10 Nov 93).\n \n Owens, again: \"The second article of amendment (Second Amendment) to the Constitution of the United States is repealed.\" (U.S. House Joint Resolution 438 introduced 11 March 1992 by Congressman Owens, D-NY)\n \n \n DIANE FEINSTEIN (California Senator, author of \"Feinstein Amendment\" which became the '94 gun ban): \"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them... 'Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in,' I would have done it.\" (60 Minutes episode, CBS) [Sen Feinstein holds a CCP]\n \n \n DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN (U.S. Senator) \"...we could tax them [firearms] out of existence.\" (Washington Post 4 Nov 93)\n \n \n MEL REYNOLDS (U.S. Congressman) \"If it were up to me we'd ban them all [firearms].\" (CNN Crossfire 9 Dec 93)\n \n \n NELSON T. (PETE) SHIELDS III (Founder, Handgun Control, Inc./National Council to Control Handguns) \"We're going to have to take this one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily - given the political realities - going to be very modest. Right now, though, we'd be satisfied not with half a loaf but with a slice. Our ultimate goal - total control of all guns - is going to take time.....The final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition - except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs and licensed gun collectors - totally illegal.\" (New Yorker Magazine, p.57-58, 26 Jul 76)\n \n \n SARAH BRADY (Chairman, Handgun Control, Inc.) \"There is no personal right to be armed for private purposes unrelated to the service in a well regulated militia.\" (Richmond Times-Dispatch, 6 June 97, pg. 6)\n \n Brady, again: \"We have a tremendous opportunity to take a giant leap forward in our fight to require gun licensing in this country....\" (HCI fund-raising letter, Oct 97, speaking of Initiative 676 in WA)\n \n \n JOSH SUGARMANN (Executive Director, Violence Policy Center; former Communications Director of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns): \"To end the crisis [gun violence], we have to regulate- or, in the case of handguns and assault weapons, completely ban- the product.... We are far past the where registration, licensing, safety training, background checks, or waiting periods will have much effect on firearms violence.\" Mother Jones Magazine, Jan/Feb 94, article titled \"Reverse Fire\"\n \n Sugarmann, again: \"...the semiautomatic weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion ..[that] anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun - can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons (1988 memo)\n \n DR. ARTHUR KELLERMAN (Published 1986 \"study\" discouraging people from using guns for self defense): \"If you've got to resist [an attacker], your chances of being hurt are less the more lethal your weapon. If that were my wife, would I want her to have a .38 Special in her hand? Yeah.\" (Health magazine, Mar/Apr 94 )\n \n \n WILLIAM GREIDER (writer, Rolling Stone magazine): \"The plain fact is that the United States is now hostage to a harrowing epidemic of gun violence, and the Brady bill won't do much to change that. The National Rifle Association has been saying this all along, and the NRA is right....The NRA has also argued that a waiting period won't prevent criminals from getting guns. And it's right about that, too....Enactment of the Brady bill will, however, represent a victory of some political significance - a visible defeat for the tenacious lobbying power of the NRA....Thus the limited scope of the Brady bill was justified as a necessary first step toward breaking the NRA's power - a way to demonstrate that politicians could support a moderate version of control and survive.\" (Rolling Stone, article entitled: \"A Pistol-whipped Nation - Pass the Brady Bill - then ban handguns\", 30 Sep 93, pg. 31)\n \n \n CHARLES MORGAN (Director, American Civil Liberties Union, Washington, D.C. office): \"I have not one doubt, even if I am in agreement with the National Rifle Association, that that kind of record keeping procedure (gun registration) is the first step to eventual confiscation under one administration or another\" (in a 1975 hearing before the House Subcommittee on Crime)\n \n \n CARL ROWAN (Washington, DC Syndicated Columnist): \"We must reverse this psychology (of needing guns for home defense). We can do it by passing a law that says anyone found in possession of a handgun except a legitimate officer of the law goes to jail- period! (1981 article)\n \n Rowan, again: \"...as long as authorities leave this society awash in drugs and guns, I will protect my family.\" (1988 article titled \"At Least They're Not Writing My Obituary\", after shooting an unarmed trespasser with an unregistered handgun)\n \n \n DR. JOYCE BROTHERS (Psychiatrist, TV personality): \"Men possess handguns in order to compensate for sexual dysfunction.\" [her husband is among NYC elite that has been issued a permit to carry a concealed handgun]\n \n MIKE SEELY (Spokesman for Washington Citizens for Handgun Safety, gun control lobby group pushing I-676, a gun licensing law): \"Their movement (2nd Amendment supporters) is so well grounded in the Constitution, it's 200 years old. Our movement is probably 20 years from reaching its peak.\" (Reuters)\n \n Seely, again: \"Maybe we brought out the extremist vote with this one.\" (The News Tribune, Tacoma, WA 6 Nov 97, after their ballot measure requiring gun licenses was defeated 71% - 29%)\n \n \n NAZI LAW (Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons, 11 Nov 1938, German Minister of the Interior): \"Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority. Firearms and ammunition found in a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation....Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions ...will be punished with imprisonment and a fine.\n",

You can defend your position either, so you attack me with some nonsense. \n \n The answer is NO, Brady! You can't steal our 2nd Amendment Rights!",
