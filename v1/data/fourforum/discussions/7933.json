   "I know this question is a very personal one, and also very difficult to answer if you haven't been there. However, think about it (for guys, think about this happening to your wife, your girlfriend, your sister, your mother, your daughter...), what about all the post-abortion trauma? Doesn't that say something? Why hasn't anybody said anything about that (at least I haven't seen it here, except in quick references perhaps)?\n \n Would you be willing to end the life (cause we do agree, at least, that it's alive right?) you carry inside you (guys, let's make an effort)? And if you would, under what circumstances? And after that, do you think you would just be O.K., carrying on with your life as if nothing happened?\n \n The personal experience of people in a whole variety of areas can give us a very good idea of what kind of practise we are applying. Saying that slaves were \"happy\" as such is a stupid argument in favour of the institution, I'm sure the VAST majority of slaves hated it. Doesn't that subjective feeling say something about the objective truth of slavery? Doesn't this apply to abortion also?",

   "Pejotif,\n \n In response to the question: No, I would not have an abortion. \n In a rape situation: a human being is a human being no matter how they were conceived, just ask my 10 yr old nephew. \n If my life were in danger: I'd risk my life for my own babie's life. (I don't think women should be required to risk their lives if they choose not to, it's just what I'd do personally)\n \n Being a feminist, I often get mistaken for being in favor of legal abortion. Not true though. I personally believe that if a woman finds herself pregnant(for whatever reason), that giving the developing person a life is the most empowering thing a woman could do in that situation (even if that means giving it up for adoption). I don't see why women killing their babies in their wombs is \"empowering\". Anyone can kill another person, but only women get the experience of childbirth and giving life to another person. That's empowering. \n \n Here's my personal experience with pregnancy. When I was 15 I went on for two months thinking I was pregnant. I finally found out that I wasn't. During the two months though, I never told anyone but my boyfriend, I couldn't tell my family (I was too embarrassed too). I tried never to let myself think about abortion. I honestly thought I'd give birth secretly and leave the baby at the hospital ( I had heard that unwanted babies can be left at these places legally). From that moment on I promised myself I would never put myself in that situation again, at least until I was ready. \n \n Anyways, thanks for letting me spill my story on you.",

   "Hello,\n \n This is my first post on this board. \n I joined because it said: \"Where Your Ideas can change Minds\" -positively, I hope\n \n In this case, I offer not only an idea, but 2 sets of actual experiences:\n 1. my own, plus\n 2. my teaching/counseling of women who happy-go-lucky chose to kill 1 (or multiple) baby/ies... and then years later developed (usually Breast)-cancer; which they were able to trace-back to their Abortion-decision. Their mind said \"For doing what you know is wrong, you will not escape the consequence\"\n \n Here's my personal story:\n The same week I found out (at 33) that finally I would be blessed being a happy mommy, I was assaulted and left slowly bleeding, alone. As an experienced nurse, I was truly terrified what might happen to the 2 of us, were I admitted to a hospital. So I prayed that we would be OK, without needing to go to the ER. But a friend discovered us, and they took me in. I was more gone, than here.\n \n In the meantime, someone payed to have them Kill my daughter inside me because \"You are grave\". \n Yet, I wasn't told about their \"decision\", as I regained enough consciousness to voice my \"opinion\".\n \n For 7 days (often more than once daily) this \"specialist\" made Rounds to my bedside:\n 1 doc:\"At 9 weeks now, you are unable to carry 'it' safely; and the best choice is to save at least one of you, right?\"\n Annie: \"No, that is wrong. And we *both* WANT to live!\"\n \n 2 doc:\"Be reasonable. As a nurse, you know this is in your best interest\".\n Annie:\"GOD creates *life*, which (medicine specializes in KILLing.<How pray tell is that \"reasonable\"?!)\n \n 3 doc: \"You know as a nurse, it'll just spontaneously-abort\".\n Annie: \"How little you know\"\n \n 4 doc: \"You know as a nurse, it'll be born so deformed, and compromised, Society will be burdened needlessly to care for it, because of your selfishness\"\n Annie: \"I grant you I'm selfish in protecting the life of this one child; and she will be born free and live healthily/happily\"\n \n 5 doc: \"You're just dreaming; because really you don't know anything\".\n Annie: \"Call me what you want; and what if I'm aware, of more than you are?\"\n \n 6 doc: \"You know, in my long career of practicing medicine, you're the most uncooperative patient I've had\"\n Annie: \"Yes I know; and thank you for your compliment\"\n \n 7 doc: \"I give up. You're truly hopeless. And why?\"\n Annie: \"Thank you. Because I choose to create the *positive*-reality I want, Sir\"\n \n And months later, as she emoticon_love birthed into my arms, my daughter had an Apgar-score of 10/10 & was well-formed/operational. And everyone commented re \"very-alert & calm\" this (5lb-13oz.) baby\n \n And years later, Home-schooled, my daughter took her Commencement-walk having graduated College with high honors, at 17 :) \n \n I am no god. Never was, never will be. I also know that GOD does not love the 2 of us more, than any other *expectant* mother/baby. And \n let me tell you: this tiny bit of \"protection\" I provided, any other mother can provide as well. It's just a simple matter of who do you trust: GOD?, or man.\n \n Annie\n --------\n \n \nI know this question is a very personal one, and also very difficult to answer if you haven't been there. However, think about it (for guys, think about this happening to your wife, your girlfriend, your sister, your mother, your daughter...), what about all the post-abortion trauma?

I'm glad I'm not a cold virus, but that doesn't mean I think that is call for immunosupresents all round, its just anthropromorphising on my part. Likewise when we think baby turtles get the short end of the stick.\n \n Vegetarians think the rest of the us are pretty evil in condoning the killing and consuming of sentient beings for our own pleasure, but few of us really have serious problems with it (though I probably would if I had to kill and deal with an actual animal rather than the tasty and abstract meat). Unlike some vegetarians who try to convert back after becoming pregnant attempting to the best for their kids.\n \n Its all about what you can feel empathy for, rather than whether you feel empathy at all - not recongising an early embryo as something you can emphasise with does not make you a psychopath, nor does it mean you feel any differently about a baby than a pro-lifer. All it means is that you can't emphasis with an early embryo.\n As far as the baby is concerned, surely it will only care about how it is treated and loved once it can experience caring and love? Before then, it seems more in line with things like dolls and favoured toys to me - some people may find value in it, but I am unable to really see things from their viewpoint.\n \n Before I get all complicated, I'm curious on your (Prototype's) opinion on evolution and empathy. You are clearly religious to some degree, and what you say to college girl is clearly about the subject. Its a topic that does interest me quite a bit, along with other odd quirks we have picked up somewhere along the line. Do beleive that this sort of thing is God acting through evolution (directing apparent mutation etc) or something that isn't entirely His work (due to it having such a tendancy to be a bit vague, inspiring protectiveness toward babyesque things like kittens, puppies and other large eyed symetrical things)?",

Everything is fine, and you won't feel anything, getting rid of those cells, etc\" - and based on that kind of counseling, they agreed to commit that act. And yes, they were told to be \"happy\" about giving it no afterthought, which many do not.\n \n The counseling they had many years later, was usually for: unexplicable pains, mounting anxieties, other chronic/acute diseases, recurring depressions, panic attacks, etc.\n \n\n This (breast) cancer tie is very interesting. Can you approximate how many women you knew that had abortions & ended up w/ breast cancer and how did they trace it back to their abortion?

   "I'm not sure thats a particularly workable philosophy as you are putting god in control of everything, its going to be inpinging on free will for those you God has decreed will die at anothers hands and means that those who are aborted were ment to be so anyway under God's plan. Not to mention if you leave out the human acts that end in another's death there are still plenty of natural horrors that would lead us to beleive that God has a very different definition of love than we do.\n\n \n No, there is one mistake here. You're arguing against the same freedom of decision making given to you to not kill. God gives that freedom to every man and woman. They choose to kill, they suffer consequences. That's the way things work with God, but his respect for man is the one thing that makes him limit himself to offering the choice to turn to him at any time instead of striking them down with a bolt of lightning the instant they sin. It was man's choice to sin, it was man's choice to abort. God has a set date and method for the death of every human, but that doesn't mean he kills them. Murder is laid to man's charge. The decision is always his, and God knowing the future has shaped it to the knowledge of the man's decision.\n \n (By the way, natural horrors of death are only present because of Man's first sin. Those things are his fault, not God's.)\n \n I'll tell you one thing. If you look at God as a monster, I'll tell you why. He is judgemental to people who sin against God, and though they may receive forgiveness, you don't always escape the punishment. God uses the different things like cursing the ground for Adam's sake and causing the environment to work against him to punish him for what he did. He doesn't let anyone get off with sin, and if he didn't impose such things as he decreed appropriate, he wouldn't be much of a God, would he?",

I have a different view on that subject though, if you'd like to discuss that further.\n \n God's code of ethics ARE very different from our own. Quite true. But Man's view on what's right and wrong is the one thing that turned the world into the moral turmoil it's in now.

The frequency of psychiatric diagnoses in women who have undergone an abortion procedure is similar to that in women with no such history. Risk factors for postabortal psychosocial problems include previous or concurrent psychiatric illness, coercion, medical indications that force the patient to chose between possible life threatening complications and termination of a wanted pregnancy, increasing length of gestation, ambivalence, and lack of social support [3,4]. In 1993, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised (DSM-IV-R) ceased to recognize abortion as a type of psychosocial stressor.\n \n 1.

The individuals(s) growing inside mom already have a head, trunk & beating-heart...before \n a girl/woman may experience the first-twinges of hormonal-'nausea'.\n This comprehensive computer/neuro-network misses nothing in the way of experience, as recorded by both mom & babies.\n \n And yes, some girls/women later develop symptoms & dis-eases previously mentioned..\n\n \n So...their nerves \"remember\" their abortions and thus enact a kind of physical guilt trip them?

I mean no disrespect nor would I attempt to demean or dismiss the difficult emotional time you had then or may have now. But using as examples women who had emotional stress after an abortion does not mean that there is a clear cause and effect relationship for all women. This sounds very callous to the individual, but statements about the likelihood of the relationship between two events must be done on a population basis.\n \n The presence of emotional stress after abortion clearly occurs; yours is an example of that, and nothing anyone can say could make you think otherwise. And there is no logical reason why you should. But the studies indicate that the risk of depression after an abortion is no higher than after carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. The overall risk is no greater than the general population. \n \n The point is that anti-abortion proponents exaggerate the frequency of this occurence and that is dishonest.\n \n One point of yours I disagree with. I think that any woman could go to a \"pro-choicer\" for emotional support and counseling after an abortion. No qualified counselor would let her personal opinion on the legality of abortion get in the way of her professional obligation.",

Going to take a guess and assume you mean the politicalisation of science being a bad thing, and generally being bad science anyway (in that the various procedures were biased to give a specific answer before anything started). \n So Good science = fair and balanced\n Bad science = biased to give a predetermined answer\n Ugly science = the misuse and just making up kind, nazi-science type stuff.\n \n\n For whom? - Certainly not the poor patient. (It's common knowledge that most Elderly populations slow-down in almost every function, including failing to get enough physical-exercise which also contributes to \"getting fat-ter\"<-- making increased-medicating particularly dangerous for them as drugs accumulate in adipose stores. \n \nUsed the wrong word there, ment more required due to older populations suffering from a much wider range of diseases than younger people.\n \n \n\n Frankly, I don't give a hang-nail about their \"future-profit-prospects\".\nSocialised health care I'm all for, but the socialised drug research would just be a black hole to throw money down or would be neglected if in the same budget as the rest of your healthcare. They need to charge money to recoup the billions in R&D costs each drug takes, and to recoup losses on drugs that never got to market. If you want someone to put a 500 million dollars into a high risk project they are going to want to get something signficant out of it. Its the shareholders and investors you should dislike, but they are doing exactly the same everywhere else as well. \n \n\n What I have cared about/for in 33+ yrs. of helping people, live more Safe, Independent, & FUN-lives, is that they are free to do just that on *their terms* - not the terms of some pharmaceutical-Rep. \n\n \n\n Excellent! - and how do you think a condition like \"Diabetes, or \"Heart dis-ease\" or a 1,000 other variations, got that way? Or more to the point, who--<like the patient-patient her/himself<--will be in a position to \"cure their owned dis-ease\" :) \nNot sure what you are saying, that we shouldn't develop drugs for so called 'lifestyle' diseases. I'll agree that here trying to get a widescale prevention program would be ideal, but things like diabetes won't just go away once you get fit again. Seems heartless to not treat them if you can.\n \n\n Now obviously, Drugs do have their place, in certain instances like (\"Medical First-aid\" - IF you can get that when you need it). And\n also, so much of medications are Good. Ever heard of the \"Placebo-effect\"? - Yes, (especially in Double-blind studies), here read this: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=7100\n Mind-body connection in placebo surgery trial : 8 Apr 2004 - \n 12 month quality of life study with 40 Parkinson's patients shows surprising results... One patient, for example, reported that she had not been physically active for several years before surgery, but in the year following surgery she resumed hiking and ice skating. When the double blind was lifted, she was surprised to find that she had received the sham surgery...\"\n This proves, amongst other things, that *what the Mind expects, it will create as reality*<-- thus you see the phenomenal power-of-suggestion (or Orders, in the case of medicine). ~ And\nAny drug in widespread use has proven more effective than the placebo in a double bind trial. What happend to the other parkinsons sufferers though, pretty sure they weren't all hiking and ice skating whilst on the placebo. Whilst the placebo effect is very well documented, it would be wrong to assume that in all cases where someone gets better without the drug it is to do with the mind curing them. There are a large number of other factors that come into why the placebo recipient will do better than someone not in the trial, that have nothing to do with the placebos effect on the mind at all.\n \n\n it proves as well, how - using God's *self-healing abilities* He has blessed humanity with, many of our dis-eased conditions we not only create, but can heal again from as well :) \n \nWhy not use our god given intelligence and reason to design compounds make of up his creation to cure us of the diseases we've been 'blessed' with? What do you think God's self healing methods are, are we talking the bodies self healing methods or something more divine?",

   "I do have a single question though. You say you won't let a pregnancy get in the way of her life, her dreams, college or career, so on. Would you do this only in a case of rape, or any case at all? I'm curious to know since you value human life so much, I would think you wouldn't let such a thing be killed simply because of a new life change caused by voluntary actions.\n\n \n \n I know as a parent, that abortion is legal and currently is an option for women. Could you imagine if my child was raped and a pregnancy happened from it, and I told her what she must do, I would never do that.\n \n Rape is a violent, horrible crime, when I was in my twenties, if I was raped and a child was an outcome of that rape, back then I know I could never mentally muster up enough inner strength to keep a baby, without a doubt I would have had an abortion if that circumstance happend. Today though in my late 30s if that same scenario happened, I personally would keep the child. Why? Because I just view things differently.\n \n As for my daughter, if she was in that situation, I would leave the choice up to her, it doesn't matter how \"I\" feel, it matters how she can cope.\n \n Abortion doesn't kill, our thoughts do. Just like with anything else in life, cars, guns, drugs, sex, ect, all these things don't kill by themselves, they are merely tools to kill. It's what we believe and how we behave that determines our choices.\n \n Making abortion illegal or keeping abortion legal, in my mind, is not the issue. Abortion has been legal for 30 some years and I think we as an american society, let the women and men down, by keeping poor statistics and not setting up some kind of intervention and support network. What I mean is, if a million people became unemployed, we would try to reach out and address the issue and re-employ them. If a million illegal immigrants came over every year to America, we try to address the situation, we \"the government\" has taken care of them through medical attention, education, and governmental assistance, we've added spanish speaking street signs in some states, we allow them to speak spanish or english for their benefit, we do things to address a \"crisis\" that's more humane than inhumane. If a million people die in car crashes every year, then we try to address it by building better and safer cars so there will be less.\n \n We simply don't treat women getting abortions (a million plus) every year with the same compassion and respect for offering and providing tangible resources that a woman can actually use. \n \n I think with abortion, both sides are looking to be \"right\" and not trying to look at the issues, and compromise. There really is a missed opportunity here. If it were up to me, at this point in time, having abortion legal for 30 plus years, I think its best to keep abortion legal and not look at it as a law to kill other human beings, but rather as an opportunity to help women address some of the issues why they have abortion, perhaps giving an advantage to women, by providing more women services, address and provide assistance, just like we do with every other situation that happens in the millions each year.\n \n I look at a million abortions a year and say, well, how can we reduce that. Could you imagine, if we could take that number and make it 1/2 a million, then 300,000 and so on, to me that is remarkeable progress, and maybe in the process, women will have many many choices and not resort to her last choice of abortion.",

If you didn't shape her view on abortion based on your belief, then at least show her what her baby is. It would drastically change her mind if she considered it.

I can't imagine how great it would be to save hundreds of thousands of lives. But in the issue of pregnancy with abortion included, there is usually only two choice available. Have the baby killed, or kept. They can give it up for adoption later if they don't want it, but that's pretty much the 1 or the 2 of choices there.

   "I think this was eloquently and beautifully put. You are so very right; we need more focus on learning how we can reduce the number of abortions, and (should abortion turn over to become illegal) the number of women who want abortions and can't get them. I don't think anyone can disagree with this!\n \n How can we accomplish these goals? I have tried to talk to folks about this in the past, but have gotten little response. Any ideas?\n \n Caprii, are you really the same poster who started the thread \"You Folks Still Chasing Each Other's Tails\"? Did someone take over your persona? I like this Caprii much better; I even think I agree on everything you've said up here! :)\n\n \n Well thank you and yes I am that same poster. :) \n \n I liked the sentence above of \"how can we accomplish these goals...any ideas\" Like you, I've talked about this to others and NO ONE wants to come meet in the middle, to take such a stance, both sides have to acknowledge certain things and they will not. When I said my view that I'm a pro-lifer but lets leave abortion on the table, some people said I'm crazy. Yes, I know abortion is the killing of another human life, and as a pro-lifer how could I even suggest such a thing. Well, the reason I can suggest such a thing is because 30 years have gone by and approximately 30 million american babies have been lost, and the rate of speed will stay the same if we keep on doing what we have been doing, fighting a lost cause.\n \n For my own personal reasons, I did a lot of research on abortion, and I was stunned what I found, its just mind-boggling.\n \n Bell, I have many ideas, some are good, some maybe not so good, but if both sides can throw out real ideas to move forward and in a new directions, that is the most important thing to me.\n \n You asked if I have any ideas. I have plenty. I'll say some of them, but I'm not suggesting this is how it should be, I'm simply stating ideas, for you as a pro-choicers, to maybe look at it in a contructive and possible idea and maybe modify it.\n \n The sad thing is these days, both sides are suspicious of the other. I swear I have no agenda, my heart is with the mother, father and child.\n \n Did you know most abortions about 90% plus are done in abortion clinics.\n \n My idea is take the profit and stigma out of abortions. Abortion is a surgical procedure. If you're having a surgery, what ever it may be, where is the most common place we have the surgery...a hospital. So why is abortion treated differently? How many surgeries that may cause death, are done out of a hospital environment? I don't know any, do you? So why abortion? We placed a dark stigma on it that's why. In our minds, hospitals are for saving life not killing life, but hospitals have the facilities, have the medical staff, everything already in place, hospitals don't count on abortions to stay in business. \n \n If abortion is legal, let women have the same medical attention offered to her as if it were like any other surgery that may cause death. The safest place to be when having a surgical procedure done, of any kind, is the hospital.\n \n Now on the other hand, abortion clinics, do strictly abortions, making an element of needed busines to stay in busines. That is wrong. Also, keeping abortion clinics seperate from hospitals places a dark stigma on abortion. Remember the \"back ally\" where women had their abortions\" well, clinics are only a small step up from the back ally, and sends a bad image that abortions are not worthy for a hospital setting. Is that what we want? As iconic as Planned Parenthood is, the biggest abortion provider, don't women deserve the best care, and the best of care is in a facility equipped to handle any type of medical procedure, including any type of emergency procedure if it so arises, with a wide range of medical professionals. \n \n So my suggestion is that through legislation, we have hospital be required to perform abortions. It's a medical procedure for goodness sake, there shouldn't be any objection. Let a hospital be a woman's first place to seek medical attention for her surgical needs. \n \n I have other suggestions, but let me know how you feel about the above one.",

It doesn't sound like there are full-time clinics open in quite a number of states, that it is necessary for physicians to come in from other states to perform these surgeries.\n \n It is very dangerous, for example, to be an abortion-provider in Florida--or have you already forgetten the murder of a number of people in Pennsacola, Florida?\n \n Do you suffer from that convenient sort of forgetfulness?

This is clearly the medically safest route for women. It is a surgery, and abortion clinics are not equipped to handle major complications. They will cart you off to the hospital if there is a problem, and this could cost one's life. Women and all people deserve the best care and this is best performed in a hospital. It is scary as hell to know that if something happened to you, you may not be able to receive the best care immediately because of this stigma. Like you said, if it's a legal procedure, let's treat it as such.\n \n However, actually getting to this point is going to prove to be extremely difficult. Removing the stigma is never going to happen, I think, although it's becoming alleviated with more women speaking out.\n Abortions in hospitals will still have to remain a clandestine procedure, with all kinds of safeguards in place for both the patient and physician. This may also go hand in hand with women wanting some measure of privacy.\n \n So I agree-abortions should take place in hospitals. :) \n \n Now, how do we make it so less abortions occur there, too?\n \n This idea is out in left field, but I'll throw it out there because I think it'll help. \n \n Work on developing a birth control pill or shot for men. Men hate condoms, but a non-invasive method of birth control might be more up their alley. I think guys are going to be very strongly motivated to take birth control. Empower men to make choices about procreation this way. \n \n Of course, this viewpoint steps neatly away from the concept of abstinence. Not to say that abstinence isn't an excellent idea for many, many people. However, we've been promoting abstinence for years and it's not helping. Like you said, there have been millions of abortions in the past thirty years. And I think asking 20, 30 year olds to remain abstinent unless they want children is unrealistic.\n \n And, male b.c. coupled with female b.c. is surely going to but a huge inhibitor to pregnancy!\n \n And isn't it odd how women/girls meet with a stereotype of 'if they're on birth control they're loose'. So girls won't ask Mom for help b/c she doesn't want Mom to know she's having sex. But her brother, now he's 'expected' to be loose. Give him the birth control!\n \n Now...to disseminate (no pun intended) this b.c. is a whole other issue. We have to allow access to it, it has to be cheap, non-stigmatic, and we have to go about it the right way.\n \n Is that really far off? Any feedback is appreciated. Sorry I'm so long winded.",

The same way I won't trust a study from certain feminists organizations arguing that rape is a lot higher than it is (rape crisis centers on upper class college campuses make less sense to me than rape crisis centers in an poor, urban area with high rates of crime). Give me a bipartisan study, and I'll take it into consideration. :) \n \n This so-called PTSD after abortion...Have you possibly considered the fact that women who find themselves pregnant from consensual sex were often engaging in risky behavior to begin with? And that many such women (especially young women) probably already had issues that depressed them?\n \n Hullo, I'm a new member, and I don't consider abortion murder or morally wrong. But, sadly, I am also a very strange woman. I don't consider the ramifications of God and souls (neither of the two have been proven to be real, though I prefer to believe in both). To me, it's a clear-cut animal right. It's base, it's sometimes horrifying, but it's there, all the same. An embryo is not a living being. It's attached to my body, growing inside it, feeding off of it. When it can be removed and live, then it's a being.\n \n I consider abortion an animal right because, perhaps in a skewed perspective, animals generally don't go on about the offspring they kill or abandon.\n \n But back on topic. I, personally, will likely never choose to have an abortion. First off, I'm almost rabid when it comes to birth control. Two proven methods must be used at all times! emoticon_xkill Second, I am personally opposed to abortion as an option, except in health-related cases (and then it would just depend). I do not want children of my own (I will probably have my tubes tied sometime in the next few years), but I will probably end up adopting older children when I'm older (I have no tolerance for creatures I can't reason with or bully into doing my bidding, and even less for people who only want a pretty newborn baby when they are plenty of children in state care needing homes). But I am opposed to abortion as a personal option simply because the possibility that the fertilizied egg/embryo could grow into a loving child mildly disturbs me. That, and as a white female, giving up a child for adoption (difficult as that might be personally) would likely be no problem. I might even get some compensation out of it. emoticon_xgood If I gotta be a breeder, might as well get SOMETHING out of it, no?\n \n As for the rape/incest debate...since I side firmly with choice (why should some rich, white *male* politician decide what is best for me?), it's all the same. I'm for choice in the first-trimester, unsure about the second (I lean towards \"no\" except in health-related cases--I'd probably support abortion through the fourth month, but not afterwards), and absolutely oppose third-trimester abortions except in health-related cases. \n \n The funny thing is, I dislike women who engage in risky behavior and then choose abortion as an out. It smacks of stupidity and irresponsibility, and if you can't take responsibility for your behavior (yes, women should be responsible, and I say this as a woman who grew up without a father), don't have sex. I do not say this because I believe in a double-standard, but because, obviously, pregnancy has more impact on a woman's life than it does a man (they have no fetus attached to them from the inside). And if you can't handle that possibility, buy a vibrator instead. If I didn't think it'd errode choice, I'd want a law restricting abortions to women who could prove they had access to proven birth control at the time of conception (condom reciepts, birth control prescriptions, etc).\n __________________\n Be careful not to take me too seriously.",

   "(snip) I am no god. Never was, never will be. I also know that GOD does not love the 2 of us more, than any other *expectant* mother/baby. And \n let me tell you: this tiny bit of \"protection\" I provided, any other mother can provide as well. It's just a simple matter of who do you trust: GOD?, or man.\n \n Annie\n --------\n\n \n Annie, I hate to say this...But you scare me. Truly, and deeply scare me. I do not believe seven doctors visited you and tried to convince you to have an induced miscarriage, especially using the rather insulting and vile reasons you claim. (It rather looks like you took their serious, medical suggestions and reworded them in such a way as to skew perspective, making them look like heinous devils of the medical community.) Honestly, people like you working within the medical community are just...wrong. Despite your \"experience\" as a nurse, you actually claim things that have nothing to do with medicine as valid fact.\n \n Are you suggesting my grandmother, who had breast cancer, had an abortion? I don't think so. My mother, yes, but not my grandmother.\n \n You also seem to suggest that, as punishment for having an abortion, God (or some undeniable force) gave them cancer. Then there's your position that, because you trusted God, you were given a healthy daughter. So, if I'm in a similar position and trust in God, and end up with a damaged child, damage to my own health, my death or the death of my unborn fetus...Does that mean God let me down and I should curse God for such an obviously disloyal act?\n \n I support your choice, as I'd support anyone's choice, but using God, guilt and misleading \"facts\" to support your reasons disgusts me, largely because I'm pretty sure you've used, or would use, all of these to convince young women not to have an abortion. If you convinced them in any other way, I wouldn't have issue with it.\n \n That said, I'm not for invoking God on either side of the debate (though Simone's reference to God as the Supreme Abortionist was amusing). Using God as a way to slap obviously religious individuals across the face is..juvenile. And using God to justify your position is just about as bad. The Bible (I'm assuming this is the God most of you refer to) was written by men. In fact, it was written by men long after the oral stories were actually passed down, and then these stories were bound together by the young Catholic Church and called a Bible. So you saying \"God\" is against abortion is the same as me saying \"God\" wants me to kill non-believers and adulterers. Until God learns to use a pen and paper (or a cam), abortion stands as a moral and legal issue, but not a religious one (except for those who dearly love to make it such). (Anyone can use God as justification - witch hunters, murderers, jihadists...Need I continue?)

   "Okay, I know I started this thread, and I haven't visited for a looooooooooong time, but I have read what you guys have posted, and I think there are several interesting ideas here.\n \n First of all, Bell and Caprii, I think that your discussion about trying to reduce the problem of abortion (seen from a social and politicla viewpoint) is one of the best things said in this thread. I agree that ther are very few times in which both sides of the argument ever concede (and I must say I have doe this many times). Seeing the problem from a social point of view, I think your ideas about attempting to reduce the number of abortions through tactics that combine pro-choice and pro-life arguments and strategies is very sensible and coherent. \n \n However, the main problem I have with abortion is not a social or quantittive one. What I find abhorent is that it is a justification for the destructin of human life. To me the ideal society (concerning abortion) is one in which this practise is not an option, both by law and by choice. But I acknowledge that this approach is much less pragmatic than yours, which is why I commend and support it. Since I am Catholic and believe in God (although this doesn't imply that those who don't can't have similar ideas), I believe that each human life has an absolute, infinite value. This means that there is really no difference between one abortion and 1 million, no difference between a murder and a genocide. In mathematical terms, we're talking about infinite quantities (values) in all cases. So, each abortion is a terrible crime for me, regardless of how widespread or frequent the practise is. This doesn't mean that from a social point of view, 1 million abortions is much worse than one.\n \n Also, I have seen that many of you have engaged in side-debates about other topics, mainly religious ones (is there a single thread in this forum where this doesn't come up? (I know I'm among those who mention it frequently, but not ALWAYS!)). The one that I find particularly significant and interesting is the one about original sin, so I'll start a thread about it in the Religion forums.\n \n Annie, despite all that has been said and argued in this thread, I want yo say that I believe you entirely, and I thank you for sharing your experience with us. You are a person with as much authority and credibility here as any single one of the rest of us, so there is no reason for me to believe you are lying. It is none the less amusing that many in this thread have demanded that facts be given to support arguments, while at the same time you are being rudely discredited through whimsical and \"factless\" arguments. Spit Bubble (by the way, welcome), I must say that accusing someone of lying to enhance their position really doesn't say very good things about you or your arguments. I have always thought that those who start off discrediting their opponents instead of the opponent's ideas rarely have significant or compelling arguments themselves.",

   "Believe as you want, it changes not the truth of what happened. And \n yes, their reasoning was \"vile & insulting\". Quite so.\n \n so you finding it difficult to accept \"harsh reality\", you make it \"look like\" ... because you like that better. Sorry, it doesn't work that way.\n\n \n I've spoken to anti-abortionists before. My best friend (and ex) is one. He's the one who convinced me, personally, that abortion is not an out. But women like you just turn the issue into a spiritual debate, and then bring up several things that make absolutely no sense within the context of the debate.\n \n Everything I pointed out was meant to deal with logic, not a twisting of your words. When I said I didn't believe seven doctors visited you in the hospital, it's because I've been to a few hospitals in my time (both as patient and relative). Most the time, it takes several hours just to see, briefly, one doctor. And I've never heard of a doctor so interested in saving a woman's life/aborting a pregnancy that he/she would drag six other doctors to the woman's bedside to convince her it's the best choice. (Maybe *one* but not six.) In a hospital, most doctors seem to recognize the fact that they can only offer advice and let the patient do what they feel is best, even if it isn't best (the \"isn't\" part is directed at patients in general, not your state of health however many years ago).\n \n \nYes, and in as short & nice a way as I could, I told the docs (in the vernacular), to 'shut-up'. Now \n granted, their 'ego' can't take it: \n How dare I stand-UP! for *my body* they assume they own while on their turf, and \n How dare I stand-UP! for *my daughter's body* they assume they own while on their turf. Course, \n they're not used to that. They're used to people meekly complying with \"whatever you say, Doc - afterall, \n you're God\".\n \n NOT. And countless other medical docs also exist, who *Honor LIFE*, as in \"Pro-LIFE docs\". The latter wouldn't think of dis-empowering people as too many still do. (as \n 2 atty's would tell me later \"Annie, if you could ~ yes you would protect/empower each little, vulnerable person in this world, but you can't. So, you keep doing what you can, as well as you are, peaceful soul\").\n\n \n You always have the right to decide what to do with your body. Why do you think I'm pro-choice? To top it off, I haven't meekly gone with a doctor's advice since I was twelve. I always ask what their reasons are for diagnosing a condition, or recommending treatment. And if I disagree, chances are I'll get a second opinion.\n \n And, yes, it still looks like you skewed their words to fit your point. A doctor's advice, however much it upsets you, rarely has an agenda. And six doctors? Unless you went to a hospital with doctors who rabidly wanted to see all pregnancies aborted, I rather doubt it. My previous comment was not about how you reacted then, but what you claim they said. \n \n \nbut you forget to add, \"in my opinion\". \n\n \n That was implied. :)\n \n \nah, re \"valid fact\": That sort of languaging usually comes from someone least experienced/conversant with anything outside the box of the medical-Model - as if that is the \"only\" model, ably helping people live successfully. Well, sufficient people, myself included, continue proving differently... \n\n \n Not at all. I believe there's a few things outside of the medical realm that have been proven helpful. (Holistic medicine.) But that's just it...they're all *proven.* Not claimed. Not believed in. Proven.\n \n \nHow did you come to read from \"some\", to \n \"all\"?, to \"my grandmother\"??, to \"my mother\"??? <-- both generalizing & jumping to false conclusions like those, obscures meaningful messages.\n\n \n In other words, some women (and men) who develop breast cancer just developed breast cancer...while others had abortions earlier in their lives and develop it as God's wrath? Have you ever heard of science? You know, proving your theory, generally by seeing the same result in the same situation? This is why I pointed out that my grandmother, who has had breast cancer, has not had an abortion. And my mother, who had two abortions, never had breast cancer (though, I suppose, you could claim she would've if she'd lived to a ripe old age).\n \n \n\"seem\"? - are you 'sure' you understand?\n\n \n I love it when one word is an issue.\n \n \nIn the first place, I would not (because I can not) 'second-guess' God. \n Now, my faith being such (particularly as a result of my having guided successfully a number of people in their *self :) healing*), that I doubt God would do any such thing. God does not want that we \"suffer\" - far from it. In fact, you can find evidence of God's intentions for us, here now & eternally, repeatedly in the Bible.

Everything God has done, & will continue doing, is out of His perfect/unending Agape for us :), His spirit-children.\n \n I note with further interest how you wrote \"(or some undeniable force)\" - care to explore what made you write it in this way?\n\n \n I'd like to point out that \"self-healing\" does not always come by way of God. Plenty of people find it through religion, while plenty of others find it through time, psychologists or their own methods.\n \n But if you claim that several women came to understand that breast cancer developed because they'd had abortions...There's only two reasons you'd say that. Either God was punishing them, or you've found medical and scientific reason to believe that, somehow, an abortion actually causes cancer. The first, I've addressed above (and since many people who use religion as a back-up for their stand often say, \"God will punish you for...\" I rather figured that was your point.). The second...You're nuts. Maybe you should've said uterine cancer, or even ovarian cancer. Unless you can explain to me how an abortion (performed mechanically, not chemically) makes cells in the breast go haywire...? I'm all ears.\n \n Undeniable force = karma or your idea of God, which is probably different from my idea of God.\n \n \nwhoa - not quite so fast. \n Since your statements (previous to this one) obviously do not represent what I either meant, nor said, \n then \n your next statement\n does not represent my position either. Correct.\n \n (Spit-bubble: So, if I'm in a similar position and trust in God, and end up with a damaged child, damage to my own health, my death or the death of my unborn fetus...Does that mean God let me down and I should curse God for such an obviously disloyal act?)\n\n \n So sorry, I was trying to figure out why God lets some women down, and yet favored you. I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology, luck, etc. Sometimes bad things happen, sometimes good things happen. But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional...So, again, in a similar situation (trust in God, doctors say baby will be born damaged, etc), if it turns out the doctors were right, is God to blame for letting me down? Or was it, in fact, just the way things are sometimes?\n \n Or does God just randomly hear some prayers, but not others? No, no...lemme guess. \"God has a plan for us all\"?\n \n \nActually you support \"my choice\" not. - For you see, your choice of the word BUT negates your words preceding it, \n for one.\n For two, your own lack-of-understanding is causing you to feel \n \"disgust me, because I'm pretty sure\" <-- what you said here, confirms the above. And \n \n Telling & transparent is: \"So you saying \"God\" is against abortion, is the same as me saying \"God\" wants me to kill non-believers and adulterers.\"\n\n \n \"But\" is also a way to join two sentences together that could remain apart. Would you like me to reword it for you? --< \"I support your choice, as I'd support anyone's choice. However, using God, guilt and misleading \"facts\" to support your reasons disgusts me, largely because I'm pretty sure you've used, or would use, all of these to convince young women not to have an abortion.\" That better? On the other hand, if I said, \"I'd support your choice, as I'd support anyone's choice, but I still think you should've had an abortion,\" you'd be quite right.\n \n You brought God into the argument, not I. I prefer logic. I simply pointed out that *anyone* can claim God is for or against their cause, and that's been a sad, sad fact throughout history, regardless of whether or not the cause is good or bad. I'm sure many Catholic nuns believe God gave them a calling to help the poor and sick. It's a good belief, but it doesn't make it true, just the way a belief that God wants me to kill witches and non-believers doesn't make it true.\n \n \nAnnie: only by your twisted arguments. Your entire post here, is built on one false manipulation after another. And after you managed to get yourself into this fix, no wonder the above non-sense is the best you can come up with.\n \n No thank you, you've posted quite enough non-sense.\n\n \n So, when you state several things that have *no* standing in science, logic, proven fact, etc...It's fact. But when I argue differently, it's \"false manipulation\" and \"nonsense\"? Mmk.\n \n \nI have never enjoyed \"argueing\" - and \n even less: sharing with people as least willing to READ (as many in this group), \n who at the same time make it a sport acting INhumane.\n \n Thank goodness, the internut is varied enough that every-so-often - folks can be found, actually eagerly wanting to benefit from *Life abundant :)*\n \n Annie\n\n \n I enjoy a good debate, myself. :) When I say argue, I do not mean viciously fight, doll.\n \n You only wish to share/debate with people who support your position (anyone else is making it a sport to act inhumane)? Why is that? I, pro-choice, am perfectly happy willing to debate it with people who disagree. It's how I ended up *personally* against abortion to begin with (which, oddly enough, does require listening). \n \n Which reminds me, yet another reason I don't want my own children: I never want to have to face a decision that pits my pregnancy against my health and life. Either choice would leave me hollow.",

I wonder just how prevalent this is. I have more than a passing familiarity with the medical profession in general, but only a passing familiarity with the clinical side of this topic. I was unaware that it occurred at all and the only time I hear of it is from pro-life persons.\n \n This is something about which there will be no facts. It is completely unethical for a physician to coerce a patient to do anything. Thus this unethical behavior will not be documented anywhere. Therefore we have to ask, why such behavior might conceivably occur. When conclusive facts are not available, I always ask myself what incentive people might have for their behavior. \n \n I could envision a situation where an abortion could be strongly advised for the mother's health, but otherwise I can't see it. Mainly, what would be the incentive for the physician? It certainly isn't money. Most gynecologists that I know do this at great financial loss, public disapproval and harassment, and potential danger. An acquaintance of mine tells me she does it because she believes she has a duty to provide a place for women to have the procedure safely. The \"surgi-center\" she works at surely would have a financial incentive, but has little influence over at least the physician. They are lucky to get someone to work there. \n \n Why would any physician act unethically here and put undo influence on a woman to have an abortion?",

Just because someone tells me I can vote for a Democrat or a Republican doesn't mean that person is trying to manipulate me into voting for one over the other.\n \n I kind of get the feeling when dealing with a lot of pro-life people that they few anyone who believes in choice as someone who also wants abortion done willy nilly. That we advocate FOR abortion instead of FOR choice.\n\n \n I'd like to add that pro-choice is just that--in support of choice. Whether it be to abort or not is not the issue. The issue is to have these options legal, safe, and available.\n \n I think some pro-life advocates confuse pro-choice issues into being something they aren't. It's like I always said; no one \"wins\" the abortion debate.",

   "\n That is a topic perhaps we could explore: \"the manipulation \n of girls by doctors to convince them to \n abort.\"\n \n\n Since the topic of this thread is medical-murder via 'abortion', guess people wanna stick with that - \n rather than\n Re-phrase the question as: \"Manipulation by doctors, to convince them to... (whatever) \". That is another topic to explore; tho I can think of \n finer.\n Like topics that actually *encouragingly-Advance... the human-condition*, as we continue :) involved in.\n \n\n This seems to have been some persons' understanding and experience. I wonder just how prevalent this is. \n \n I have more than a passing familiarity with the medical profession in general, but only a passing familiarity with the clinical side of this topic.\n \n\n who knows what 'clinical familiarity?' that is\n \n\n I was unaware that it occurred at all \n \n\n Naivite feels nice, don't it? I continue wanting myself to Believe that \"people are only confused, they really intend no harm\". \n However, \n most medical-doctors we work with, and who - like myself - truely/genuinely are into \"Helping any who want such... achieve *enhanced Life-quality...*, (are also aware of the darker-side of medicine, where a person offers a doc \"$...dollars\", under the table). Mine was just one such example; and it occurs more than people want to think, and for different reasons. Again, done for a 'monetary pay-off'. \n \n\n and the only time I hear of it is from pro-life persons.\n \n\n Just couldn't resist putting this, in here - could you. \n \n \n This is something about which there will be no facts. It is completely unethical for a physician to coerce a patient to do anything. Thus this unethical behavior will not be documented anywhere. Therefore we have to ask, why such behavior might conceivably occur. When conclusive facts are not available, I always ask myself what incentive people might have for their behavior. I could envision a situation where an abortion could be strongly advised for the mother's health, but otherwise I can't see it. Mainly, what would be the incentive for the physician? It certainly isn't money. \n \n\n The operant statement here, was: \"I can't see it\". Or \n as expressed elsewhere: 'I'm not taking my blinders off'. \n And\n you've got this right: \"It is completely unethical for a physician to coerce a patient to do anything\". - so, that being the case, why is this s*** (plus related 'procedures', 24/7 going on??)\n \n \n Why would any physician act unethically here, and put undo influence on a woman to have an abortion?\n \n\n Were you aware that \"Practicing medicine... is a business-for-profit\".\n \n As well it should be, for our friends :) the *Medical-doctors who, like I reverenced above, are Helping any who want such... achieve *enhanced Life-qualities...*\n \n Annie",

   "Why would this be any of your business?\n \n Do I ask you about the medical care you've received?\n\n Wow what an absolutely ridiculous reply. What a cowardly attempt to hide from some of the best logic I've seen posted on the abortion thread ever.\n \n Well, simone, did she ask your name? Your SSN? Your DOB? Your residence? Does she have any idea who you are? So why reply with this garbage?\n \n My response to the initial post is that, as a male, I cannot say for certain. I will admit that upfront. And thus, being that I am against abortion, my opinion is sure to be \"slanted.\" However, in the situation of having a gestating fetus inside my body, I can only imagine I would find abortion to be, at the very least, mildly disturbing. Furthermore, I cannot imagine myself ever forgetting such a decision, or being able to stop myself from wondering what would have happened if my decision were reversed. From what I understand, abortion causes certain hormonal imbalances in females beyond the normal pregnancy roller-coaster. It generally tends to cause a great deal of anxiety, from what I understand. Thus I will discount my immediate post-abortion feelings. Prior to, however, I feel that I would question whether or not there was a sanctity that I was defying. I cannot escape my present bias, but if I wasn't aborted, what right do I have to abort? I recieved life, why ought I take it away? The only circumstances I can imagine myself aborting are if my life was in danger and there was significant peer pressure to go on with the abortion from close friends/family.\n \n Bravo to the thread-starter on connecting subjective opinion to objective truth, by the way.",

I decided at 10 to live a life of celibacy because so much human suffering is related to desires of the flesh.\n \n However... if I was raped and became pregnant, I'd go to the hospital, get a rape kit done, hopefully provide enough evidence to send the bastard to jail, and they generally give you medications to stop any potential pregnancies at this time. There are, however, the odd cases where the medication doesn't prevent a pregnancy and the woman becomes pregnant. Many women have screwy menstrual cycles, especially those that train or exercise a lot, so even though a lot of people like to think all women know themselves like clockwork, it's not so.\n \n If I became pregnant despite early intervention, I'd abort as long as the embryo wasn't yet at a stage of development to produce brain waves and feel pain.\n \n After this point, I'd probably keep the embryo and try to counsel myself into accepting the child as an innocent being and just as deserving of love as any other innocent being.\n \n AAW",
