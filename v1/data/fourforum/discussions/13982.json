   "David Kopel explains: \nSome clarification here. Heller never adopted a \"reasonable regulation\" standard. Heller allows for machine gun bans under theory that they are not part of the Second Amendment (that is, they are not Second Amendment \"arms\"). Restrictions on gun carrying in \"sensitive places\" are not explained doctrinally, but they are easily comparable to First Amendment \"time, place, and manner\" rules. Heller says that concealed carry may be banned; in the states, the dominant theory for this restriction was that concealed carry was not part of the right. Finally, Heller's allowance for conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of guns was expressed without being described as part of some kind of \"reasonableness\" test.\n \n Feldman was astute to cite Winkler's Michigan Law Review article, since that article argued that state RKBA cases use a \"reasonableness\" standard, which Winkler interprets as meaning that almost any anti-gun laws (including a handgun ban) are alright, as long as people are allowed to own some type of firearm.\n \n In a forthcoming Santa Clara Law Review article, Clayton Cramer and I argue that Winkler overstates the degree of state judicial deference to anti-gun laws; we also argue that the weak standard of review cases are plainly invalid as Second Amendment guides post-Heller-since the D.C. ban itself would have been upheld under the standard Winkler describes (and for which he advocated in a Heller amicus brief along with Erwin Chemerinsky).\n \n In McDonald, BTW, Winkler joined the all-star professors team whose amicus brief advocated for Privileges or Immunities enforcement of the right to arms.\n \n",

Those sales are legal in Wisconsin and they are the source of the vast majority of crime guns ... about 90% of crime guns in Wisconsin and nationwide come from this secondary market.\" \n \n Addressing this loophole, she says, is imperative to reducing the firearm homicide rate. \"It's amazing to me that we're asking the question 'how are these criminals getting guns?' when we're not even trying to prevent them,\" she said.\n Study Suggests Additional Background Checks Deter Gun Deaths",

   "At a Glance\n \n &#8226; Under current federal law, loopholes in the background check system have created an enormous unregulated, secondary gun market: An estimated 40% of gun transactions legally occur with no background check, no identification and no record of the sale.\n &#8226; This unregulated market is a key source of guns for criminals. A study found that 80% of inmates got their guns from secondary market sources. Nearly 90% of traced crime guns changed hands at least once after the last known retail sale.\n &#8226; The secondary market is a source of guns for other high-risk individuals, such as young people. In Southeastern Wisconsin, 18, 19, and 20 year olds accounted for more than 30% of all the handgun homicide suspects. This high-risk group can legally acquire guns in the secondary market, even though they are prohibited from doing so in the primary gun market.\n &#8226; The current background check system can easily be extended to all gun transfers. Transactions between private parties can be conducted by licensed gun dealers, who can require identification, initiate a background check and maintain paperwork, just as they do now for their own sales.\n &#8226; The background check system could be made even more effective by prohibiting additional high-risk individuals from purchasing guns and by maintaining a record of all gun transfers, which would give law enforcement a powerful crime-fighting tool.\n &#8226; Some states have already improved their systems by regulating some or all private gun sales. On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.\n &#8226; 92% of all Americans, including 91% of gun owners, are in favor of criminal background checks for all gun purchases.\n \n http://www.waveedfund.org/uploads/WAVE_report_Improving_CBC_System_secure.pdf",

   "At a Glance\n \n \u0095 Under current federal law, loopholes in the background check system have created an enormous unregulated, secondary gun market: An estimated 40% of gun transactions legally occur with no background check, no identification and no record of the sale.\n\n \n Is that a fact Tom Diaz? Wasn't these the same facts you formerly b- - - - - - about not knowing the source of the gun because checks were NOT available to police depts? Strange lies make stranger charges.\n \n \n\u0095 This unregulated market is a key source of guns for criminals. A study found that 80% of inmates got their guns from secondary market sources. Nearly 90% of traced crime guns changed hands at least once after the last known retail sale.\n\n \n The 9 justices didn't seem impressed with your statistics and no one else is either. Stolen guns is a secondary market and federal agencies are a main source. Strange that a traced gun not used in a crime comprises...........wait for it....about 90% of all traces run. Testimony by the ATF head honcho admitted they took valuable time and were worthless and interfered with investigations.\n \n \n\u0095 The secondary market is a source of guns for other high-risk individuals, such as young people. In Southeastern Wisconsin, 18, 19, and 20 year olds accounted for more than 30% of all the handgun homicide suspects. This high-risk group can legally acquire guns in the secondary market, even though they are prohibited from doing so in the primary gun market.\n\n \n Those \"high risk\" 18-20 year olds are issued guns in employment of police work and in the military. There is no law barring 18 year olds from buying rifles and shotguns or possesing anything accompanied by an adult like family. Hunters are eligeble to hunt at 12 after taking hunter safety in a stand by themselves or however else they are hunting. There is no prohibition in the primary gun market. Texas clearly states that an 18 year old can legally carry a handgun and get a concealed permit if he is a member of the military or police and is currently active or honorably discharged.\n \n \n\u0095 The current background check system can easily be extended to all gun transfers. Transactions between private parties can be conducted by licensed gun dealers, who can require identification, initiate a background check and maintain paperwork, just as they do now for their own sales.\n\n \n Unfunded mandates - see Printz! I don't believe this will have a snowball's chance of surviving even a passing whiff on a RIGHT. Fees nor license can be demanded to exercise a right freely stated in the Constitution.\n \n \n\u0095 The background check system could be made even more effective by prohibiting additional high-risk individuals from purchasing guns and by maintaining a record of all gun transfers, which would give law enforcement a powerful crime-fighting tool.\n\n \n All the record needs is already done and must be destroyed by FBI/ATF within 30 days. Dream on. The places this has been tried has been expensive and never helped solve a case. I give you New York and Canada. Complete failure with Canada spending over 2 (two Billion dollars on that failure. Registration is unConstitutional, that is why we have the insta check.\n \n \n\u0095 Some states have already improved their systems by regulating some or all private gun sales. On average, the states that have done the most to regulate private gun sales appear to have lower firearm death rates and lower firearm homicide rates.\n\n \n States with the most draconian laws have the highest crime rates and homocide rates. Regulation of a right won\\'t pass muster.\n \n \n\u0095 92% of all Americans, including 91% of gun owners, are in favor of criminal background checks for all gun purchases.\n\n \n I doubt that and so did the SCOTUS Justices in the oral arguments. They thumbed their collective noses at statistics. They know what they are worth, zilch.\n \n http://www.waveedfund.org/uploads/WAVE_report_Improving_CBC_System_secure.pdf[/QUOTE]",

If you're trying to convince us that the DROS somehow doesn't amount to registration then you're going to have to try a whole lot harder than that.\n \n Anytime you have a database that lets you find a person's name, address, and the number of guns they own then it's registration, no matter how vague it might be.\n \n Let's take a look at what Bryan pointed out regarding the DROS in this thread: \"The DROS form itself which is submitted by the dealer to the \"Automated Firearms Unit\" (AFU) lists the name, identifiers, and address of the purchaser in addition to either the exact number of long guns or the make/model/serial number of handguns.\"\n \n Name, address, number of guns purchased.

But you're still supporting it's use despite this fact.\n \n If these DROS records really are destroyed after 15 days, what's the point in having the DROS system in the first place? What's the justification for giving the attorney general access to a database of registered and documented transactions, if the information can only exist for 15 days, and anything longer than that is illegal?\n \n Looking over the California DOJ site, it specifically mentions that the dealer has to maintain the DROS records for three years. So even if the AG has to destroy their copy of the transaction records, the hard copies will continue to exist.\n \n And then there's all the talk about the fee that has to be charged by the dealer for the DROS...\n \n \nThat means no \"list\" for your imaginary house to house round up.\n\n \n Sorry.

To quote an old judge I practiced in front of before he passed: \"I'm not always right, but I'm never in doubt.\" I still think it is registration. A citizen can send a form to \"Automated Firearms Unit\" to request information about how many guns he/she is registered to own. The citizen lists his/her name, address, and (optionally) a phone number on the form. The form is here: http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/AFSPrivateCitizen.pdf\n \n Therefore, it is clear to me that an official with the AFU can type in a person's name and address and produce a computer print-out listing every gun registered to that person. For handguns, the list should be specific enough to list make/model/caliber/serial number. For long guns, the list should tell the official the exact number of guns registered to that person-without the ability to list make/model/serial number. It may be we are only arguing semantics over the definition of the word \"registration.\" I envision a search of Mr. A's name would produce a computer list showing, for example, that he is supposed to currently possess 5 long guns, a Kimber CDPII .45acp handgun serial number abc1234, a S&W .357 magnum revolver serial number pqr5678, and a Glock model 29 .40 handgun model number xyz7890. Now we can say that for long guns the AFU database may only be able to produce a raw number of guns registered to a person, but with that one exception the California system appears to waddle and quack like the registration duck it is. And, assuming for the sake of argument that this system would survive incorporation of the RKBA, then how long would it be before the Brady Campaign asserts a dire need to close the \"long gun registration loophole\" to register exact make/model/serial numbers of those guns?\n \n Let me make my position clear on registration. I do not believe SCOTUS would hold that registration violates the 2nd. Amendment. However, the purpose of registration is to prevent disenfranchised persons (felons, the mentally ill, etc.) from having guns-these are the persons we want to know about. The problem with registration is you cannot force these persons to register guns they possess-not because it violates the 2nd. Amendment, but because it violates the 5th. Amendment's right against self-incrimination (a right incorporated against the states long ago by application of the 14th. Amendment's \"due process\" clause-and after hearing about the arguments in McDonald it appears the 2nd. Amendment RKBA will join that club of fundamental rights soon).",

They start by asking for an seemingly unintuitive law that pertains, in this case, to handguns, with EVERY intention of claiming loophole for the rest at some later date. \n \n That is EXACTLY what they have done with every infringement we grant them. They have ZERO Rights against our 2nd Amendment Right to keep and bear arms. ZERO. Then they come hat in hand saying that this is all we want. Come on. Be Reasonable. Compromise. Please give us just this, then after we do grant them an intrusion into our Right, they then turn around on the Constitution and say THESE FILTHY SCUM BAGS HAVE A LOOPHOLE! (That was NOT a shot at you Sinjin, but don't worry, I am coming to you next.)\n \n Want proof that this is always the way it goes? Just 2 days ago, the Supreme Court gave every indication that our RIGHT was going to be declared Fundamental, and it applies to the city, state, and other local governments as well to the Federal Government, and just yesterday Sinjin was demanding more of our Fundamental Rights! \n \nAddressing this loophole, she says, is imperative to reducing the firearm homicide rate. \n\n I ask, when is enough enough? When will the Antis start to respect the Constitution? \n \n We have already granted all of these.   It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America.  \n Plus we have given them all of the high profile Federal laws on the books, from Gun HATING Clinton Administration.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3.

When you got called on it by skeptical people (which included most here and myself), Bryan laid it out for you nice, neat, and clean and showed you it was just another form of registration.

More like \"me no Alamo, Me no Goliad\". \n \n \nHandguns were registered in CA prior to the DROS system being instituted.\n\n \n Uh, yeah, that is the point. They are still registered by DROS also...as Bryan pointed out...and like a good kalifornian you imagine to be, you still support it.\n \n Here is a little history lesson for you courtesy of Jeff Snyder posted on survivalblog.com.\n [QUOTE]\"... [M]any gun owners readily concede that their right to keep and bear arms is \"not absolute\" and is subject to \"reasonable\" regulation. This concession to moderation or reasonableness is fatal to the right. Yes, there are people who should not have guns. However, the point of the Second Amendment is precisely to deny government the power to decide who those people are, just as the point of the First Amendment is to deny government the power to decide what you may read and hear. Rights are not reasonable, and are not to be made reasonable, because government itself is not reason; it is force.\" - Jeff Snyder\n \n Governments in the last century killed more innocent citizens than all the wars combined.\n \n Can you wrap you head around the concept of what a RIGHT is? So far you have indicated the disinclination to consider any views but your own even over the FF statements and THE DOCUMENT itself. Government does not have the power to infringe on RIGHTS period. Jefferson warned if anyone were to break those sacred rights we should \"rush tumulteously to ARMS! It is not subject to majority vote as you have been told repetievly. It is not in the government's powers as much as you would like to control everything despite the citations you have been shown by Tither and proof from history. You have lost all symbalence of credibility and all arguments you have made based on facts and history and dismissal with proof and intent of THE DOCUMENT.\n When one of the Justices (Ginsberg I believe?) tried to introduce Australia, England/UK, and Canada as \"equal democratic governments\" that was rebuked by Scalia and Roberts who pointed out they had no Constitutional protections. Ergo, they were not Republican institutions who/which maintained RIGHTS.\n \n Son, if you like it over there haul Away! You sound like another country reject trying to turn America into the stink hole they left or like the kalifornians who move to other States, mainly because of the tax issue, then try to duplicate what they left thinking it just hasn't been tried by the right people yet.

   "Nothing at all. \n \n You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA? \n I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely. \n \n I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.\n\n \n Open carry is gaining momentum in Michigan, so who knows? And the I smell posers comment...well, I'll just say that I think you're jumping to a premature conclusion.\n \n I'm catching up on this thread and have a few more pages to go, but I wanted to address this comment before I go on. Most of us who openly carry in Michigan, are licensed to conceal, but we are carrying openly to promote the concept. Let me note that I, too, believe that openly carrying an unloaded firearm is asking for trouble. I can't see how it could make any situation safer, with it taking seconds to load a gun and get it into battery. Luckily we carry loaded here, which drastically changes the dynamics. When one can go from either concealment or a side holstered weapon to putting holes in a center mass in under a second, that's an effective deterrent.

   "Open carry is gaining momentum in Michigan, so who knows? And the I smell posers comment...well, I'll just say that I think you're jumping to a premature conclusion.\n \n I'm catching up on this thread and have a few more pages to go, but I wanted to address this comment before I go on. Most of us who openly carry in Michigan, are licensed to conceal, but we are carrying openly to promote the concept. Let me note that I, too, believe that openly carrying an unloaded firearm is asking for trouble. I can't see how it could make any situation safer, with it taking seconds to load a gun and get it into battery. Luckily we carry loaded here, which drastically changes the dynamics.

If you have the Chops! Maybe they will take that under advisement! emoticon_smile \n \n  Klein v. Leis, 99 Ohio St.3d 537, 2003-Ohio-4779. \n {\u00b67} Today, we reiterate that the right to bear arms is fundamental. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. (Sorry, superfluous I know, but I just had to include that part) \n \n {\u00b610} In State v. Nieto ... The court stated, \"The statute does not operate as a prohibition against carrying weapons, but as a regulation of the manner of carrying them\" and found the concealed-weapons statute to be a \"proper exercise of the police power of the state.\n \n \n {\u00b615} The General Assembly has determined that prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons helps maintain an orderly and safe society. We conclude that that goal and the means used to attain it are reasonable. We hold that R.C 2923.12 does not unconstitutionally infringe the right to bear arms; there is no constitutional right to bear concealed weapons. \n \n {\u00b624} Under intermediate scrutiny, a regulation will be upheld only if the \n regulation is narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest and \n leaves open other means of exercising the right ..... Further, the state correctly asserts that the statute leaves open the ability to bear arms by openly carrying a firearm, satisfying the third prong of the test. \n \n ........Going to another part of the ruling......... \n \n {\u00b626} .. \u00b6 17. The majority opinion also inadvertently demonstrates that requiring the accused to prove a constitutional right as an affirmative defense is problematic: \n \n ..... \u00b6 17. A statute that permits arresting a citizen without regard for whether he is exercising a fundamental right, and encumbers the citizen with the burden of proof, is not narrowly tailored. Cf. Reno v. Am. Civ. Liberties Union (1997), 521 U.S. 844, 882, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (\"We agree with the District Court's conclusion that the CDA places an unacceptably heavy burden on protected speech, and that the defenses do not constitute the sort of 'narrow tailoring' that will save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision\").\n \n {\u00b627} Under the current statutory scheme, an officer need not be \n concerned with whether the accused is engaged in a constitutionally protected, i.e., lawful, activity at the time of arrest. Rather, a person can be arrested anytime when carrying a concealed weapon, even if doing so for the constitutionally protected purposes of defense and security. This creates an unavoidable chilling effect on the free exercise of the right to bear arms for defense and security. \n \n \n {\u00b628} Moreover, the opportunity for the accused to establish that he was exercising a fundamental right does not justify subjecting him to arrest each time he exercises the right. This is as offensive as a statute allowing the arrest of anyone who speaks in public, but permitting the speaker to prove at trial that the speech was constitutionally protected. See, e.g., Houston v. Hill (1987), 482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398. An otherwise unconstitutional statute is not constitutional solely because it provides that a citizen may point to the Constitution in his defense at trial. The arrest itself violates the fundamental right. By authorizing the arrest, R.C. 2923.12(C) treats \" 'a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct' \" as unlawful. Id. at 458, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 \n L.Ed.2d 398. \n \n {\u00b629} To be narrowly tailored, a statute must place the burden on the \n state to prove that the accused was not exercising the constitutionally protected, fundamental right to bear arms for security and defense. If the constitutionally\n\n Say hello to my little friend! \n \n Kind of takes the starch out of the Terry Stops discussion too. No?",

   "It IS most common for Mr. or Mrs. Smith to assume that someone wearing a sidearm is a cop, off-duty or whatever. Police know better, and I think they recognize the goatee as not police-issue. I agree that the police shouldn't assume anything. They especially shouldn't assume that someone wearing a sidearm is breaking or about to break the law(s). In fact, the Michigan AG says that the carrying of a holstered firearm alone doesn't constitute RAS (reasonably articulated suspicion) or PC (probable cause) for a terry stop. The criminal element just doesn't openly carry. That may change as more civi's start OCing but as of now, that's the way it is (and should stay).\n \n From experience, I'll tell you the most common reactions to OC: 1st most common reaction is none at all. You'd be surprised to know just how many people don't even notice it. The 2nd most common reaction is the assumption that the OCer is an LEO. Lastly, you're recognized as a civi who's enjoying the RTKBA. I've recieved nods from LEOs, no more and no less. I was once stopped and thanked for \"what I do\" by an elderly woman. I told her \"I'm not a policeman\" and she replied with \"Oh. Well thank you for making me feel safe anyway\"... which was followed up by a nice conversation about OC.\n \n I'd never want an LEO to \"let his guard down\" around someone who's visibly carrying or at any other time. An LEO should be just as alert to an open carrier as he would be to someone who might be concealing. Just because you don't see a gun on someone doesn't mean it's not there. In a sense, an LEO might be little more concerned with someone who he doesn't see a firearm on, since the display of an openly carried gun is somewhat indicative that the person carrying it doesn't have anything to hide.",
