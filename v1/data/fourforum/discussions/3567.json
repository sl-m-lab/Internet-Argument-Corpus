   "A Final Appeal: Anybody But Bush!\n \n The presidential election is right around the corner and -- guess what? -- the American people once again have no real choice for President of the United States of America. No candidate is really worth the vote of one American but I can say without the least hesitation that no candidate deserves defeat more than George Bush, who is the clearest example of a traitor to the American people since the time of Benedict Arnold.\n ...\n Long before Bush brought to power the cabal of Jewish neocon forces, they had made clear that they supported an American war against Iraq. But it was not for America that Perle, Wolfowitz, Feith, and Wurmser supported the war. They had collaborated on a report called \"Securing the Realm,\" a paper written for Jewish extremist Benjamin Netanyahu. The report unabashedly proposed an Iraq war as a war for the strategic interests of Israel. Now let me repeat that. The main Jewish architects of the war on Iraq supported the war long before the allegations of \"weapons of mass destruction\" as a war critical for Israel.\n \n This band of traitors, in collusion with neocon sympathizers in the media, launched this war by a litany of lies and deceptions. If Americans were going to foot the cost of this war to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars (the equivalent of thousands of dollars for every working family in the United States), at the cost of thousands of maimed or killed American troops, at the cost of making the United States hated by millions, increasing the ranks of the terrorists, and becoming the target for terrorists all over the world -- they had to lie and say that America faced an \"imminent threat\" from Iraq.\n ...\n Both Bush and Cheney in their respective debates said that the world and Americans are safer since the toppling of Saddam Hussein's government. Let me tell George Bush something, those boys in Iraq are Americans too! And their pain is our pain, their suffering is America's suffering. They have families and loved ones and they shouldn't be maimed or be dying for damned lies! Tell the thousands of Americans who will fall victim to terrorists in the upcoming years because of this insane war that they were made \"safer\" by it.\n \n Continued (text) :\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3985\n \n \n Or, listen to the audio version of this essay while you surf:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com:8000/content/dd/anybodybutBush.pls\n (streaming MP3)\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/mp3/anybodybutBush.mp3\n (download MP3)\n \n \n \n .",

   "do you find it pathetic that the top reason for Kerry is that he is not Bush?\n\n \n Yes, however, there is a ABK going around as well. Many liberterians, as well as conservatives are finding it VERY hard to find reasons to vote for Bush, other then that they loathe the idea of a President Kerry. It goes both ways. \n \n The fact that ABB is around says much about how well our president is doing, the fact that people are willing to vote anyone but bush into office is a manifestation of how badly people think Bush is as a president. The distrubing issue is that people blow ABB off without thinking about why it exists and what it really means. \n \n \nWhen Tommy Franks was asked about it, he said he had never said anything along those lines.\n\n \n iIt's called \"I don't recall, well, I do, but I'm not going to help you by admitting it.\" Besides, I can't even remember what I said an hour ago much less several months or a year or two ago. Don't expect Franks to as well. Just because 1) they don't remember or 2) they don't want to admit it, that it didn't happen.",
