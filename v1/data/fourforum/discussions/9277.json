People should be paid a wage that will allow them to support their families. Capitalism is an evil unfair system that rewards theft, cheating, and the enslavement of the poor. As a christian your main focus should be one of helping the poor and those less fortunate in society; not worrying about the status of your wealth. When was the last time you donated anything to a food bank?

It is hard to go to school if you are living in a cardboard box; not to mention the high cost of higher education. I know many people who are making minimum wage they do not make a good living. They work 40 hours and barely make enough to make the rent. Which is in some cases 1000$ or more a month. I know many people who are having trouble paying for gas to get to work. I know many people who are having trouble feeding their families even though they are working 40 or more hours a week. I know many corporations that the first thing they cut is the work force or hours in order to make more profits. They never cut the upper management.

Second, the terrorists wouldn't be bombing anybody if we hadn't provoked them. They would be practically dormant. But of course, EZ and other Christain Conservatives view Muslims as sub-human and could care less about them. The fact is, none of this would've happened if we had not gone into Iraq. There would be thousands alive today. Do you know how much money we spent on this war? Trillions. Trillions that could've been used to find a cure for cancer, to feed the starving children in Africa, to provide welfare for our OWN country's poor men, women, and children. But no, we spent it on mutilating and bombing innocent Muslims, and achieving nothing in the terrorist department. It lead to a great financial debt in america, and the deaths of thousands of American soldiers. What are you going to tell the mothers of those 3,000 boys and girls? We've accomplished nothing, and we're failing. Iraq is falling into chaos, and the terrorists have only gotten stronger. The #1 Al Queda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Taliban, etc. recruter is GEORGE WALKER BUSH.

   " Biblical literalists have the right to think so. However, you live in a country that separates religion from politics, don't you?\n\n \n Most of us don't separate Godly morals from our country's institutions. Never have. If you think we do you don't know America.\n \n \n Imagine some hypothetical future in which ultra-orthodox Jews control the US government. Would they be justified in forbidding you to work on Saturdays, on religious grounds?\n\n \n Hypothetical. However, Orthodox Jews wouldn't approve of gay marriage either.\n \n \n Ah, so now we're looking for an excuse to control other people's lives because they may have unhealthy lifestyles.\n\n \n Hey - they can go out in the woods and say their vows for all I care. We're just not going to legitimize sodomy / gay marriage.\n \n \n \n Funny how the RR rail against the 'nanny state' when it threatens to restrict their freedoms, but invoke it so self-righteously when they want to restrict the freedoms of others.\n\n \n Funny how you're always on the wrong side of God and still want life and liberty. As our founding fathers wrote, these liberties come from our Creator - not from some morally debased gaggle of infidels.",
