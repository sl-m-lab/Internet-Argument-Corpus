We are all made in the image of God. We are living icons.\n \n In saying that all life is sacred, I know that if I were to stand by and let you suffer death, if I could intervene, then I'd be just as guilty of muder as the person attacking you.\n \n So sometimes this is a matter of weighing up one life against another... this is touched upon by Jesus who talks about a man who gives up his life for his brother.... when there is clear prohibition against suicide. Therefore, losing your own life on purpose is itself not suicide, but losing it for a 'cause' is glorious.\n \n I know that the Old Testament talks of a time to kill and a time to heal.",

I was under the impression that the death penalty was still a viable method of punishing injustice according to the Bible.\n\n \n It is, I think. I am not in the position of having to carry it out, and hope I never am. All of the apostles (except John) died as martyrs without fighting the ones who killed them. \n \n God does say, in the bible, and I don't remember exactly where, that if a person continues to live in sin as a believer even after correction, there could come a point where God will allow his life to be taken to prevent him from living in that state any longer. Likewise, God instituted Governments and laws and they were for the protection of society. I personally am against every form of life taking (for humans) but I do not know what I would do if confronted with someone about to rape my wife. I just might take a life.\n \n God's perspective is an eternal one. Many of the church teachers have not taken on that perspective and still seem dimly. Much of the church teaches the forgiveness and love of God to bring people in and then the anger and wrath of God if they don't then stay the course. This is simply not true. God is God and He is Love. Period.",

It is easy to be pacific when others are doing the fighting.\n \n I do believe in the sanctity of life, but that also means that I must protect life. IF I were to stand by as people attacked my mother, then I'd be taking the moral high-ground of pacisfism, but I'd also be a coward.\n \n It is a perplexing issue.\n \n I believe that Jesus liberated us from strict adherence to laws... the Jews were bogged down in this... arguing if the Sabbath was holy, what would they do if a mule fell down a well on the Sabbath, etc. etc.\n \n For instance... if you were in need of an ambulance, I would not hesitate to break into a house, if I needed to use that phone to call the ambulance. Breaking and entering is immoral, and illegal, but we must sometimes make hard choices.\n \n Fortunately God loves us.",

The amount of women who died pre-legal abortions is staggering. You would lose both the woman and the child, and rich women would still be able to afford better 'backyard' abortions, thus making it a class issue.\n \n Education of pregnancy prevention is important.\n \n Here in Australia women are entitled to reasonable child payments ... this is in turn abused by some women who become single parents specifically to get the money (and they still love their children)... but the government takes some care for them.",

Do you kill someone to prevent a murder?\n \n You think abortion is murder yet_you're_not_anti_abortion. emoticon_cry\n *head explodes*\n\n \n I'll look at the last statement first. I should re-state it. I am against abortion, because it is murder, however I am not against people having abortions because of the reasons I stated earlier; viz. that you'd be assuredly killing both mother and child when she undertakes backyard abortions.\n \n It is a dilemma, because it is judging one life's worth against another... or in some cases against two others.\n \n Yet at the same time if it were necessary for me to kill someone in order to protect someone I am making that judgment.\n \n I believe for instance that I have a duty of care, even beyond the legal concept.\n \n If I saw a child drowning, and I could help, then I think that I should... even though I'm possibly putting my own life at stake, and also that child may have no relationship of kinship with me... but I'd still feel obliged to help.\n \n It is a very difficult matter, and I thank God, that God is the ultimate judge in this, and not you or I. It is not a job I'd want.\n \n I think to this is the demonstration that legalism is a dangerous path to take.\n \n Orthodoxy isn't a rational-legalistic religion. It is against the grain for Westerners... but we just have to accept some things... otherwise you'll do your head in trying to work out all the little 'ifs' and 'buts' of this.\n \n My only advice...\n Act in good faith, and with purity of heart, put your faith in Christ, and listen to his message.",

Do you kill someone to prevent a murder?\n \n You think abortion is murder yet_you're_not_anti_abortion. emoticon_cry\n *head explodes*\n\n \n NO. \n The question is asked of ethics students. Given the opportunity would you abort the baby Hitler. The ethics student would respond no. If the answer yes is ever derived then the question becomes what sin is so great that we may go back in time and abort. This places man at equal footing with God.\n \n Now the logical question next is what about self defence or that of your family. This question needs placed in another catagory. Attempt of Murder To protect a person from this attempt is admirable. To kill the assalant in the process is tragic, but sometimes nessisary.\n \n I believe aborthion is murder, however right now the government feels diffrently. To kill someone for performing abortion makes me a murderer. The great thing about God's justice is it is perfect and the abortionist will be judged by that critreion latter.",
