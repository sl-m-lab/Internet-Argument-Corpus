The only support he provides for that claim is the letter from the FedSoc, which he claims shows what \"really happened\". If the letter is biased, than it doesn't show what really happened, and so Steve's proof collapses. Therefore the bias or lack thereof of the letter is key. Get it?",

The article is not saying that Scalia went out there just to have fun. If acknowledges that he lectured there. The point is that he's lending his name, and the weight of his office, to a political organization. The point of the weekend was to give conservative movers and shakers access to a Supreme Court Justice, a very conservative one. If the article overemphasizes the recreational aspects of the trip, the FedSoc letter overemphasizes the scholarly. The truth, as I've said all along, lies in between. Scalia assisting a highly partisan organization in this manner is, to my mind, ethically questionable. The fact that he blew off the confirmation makes it a bit worse. The article does segue from Scalia lecturing at this luxury resort to dicussing perks in general, and the transition isn't clear. A bad call on the part of ABC, sure. But it doesn't amount to \"Liberal Media Bias\", nor does it excuse Scalia. ABC legitimately pointed out questionable behavior, and now it seems that the conservative spin machine is trying to \n reshape it into being just about tennis. And, if I may repeat myself, you have produced nothing from any source that could make even the vaugest claim to neutrality that says otherwise. If you're going to keep crying \"liberal bias\" you gotta come up with something other than conservative bias to back it up.\n \n \n \n\n It amazes me that someone would even defend ABC for doing this.

   "It is ethically questionable to teach a class that has been accredited by 30 states (the states where the lawyers came from)? It is ethically questionable to not go to a swearing in cermony because a judge made a commitment a year in advance to teach a class and by the time they knew of the swearing in the event was all but started? This is a clear example of media bias. IF you can't see that then I don't know what is wrong. If you mislead people into thinking this trip was a \"perk\" then you might be a fool. \n \n \nIf you're going to keep crying \"liberal bias\" you gotta come up with something other than conservative bias to back it up.\n Then just look at the facts. What was Scalia actually doing? This is not in dispute. What did the story focus on? \n \n It focused on this: \n \"High Court, High Living\n No ethics rules can keep justices from enjoying free gifts, trips and perks.\"\n \n The mention Abramoff and stress how he DIDN'T pay for it. Since when should you have to pay to TEACH a seminar? They stress it as a fancy hotel. They say that one guy is a legal expert regarding ethics (failing to mention he is a hardcore liberal law professor) but they did mention that the 1 quote from the other guy was made by a person who is a member of the federalist society. \n \n Have you ever had a seminar before? All lawyers have have a certain amount of credit hours for continuing education every year. I actually have the same thing for being a CPA and my father does for being a psychologist. Now, I don't pay to go to a seminar because my employer normally gets the tab. The speaker is normally paid by the person hosting the event...this is common practice. IN fact, my father was asked to speak to some doctors and the group putting it on foot the bill. So this is not abnormal nor is it dubious ethical behavior. The one quote from the Federalist society guy was not stressed enough but the federalist society is not going up before the court so there is no independence problem. Not only that, Scalia had a 300+ page report that the people had to read and he taught. That seems a little much for someone that went there just to drink at social hour and play tennis. \n \n This report was just biased and the facts are clear. I'll admit when media is bias on either side....why can't any of you do the same?",

This is a clear example of media bias. IF you can't see that then I don't know what is wrong. If you mislead people into thinking this trip was a \"perk\" then you might be a fool. \n\n The problem, as I have said, is that Scalia was not there to just \"teach a class\", as you put it. Supreme Court Justices do not generally go around \"teaching classes\". Nor is the focus of the FedSoc continuing education. The purpose of the FedSoc is to develop, refine, and propogate their conservative agenda. If Scalia is giving a members only lecture to the FedSoc at a luxury hotel, you can reasonably guess that the point is not fullfilling continuinig education requirements. It's a reasonable guess that Scalia was there to educate FedSoc members about certain talking points for future politcal debates. That's the ethically questionable aspect of this, not repeat NOT the tennis. The fact that ABC brought up perks at all was a poor editorial choice, but that's all it was. They crammed two stories under one headline, both broadly being about judicial ethics, and people who are can't stand to hear anything bad about a conservative figure are spinning it to make it sound like tennis was the only issue.\n \n \n \n\n This report was just biased and the facts are clear. I'll admit when media is bias on either side....why can't any of you do the same?\n\n Now that's just not true. You cite the National Ledger as being fair and unbiased, and they're about as conservative as they come. I really don't think you can see bias. I'm starting to think that anything that says anything bad about a conservative automatically becomes \"liberal bias\" to you, and anything that says anything good about a conservative is the straightforward truth in your eyes. It's like color blindness, but on the polical spectrum. You can't even grasp what people are trying to describe to you, because you simply can't see it.",
