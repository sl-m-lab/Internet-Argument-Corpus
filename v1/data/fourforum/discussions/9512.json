The arguements are about the \"sanctity\" of marriage. If you're claiming to be fighting for the sanctity of marriage, as many who oppose gay marriage do, then you really ought to be treating marriage as a sacred institution yourself. If you don't, then why should anyone give your arguments any credence? Gavin's reasons for letting gays marry had nothing to do with the sanctitiy of marriage, and so the fact that he had an affair is really irrelevant to the issue.",

In fact, you DID NOT EVEN DISCUSS IT beyond giving your own personal opinion (with no rationale behind it).\n All you did was show Newsom having an affair, state you don't find it hypocritical, and then said that you \"hope this will go to show\" something that you never even showed.\n I mean, if somebody out there actually holds you as an irrefutable authority, then yeah. For THAT person, you have \"shown\" them something because your opinion \"shows\" them.\n But as for any actual reason? emoticon_xdonno \n \n 2) The only way you can \"separate\" the two issues is if you EXPLICITLY ENGAGE in hypocrisy, or if you believe that the \"institution of marriage\" is one thing, and YOUR PERSONAL marriage is something that doesn't need to live up to the standards of the institution.\n Strike that.

Perhaps he sees nothing wrong with adultery.\n The problem is Jyoshu that you are trying to HINT that some might see Newsom's situation as hypocritical, WITHOUT EVEN EXPLAINING WHY some should see it as hypocritical in the first place.\n What value does Newsom hold that he supposedly went against???\n \n At best, this is a thinly veiled lame attempt at \"innocence\" by association. If Newsom isn't hypocritical in his actions, then others can't be either when they do the same thing...\n \n If you even try to come back to this thread, maybe you should start by discussing the ISSUE of hypocrisy and refuting the REASONS WHY people see hypocrisy in some of the \"sanctity\" side of marriage, and presenting some REASONS WHY you don't see hypocrisy...",

Marriage problems are sometimes unavoidable if a person's spouse is unwilling to be reasonable. Am I to assume here that you view something can be hypocritical if it is unavoidable?\n \n If someone believes that fossil fuels are bad because they cause global warming, do you call them a hypocrite because they give in and buy an automobile?\n \n If someone believes violence is bad, do you call them a hypocrite if they are forced to resort to violence to defend their family in a break-in?\n \n Do you understand the concept of an unavoidable situation? If a religious person's spouse decided to file for divorce, it's not the religious person's fault. Having a blanket idea that religious people involved in divorces are hypocrites is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates you haven't thought through the situation very much. SOME religious leaders may be hypocrites if THEY divorced their spouse. But that's not always the case.\n \n I also think it's interesting that when people level charges of hypocrisy, because if you think about it, it's the only accusation that people can make that is ALWAYS, in and of itself, hypocritical. :) If Foundit has ever, once in his life, been hypocritical about something to any degree (and who hasn't?), then he's a hypocrite for considering someone else a hypocrite. I don't think people like him who like to find hypocrisy in religious people think about that sometimes.\n \n \nBut the funny thing is that divorce is a CONTINUAL failure to live up to something.\n It's not like somebody stole something once, repented, and then promised never to do it again.\n \n According to the Bible, by Jesus's OWN WORDS, the marriage STILL EXISTS if the divorce is not valid according to some very strict guide-lines.\n The obvious conclusion would be for the couple to repent of their divorce, get back together, and STAY MARRIED.\n \n Otherwise, you're living in sin JUST AS MUCH as the gay man who continues to be gay in his sexual behavior...\n\n \n LOL, I love it how people who could care less about the Bible or Christian thinking sometimes suddenly try to take up the mantra when it suits them, even to the point of preaching to others. No one even brought up Jesus, sin, or the Bible here until Foundit did. \n \n The whole \"continual\" thing because it's unrepentant isn't valid because there may be cases where the person WANTS to get back together with their spouse, but the SPOUSE doesn't want to. \n \n Not to mention that it doesn't take into account that Jesus does allow for divorce under grounds of marital unfaithfulness. But even with that aside, it seems to me that Foundit and other people who like to point fingers have a choice--they can take a more live-and-let live attitude toward religious people (AND gays) and not view the fact that people are human and make mistakes as hypocritical, or they can view these things as hypocritical, but then it can be pointed out that someone in Newsom's case is a hypocrite too. It's really their choice. My view is that neither really is, because there's a difference between having a view ABOUT marriage and being married. But if they are going to jump on these things when a religious person struggles in marriage, then they are going to have to deal with it themselves.",

I never made any judgment statements regarding MY PERSONAL opinion and grounds for divorce.\n \n Oh wait. It must have been this other poster...\n \n Jesus said:Mat 5:31 &#182; It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: \n Mat 5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. also...Mar 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? tempting him.\n Mar 10:11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n Personally, I agree with you that this \"Jesus\" guy is \"unwilling to be reasonable\". I mean, obviously we should have a much lower standard of \"unreasonable\" instead of the strict standard of \"committing adultery\".

   "I'm sorry, but precisely who are you arguing with? I never made any judgment statements regarding MY PERSONAL opinion and grounds for divorce.\n \n Oh wait. It must have been this other poster...\n \n Jesus said:Mat 5:31 &#182; It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: \n Mat 5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. also...Mar 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? tempting him.\n Mar 10:11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n Personally, I agree with you that this \"Jesus\" guy is \"unwilling to be reasonable\". I mean, obviously we should have a much lower standard of \"unreasonable\" instead of the strict standard of \"committing adultery\". And we all know that adultery is entirely \"unavoidable\", unlike sexual orientation which must be ignored if you're gay...\n And re-marriage? Jesus obviously established it as adultery, but he's just too darn inflexible!\n\n \n Yep, Jesus did set the standard. Interesting you seem to be less forgiving toward those who mess up than those who mess up. Your mentality doesn't seem to hold any understanding that people are human and they sometimes fail ... which Jesus DID understand--it's why he also exhibited and taught forgiveness (which people like you conveniently leave out of his teachings when you try to beat someone over the head with them).",

The charge here is hypocrisy. Specifically, that his having an affair is specifically hypocritical, given his efforts to let gays marry. Since the reasons he had for trying to let gays get married have nothing to do with the institution of marriage, the charge of hypocrisy simply doesn't work. Think about what hypocrisy means. Saying one thing, doing another. The charge here is that he said \"Gays should be allowed to marry\" and his action was having an affair. His action doesn't go against his statement. Ergo, no hypocrisy there. If you want to make some sort of argument that anyone who has an affair is guilty of hypocrisy in that most people think marriage is a good thing that would be a different issue, and one that has absolutely nothing to do with gay rights. That was the original point here, remember? Jyoshu was trying to do a tit for tat deal, trying to make a supporter of gay rights seem to be hypocritical in his support of gays the same way so many opponents of gay rights are hypocrites in their opposition. And that parallel simply doesn't work, Gavin's personal life in no way contradicts his support for gay rights.",

   "If Gavin has publicly condemned adultery, I would agree whole-heartedly with you that he is a hypocrite.\n I agree with the part I added the Bold-faced to...\n \n With that said, has Newsom ever publicly condemned adultery??\n\n \n Wow, talk about splitting hairs ...\n \n So basically, in your view, hypocrisy can never exist unless narrowed down to the EXACT aspect by which marriage is treated as unimportant, and it happens to match up exactly the same way. Someone treating marriage flippantly in one way and giving it lip service another way is in NO way hypocritical? Yeah riiiiiiight. Whatever, Foundit. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nWHO THE HECK are you claiming that \"was in no way motivated by the idea that marriage is important\"?\n {Consider this my one question to you Jyoshu in this post...}\n\n \n You know, if you're going to pick out a question and say 'consider his my only one for this post', there's not a lot of point in asking other questions as well. Just something I'm noticing ...\n \n I was referring to you, for one, because I can't imagine that you'd argue against hypocrisy here if you thought he was motivated by the idea that marriage is important. Ok, so given your new question here, are you saying Newsom's actions in 2004 WAS motivated (at least in part) by an idea that marriage is important? Which is it, Foundit, in your opinion?\n \n \nBecause the thing you fail to address is HOW it is important. In WHAT WAY is it valued...\n\n \n Why should that matter any more than it should when gay marriage proponents hold divorce or adultery as hypocritical over the stance on gay marriage? That too is a case of two different ASPECTS of marriage being pitted against one another for the purpose of demonstrating a hypocritical standard.\n \n \nHOLD THE PHONE here...\n Quoting Jyoshu. Post #1 in this thread:\n \"But actually, I don't view this behavior (Newsom's behavior) as necessarily hypocritical even with a self-viewed moral take on marriage, as some gay marriage advocates do. \"\n \n So now you're claiming Newsom WAS hypocritical...\n And yet somehow, when people who speak SPECIFICALLY espousing the \"sanctity of marriage\" have divorces, THAT isn't hypocritical...\n I suppose even when they are caught cheating.\n Naw. Surely you wouldn't try to be THAT obvious...\n\n \n Foundit, calm down. When I \"claim\" Newsom is hypocritical, I'm doing so as a reverse use to demonstrate the way gay marriage proponents flippantly throw the hypocrisy charge around against religious leaders. The point is that it doesn't matter if Newsom/religious-leaders are hypocritical or not for the purpose of the marriage debate because it shouldn't be an issue. A person can have a view on the sanctity of the INSTITUTION of marriage and fail in his own marriage (which is marriage on the individual level). \n \n \nJust out of curiousity Jyoshu, would you want to see a list of people who have condemned gay marriage and discuss their \"hypocrisy\" regarding it based on the ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES of their marriage???\n\n \n It really wouldn't matter. The hypocrisy (if it's to be called that) doesn't speak to the issue.\n \n \nYou are very wrong.\n It's a substantial argument because you have folks who are fighting very hard, devoting a lot of time and effort to the issue of \"sanctity of marriage\", yet they don't give a damn about their own.\n It's valid because it shows that THEIR CLAIM of fighting for the \"sanctity of marriage\" is what is \"hollow and invalid\". Even THEY don't believe in it...\n\n \n No, this is where YOU'RE wrong, and where we definitely disagree here. I'll explain it again. When religious leaders speak abut the \"sanctity of marriage\", they're typically talking about the INSTITUTION of marriage--marriage as an institution. Do you understand the difference there? Let me use an analogy to help you understand this .... it's like someone saying they think the institution of education is extremely important in society, but it just so happens that they themselves dropped out of high school. It happens, Foundit. Just because they happened to have dropped out of high school doesn't mean they can't have an opinion that education is a very important institution in society, and even fight for it legislatively. In fact, the reality that there ARE high school dropouts and and that they themselves failed may even make them all the more determined to say that education is an indispensible and extremely important institution to society. Now, why should the fact that someone dropped out of high school automatically make them a hypocrite for believing that education is important for society? Do you see the distinction?\n \n \nIn Newsom's case, we know he fights for the RIGHT to have marriage, but I have seen NOTHING showing him fighting for the \"sanctity\" of marriage. \n\n \n I never said he was fighting because of the \"sanctity\" of marriage--I said the hypocrisy argument could be made based on the idea that he considers marriage important, and fails in his own (if you use the same poor logic gay marriage proponents use against religious people). It's not a question of goals (gays getting rights), it's an issue of motivation. If you're going to make the argument that Newsom is just \"fighting for the RIGHT to have marriage\" with no regard to the fact he obviously considered marriage important, then you might as well use the same let-em-off-the-hook standard for religious people and say that their just 'fighting against the right\" for gays to have marriage and drop this hypocrisy claptrap of yours.",

I am speaking of the context of the gay marriage debate.\n \n \nIs \"marital fidelity\" a part of the \"sanctity of marriage\" for evangelicals?\n\n \n Not in the context of the gay marriage debate. THAT'S the context in which these evangelicals are using \"sanctity\".\n \n Context, Foundit. Context.\n \n You also need to realize that I don't side with these evangelicals on everything, to every degree. You seem to think the idea of me indicating some evangelicals don't take marriage seriously in the area of divorce and adultery is some major win here on your part; I've said numerous times here that some evangelicals indeed don't take marriage seriously enough, and that indeed they could be described as hypocritical. You're preaching to the choir here to some degree. But it's still not what I said there, and you need to keep context under consideration.\n \n \nAnd the Christian religion has established BOTH as important, hasn't it?\n EXPLICITLY stated in the Bible. Written RIGHT THERE.\n\n \n Yes, but that doesn't change the fact that evangelicals are using 'sanctity' in the context of gay rights. If you want to start a thread on adultery and divorce in the Bible, then fine but stick to the issue here. It's not hypocritical in this case because they aren't using \"sanctity\" in the context that it would make it hypocritical. They're talking about sanctity in terms of the make-up of marriage--a point you keep ignoring.\n \n It's like if Foundit says, in a conversation and context about conduct in live, face-to-face debate, \"I believe debate should be calm and free of shouting.\" Then, someone comes along and calls Foundit a hypocrite because he often uses shouting (all caps, and bold-face) in online debating and is sometimes not calm in online debating. See, different context. Still debate, but that's not the context that Foundit (in the analogy) was making the statement, it's not really the same.\n \n \nTheir hypocrisy is not mooted by the fact that they focus on \"gay marriage\" sanctity and exclude THEIR OWN marital sanctity.\n That IS their hypocrisy...\n\n \n They may indeed be hypocritical in a broader sense, but not over their use of the term sanctity which is where we began on this. You're moving the goalposts here.\n \n \nJyoshu, you're missing the point.\n It has been MY POINT all along that they are focusing on the \"gay marriage sanctity\" while ignoring their OWN marital fidelity sanctity.\n\n \n Bull. Absolute bull. You never said \"gay marriage sanctity\" nor does your context indicate that's what you meant. You've been chomping at the bit here the whole time to indicate hypocrisy over the term sanctity. So don't expect for a second me to believe that.\n \n \nYou JUST ADMITTED that they don't value marital fidelity sanctity.\n \n \n Well at least you are finally drawing some distinctions there. That's a start.\n \n \nThat is HALF OF THE EQUATION for proving hypocrisy.\n The other half is PROVING how they are going against their own values.\n And THAT part was the EASY part because it's WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE.\n \n Case complete.\n\n \n I'm not sure which is funnier: that you think you've proven something substantial here, or that you think you've gotten away with the 'switcheroo' on your premise (claiming it was all just about broad hypocrisy all along, instead of trying to show they were simply hypocritical because they argued about the \"sanctity of marriage.\") emoticon_rolleyes Or maybe it's the sudden and convenient \"2nd half\" that just showed up about \"proving how they are going against their onw values.\" Clearly you're making this all up on the fly as you go. ;) \n \n \nNo. I'm not.\n Written in black and white.\n\n \n Shhh ... Listen. Did I just hear something there? Hear that? That's the sound of someone posting who doesn't get the concept of context. Black and white don't mean squat if you disregard context. (Not MY context, the context of the evangelical use of 'sanctity')\n \n \nYOU are now trying to split hairs by trying to separate out an issue of MARITAL FIDELITY from the concept of \"sanctity\", but quite frankly that is just an astounding attempt.\n Fidelity is an INTEGRAL PART of the sanctity of marriage.\n\n \n But you just drew the distinction yourself above. Remember? \"fidelity sanctity?\" \"Gay marriage sanctity\"? Which is it going to be, Foundit, because you're contradicting yourself. \n \n Now, pray tell, why would fidelity be any integral part of the use of \"sanctity\" in the context of the gay marriage debate? Hmm? In fact, why would evangelicals intend marriage fidelity into the context at all in that debate? It's funny really--because you were jumping earlier to defend Newsom by saying his statements weren't about fidelity and shouldn't be held accountable in that way, but you sure don't seem to want to entertain the correct idea that evangelicals aren't using that as their basis in their arguments in the gay rights debate either. Isn't that interesting? emoticon_wow \n \n (one wonders just how deep this rabbit hole of yours will go...)\n \n Now, I'll deal with the matter of Jesus commenting on one thing and not commenting on another, that you were talking about ...\n \n Yes, Jesus did deal with adultery (in a far more forgiving way than you are), and he not directly deal with homosexuality. But you are forgetting that the the words of God (in the Christian view) are not limited to the red-letter words of Christ. There is plenty elsewhere in the Bible that deals with homosexualty. Incidentally, it fascinates me when people hold up the fact Christ didn't directly comment on any given issue that Christians take a stand on. I don't recall Christ commenting on many, many things that Christians believe are bad--and they believe so justifiably. Suicide was never talked about by Christ. Binge eating. Binge drinking! Illegal drug use. Heck, we could go on and on. But the best you can come up with is the fact that Jesus didn't mention it, as if that automatically means something? Come on Foundit, you can do better than that. I know you can!\n \n The second matter that I said I would comment later on was the fact that standards for divorce are specifically laid out in the Bible. That is correct, but then so are standards over homosexual relations. You seem to be indicating that one is and the other isn't, but this just isn't so.",

   "and the 2nd part is what's critical for you not to miss. I am speaking of the context of the gay marriage debate.\n\n This attempt to focus the \"context\" is essentially an attempt to narrowly define the conversation so that the hypocrisy of some anti-gay Christians can be ignored.\n \n Say Jane tells her kids that they have to keep their rooms clean. She enforces this upon them religiously, spending as much time and money on enforcing the \"clean room\" standard as the religious right spends trying to ensure discrimination against gays...\n But her own areas, like her bedroom and her den, are in disarray. A pig sty.\n \n Now along comes Jyoshu. He insists that we must only focus on the \"context\" of how Jane wants to apply her rules against her kids.\n How Jane enacts the clean room standard regarding HERSELF is out of \"context\" according to him.\n \n :xbanghead \n How much more ridiculous can you get?\n \n \n \nYou also need to realize that I don't side with these evangelicals on everything, to every degree. You seem to think the idea of me indicating some evangelicals don't take marriage seriously in the area of divorce and adultery is some major win here on your part...\n\n Jyoshu, often getting you to admit ANYTHING in reality can be pulling teeth.\n So yeah. \"Major win\" in some respects...\n \n \n \nI've said numerous times here that some evangelicals indeed don't take marriage seriously enough, and that indeed they could be described as hypocritical.\n\n WHERE have you said that?\n Quote me the text where you have admitted to that.\n \n \n \nIf you want to start a thread on adultery and divorce in the Bible, then fine but stick to the issue here. It's not hypocritical in this case because they aren't using \"sanctity\" in the context that it would make it hypocritical. They're talking about sanctity in terms of the make-up of marriage--a point you keep ignoring.\n\n 1) No. I'm not ignoring that point at all.\n Your attempted point is just not relevant, as discussed above.\n An arbitrary attempt at creating a standard for RESTRICTING evaluation of hypocrisy, and that standard just plain doesn't exist.\n 2) See the analogy above for why your demand to restrict the conversation to a \"context\" is just plain irrelevant.\n 3) It is VERY relevant in demonstrating the lack of sincerity in the demand to preserve \"sanctity\" in marriage.\n Focusing on OTHER PEOPLE's \"sanctity\", while ignoring your own, is a huge hypocrisy give-away...\n It demonstrates that the TRUE concern is not really over \"marriage\" at all, but that the GAY issue is the thing that is driving the matter. This is demonstrated in multiple ways, like in how most anti-gay marriage advocates are also against gay civil unions, which is another issue you can't broach...\n \n \n \nIt's like if Foundit says, in a conversation and context about conduct in live, face-to-face debate, \"I believe debate should be calm and free of shouting.\" Then, someone comes along and calls Foundit a hypocrite because he often uses shouting (all caps, and bold-face) in online debating and is sometimes not calm in online debating. See, different context. Still debate, but that's not the context that Foundit (in the analogy) was making the statement, it's not really the same.\n\n Sigh. This isn't the first time you've tried this type of analogy, with the same exact flaw, is it...\n \n Remember that question I asked you above that you STILL haven't answered? The one about people who believe in global warming buying cars with fossil fuel engines?\n \n DETAILS and CIRCUMSTANCES of the belief matter. Not just blind allegations of \"important\" and therefore anything YOU classify as \"important\" must obviously be a good standard...\n \n Because in the case of the anti-gay Christians and the divorce, the Christians DO have a standard against divorce except in VERY SPECIFIC cases, as explicitly laid forth in the bible. The \"sanctity of marriage\" includes marital fidelity.\n \n But in your example, you're talking about IGNORING the circumstances and details. Viewing it as hypocritical as a hypothetical for something I DO NOT believe in with regards to the analogy. In the analogy, I don't have the same view regarding CAPS and bold-faced. The DETAILS of my position include different perspectives on different issues.\n Ergo, INHERENTLY NOT contradictory. Not hypocritical.\n \n But for marriage? The Christians DO have a standard against divorce.\n \n Nice try, but no cigar...\n \n \n \nThey may indeed be hypocritical in a broader sense, but not over their use of the term sanctity which is where we began on this. You're moving the goalposts here.\n\n No moving of the goalposts (except on your part). No \"we\" here...\n YOU are attempting to tell me where the goalposts are, and now you're trying to tell me that I'm \"moving\" the goalposts that you insist upon that I do not see as relevant.\n \n \n \nBull. Absolute bull. You never said \"gay marriage sanctity\" nor does your context indicate that's what you meant. You've been chomping at the bit here the whole time to indicate hypocrisy over the term sanctity. So don't expect for a second me to believe that.\n\n Quite frankly, I don't care what you say you believe.\n You have shown an incapability to keep up with the conversation. I talk about Jesus's statements, giving them earlier in the thread, and then when I mention them again later you suddenly can't grasp what I'm talking about.\n I repeat myself that I would be happy with civil unions IF they were completely equal to marriage (which they aren't), in all 50 states (which they aren't).\n \n Your incapability to believe is not based on an absence of the facts, but on a failure to grasp and remember them...\n \n \n \nWell at least you are finally drawing some distinctions there. That's a start.\n\n What you said INITIALLY is not the distinction you made later.\n You said: \"The sanctity they are talking about is about the make-up of a marriage.\"\n \n By analogy, I could say \"The bird they are talking about is the duck\".\n But that does not ALSO mean that the goose is not a bird.\n And what you INITIALLY said did not establish anything about fidelity sanctity not being sanctity.\n \n In fact, you STILL haven't really done that. All you are doing is insisting that you want to stare at ducks, while ignoring the geese.\n \n \n \nI'm not sure which is funnier: that you think you've proven something substantial here, or that you think you've gotten away with the 'switcheroo' on your premise (claiming it was all just about broad hypocrisy all along, instead of trying to show they were simply hypocritical because they argued about the \"sanctity of marriage.\") emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Jyoshu, it has been about HYPOCRISY all along.\n YOU are the one suddenly demanding that boundaries be drawn, and now you're insisting on \"broad hypocrisy\" vs what? Narrow hypocrisy? Is that what I was supposedly arguing for before???\n \n The truly funny thing here is that you ARE NOT EVEN MAKING AN ARGUMENT.\n All you are doing is being snide about my posts, making weird allegations which don't even make sense, while making no real argument regarding content.\n Lame non-sequitur. Try sticking to the subject...\n \n \n \nBut you just drew the distinction yourself above. Remember? \"fidelity sanctity?\" \"Gay marriage sanctity\"? Which is it going to be, Foundit, because you're contradicting yourself. \n\n Huh???\n there is no contradiction there.\n \"Sanctity\" includes fidelity. Period.\n \n I noticed in your response you couldn't bring yourself to say that it does not include fidelity. Period.\n Instead, you tried to make up an arbitrary non-sequitur (making it up as you go along) that the \"gay marriage context\" of sanctity doesn't include fidelity.\n (Which, on some levels is kind of funny considering how many times I have heard the anti-gay religious right attempt to use gay infidelity and promiscuity as a reason against gay marriage. Yet another level you are just plain not getting.)\n \n \n \nNow, pray tell, why would fidelity be any integral part of the use of \"sanctity\" in the context of the gay marriage debate? Hmm?\n\n There you go again.\n Attempting to focus ONLY on Janey's kids' rooms as \"context\" so we can ignore her own messy pig sty.\n \n \n \nIn fact, why would evangelicals intend marriage fidelity into the context at all in that debate?\n\n See above regarding how many times I've had somebody tell me that gay infidelity and promiscuity is a reason to prevent gay marriage. (That, in addition to the fact that your whole \"context\" non-sequitur is just a lame attempt to get people to ignore the misdeeds of the man behind the curtain...)\n \n \n \nIt's funny really--because you were jumping earlier to defend Newsom by saying his statements weren't about fidelity and shouldn't be held accountable in that way, but you sure don't seem to want to entertain the correct idea that evangelicals aren't using that as their basis in their arguments in the gay rights debate either. Isn't that interesting? emoticon_wow\n\n WOW is right.\n You just don't get it, do you.\n NONE of this is actually sticking in a coherent fashion so you comprehend what I am saying...\n \n Hypocrisy requires the person involved to espouse a opinion, and then to violate that opinion.\n Newsom espoused an opinion on \"importance\" of marriage EQUALITY from a civil rights perspective.\n And then you try to turn around and pretend that his statements on marriage EQUALITY somehow means marriage FIDELITY.\n \n Now, on SANCTITY of marriage, ignoring the narrow context you want to fixate on, SANCTITY is supposed to include the fidelity AND the gay marriage thing. The \"sanctity\" thing supposedly being important.\n And unlike Newsom who has never been shown to make a statement establishing the fidelity as important, the BIBLE DOES establish a statement demonstrating fidelity is important, and that divorce is only allowed in SPECIFIC conditions, with re-marriage out of the question.\n \n By analogy, if you DID SHOW that Newsom has established fidelity as important, that WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL.\n Do you get this?\n Any of this?\n \n Cause NONE of this is new. After many pages of explaining it to you, I'm STILL re-explaining it.\n \n \n \nYes, Jesus did deal with adultery (in a far more forgiving way than you are), and he not directly deal with homosexuality.\n\n Ahhh. I just KNEW you would do that...\n The important part of my point was NOT that Jesus never directly talked about homosexuality. I am not deriving any point FOR homosexuality on that.\n Rather, it is a point with regards to what he DID talk about, and the standards he DID establish.\n The standards he DID establish should be AT LEAST as important as the standards he never spoke about, shouldn't they?\n THAT is my point.",

And we'll never see such initiatives with that, because the bigots that call themselves christians who work so hard against gays would never work against adultery in such a way. This is probably due to a large portion of their membership is made up of heteros who have had divorces, and if they start preaching against their members like that, boy will their money dry up fast from people leaving thier congregation.",
