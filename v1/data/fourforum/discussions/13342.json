Everyone has taken certain positions. emoticon_frazzled THAT'S all I \"admitted to.Now if by \"certain positions\" you ACTUALLY meant \"thinking the GOP is better for gays than Dems\", then NO, I didn't make that argument; I can't admit to something that's not even there. I NEVER said it that position of the author of the article was my personal opinion. Of course, you didn't SAY what you meant by \"certain positions\" (no doubt intentionally) so, at this point who knows???\n \n Is that what you meant by \"certain positions\": thinking the GOP is better for gays than the DNC??? Then no. I don't admit to that AT ALL.\n \n Look, you're basically in full-out flailing mode at this point...\n Trying to fling anything you can over ANYTHING ...\n \n Calm down, take a chill pill, and go get a cold one. 'Cause you've basically lost it here. Falsehoods, personal attacks about courage, long posts about he-said/she-said junk, offensive comparisons to Altzheimer's disease, etc. You've put on a clinic here of belligerence and argumentativeness over substance.\n \n \nLike who?\n The perpetual ad hominem Steeeeve?\n The troll Symbiote?\n Does Archie have problems with me?\n \n Again, you fail to recognize the company you keep.\n\n \n Yeah ....\n \n 2 out of 3 are people who are mostly guilty of (gasp) happening to simply disagree with YOU.\n You fail to realize how much the terms (perpetual adhominem, troll, etc.) you use there are stunningly ironic on your part.\n \n \nJyoshu, I cannot tell you how many people have commented to me about you. \n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n Foundit, are you going to start this garbage again??\n \n (Shrug) Likewise. I cannot tell you how many times people have commented over YOU. Private messages, private messages ....\n The difference is, I don't have some NEED to constantly throw that up in your face as you do toward others. I'm not out to do the \"nya, nya, nya\" playground thing, so I don't bring it up all the time as you do.\n \n Why you CONSISTENTLY want to play this \"everyone is against you\" game junk over substantive discussion in these forums is beyond me. It's childish and flat out immature on your part. Believe it or not, most people are here to substantive DISCUSS. If you want to join in and DO that, you can. If not (and you'd rather do the playground antics instead), it becomes patently obvious what you're here for.\n \n \nYou failed to even give your opinion to the very topic of \"Why Reagan Was a Better Friend to Gays Than Obama\"\n\n \n Isn't it funny how Foundit has spent an enormous amount of effort now being argumentative over a position he ADMITS I didn't give my opinion on??\n \n Biiingoo .... I didn't give my opinion on that because it WASN'T my opinion.\n Not sure what it's going to take for that to sink in at this point.",

It talks about CLINTON CHANGING HIS MIND on same-sex marriage.\n We all obviously know what he did against gay marriage.\n Just as we all obviously know he TRIED for gays in the military.\n\n \n Yeah, nearly a decade after he was in office. And I guess his \"trying for gays in the military\" resulted in a big fat DADT policy. (Of course, when some Clinton supports talk about that, suddenly he was NOBLE for it and was just trying to get the best he could. LOL)\n I think what's fascinating is that you haven't put two and two together and realized that he didn't come out and say that until well after he (or his wife) didn't have to worry about paying any political price for it.\n It was SAFE to finally take the leftist line.\n As far as people who really MATTER--Obama--do you seriously think he could get away with changing his view on that?\n No.\n In fact, he has said he personally believes marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n The point being, it's quite Clintonesque to have waited until well after the potential of political fallout to take such a view. :) It's like if Jefferson Davis had come out in support of black people and condemned slavery 10 years AFTER the civil war (when it no longer mattered), and then abolitionists making a point to praise him for it.\n \n \nIt's an issue of you refusing to take any side...Even in that thread that YOU STARTED, you NEVER committed to a side on the editorial.\n\n \n That's because my reason for posting the editorial was to ANOTHER point--which has already been explained.\n You're just beating a dead horse here.\n \n If you posted an article that was a flat-earther trying to argue for a flat-earth, and the reason you posted it was to show something about the way people treat flat-earthers, should you be castigated for not taking up the issue of whether the earth is flat????

He is HONEST in openly admitting that his \"powers of the state\" position would revoke Loving v Virginia.\n He HONESTLY admits that.\n So we can move on to other things.\n \n YOU, on the other hand, in your VERY FIRST POST of this thread deny a position you previously held.\n So I have to waste time getting you to admit that your first post was false.\n \n \n \nOwn up to WHAT opinion, Foundit????\n\n Are you deaf?\n Your FIRST POST made claims about what you had supposedly not said.\n \n And since then, you have back-pedaled from that claim.\n \n \n \nI already told you, I DON'T have the opinion you're arguing about!\n\n BLOWI.\n You have pretended that I claimed you supported a position because you had not commented on.\n Anybody who has read my posts can CLEARLY see that not only did I NOT say that, but I EXPLICITLY COMPLAINED that you were NOT giving your position one way or the other...\n emoticon_wow\n \n \n \nYeah, nearly a decade after he was in office.\n I think what's fascinating is that you haven't put two and two together and realized that he didn't come out and say that until well after he didn't have to worry about paying any political price for it.\n\n Jyoshu...\n Clinton WAS ALWAYS against gay marriage.\n You talk about not \"paying any political price for it\".\n HOW does he get ANY POLITICAL BENEFIT out of it???\n \n I recognize that it took him a while to get there, but he IS there.\n And that's progress.\n Which is more than I can say for the Republican party.\n \n When asked, NONE of the Republican presidential candidates would agree that the homosexual military exclusion law should be ended in the next presidency.\n NONE.\n But if you look at JUST the Republican voters, a MAJORITY of them are in favor of gays openly in the military.\n Additionally, a majority of GENERAL voters vastly approve of gays openly in the military.\n \n It's a stark difference.\n One side (Republicans) refuses to embrace a position that a MAJORITY holds.\n If that is ever true of Democrats, you can bet that I will be avidly pointing that out too.\n \n \n \nIt was SAFE to finally take the party line.\n\n \"safe\"???\n As I have myself demonstrated in the past, a MAJORITY in this country is AGAINST gay marriage.\n I really don't see how Clinton's move is \"safe\"....\n \n \n \nAs far as people who really MATTER--Obama--do you seriously think he could get away with changing his view on that?\n No.\n\n He has gotten away with changing his view on a LOT of other issues, like indefinite detention and wire-tapping.\n He has a MAJORITY in this country against gay marriage.\n \n What you don't seem to grasp is that Obama has embraced this view during a time when there were LESS people supportive of his position than today.\n Unlike Clinton who one could try to accuse of blowing with the winds, Obama HAS GONE HIS DIRECTION CONSISTENTLY.\n \n \n \nIn fact, he has said he personally believes marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n\n I don't give a flying fig about people's private opinions.\n There are some people who personally believe abortion should not be used, THAT SUPPORT LEGAL abortion.\n \n It's their LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS that I am concerned with.\n \n \n \nThe point being, it's quite Clintonesque to have waited until well after the potential of political fallout to take such a view.\n\n My mind boggles that you would even make such an absurd allegation.\n \"Political fallout\"???\n THE ELECTION ITSELF was a perfect case where he could have swayed to one side or another FOR political gains.\n Like I said, a MAJORITY of this country ARE AGAINST gay marriage.\n \n And furthermore, he has been staunch in his position. Even now over 8 months after the election.\n When he has been bound to his duty, he COULD HAVE blindly ignored the complaints of the gays. But instead, he patiently explained WHY he had to follow duty in a specific role, while REPEATED his personal commitment to support equality.\n \n \n \nThat's because my reason for posting the editorial was to ANOTHER point--which has already been explained.\n\n 1) QUOTE what \"other point\" has supposedly \"already been explained\"...\n 2) You posted that article and gave absolutely no personal position for yourself as to how you felt.\n Quite frankly, if ANYBODY needs to be accused of cowardly giving in to \"convenience\" to avoid \"fallout\", it is you.\n \n \n \nIf you posted an article that was a flat-earther trying to argue for a flat-earth, and the reason you posted it was to show something about the way people treat flat-earthers, should you be castigated for not taking up the issue of whether the earth is flat???? Come on. Get real.\n\n I recommend you get real.\n Or get some reading capabilities.\n My point is NOT that you offered an article you \"did not support\".\n \n My point is that you posted an article that you REFUSED TO GIVE ANY opinion on.\n \n If I were to post such an article (as in your example) you can bet I would give a statement showing my opinion.\n The fact that you could not even GIVE YOUR OPINION is a glaring failure.",

   "In response to an inquiry from The Advocate, the White House sent the following statement regarding President Barack Obama&#8217;s position on same-sex relationship recognition voter referenda in Maine and Washington.\n \n &#8220;The President has long opposed divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples, and as he said at the Human Rights Campaign dinner, he believes &#8216;strongly in stopping laws designed to take rights away.&#8217; Also at the dinner, he said he supports, &#8216;ensuring that committed gay couples have the same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple in this country.&#8217;\"\n \n Maine&#8217;s Question 1 asks voters whether to overturn a law that legalized same-sex marriage earlier this year; Washington's Referendum 71 asks voters to affirm or repeal a law passed earlier this year that expands domestic-partnership rights for same-sex couples and some senior couples. Voters in both states will weigh in on the measures November 3.\n \n The White House statement could help LGBT activists fighting to defeat Maine's antigay measure, as Obama's approval ratings continue to flourish there -- a new poll this month found that 58% of Maine voters approve of the president's job performance. A late September poll put his approval ratings in Washington slightly lower, at 53%.\n \n President Obama supports civil unions over full marriage equality for same-sex couples, but he has increasingly walked a fine line on the issue now that six states have legalized same-sex marriage. The president has also said that he believes states should have the right to determine the question of marriage, and as such he supports full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing legal same-sex marriages. His administration, however, continues to defend the law in the courts.\nWhite House Says No to Antigay Referenda | News | Advocate.com\n \n Oh, and just to make it clear: I, THE POSTER OF THIS ARTICLE, FULLY SUPPORT OBAMA'S WORDS. HIS SUPPORT OF THE REPEAL OF DOMA, AND THE OPPOSITION TO THE MAINE AND WASHINGTON ANTI-GAY REFERENDA. (You're not going to catch me playing that cowardly \"'some people' support/deny...\" game.)",
