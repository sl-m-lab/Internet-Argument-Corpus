   "I read the story with interest and I understand the pain inflected on family, but I find in it no reason to indict our system of justice. The man is under arrest and will face a jury. he is represented by an attorney who has determined that a Not Guilty plea is the best legal option for the client. That is the way our system works, that is the way it has always worked. What would you change?\n Dono",
