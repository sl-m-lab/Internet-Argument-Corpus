   "I am trying to understand why the fetus in the womb is totally innocent, totally blameless. But as soon as a child is born it is sinful. Is there something tainting about passing through the vagina of a woman to be born that makes a child so sinful?\n \n Also, why aren't we supposed to see the flag-drapped coffins of soldiers' bodies being returned from Iraq. I don't remember that it was bad to see these coffins during the war in Vietnam, during WWII. Why is it now bad? Why aren't we supposed to see the faces of those who died in Iraq, to know their names? Why is it so bad now for us to know when it was not so in previous wars?\n \n I think that these are both political questions and religious questions so I will also start a thread under politics.",

   "You have more responses in the politics thread. I felt that the baby one was more religion than the flag drapped coffins.\n As I said on the Political thread, I believe that the baby keeps it's inosence unitl about the age of 5. I believe that the phrase is that the baby was born into a world of sin but it doesn't mean that the baby is a sinner the moment the baby leaves the vagina. Otherwise, why did Jesus say that to enter the kingdom of heaven, you must become like a little child. Now a \"little child\" had to have been out of the womb for some time. A \"little child\" is usually just that until about the age of 5 or 6, maybe it's 4. Now I know that that refers to the readyness to believe that a child of that age possesses. But I would still assume that a \"little child\" is considered innocent until a particular age. Actually, this would be considered good for philosophy. emoticon_idea",
