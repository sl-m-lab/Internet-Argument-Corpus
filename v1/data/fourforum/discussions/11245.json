And this was not a discussion about sexuality at all, but was over marriage and divorce between a husband and wife. And as usual you have undone yourself and actually shown that Jesus was arguing that because eunuchs couldn't reproduce, the option of marriage didn't even apply to thhem. So if He was in fact referring to homosexuals as natural eunuchs, He was saying they shouldn't marry. Would you like to respond to that premise?\n Mat 19:1 When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; \n Mat 19:2 and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. \n Mat 19:3 {Some} Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, \"Is it lawful {for a man} to divorce his wife for any reason at all?\" \n Mat 19:4 And He answered and said, \"Have you not read that He who created {them} from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, \n Mat 19:5 and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? \n Mat 19:6 \"So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

And beside, you people are arguing what the definition of eunuch is today as if that has any relevancy to what it meant in context to Jesus time when He used the word. And it didn't mean gay then. It meant sexless/castrated male. This whole thread is ridiculous. But I'll play for a minute anyway.\n \n Here's a scriptural explanation of what a eunuch is. http://www.biblestudy.org/question/what-is-a-eunuch.html And regarding the Matthew 19:12 passage, here's an excerpt of it.\n Now Jesus instructed the people in Matthew 19:12 that being a eunuch is sometimes better in the same way that it is better for an unmarried individual as both can devote their whole being on the study of God's Word and the development of His Way as they do not get tangled up in pleasing a mate or be driven to sin because of their sexual appetites as he was trying to explain. But he qualifies this teaching with the admonition that it is only for those that it is given by the Father to be able too this. Of course he did not mean that humans should stop procreating within the marriage covenant or none of us would be alive today.\n His whole reason for even bringing eunuchs up in that context was because in the first century way of thinking a person who had no hope of performing sexually would never consider marrying a woman. It is obvious that to imply this passage is about eunuchs being homosexual, or homosexuality being right according to Jesus is a complete and total corruption of the passage.",

Nowhere in your link does scripture state that eunuchs are castrated males, it merely mentions the existence of eunuchs, and then talks about 'castrated males' in the bible given the assumption in the first paragraph of its answer that the two are synonymous.\n\n \n The link I posted gives the historically relevant, theologically correct description of how the people of that period viewed, defined and understood eunuchs to be IN REALITY. A more accurate picture of eunuchs can't be found as it is culturally, historically and theologically correct. Reject it if you will, but a more accurate understanding isn't available regarding this question.\n Q. What is a Eunuch? I've seen this many times throughout the bible, yet am still at a loss for its exact meaning.\n \n A. Well, Jen, this is a purely physical situation for a male. If a child before puberty is castrated or damages his male gonads, he will not develop the ability to procreate, nor perform sexually and therefore is generally safe to guard the women of the king or high official's harem. These children were usually slaves or were sold by their parents to either give the child a better life or to provide sustenance for the rest of the family or were taken in war as captives. Both boys and girls in some cultures are sold into slavery for just this purpose.\n \n Some are captives as was the case with the three young Jewish boys Shadrach whose Hebrew name was Hannaniah meaning \"God favors\", Meschach whose Hebrew name was Mishael meaning \"who is what God is\" and Abed-nego whose Hebrew name was Azariah meaning \"Jehovah has helped\". It is a possibility that these three were made into eunuchs and put under the tutelage of the chief eunuch of the king's household in Daniel 1:3. Daniel was called Belteshazzar by the prince of the eunuchs ( Daniel 1:7), however his name Daniel in Hebrew means God judges. If they were castrated in this manner in reality it would have been the greatest blow to their psychology since they now are unable to worship God in the temple at Jerusalem even if they were returned to their homeland. But God used them powerfully even in this condition.\n \n Some of these children are trained and educated in the administration of the king's household as were the three young men and Daniel in the book of Daniel. Daniel was given such great powers by the king that he became vizier or second in command under Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon and again under Darius the Great of Persia.\n Candace was the Queen of one of the Ethiopian countries and her eunuch was sent to Jerusalem to worship the Creator God of the Hebrews when Philip came upon his chariot in the city of Gaza over on the coast. He was entrusted with her treasury and was well enough educated to not only have a rare copy of the book of Isaiah but was able to read it in the language of the Hebrews which would not have been his native tongue. ( Acts 8:26-39)\n Queen Esther who was the wife of the Persian King Ahasuerus had a eunuch assigned to serve her personal needs showing that in this time period it was common for the women of the household to be attended by castrated males.\n \n \" Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was.\" ( Esther 4:5)\n The major problem with being a eunuch or someone who was blemished in any way according to the judgments in Leviticus 21:20 was that it made a male unworthy to worship in the temple near the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This law was established by the same being who became Jesus the Christ some 1500 years later in the times of the Romans.\n \n Now Jesus instructed the people in Matthew 19:12 that being a eunuch is sometimes better in the same way that it is better for an unmarried individual as both can devote their whole being on the study of God's Word and the development of His Way as they do not get tangled up in pleasing a mate or be driven to sin because of their sexual appetites as he was trying to explain. But he qualifies this teaching with the admonition that it is only for those that it is given by the Father to be able too this. Of course he did not mean that humans should stop procreating within the marriage covenant or none of us would be alive today.\n \n The idea that even a eunuch could be baptized and close to God and be begotten into God's family shows the impartiality of our Father in all things. It also shows the better covenant in Jesus and why the old covenant became obsolete in some things. To show his impartial treatment of slaves read the book of Philemon which in a nutshell says that both the slave master and the slave are equal in the sight of God and each should be respectful to the other. This was an unheard of concept in that culture and is not readily understood even today.\n \n For the most part this practice is not openly done in the modern world and it is unfortunate when some have had accidents or are born with congenital deformities but they are not left out of God's family because of it.http://www.biblestudy.org/question/what-is-a-eunuch.html\n \n As it makes clear, no where in reality were eunuchs ever considered gay in proper historical context. That claim is a figment of the homosexual communities, and their apologists combined imaginations.",

And more importantly, why would a eunuch, if he was a lover of men, ever want to marry a woman? Your logic and reasoning makes no sense at all.

Can't you see how you are defending a perversion of the whole intent of the chapter?\n ...\n \nto me it appears the better view that a eunuch is not diseased or defective, but healthy, just like a man with one testicle who is also able to procreate. 22\n ...\n If someone is a eunuch in such a way that he lacks a necessary part of his body, even if he has a penis, then he is diseased. 23\n \n Again, look at the third section and note the many citations. \n \n It doesn't matter that the source citing the passages is pro-homosexual, as that doesn't affect the content of the original passage.

You have not given it - the site you linked to does not reference from where it makes the initial assumption about the definition of 'eunuch'. After that, it references Scripture, but it's that initial assumption which is the key argument here.\n\n \n Everything you have posted here is irrelevant and off topic to the subject of the chapter we are discussing. You obviously don't have the faintest idea of how to critically study the bible at all. The first rule is the read the whole chapter of study in context and determine to start your study from that perspective. So the question here is, how do you possibly take a chapter that centers on the Pharisees attempting to trap Jesus by asking Him trick questions about a man divorcing his wife, and turn it into a chapter that's justifying homosexuality in the bible? In opposition to every passage that does directly speak to the subject of man on man sex by the way. It just doesn't pass the smell test. Here's another link with my evidence about Matthew 19:12: but the link speaks to other passages about eunuchs also.\n Matthew 19:12\n \n \"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him RECEIVE It.\"\n Jesus says there are men who will not have sexual union with women for many reasons, and He lists some of them. He says some people will not have sexual union at all as they were born without the ability to be in union with a woman (as from birth defects or being sexually impotent). In other words, because of physical circumstances.\n Others will never have sexual union because someone has taken it upon himself to physically make him that way. Either by castration, so as to be chamberlains, or as slaves were often castrated, or because of cruelty. In our day it might even be for medical reasons.\n \n And Christ also declares that others will never have sexual union for the Kingdom of God's sake. In other words, like Paul (Who wished that all were as he, Unmarried - 1st Cor. 7:7). Those who remain unmarried for the Kingdom of God's sake do so by design in order to place all the emphasis on Christ, and not on caring for a wife. God calls these eunuchs, and obviously He is not referring to homosexuals. To say some have made themselves homosexuals for the kingdom of God's sake, would be blasphemy!\n \n So we have Christ giving all sorts of reasons why one would have no sexual union (be a eunuch). God never intended that all people would get married. Therefore, it is not a failure or a cause for despair that one remains a eunuch or in the celibate state. It very well may be a special calling of God, or something that is for the best according to the will of God.\n \n Indeed, Christ says in Matthew 24 that it's not for everyone to have sexual union in marriage that they receive his command not to divorce. But to he who can receive it, let him receive it. He who will never marry cannot receive this Jesus says, but to he who does decide to marry it is \"till death do them part.\" Therefore, to them, these words of Christ about divorce and two flesh becoming one, apply. So the word clearly also by extension applies to celibate men, as well as castrated men.\n \n But those who attempt to have this word eunuch mean homosexuality, actually have Jesus saying in that chapter that some were born \"homosexuals\" for the kingdom of God's sake. That is a ludicrous statement for any Christian man to make. And just another example of the rationalizations of man, and Biblical proof that these eunuchs cannot be homosexuals.\n \n These questions having been answered, the question now is, \"why then do so many people today think that these verses that speak of eunuchs are talking about homosexuality?\" The answer is the social engineering and political correctness that is running rampant in society. It's the way of the world today to turn everything upside down. To esteem bad as good, and good as bad. To make quoted scripture evil legalism and un-compassionate, but makes smooth and compromising words of nullification, as good christian compassion. To make those who bear faithful witness to truth the bad guys, while those who say, \"ye are all saved and shall have peace,\" loving and Christlike. Apostasy and sloppy exegesis mixed with carnal or humanistic thinking has also brought these abominable ideas into the churches. Many people today just don't care what the Word of God says. They just want to be called a Christian and to live in peace with the world. They are just too deceived to understand that peace with the world, is enmity with God.\n http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/what_are_eunuchs.shtml",

   "...as far as I am aware, you asked me for scriptural or historical evidence that a eunuch could be considered 'sexually active' - or with complete genitalia. I have done exactly that.\n \n As for marrying - there would be plenty of reasons. Oscar Wilde had a wife, there are plenty of gay men who have felt pressured to do the same - be it politically, for social acceptance in a homophobic environment, or bisexuality - something which would still be Biblically condemned.\n \n \nEverything you have posted here is irrelevant and off topic to the subject of the chapter we are discussing. You obviously don't have the faintest idea of how to critically study the bible at all.\n\n Well, you asked for historical sources, not purely scriptural. There are no scriptural sources, but there are no scriptural sources for your side, either.\n \n \nhow do you possibly take a chapter that centres on the Pharisees attempting to trap Jesus by asking Him trick questions about a man divorcing his wife, and turn it into a chapter that's justifying homosexuality in the bible?\n\n Because it shows that Jesus wasn't particularly fussed about homosexuality. If he was, he would have used a different term that could not have related to gay men. Jesus doesn't mention homosexuality anywhere else in the Bible, or you'd have plastered it all over 4forums by now - I don't particularly think that homosexuality was considered a sin by Jesus.\n For clarity: consider the possibility that the thesis is correct: some eunuchs were not castrated, but were gay. For Jesus to casually mention that some men were born eunuchs, and some make themselves so 'for the kingdom of God' - if homosexuality is a sin - is akin to Jesus stating 'some people are born murderers and some murder for the Kingdom of God', to mean that murderers sometimes have great strength, and that to believe in God is to be strong. Clearly this would not be stated - so one of the two premises must be incorrect. Either a 'eunuch' cannot be a gay man, or homosexuality cannot be a sin.\n \n \nHere's another link with my evidence about Matthew 19:12: but the link speaks to other passages about eunuchs also.\n\n The link does not have 'your evidence'! It is purely opinion, and does not back up its opinion with scriptural or historical references!\n \n To clarify (again) - we've both posted something saying 'matthew says X [A]. 'X means Y [B], so clearly Z is the meaning of the chapter [C].'\n [A] is the scriptural source, which is fine and dandy\n [C] is the opinion, which is valid as long as it is justified by [B]\n [B] is the reasoning behind [C]. It needs to be proven. You can't merely say 'The original meaning of eunuch was Y' without proving it with a historical/scripturial source - if you fail to do this, then you have no justification in believing [C]. So far, you're missing out on citations for [B], whereas I have provided a whole raft of 'em.\n \n For an analogy (sorry, back to bats as birds) - I could (if I was arguing poorly) say \"the old testament states that the bat is a 'bird you should detest' [source]. Bats are not birds, therefore the OT is wrong\". However, you could (correctly) reply that \"the old testament states that the bat is a 'bird you should detest' [source], but the old meaning of 'bird' was 'flying animal' [historical source]. Therefore the OT is correct in it's classification\" \n \n Note the bolded.",

You have opinion, which you still have yet to back up - that it comes from a 'scriptural site' does not validate it as evidence.\n On the other hand, the thesis site I linked to does contain direct quotations from historical sources, as well as the opinion. All I'm asking is that you look at the source, not the opinion.\n \n Personally, I'm more inclined to believe that the intent of the passage is not that 'some people are born gay'. My particular interpretation of it - as described above - is just that Jesus didn't particularly see homosexuality as an issue, either pro- or anti-. The main reason I've been arguing here is to try and persuade Archie that quoting opinion does not count as 'scriptural or historical evidence', no matter how much he agrees with its viewpoint.",

Those don't make any sense by what we know about sexuality. (And if you're going to counter by saying that it reads that way because writers didn't in fact know about sexuality, then it's all the less likely that they ever intended it to mean \"gay\" anyway.) Sorry, but this is no less of an attempt to read something into the Biblical text than it is when fundies read things the other way into Biblical texts. I have to agree with Archie in this case. It doesn't mean 'gay.'\n",

   "My personal opinion on the 'all homosexuals are born gay' is that this is not the case. I think that a fair few 'straight' or 'gay' individuals are bisexuals who have chosen one particular gender to focus on - either from sociological pressure, or from personal choice/experience. Some homosexuals, however, are born gay - just as many some are born straight. But I digress.\n \n I don't, either, (and as stated before) think that the intent of the passage was to condone homosexuality. I just think that it shows that Jesus didn't regard homosexuality as an issue. This is because I think, from the evidence I have pointed out, that some eunuchs were simply gay men. To say that it is justifiable to be a eunuch when this is the case implies that it simply wasn't considered an issue.",

How do you explain this? Why would it say, for instance, that there are [gays] made that way by men? And why would someone make themselves gay, and more importantly, how would they possibly do that? Those don't make any sense by what we know about sexuality. Based on this verse which is Jesus Himself speaking? \n Matthew 19:12\n \"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him RECEIVE It.\"\n So are you actually saying that some men made themselves homosexual for the sake of the kingdom of heaven? As if a sexual practice that is condemned throughout the bible as unnatural is now seen by Jesus as preferential to gaining entry into heaven, so a man would make himself homosexual? Can't you see the obvious contradiction in your argument? And then explain how one makes himself homosexual if you would.",

   "I think that some bisexuals who chose to pursue a single gender could be described as 'making themselves gay', or being 'driven to it by man' - see my post above. But this is not particularly relevant to my point. I don't think that when Jesus said 'eunuch', he meant 'gay'. Instead, I just think that the fact that some eunuchs were gay men means that Jesus didn't regard being gay as a sin - otherwise he would not have chosen to use that term.\n \n To metaphor-ise: Imagine Jesus was talking about having great faith. Arguably, an [unspecified non-christian] could have great (if incorrect) faith that Jesus was wrong. However, you wouldn't expect Jesus to tell people that 'to be an [unspecified non-Christian]' was potentially good to get into the Kingdom of God, because to do so would include the negative aspects along with the purpose of having great faith. In the same way, being a eunuch (potentially a gay man) cannot be seen to have the negative aspects, because it is mentioned.",
