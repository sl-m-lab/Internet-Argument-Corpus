   "God gave us the ability to sin. He also gave us biological components that make us WANT to sin. Why would he do that? Everybody \"sins\" for a reason. No matter how good of a christian you are, if you were in another \"sinner's\" shoes with the exact same brain and circumstances, you would do exactly the same. In essence, sin is inevitable. Its our nature. Its like punishing a computer for following its programing, or punishing a dog for eating the steak you just threw in front of it. We were designed to sin, thats why we do it. Some people have biological components that makes them sin more than others. It is not their fault that they were born with certain biological components. Its like blaming someone for being black, or a woman.\n \n \n So I ask again, why does God place the blame on us for sinning if he created the urges to sin? If a robot is programmed to kill, and it does kill someone, who's fault is it? The robot's, or the programmer's?",

Man has no universal centralized internal moral code which proves we have a sinful nature. \n \n \n God gave us the ability to sin. He also gave us biological components that make us WANT to sin.\n\n \n By making us in His image, with free will, God did give us the ability to turn away from Him and reject a relationship with Him which is the worst sin one can commit in life, and the most self destrive one I might add.\n \n \nWhy would he do that? Everybody \"sins\" for a reason. No matter how good of a christian you are, if you were in another \"sinner's\" shoes with the exact same brain and circumstances, you would do exactly the same. In essence, sin is inevitable. Its our nature.\n \n \n Because unlike the Angels who were created to serve God according to the station they were created within, we were created by God for fellowship. So only human beings have free will as God Himself does. In order for us to respond to Him with true love and acceptence, we must freely choose Him over being apart from Him or our relationship is robotic or the case of puppets being controled by a puppet master. And that isn't the type of relationship He created us for.\n \n And as a Christian, I too am still a sinner. It doesn't take putting me in anothers body to get me to sin, I do just fine in this one. What you are forgetting though is that because God understands this dilemma man has with our sinful nature, He Himself created the way to overcome it by living as an example for us that life can be lived in victory and by paying the price for sin that God must require in order to overcome this sinful nature that permanently seperates us from Him in its fallen/natural/unredeemed state.\n \n \nIts like punishing a computer for following its programing, or punishing a dog for eating the steak you just threw in front of it. We were designed to sin, thats why we do it. Some people have biological components that makes them sin more than others. It is not their fault that they were born with certain biological components. Its like blaming someone for being black, or a woman.\n\n \n You confuse the fact that God gave us free will with God making us act upon it to do that which is against His will. Also, God didn't make us fall from Grace through Adam and Eve, in fact He warned us that when we ate of that fruit we would surely die(spiritually), but satan thought they would die physically which was his motivation for tempting eve, to destroy the whole human race at our very inception. If you inderstood the Spiritual battle we were in, temptations and personal sin, not to mention the redemption God personally sacrificed to give to us would make perfect sense to you.\n \n \nSo I ask again, why does God place the blame on us for sinning if he created the urges to sin? If a robot is programmed to kill, and it does kill someone, who's fault is it? The robot's, or the programmer's? \n\n \n Because He gave us a way out of the dilemma. To escape the sin nature and overcome that which is against His Holy Nature and Will in this World of Spiritual Darkness where even the bible states that satan is the god who works to destroy humanity in opposition to God who is working to save us. We are in a Spiritual Battle. If one denies that fact, then they are DOA and never even had a chance to survive the true battle this life represents as it is a Spiritual one and most people reject that the Spiritual aspect of our lives even exists.",

   "Ah, yes, the same old tired and ludicrous \"argument\" that you attempted to used a few months ago on the Creation/evolution forum: Angels don't have free will but somehow, quite magically, Lucifer and a bunch of other angels managed to turn away from God and actually rebel against him, all without having free will.\n \n The logic of Archangel, everyone. :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead\n\n \n I'm going to try just one more time to explain this to you SP. If you can't understand it then, then I give up on you. And yes, it's the same exact argument as a couple of months ago because God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. As is His truths are the same way.\n \n Angels weren't created with free will. They aren't in any position to act independently from Gods will according to the station God created them within. But what happens if they do act apart from Gods will ? Are they immediately vaporized out of existence for disobeying God ? Obviously not or else Lucifer and the minions who followed him in his rebellion against God would no longer exist.\n \n The reality is that they are capable of doing other than what they were created for because as independent and intelligent beings they have the ability to make independent decisions on their own, just not the right to make them outside of the parameters God set for them. The cost for acting against Gods will according to the station they were created in is eternal separation from God as in expulsion from Heaven. I don't know if you know this but heII was created for the devil and his angels, not humanity. \n \n \nThen shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS (Matthew 25:41). \n\n \n So just because they have the ability to act against Gods will, it doesn't mean they have the right to do it. For example, we have the ability to kill another human being, but not the right to do it. But according to your way of thinking, just because we have the ability to kill then killing must be ok and right for us. But that way of thinking neglects to consider that if you just kill someone for no reason because you are able to, you will either spend the rest of your life in Prison or get the death penalty, depending on where you live.",

   "I would speculate here (as Angelic mumbo-jumbo isn't my forte) but there were created different types of 'angels'.\n \n I would speculate that some would be mere automatons with simple functions and others more complex with some form of will and ability to reason. The bible mentions about these differing classes of angelic beings from lowly Cherubs to the Archangels.\n \n \n Personally, I'd think Free will only exists in the ability to accept or reject Gods existance, something Angels can't do yet humans can. But, this is more based in personal philosophy rather than some made up mythology and is not to be taken as any gospel.\n \n In the end, it's arguments over the nature of an omnipotant God who created all things vs 'who the #### is this Satan, who's responsible for his existance...' type of logic that turns many off to what appears to be a decietful god.\n And entity who 'created' the Devil, and unleashed him in accordance to His 'plan' and then shirks responsibility for the action...OR...If the Devil can rebel and live, maybe He's got some power, why should I believe the phrophasies in the bible are accurate...that tome is full of garbage and contradictions...I might as well follow the Devil, have fun and let tomorrow take care of tomorrow.\n \n When ever I think of religion, I think of the movie War Games coupled with psycho-somatic ailments and hallucinations. With the lesson being, \"Odd game, seems like the only winning move is to Not Play.\"",

In fact they can rebel against them.\n \n Can you not see that you just contradicted yourself? \n \n Either that or God made them for the purpose of having them rebel (making that their \"station\"), and thus God created the devil and is responsible for all evil that he has caused and thus is responsible for mankind's \"Fall\" and thus has no right to try to punish us.\n \n \n\n The reality is that they are capable of doing other than what they were created for \n\n Wait a minute didn't you JUST get done saying that they couldn't do anything apart from what they were created for?\n \n Can you still not see your contradictions?\n \n \nbecause as independent and intelligent beings they have the ability to make independent decisions on their own, \n\n First, that sure sounds like free will to me. \n \n Second, you just were saying that they couldn't do things apart from what they were created for.\n \n \njust not the right to make them outside of the parameters God set for them.\n \n And now we are back to the whole that-means-god-created-them-to-rebel-and-thus-doesn't-have-a-right-to-be-angry-at-humans-for-the-\"Fall\".\n \n \n So just because they have the ability to act against Gods will, it doesn't mean they have the right to do it. For example, we have the ability to kill another human being, but not the right to do it. But according to your way of thinking, just because we have the ability to kill then killing must be ok and right for us. But that way of thinking neglects to consider that if you just kill someone for no reason because you are able to, you will either spend the rest of your life in Prison or get the death penalty, depending on where you live.\n\n That ability to act against God's will is free will, though.

   "By making us in His image, with free will, God did give us the ability to turn away from Him and reject a relationship with Him which is the worst sin one can commit in life, and the most self destrive one I might add.\n\n \n But thats what I'm saying, we do not truly have free will because of human nature. God created us to sin, therefore we do not have complete free will.\n \n \n \n \nAnd as a Christian, I too am still a sinner. It doesn't take putting me in anothers body to get me to sin, I do just fine in this one. What you are forgetting though is that because God understands this dilemma man has with our sinful nature, He Himself created the way to overcome it by living as an example for us that life can be lived in victory and by paying the price for sin that God must require in order to overcome this sinful nature that permanently seperates us from Him in its fallen/natural/unredeemed state.\n\n \n Woa woa woa, back it up here. \"God understands this dilema\"? I don't think so. We as humans were programmed to sin, and it is very hard for us not to. There is not one human being that is not brain damaged that has never sinned. Its our nature. What God is doing is like me going to the store and buying a laptop computer. I program the laptop to follow a certain command. Then I tell it if you follow that programming I gave you then I will smash you with a sledgehammer. The computer would not have executed that program if you had not put it in there in the first place. What I'm saying is, God designed us to sin. He gave us almost uncontrollable urges to. Why? Is he just being mean? If we follow those urges he gave us he would put us in hell. That, to me, is cruel. If he truly wanted us to not sin, he would have designed us not to sin, instead of designing us to sin. \n \n \n \n \nYou confuse the fact that God gave us free will with God making us act upon it to do that which is against His will. Also, God didn't make us fall from Grace through Adam and Eve, in fact He warned us that when we ate of that fruit we would surely die(spiritually), but satan thought they would die physically which was his motivation for tempting eve, to destroy the whole human race at our very inception. If you inderstood the Spiritual battle we were in, temptations and personal sin, not to mention the redemption God personally sacrificed to give to us would make perfect sense to you.\n\n \n Lets get something straight. I did not eat any forbidden apple, nor did I obey instructions from a talking deformed snake (how the hell did the snake get human vocal cords in the first place?). I refuse to pay for another's misdoings.\n \n \n \n \nBecause He gave us a way out of the dilemma. To escape the sin nature and overcome that which is against His Holy Nature and Will in this World of Spiritual Darkness where even the bible states that satan is the god who works to destroy humanity in opposition to God who is working to save us. We are in a Spiritual Battle. If one denies that fact, then they are DOA and never even had a chance to survive the true battle this life represents as it is a Spiritual one and most people reject that the Spiritual aspect of our lives even exists.\n\n \n But why did god create this \"spiritual battle\"?

So it is with the sinful nature we inherited from Adam and Eve. Like it or not, you carry it within your gene pool as I and every other human being does. But God gave us a way to overcome it. He took our sinful natures upon Himself as the sacrificial lamb. All we must do is accept the gift He freely offers us as He knows that as long as we remain in this flesh we will never have complete victory over our Natures to sin.\n \n So what I'm saying is that we will never be good enough to live up to Gods Holy standards in this flesh. But by receiving Jesus who is the perfect lamb of God, we receive Gods own Holy Spirit which then indwells us forever more, making us one with Him just as Adam was one with God prior to His Fall from Grace. \n \n \n1Cr 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.\n 1Cr 15:15 Moreover we are even found {to be} false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.\n 1Cr 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;\n 1Cr 15:17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.\n 1Cr 15:18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.\n 1Cr 15:19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.\n 1Cr 15:20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.\n 1Cr 15:21 For since by a man {came} death, by a man also {came} the resurrection of the dead.\n 1Cr 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.\n 1Cr 15:23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ's at His coming,\n \n \n\n 1Cr 15:45 So also it is written, \"The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL.\" The last Adam {became} a life-giving spirit.\n 1Cr 15:46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.\n 1Cr 15:47 The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.\n\n \n \nBut why did god create this \"spiritual battle\"?

In other words, if I told you you had free will but placed you in a World where you never had the option or choice to anything I disagreed with, then where is the free will I told you you had ? It's nothing more than a theoretical proposition as I've created a World where any type of dissension or rebellion is impossible to act upon.\n \n I believe that is what the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil represented in the Garden of Eden. Because He warned Adam and Eve of the consequences of receiving that knowledge, Adam and Eve could have filled the World with offspring till today and we would still be living in a perfectly unblemished creation with no strife or sin. All the time knowing that in the center of the Garden still stood that Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that represented our choice that would lead to death so why would anyone possibly want to eat it.",

In other words, if I told you you had free will but placed you in a World where you never had the option or choice to anything I disagreed with, then where is the free will I told you you had ? It's nothing more than a theoretical proposition as I've created a World where any type of dissension or rebellion is impossible to act upon.\n \n I believe that is what the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil represented in the Garden of Eden. Because He warned Adam and Eve of the consequences of receiving that knowledge, Adam and Eve could have filled the World with offspring till today and we would still be living in a perfectly unblemished creation with no strife or sin. All the time knowing that in the center of the Garden still stood that Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that represented our choice that would lead to death so why would anyone possibly want to eat it.\n\n \n Sorry, but for it to be true free will, we would not inherit \"sinful natures\". That \"sinful nature\" means that we DO NOT have free will - we are inheriting a sinfulness that makes it impossible to not sin. If we had free will, it WOULD be possible to not sin (thus, Jesus, who the bible says did not sin, would be the only one with TRUE free will).\n \n Your last paragraphs say it all - we cannot live without sin due to Adam and Eve that blows away any sort of true free will.",

Its the theology of a GOD which is obsolete.\n Is that what you're saying chemist ? That even non violent sins such as adultery, fornication, bestiality and homosexuality were created by men as a means of social control ?\n \n The concept of sin exits the scene with GOD. And yes those little gems which weigh us down now were created to increase the number of couplings which might produce children (ex adultry of course). Adultry was forbidden simply because the society was based on male inheritance father to sons and the fathers (like most animals) prefer to benefit their own offspring - its a drive buriend in the genes and you may or may not know enough theory to understand that.\n So let's just summarize what you're actually saying here. God is an obsolete concept, He is logically absurd. The whole concept cluster of God is abhorrent. \n Indeed, but not abhorrent in the sense that a serial killer is. Its LOGICALLY abhorrent and rationaly abhorrent. Not gut wrenchingly throwing up ones lunch abhorrent.\n And yet the chaos that man finds himself in due to our rampant immorality as we continue to adopt your secular concepts is just par for the course huh ? You can make no connection between our current state of moral turpitude and our abandonment of God at all, right ?\n Go read you bible. If its true (and it is not) then GOD has caused much more chaos from humans than we have caused ourselves. And frankly I have to disagree that we are in a state of \"moral terpitude\" because we are approaching an abandonment of GOD. We do and will always have ethical issues to resolve in our societies and there will always be friction. But \"moral terpitude\" is not the correct term to cover it. Human societies are always in a state of flux with some conflict. Go read history.\n Well, I submit to you that it is our very denial and rejection of GOD'S PRINCIPLES that is leading to our spiral into moral, and spiritual degradation as a Society. And it is this downward spiral that will lead to our destruction in the end, and all because people like you consider the idea of God to be logically absurd. Nice job chemist, as our logical World crumbles down around our heads.\n You may submit whatever you choose. But since GOD does not exist any principles you are claiming to be from GOD could only come from men. And look at it this way- if we do not survive our own superstions of there being a GOD then our species is just another blip on the evolutionary chart. MOST species after all prove to be failures. There is no guarantee that we shall. Indee there is not enough track record for human intelligence to know if it confers a long term survival advantage.
