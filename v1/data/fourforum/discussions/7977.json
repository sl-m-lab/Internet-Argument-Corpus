They've been picked by some to win the World Series this year. The Royals have a history of losing to bad teams and beating supposedly good ones, (If I remember right, a few years ago when the Yankees won it, the Royals beat them twice) so who knows what will happen here, but I don't have my hopes to high.",

In terms of the Royals, their bats have looked pretty good, but someone picked them to win it all? hmm.",
