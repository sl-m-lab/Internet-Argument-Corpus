   "I'm sorry, but I'm a mormon and you are very mistaken sir. We do not teach violence towards others in our religion or neither do we encourage it. Homosexuality in my religion is viewed as \"being wrong.\" From things I have seen in my particular church, people who have spoken to the Bishop about their homosexuality are not treated as trash or any different. It is treated as a problem and they try to help him/her \"change their ways\" through scripture and prayer, nothing else. This electro shock treatment is just a rumor, I can assure you of that. Also, I am mormon, but I believe that gay people deserve to be happy if that is their wish. I do not agree with it, but that is their decision. As for if it is right or wrong? That is up to God.emoticon_xangel",

   "We may ask: If a majority of people in a society agree that certain groups of people are undesirable, why should we fight against such an attitude? There are a number of reasons why we should fight against socially sanctioned hate and discrimination, not the least among them being the example of one Gallilean Jew who dined with publicans, associated closely with women, defended and befriended prostitutes, and ministered to Samaritans -- hated, demeaned, subserviant or simply ignored out-groups of the culture of his day, for which he was derided and chastised even by his closest associates and disciples. It is he whom we recognize as The Judge. It is his example we seek to emulate -- including his manner of judging (or, as he has wisely commanded, not-judging -- withholding the impulse to judge and condemn one's fellow human beings -- the remedy for prejudice and a corrective for pride). I make this point to demonstrate that the LDS Church (or its members) discriminating against any group of people according to stereotypes and prejudices is incompatible with core LDS beliefs. Indeed, we are obligated morally to weed-out of society and the church lies which perpetuate attitudes and actions of hate. LDS Social Services should be at the forefront of this struggle, using insights gathered from the mental health and social sciences to help \"perfect the Saints\" by eliminating such individually and collectively corrupting falsehoods rather than distort knowledge and facts to justify oppressive standards and norms. \n \n There are several tasks which need to be accomplished by LDS Social Services: \n \n As a matter of personal and professional integrity, firmly commit to the principles of ethics established by the mental health professions to which LDS Social Services providers belong. \n \n Any mental health professional whose personal feelings or biases toward a patient or class of people cannot be contained is obligated ethically to seek out supervision or consultation or refrain from treating such people. \n \n Carefully read (or read again) the abundant scientific literature on homosexuality even if it seems to contradict one's personal biases. Critically assess all literature according to the objective standards accepted by the scientific committees of the various mental health professions. \n \n Be willing to reevaluate one's own biases and prejudices. This is an opportunity for personal and professional growth. \n \n As an obligation to one's society, use insights gained through one's professional and personal development to combat social prejudices and discrimination. \n \n Do not make the mistake of denying any church leader his humanity. Psychology has taught us that we all have conflicts, fears and unfounded biases -- conscious or otherwise -- which influence our thoughts and behavior; it is not fair to church leaders to assume that they do not. They, too, are in need of growth experiences. \n \n Refrain from utilizing stereotypes in clinical and personal endeavors. Each personal and professional encounter with another human being is a chance to learn and share on equal grounds with someone as complex and deserving of respect as oneself. Emmerson said: \"The sign of a true scholar is that in every man there is something wherein I may learn of him. In that, I am his pupil.\" This humble approach to one's clinical work and interpersonal engagements can only better oneself as a clinician and as a human being. \n \n Since only one-third of Americans know an openly homosexual man or woman, an important way to challenge one's own culturally-sanctioned heterosexist prejudices is to associate with openly homosexual persons on equal social footing rather than as a leader, therapist, or otherwise social judge. Stereotypes lose their validity when confronted with the whole reality of another human being. \n \n This list of suggestions is a starting place. Prejudice, hate and discrimination against people whom we don't know and don't understand prevents mutually beneficial interactions. There is much we can learn about our common humanity if we can get past the tendency to reject those who think, feel, love or believe differently or who come to represent aspects of ourselves which we may wish to banish. Christ taught that God is love. Let us recommit to honoring this principle in our personal and professional endeavors. \n\n http://www.lds-mormon.com/hldsss.shtml",
