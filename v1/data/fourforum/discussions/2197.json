That is pretty close to her exact words though I couldn't remember the full quote.

Perhaps they felt coerced into doing it, but if that was the case then they would most likely be more than merely \"regretful\" about it.\n \n That *is* uncommon to wish they hadn't done it. I've listened to many woman who get seriously depressed, and my impression (not a scientific percentage, merely an impression) is that while they are emotionally distressed, perhaps years after, most do not say they wish they hadn't done it (unless they felt coerced). They felt it was the right decision at the time.\n \n And that does not even include those who are *not* seriously distressed afterward.",
