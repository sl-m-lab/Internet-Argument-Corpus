I am just so frustrated about the real World situation regarding the abuses of abortion that if we could get back to the original reasons why abortions were legalized, such as the health of the mother, rape, incest and severely damaged children, then we would immediately go from having around 1.4 million a year down to maybe 50,000. Wouldn't that make such a compromise attractive to you?[Phyllis]I'm all for reducing abortions so long as we proceed toward the ideal that every human life has intrinsic value and dignity and ought to be protected.\n Of course I agree. But let me ask you this; if the government said we're going to redefine a fetus as a pre-living humanoid with no intrinsic value at all, but we will limit all abortions in America to 50,000 per year or less, would you reject that deal because of a definition? That would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water in my opinion.\n [Phyllis] But if the question is whether I think abortion is morally permissible in cases of maternal health (broadly defined as it is today),\n There in lies the rub. The bolded is the problem. What was originally intended has been so corrupted that every woman who wants an abortion past 12 weeks just has to sign a paper and the loop hole has been satisfied. The OP for this thread is evidence of that. in my scenario, the mothers health must be medically threatened for an abortion to occur. And no loopholes to get around the rules. According to stats, that would represent around 1% of all annual abortions which currently take place due to the mothers health.\n [Phyllis] rape, incest, and handicap, my answer is that it is not.\n Just consider the reality of the situation we are in Phyllis. We have a President who in his first week approved Government support for paying for abortions internationally. Beside the fact that I am dreaming to think this administration will do anything to lower abortion rates, how far do you think your stubbornness will get our cause? \n \n My issue is to save babies from dying as they currently do, not to win a philosophical argument or debate. Unless we are willing to make some concessions; and even if we are, I'm not sure anything can be done to stop the abortion train that is rolling through our culture. So just about any plan that could decrease the number of abortions and stress personal responsibility would look attractive to me at this point.",

   "I have been hesitant in addressing this topic since this is such a contentious issue that I can be relatively certain that my view would be distorted instead of directly addressed. Nevertheless, I think it is worth bringing up a few points for the sake of any poster willing to actually debate this topic or for any reader out there. It is better than leaving it un-addressed or addressed by someone who seems to support infanticide of even born infants. I will be happy to then reply to those that are willing to actually discuss the points, as opposed to those only willing to distort them or make blanket accusations.\n \n So, the issue at hand is how to deal with a botched abortion of a 23 week old fetus that resulted in a live birth where, in this case, the abortion clinic worker then killed that baby (any born human being called a baby). I will say that my initial gut reaction was the same as I assume yours was. Namely, my first reaction was to imagine the suffering of the now born baby put into a dumster - cold, in the dark, dying of thirst, hunger, the elements, fearful and confused. These are all initial reactions since that is what a full term born baby might suffer under the same circumstance. I believe that is what drives a lot of the emotions around this topic.\n \n The main point on which I differ with the majority opinion here is that I find it necessary to step back and ask the critical question - Is the scenario of suffering that I am imagining real or only in my imagination? Is that baby really suffering? What is really happening?\n \n Perhaps your world view comes to a different answer to those questions but my world view respects the answers of science that, according to the consensus of neurologists, says that, at 23 weeks, a fetus (or premature baby) cannot yet feel pain, have any sense of thoughts or emotions - nothing. At that stage, it is just a living body with \"nobody home\". This doesn't change whether it is in a woman's body or not. It may be born, but it still has \"nobody home\" until it develops for a few weeks more. This means that no, it is not suffering, no, it doesn't feel fear or confusion or indeed anything at all. Our gut reactions were just wrong so we have to make decisions about such cases based on the reality, not our misleading and false gut reactions. \n \n I have never thought it made sense to grant rights to mere bodies - whether during the development stage of pregnancy or after the congitive functions are completely destroyed at the end of life or after a terrible mind-killing accident. It just doesn't make sense to me. I have a very fundamental view of ourselves as people being our mental selves. Without a mental self, we don't exist - just our bodies. It is the mental self that deserves rights. So, at 23 weeks development, that newly born baby is still just a body with \"nobody home\" - no mental existence - so I also would think that it doesn't yet deserve rights.\n \n However, even if it is not yet a person with rights, it certainly has the potential to become a person like one of us if given a few more weeks to develop. I personally think that that potential is important enough to at least consider. When it is still in the woman's body, the worth of that potential is superceded by the very important right that a woman has over her own body. However, in this case, the fetus is already out of her body as a born baby so the argument of a woman's right to her own body is no longer relevant and can no longer be used as a reason to kill it. So, what does one do with it?\n \n At 23 weeks, it has a fairly low chance of survival even under full medical care (I hear that fetuses at 24 weeks have about a 60% chance of survival and that reduces by about 4% for every day before 24 weeks). To keep it alive, its medical care and subsequent nurturing would have to be paid for and it would probably be quite expensive. It is obvious that the mother didn't want any responsibility over the potential person since she wanted it aborted. Since it is not yet a person with rights, then I see no requirement for her to have to take on the responsibility for its care. She decided against that responsibility prior to it becoming a person, which is the time limit up to which I view that she should have the undisputed right to choose. That leaves it up to the state to care for it through taxes and up to the state (and voters indirectly determining the laws which would govern such issues) as to whether or not to take on the care of this soon-to-be person.\n \n I, personally, would be willing to fork up some taxes for the care of such premature born babies for the sake of their future potential (in that, in a few weeks, it would gain a mental existence and become a person with rights). I would even go as far as to say that I would be willing to fork up some taxes to support an alternative to abortion of women in fairly late term getting their fetuses born instead of aborted, with the state taking on the responsibility. However, the question arises, how early in the pregnancy could one apply this same scheme? Right now, it doesn't make sense to take care of any premature babies before, say, 22 weeks since they have a negligible chance of making it anyway, no matter how much medical effort is expended. Nevertheless, technologies might someday arise which would allow that. Eventually, one would hit a bottom line that there would simply not be enough money to take on such responsibilities without jeopardizing other critical things to fund. We could only pay for so much. So, that, in my view, would determine the cut-off point in fetal development of when one tries to save a premature baby born from a botched abortion.\n \n On a last note, I have stated in many posts that I think that, once fetuses gain mental existence (which happens no sooner than late term), then they are essentially people with rights - including a right to life that can only be superceded by strong reasons for abortion (ex. risk to mother's life, significant risk to health, etc.). So, I am against late term abortions either way apart from these exceptions. If a late term abortion somehow resulted in a live birth, then I would think that the woman does have responsibility to take care of it since she had passed what I view as a deadline for making her decision. The main question here was what to do with unwanted fetuses born prior to this stage from botched abortions.",

   "I have been hesitant in addressing this topic since this is such a contentious issue that I can be relatively certain that my view would be distorted instead of directly addressed. Nevertheless, I think it is worth bringing up a few points for the sake of any poster willing to actually debate this topic or for any reader out there. It is better than leaving it un-addressed or addressed by someone who seems to support infanticide of even born infants. I will be happy to then reply to those that are willing to actually discuss the points, as opposed to those only willing to distort them or make blanket accusations.\n\n I appreciate your willingness to share your view on this. From the outset let me say that it is not my intention to distort your view in the least. I do not find such a posture terribly helpful in discussions. To the extent that I may have misunderstood anything regarding your view, please correct it.\n \n \nThe main point on which I differ with the majority opinion here is that I find it necessary to step back and ask the critical question - Is the scenario of suffering that I am imagining real or only in my imagination? Is that baby really suffering? What is really happening?\n\n You say \"the critical question\" in determining whether this action is truly as outrageous as it has made many people feel is whether this born alive infant actually experienced any suffering. Is it really true that only an act that inflicts pain and suffering is immoral?\n \n \nPerhaps your world view comes to a different answer to those questions but my world view respects the answers of science that, according to the consensus of neurologists, says that, at 23 weeks, a fetus (or premature baby) cannot yet feel pain, have any sense of thoughts or emotions - nothing. At that stage, it is just a living body with \"nobody home\". This doesn't change whether it is in a woman's body or not. It may be born, but it still has \"nobody home\" until it develops for a few weeks more. This means that no, it is not suffering, no, it doesn't feel fear or confusion or indeed anything at all. Our gut reactions were just wrong so we have to make decisions about such cases based on the reality, not our misleading and false gut reactions.\n\n You say here that your worldview \"respects the answers of science.\" Specifically, that a 23 week old fetus cannot feel pain and has no thoughts or emotions. It is not necessarily the case that a person who differs with you as to the morality and permissibility of abortion at 23 weeks does not \"respect the answers of science\" in the specific areas you mentioned. I do not deny your view exhibits a heavy respect for the \"anwsers of science.\" I would, however, contest that your view accounts for all of the answers that science has given us. Indeed, there is another scientific fact that ought to be respected: the scientific fact that \"[a] zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo).\" I do not believe that we should selectively decide which answers of science to respect, and which answers to ignore. That would not be a very scientific thing to do. \n \n I do not know whether you intended this or not, but it sounds as if you are suggesting that if somebody has come to a different conclusion than you on this issue, then their view must not \"respect the answers of science.\" I would heavily disagree with that. Science tells us that a Zygote is a new human being. Whether that new human being has rights is not a question of science, but rather a question of philosophy.\n \n This is the case because it is not the facts of science that are in dispute, but what those facts mean. The former (scientific facts) can properly be considered to belong to the realm of science. But the latter belongs properly to the realm of philosophy. Science cannot tell us that, because a being can experience suffering, thoughts, and emotions, one therefore ought not to kill it. Nor can science tell us that a Zygote has or does not have rights. In essence, science can tell us what a thing is and how it develops. What science cannot tell us is that the developing human being has or does not have moral value based on its achieving some certain stage of development (mental existence, for instance). That is a moral conclusion that depends, not upon science, but upon a moral philosophy.\n \n Therefore, in this instance, I could assume that this born alive infant could feel no pain and still conclude that dumping it in a trash can was the killing of a human being (a scientific fact), that such killing was wrong (a moral philosophy), and that such killing should therefore be prohibited (synthesizing the two).\n \n Your entire view on this matter seems to be based on the sole fact that, because the born alive infant did not in fact experience pain and suffering, and indeed was incapable of experiencing pain and suffering, the outrage expressed at this incident is not grounded in reason. I emphatically dispute this. I do not believe the morality of an act turns on the question of whether it inflicts some sort of pain (either mental or physical), but rather it turns simply on the nature of the action itself.\n \n Take the desecration of a dead body as an example. Many people would find such desecration to be morally reprehensible despite the fact that the desecration inflicts no pain or suffering upon the body. People would view it so because of a moral philosophy that holds the nature of the act itself to be reprehensible.\n \n I suppose what comes up now is this: what do you consider to be so reprehensible about the actions in the case of the born alive infant? What I find reprehensible is not the malpractice of the doctor, but rather the unjustified killing of an infant-that is to say, the unjustified killing of a fellow human being. This is wrong in itself.\n \n Thus, I would caution you against suggesting that your view is more reasonable than mine because yours is scientific whereas mine is not. That is not true. Rather, both of our views use scientific facts to reach philosophical conclusions.\n \n \nSo, at 23 weeks development, that newly born baby is still just a body with \"nobody home\" - no mental existence - so I also would think that it doesn't yet deserve rights.\n\n I do not think any being earns rights. I believe human beings have rights inherently, and the only question is whether we should recognize and secure them or not. This view has the happy consequence of taking all subjectivity out of deciding which human beings get rights, and which human beings do not get rights.",

I do not find such a posture terribly helpful in discussions. To the extent that I may have misunderstood anything regarding your view, please correct it.\n\n I appreciate that and will be happy to respond. I think there are genuine disagreements that groups can have and, even if those disagreements are not resolved, a lot can be gained just by understanding the opposing point of view in a calm, respectful discussion. I appreciate that you seem to agree since there are many on both sides who don't care to really hear out the opposing view. \n \nYou say &#8220;the critical question&#8221; in determining whether this action is truly as outrageous as it has made many people feel is whether this born alive infant actually experienced any suffering. Is it really true that only an act that inflicts pain and suffering is immoral?\n\n No, but I believe that the idea of the infant suffering is what drives a lot of the emotion in this particular situation, which is why I found it to be a critical question to address whether or not the infant is actually suffering. If we take the issue of suffering out of the discussion (by showing that the infant did not suffer), then the issue could then be debated based on other criteria - where mental existence is a criteria that I personally find critical.\n \nYou say here that your worldview &#8220;respects the answers of science.&#8221; Specifically, that a 23 week old fetus cannot feel pain and has no thoughts or emotions.

That would not be a very scientific thing to do. \n\n In the case of the comparison of world views, there I was only addressing the question of whether or not the infant is suffering - not the larger question of whether or not the killing of the non-suffering infant is moral or immoral. Again, the question of whether or not it was suffering was important in my view since I believe that it drives a lot of the emotions behind this particular example. As for differences in world view, I imagined that someone who believes that a soul enters at conception might not agree with the neurological conclusion and, instead, think that the infant might suffer even at 23 weeks. \n \nI do not know whether you intended this or not, but it sounds as if you are suggesting that if somebody has come to a different conclusion than you on this issue, then their view must not &#8220;respect the answers of science.&#8221; I would heavily disagree with that.

Rather, both of our views use scientific facts to reach philosophical conclusions.\n\n I think you are misinterpreting my view. I firmly believe that science should form a basis of our understanding of the facts behind a moral situation but I do agree with you that our guiding moral philosophies then determine the morality, given the scientific facts at hand. Again, the comparison of world views was meant only to underscore that we should make our decisions based on the understanding of the facts that science gives us where, in this particular example, I was referring to the question of whether or not the infant is suffering.\n \n As for the moral / philosophical question, that is why I brought up the paragraph about the importance of mental existence since this forms the core of my own philosophical belief about rights and morality. I fully appreciate that others can have another point of view that is also based on science where, as you say, the growth of a human being starts at conception. The main philosophical difference between us is that I view that the essence of what makes us people is our mental existence. Without that, the only thing that exists is a body - which is far less important in my view except for its potential to grow into a person (as is the case for embryos and fetuses). You seem to attach the same importance to zygotes as to fetuses one day from birth since they are equally human beings in your view. My view very much differs since I don't view a body without any mental existence as a human being. If I suffered a terrible accident where I no longer had any thoughts, emotions, sense of pain or any mental existence on any level (conscious or subconscious) so that all that was left of me was just a living artificially supported body with \"nobody home\" then I would consider that future self as having already ended and one could go ahead and kill the leftover body with no remorse since nobody would be hurt by it. \n \n Honestly, I have trouble understanding why people on the pro-life side don't seem to place any importance in the question of whether or not there is \"somebody home\" in the body. This is a fundamental question that even many renowned Christian theologians throughout the ages have addressed with the question of ensoulment (when a soul enters a body) and the various types of souls. It is only relatively recently in history (19th century) that the full soul was believed to enter the body at conception. Prior to that historic time, the views about ensoulment and the morality of abortion related to that question of ensoulment, varied quite a bit. Very often historically, the Christian Church (represented mainly by the Catholic church through most of Christian history) viewed ensoulment as happening at \"quickening\". The only reason I bring up these historical notes about Christian views on ensoulment is because it touches upon the same concerns about mental existence and the difference between the body with a mental existence and one without. That mental existence is the thing that is by far the most important for me when thinking about abortion rights and rights of people.\n \nI do not think any being earns rights. I believe human beings have rights inherently, and the only question is whether we should recognize and secure them or not. This view has the happy consequence of taking all subjectivity out of deciding which human beings get rights, and which human beings do not get rights.\n\n But how can a body with \"nobody home\" have rights? It is like giving rights to an inanimate object. How about if that early fetus never developed farther so it would never gain a mental existence and just remain a miniature human body with \"nobody home\" ever - would you still think that it deserved rights?",

   "No, but I believe that the idea of the infant suffering is what drives a lot of the emotion in this particular situation, which is why I found it to be a critical question to address whether or not the infant is actually suffering. If we take the issue of suffering out of the discussion (by showing that the infant did not suffer), then the issue could then be debated based on other criteria - where mental existence is a criteria that I personally find critical.\n\n But don't you think that a lot of the emotion in this particular situation is grounded in the belief that the born alive infant was indeed a human being? That seems to me to be the issue. People are upset about this because they believe this infant was a human being and did not deserve the treatment she got.\n \n \nIn the case of the comparison of world views, there I was only addressing the question of whether or not the infant is suffering - not the larger question of whether or not the killing of the non-suffering infant is moral or immoral.\n\n Ok.\n \n \nI think you are misinterpreting my view. I firmly believe that science should form a basis of our understanding of the facts behind a moral situation but I do agree with you that our guiding moral philosophies then determine the morality, given the scientific facts at hand.\n\n I'm glad you agree with this.\n \n \nHonestly, I have trouble understanding why people on the pro-life side don't seem to place any importance in the question of whether or not there is \"somebody home\" in the body.\n\n I'll do you one better. It is my view, and many other pro-lifers as well, that we have a human being from the moment of conception, which means that I believe the embryo has rights even though at that point it doesn't have any mental existence or any body.\n \n \nIt is only relatively recently in history (19th century) that the full soul was believed to enter the body at conception.\n\n Could this be due to the fact that the development of the human being became better understood as science made the discoveries?\n \n To be clear, my view does not rest at all on a soul. It is a non issue for me, and to be honest it is a non issue for many other pro-life people that I know. We really do not sit around and talk about when a soul enters the body. And as I've already indicated, wouldn't it be somewhat unnatural to say that the soul enters the body from the moment of conception, since at the moment of conception there is no body for the soul to enter into?\n \n \nThe only reason I bring up these historical notes about Christian views on ensoulment is because it touches upon the same concerns about mental existence and the difference between the body with a mental existence and one without. That mental existence is the thing that is by far the most important for me when thinking about abortion rights and rights of people.\n\n There were indeed various views throughout history. But shouldn't we expect those views to change if the facts show them to be erroneous? Once upon a time the Catholic Church's official view was that we live in a geocentric universe. But when scientific discoveries disproved that view, they eventually came around. Is this not a good and expected thing rather than a surprising thing? Would we not expect them to change their view to line up with the truth about the heliocentric universe? So why is it so surprising that they would change their view when more facts about the development of the human being become known?\n \n \nBut how can a body with \"nobody home\" have rights? It is like giving rights to an inanimate object.\n\n It doesn't earn rights on the basis of what it can do, how developed it is, etc. It has rights intrinsically; that is, it has rights by virtue of its being an individual member of the human family.\n \n \nHow about if that early fetus never developed farther so it would never gain a mental existence and just remain a miniature human body with \"nobody home\" ever - would you still think that it deserved rights?\n\n I'm a bit uneasy with the question \"do I think it deserves rights?\" That question bothers me because I do not feel qualified to determine whether something deserves rights. You may notice that I always talk in terms of human beings having rights intrinsically. That is because I align myself with the articulation in the Declaration of Independence regarding the existence and source of rights:\n \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n I agree with that statement. And what that statement asserts is 1) rights are real things, they are not mere pragmatic fancies; 2) God is the source of rights; and 3) God endows all men (i.e., all human beings) with rights. I hope that explains why I don't typically like the question \"do you think X deserves rights.\" Within my worldview that question is actually unintelligible.\n \n There is other historical merit to this view as well. Abraham Lincoln, when he would talk about slavery, would assert that black people have rights just like white people.

   "But don't you think that a lot of the emotion in this particular situation is grounded in the belief that the born alive infant was indeed a human being? That seems to me to be the issue. People are upset about this because they believe this infant was a human being and did not deserve the treatment she got.\n\n Yes and no. For some, the issue of whether or not the infant is suffering or whether it even has a mind is truly irrelevant. However, I believe that, for most people, there are automatic assumptions that are made about an infant and about the term \"human being\" - assumptions that there is a mentality in that infant, not just a body itself. I suspect that many people have difficulty understanding the fact that, when a living being looks human, that doesn't necessarily mean that it has all of the human traits that one takes for granted about a human being. It is hard for many to truly grasp the idea that they might be looking at a living human body and that there truly might be \"nobody home\" in it. This is similar to the emotions experienced by people whose loved one has suffered such a traumatic brain injury that they have no mental brain function - only enough brain function to keep certain bodily processes going (heart beating, etc.). It is very hard for them to then \"pull the plug\" on the remaining artificially sustained body since it is the body of their loved one and they cannot get themselves to fully grasp that the person who they loved is now long gone - the remaining body is not the person they loved, it is only a living body, a thing. \n \n That difference is what I am getting at - a body itself vs a body with a mentality that is a person. So much of pro-life language and arguements seem to assume that there is a mentality, even if it is not stated as such. I have seen examples of imaginary letters from the fetus imploring not to be aborted. I have seen examples of pro-life proponents claiming that even early fetuses and zygotes have a \"will to live\". All of this shows that many or most people DO automatically assume a mentality, even if they don't think about it. That is what I am trying to stress to them - i.e. that the mentality that they are imagining truly doesn't exist yet. \n \nI'll do you one better. It is my view, and many other pro-lifers as well, that we have a human being from the moment of conception, which means that I believe the embryo has rights even though at that point it doesn't have any mental existence or any body.\n\n I use the term \"body\" in the most general sense, where even a single cell is a body. So, from that point of view, I would also view the zygote as a body with \"nobody home\".\n \nCould this be due to the fact that the development of the human being became better understood as science made the discoveries?\n\n Science can tell us nothing about the soul since there is no evidence for souls. Science can only tell us when something is alive or not, and the degree of development. However, before science, people could still tell that a pregnancy had started and something had started to grow even before \"quickening\", when the soul was thought to enter. Other theologians separately described a \"vegetable soul\" that appeared before the full soul entered, in order to try to grasp the difference between a living body and one with a mentality (which many seemed to assume existed once the body started moving at \"quickening\"). \n \nTo be clear, my view does not rest at all on a soul. It is a non issue for me, and to be honest it is a non issue for many other pro-life people that I know. We really do not sit around and talk about when a soul enters the body. And as I've already indicated, wouldn't it be somewhat unnatural to say that the soul enters the body from the moment of conception, since at the moment of conception there is no body for the soul to enter into?\n\n Well, there is the single cell or multiple cells of a zygote or early embryo. Though my personal beliefs vary between agnosticism and some limited version of Christianity, I would think that, if souls exist, it would be cruel to put them in such an under-developed body. However, apparently, many people disagree because the official theology of many Christian denominations has the soul entering at conception.\n \nThere were indeed various views throughout history. But shouldn't we expect those views to change if the facts show them to be erroneous? Once upon a time the Catholic Church's official view was that we live in a geocentric universe. But when scientific discoveries disproved that view, they eventually came around. Is this not a good and expected thing rather than a surprising thing? Would we not expect them to change their view to line up with the truth about the heliocentric universe? So why is it so surprising that they would change their view when more facts about the development of the human being become known?\n\n Again, Science can tell us nothing about the soul since there is no evidence for souls. Science can only fill in the details about the development process that was only sketchily known in the past. Your comments seem to imply that people didn't think that there was anything alive and growing prior to \"quickening\", when people then thought that a soul entered. I would contest that since women knew right away if they were pregnant, far before quickening, and a wide range of miscarriages would reveal the existence of a being growing inside. Also, the theological discussions about various versions of the soul that happen before quickening show that they did indeed know that something was alive before quickening.\n \nIt doesn't earn rights on the basis of what it can do, how developed it is, etc. It has rights intrinsically; that is, it has rights by virtue of its being an individual member of the human family.\n\n It is not a matter of earning rights. It is a matter of the purpose of rights themselves. Objects don't have rights because it makes no sense to give rights to objects. People have rights. You claim that bodies have rights. I don't. I think that bodies without any mentality at all are just objects and, as such, they don't have rights. Bodies of early fetuses and embryos may be objects at that particular point in time but they do have worth since they will someday gain a mental existence as they continue growing so their potential should be valued. \n \n I find it critical to differentiate between what something IS and what something WILL BE. A zygote, embryo or early fetus someday WILL BE a human being or person, but it ISN'T yet. The litmus test for determining whether something is already a human being is to imagine a hypothetical where it will not grow and develop farther. If you take that zygote and it will forever stay a zygote, then how in the world can you consider it a human being? I can't imagine. It may have human DNA - so what? That in itself is not important. \n \n The same thing goes for an embryo. Ok, so it starts to look like a human being but, apart from the imagined mentality that some might put into it, then, at that point in time, it is just a body - no spark of mentality that makes us people. If that embryo would never develop, NEVER feel or experience, NEVER think or have emotions, and the only thing that is happening is that organs are functioning - NOTHING else, and that will never change and never grow, then how in the world can you call that embryo a person? In what way is it a person? Is human DNA all it takes for something to be called a person in your view? It just doesn't make sense to me.\n \nI'm a bit uneasy with the question \"do I think it deserves rights?\" That question bothers me because I do not feel qualified to determine whether something deserves rights. You may notice that I always talk in terms of human beings having rights intrinsically. That is because I align myself with the articulation in the Declaration of Independence regarding the existence and source of rights:\n \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n I agree with that statement.

And he reasoned this way based on the belief that \"all men are created equal and are endowed with certain unalienable rights.\" He never spoke of blacks as deserving rights; he spoke of blacks as having rights. And the only question would become whether government was going to secure those rights.\n\n Perhaps \"deserve\" was the wrong word. I was thinking along the lines of when one applies rights and when one doesn't where I thought that an object didn't deserve rights. However, I agree that the term is misleading since it suggests that rights are earned, not automatic. Instead, one can talk of when rights should be automatically applied. For example, it makes no sense that plants should automatically have rights. Rights of animals are a more contentious issue since animals can suffer, which leads many people to view that animals should also have rights. It all comes down to a general question of why rights exist in the first place. Historically, people claimed the existence of rights because of the negative historical consequences that occured in societies without rights. Nearly all of the negative consequences that people referred to in claiming rights were negative consequences that entailed suffering of some sort or another. Either way, rights were always applied or attempted to be applied to beings that mentaly existed. I just don't see any reason why a living body that doesn't have any mental existence should have rights. What would be the purpose of giving rights to such a living object?\n \n Again, I view that a large part of the problem is that many on the pro-life side fail to differentiate between what IS and what WILL BE. Just becuase an early fetus will become like a person doesn't mean that it is a person yet. So, if you stop its growth through abortion, you are not hurting anyone. All you are doing is stopping something that could have been, but never yet was.",

And that basis was spelled out in the Declaration of Independence, where the existence of rights was asserted to be in every human being by the endowment of their Creator.\n \n \nEither way, rights were always applied or attempted to be applied to beings that mentaly existed.\n\n This does not account for the present fetal homicide laws, nor does it account for the historical trend of outlawing abortion.\n \n \nI just don't see any reason why a living body that doesn't have any mental existence should have rights. What would be the purpose of giving rights to such a living object?\n\n See, here it seems to have slipped in again.

That child is viable as early as 22 weeks into the gestation period. Beside that it's a living growing human being from the very moment that the mothers egg becomes fertilized. The evidence of that is that it grows from the moment of conception forward until it becomes a sentient being if only its mother doesn't choose to murder it.\n \n You so easily attempt to marginalize it as some clump of mindless cells when I tell you with complete and absolute assurance that the unborn, unthinking fetuses which you are so willing to kill have more soul, intelligence and depth of spirit than you show here on this forum. They after all are completely innocent and without any sin to their credit. \n \n You on the other hand in your desire to see unborn babies killed at the whims of the women who have been raised in a culture that promotes the murder of their own children as an act of mercy, since they might not feel emotionally prepared enough to take responsibility for their own sexual irresponsibility. Which of course you will never criticize or call for a correction of. \n \n You think nothing of the deaths of 1.4 million babies each year as you declare how good and Just the right to kill them is. And you are so depraved that you consider that to be the moral perspective in this debate. And just so you know cap0, I'm not angry, but I am totally disgusted at the empty vessel which you so often show yourself to be here. To do anything less than rebuke what you stand for would be to cheat you of that truth about abortion which must be told.",

   "Yes, but might not the same thing be said about someone who is viewing a heavily sedated comatose patient?\n\n Yes, heavily sedated comatose patients also do not have all the things we take for granted in regular people but at least they have some minimal mental existence - even though it is subconscious. When we sleep, our mental existence also does not manifest itself in a conscious way, but we still mentally exist. Comas are just a lesser state of the same thing. As long as there is ANY mental existence, conscious or subconscious, then I would say that we exist as people.\n \nI do not know whether that is the view of many Christian denominations. I do know that I have never heard anyone (other than you) discuss it.\n\n Here is a history of Christiantity's view of ensoulment and its relevance to the morality of abortion: Historical abortion beliefs of the Christian church .\n \n I bring up this subject for two reasons. First, it shows that this idea of the importance of mentality is not a new one. It is as old as moral philosophy itself, stemming back at least as far as the Greeks, and shows itself extensively in Christian theology and practice. Secondly, many people are pro-life because of their religious views. If so, then I think it is important that they know the history of their religion where abortion issues are concerned.\n \nAnd interestingly enough, the Hippocratic oath included a prohibition against participating in an abortion. \n\n The original ancient Greek Hippocratic oath did include a prohibition against administrating an abortion, but almost no modern ones do. From Hippocratic Oath - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia : \"Derivations of the oath have been modified over the years in various countries, schools, and societies as the social, religious, and political importance of medicine has changed. Most schools administer some form of oath, but the great majority no longer use the original version that forbade abortion, euthanasia, and further forbade general practitioners from surgery. \" Ancient Greece may have contributed much to the original core of human knowledge but they are not universally aknowledged as icons of morality. For example, most people were slaves.\n \nAgain, for me the critical issue is whether a being is an individual member of the human family. That is, whether the being in question is a member of the species homo sapien. Thus, even a zygote that will forever remain a zygote is a human being worthy of respect and in possession of rights.\n\n But what is the reasoning behind that proclamation and in what way is a zygote a human being? What are the specific characteristics that define a human being in your view? What use are rights to a zygote anyway - a living entity that has no mental existence whatsoever. A zygote is just one cell with human DNA. Is unique human DNA all you need to define a human being? If so, then our definition of human being is vastly different. Perhaps that is where our disagreement begins and ends, where I remain completely befuddled about the reasoning behind your proclamations.\n \nScience would seem to classify these as human beings. That is my basis.\n\n Science classifies them as human but human being is a more laden and vague term that seems to have multiple definitions in the Dictionary. Science can only tell us whether it is human or of some other species. Philosophy tells us whether it is a person / human being.\n \nThat does not explain why some nations rebelled against rights-recognizing governments. The United States, for example. At the time of the revolution, Britain was a government that recognized rights. However, the United States broke away from that government on the basis of another understanding of rights. And that basis was spelled out in the Declaration of Independence, where the existence of rights was asserted to be in every human being by the endowment of their Creator.\n\n The colonies rebelled against Britain because they thought their rights were being trampled, not because Britain was a rights-recognizing governement in general or because their recognition of rights was not a religious based one. The British did not recognize rights consistently, equally or fairly and it was their mistreatment of the Colonies and their trampling of various rights that the Colonials felt they had as British subjects that angered them enough to rebel. You may recal that a major rallying call was \"No taxation without representation\". The mainland British people had a say as to how they were taxed. The colonials didn't. This and other injustices are what caused Americans to rebel. Either way, the statement about rights relating to God only appears in the Declaration of Independence. It does not form any basis to the actual functioning of the government which is outlined in the Constitution. If the founders would have wanted religion to form a part of government, then they would have included that in the Constitution since it is the Constitution, not the Declaration of Independence, that defines how our country was to be run.\n \nThis does not account for the present fetal homicide laws, nor does it account for the historical trend of outlawing abortion.\n\n Up until the end of the 19th century, abortion was legal up to \"quickening\" - a leftover of British common law which was adapted into Colonial then US law. Abortion was only fully illegal from the late 19th Century to Roe vs Wade - a clear minority of US history. \n \nSee, here it seems to have slipped in again. I don't quite understand the question \"why should X have rights?\" That question is asked as if I have some say in whether something has rights or not, a view that I do not accept. And if I do not give rights to anything, how I can answer what purpose there is in giving rights to X? I think rights are inherent; and thus for me the only question becomes whether X has rights, not whether X ought to have them.\n\n A big difference between our philosophies is that you think that God grants rights. I don't. I view rights as a legal construct defined by humans for human societies. After all, it is not God who wrote the Constitution, it was men. It was not God who decided to not grant rights in feudal European societies, it was men. It was not God who freed the slaves, it was men. \n \n Men (and now women) define their government either through Democracy or through histories of rebellion countering subjugation. If there were clear natural rights that everyone agreed to, then one could use natural rights as a genuine arguement in how SPECIFICALLY a government should arrange its legal structures. Unfortunately, philosophers and theologians have never been able to agree on what rights constitute natural rights. So, that generally left the determination of rights up to those in power - where history shows us that different governments and cultures viewed rights very differently. In China, for example, individual rights are considered much less important compared to people's responsibilities to society. \n \n I personally think that it is much better to try to reason out rights as objectively as one can, fully taking into account all opposing views and arguments. The greatest evils in human history most often happened because reason was ignored in shaping policy. Hitler erroneously assumed many things about all Jews and used these unjustified criticisms to fuel hatred and scapegoating against them, leading to the Holocaust. Slavery was also based on many erroneous assumptions about people of African origin. All of these injustices had people arguing at the time based on proclamations, not on reasoned out policies. Reason can be a great tool for justice, as long as it is used objectively and not cherry picked by people based on their political persuasion.",

   "The reality is that this argument must make huge assumptions in order to apply that reasoning to the unborn. Evidence has been posted here in the past and ignored by abortion proponents that shows clearly that infants DO learn while in the womb, can feel pain at 23 weeks of gestational development and show physical responses to sounds, pain and other types of stimulation while in the womb at that level of development.\n\n Many of those claiming that fetuses can feel pain at 23 weeks or earlier fail to differentiate between reflex response and an actual experience of pain. The neurological consensus is that any response prior to that late term is only reflex response, not an actual EXPERIENCE of pain. I can recognize that, for a layperson (where I qualify as that as well), it can be easy to misinterpret the response. After all, when a being is prodded and it moves, our automatic assumption is that it felt the stimulus. That is where Science can help us clear up our misconceptions. Those scientists, that have claimed that fetuses prior to late term experience pain, have failed to address that critical difference between reflex action and actual experience of pain. Unless they have a good answer to that challenge, then I will continue to believe the consensus opinion of neurologists.\n \nWhat is also alarming about this specific case is that even though no attempts were being made to deliver this baby girl alive since she was born in an abortion clinic, in spite of that she survived the induced labor process and was born alive. If that doesn't speak to her will to live then nothing does. Beside the fact that once she breathed the breathe of life she was determined by even the most liberal reading of the law \"to be alive\". \n\n Her mind had nothing to do with her survival - particularly since she had no mind. A mind is not necessary for a body to survive. It is clear that the abortion process itself was not so harsh as to kill the fetus. Also, nobody is questioning whether or not she was alive. Abortions always kill a living human fetus / embryo. The question is whether or not she was a person. In this case, at 23 weeks, I would say no since she did not yet have a mental existence, it was just a body with \"nobody home\". It seems that you are using your imagination to add a personality into her that didn't exist yet in reality. I can empathize with that since I understand why you would jump to those conclusions, but I continue to find it critical to step back and examine what her state REALLY was.\n \nSo for pro-abortionists to then continue to defend even this corruption of abortion policy and the law, is just more evidence that the practitioners of this abominable culture of infanticide has no respect for the original limits that Roe V Wade placed on abortion, since they are no longer even in the psyche of todays pro-abortionists who seek to defend and justify them no matter how abusive the practice becomes. \n \n This was murder plain and simple. It matters not that she was in that office for an abortion because the moment that child was born alive and took a breath of air, it fell under the guidelines of the Hippocratic Oath and deserved to receive medical care to preserve its life. Anything said in opposition to that fact is an attempt to justify murder.\n\n Currently, the law seems to say that anyone born is a person protectd by rights so it probably did legally fall under the definition of murder. The question for this forum is what SHOULD be the law, not what the law is. In the earlier posts, I have presented what I personally view the approach should be.",

[/QUOTE/]\n \n Actually, yes, I would deny that. Abortion is not something spoken about as shameless and acceptable; I can't think of anyone who would not think of abortion as a deeply personal and emotional subject that they would probably only discuss, in the situation, with their nearest and dearest. It is hardly something which is generally seen as a regular and normal occurance, for a woman who makes this choice it is emotionally painful and most likely kept to herself except with those closest to her. Though I don't believe anyone should feel ashamed of themselves for making that decision, your statement that abortion itself is seen as guiltless is entirely wrong. \n \n \nThis culture doesn't teach modesty, self respect or a sense of personal responsibility anymore.

Much better! emoticon_frazzled\n \n That statement shows that you have no experience in this subject whatsoever, if you consider deciding to have an abortion 'easy' in any way. Taking responsibility is one thing - making the WRONG decision in terms of what is best for the person, their family and the unborn fetus purely to satisfy what others consider to be right is quite another. \n \n \nDon't you get that the guilty party who caused the problem to exist is killing the innocent bystander who never played any part in the perceived problem existing in the first place?

Again, utter generalisation of woman by again spouting nonsense like many women having abortions to save their social lives. Secondly, there is no CHILD, there is a fetus in the early stages of development. An abortion is often chosen for the sake of the wellbeing of the child, are you at all aware of this? If someone was that interested in her social life I would hardly disagree with their own decision of an abortion - is it better for her to continue with a pregnancy she doesn't want, then have a baby she has no wish to care for, and continue to party her way through life while neglecting a child, or have a termination at 8 weeks gestation?",

What is rational about murdering an unborn child and destroying its hopes, dreams and every iota of its potential? How is raising daughters to believe that killing their own offspring teaching them empowerment over emotion, rather than teaching them to never take personal responsibility for their irresponsible actions and lack of moral restraint? And how is condoning the murder of the unborn promoting empowerment rather than misogyny when more than half of the babies killed in the womb are females? And how can you not recognize that promoting that women kill their own offspring in spite of all of the physical and emotional costs it results in not the epitome of socially and culturally ingrained misogyny?\n \n Why are you so morally empty that you can't feel empathy for the innocent females who will never taste life due to the selfish motivations of those who prefer the death of their own offspring against the norm of protecting ones progeny which is the natural and normal function of a parent? Is that not one definition of absolute, and the worst kind of generational misogyny? \n \n \nPssst, there are no moral absolutes, except the ones created out of thin air by power hungry men to keep others obedient to them.\n\n \n Why is it that you constantly make statements which sound reasonable in your twisted mind but come to no rational conclusion at all? Tell me how opposing the infanticide of the totally innocent unborn translates into any type of real power for those who oppose this vile option for birth control, either monetarily or politically? \n \n Do you deny that abortion translates into a billion dollar industry for its providers? So we know it equals monetary, and by default, political power for them since their lobby is massive. And since it has been promoted for 36 years now within the popular culture of this country as an acceptable birth control method and is accepted as ok by so many more than in previous generations, doesn't it translate into political power for its proponents? So tell me again what \"POWER\" benefit the opponents gain by standing against this modern form of infanticide. \n \n Also, by what standard of reasoning do you so ignorantly claim that there are no moral absolutes? Is not murder illegal in virtually every Nation and Culture on Earth? Even the most primitive tribes which have been discovered who never saw a white man before had moral standards which we identified with in our culture.\n \n Show me the cultures which find it morally acceptable for individuals to cut their own limbs off, or the limbs of perfectly healthy people off, for reasons of vanity. Show me the cultures which sanction murder for sport or for the pleasure of those doing the killing. Show me the cultures which have written laws which state that the violent kidnapping and rape of women is allowed since men are superior creatures who must have the outlet to satisfy their sexual desires?\n \n What is so sad about you cap0 is that your denial is so complete that you actually can believe that no moral absolutes exist, which explains why abortion is no big deal to you and is why you can't see the issue from the victims perspective. When all is said and done, you're no different than the radical islamic terrorist which also explains why you defend their actions rather than the innocent victims they murder.\n \n \nBTW, care to reiterate your story about you and a certain other individual?\n\n \n Are you referring to my personal experience with abortion at 19 years old? When I took my girlfriend to NY and paid for an abortion just 2 months after Roe was passed? And how the advisor at Family Planning clinic lied to us about the facts of what the stage of growth of the child was when it was aborted? Is that what you're talking about? \n \n Also, in your warped mind, does my personal experience of being a victim of the lies of the abortion industry nullify me as a spokesperson against the misogyny which abortion represents, or doesn't it in fact qualify me to speak out against what this culture of mass murder truly translates to as I have seen its affect on a woman I love first hand? \n \n And why do you ask about that experience without referring to it directly as if I shared some deep dark secret which is the hidden shame of my life? If I was crushed from the guilt of what I did in ignorance so long ago, I never would have shared it here with a moral reprobate like you. Here you are defending and promoting abortion as right and good, yet you attempt to imply that I am guilty of doing something wrong and dirty because I stand against abortion/institutional infanticide.\n \n \nYou have posted it twice, so please do not accuse me or anyone else of inventing facts.\n\n \n What facts have I invented? Please list any and all facts which have been shown to be false at all. Or is this just so much more grasping at straws as you write a post but say nothing true or rational at all.",
