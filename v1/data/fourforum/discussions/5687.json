   "Not any more statistically improbable than abiogenesis or genetic mutations giving rise to new species. Now the odds of those occurring are absurdly improbable, yet that's what you've bought into. So why do you like those far-fetched odds compared to the following?\n \n Jesus fulfilled about 300 prophecies in the Bible. Peter Stone, in Science Speaks, calculated the probability of one man fulfilling 48 prophecies to be 10 to the 157th power. To put this into a mathematical probability formula picture this: The electron is about as small an object as we can imagine. If we had a cubic inch of these electrons and tried to count them, it would take us (at 250 per minute) 19,000 times 19,000 times 19,000 years to count them. Now mark one of them, and thoroughly stir it into the whole mass. What chance does a blindfolded man have of finding the right electron? --- The same chance as one man of fulfilling 48 prophecies about Christ, without being the Son of God!\n \n This is what that number, when literally written out would look like. \n 1 in 10,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000! \n \n This is proof that the Bible is supernaturally inspired by God and that Jesus is the Messiah! (Libertybiblechurch.net)\n\n of course, we dont know that these \"prophecies\" were altered or reinterpreted to match jesus' deeds, or that jesus' deeds were rewritten to match the prophecies, or both. not only that, but i fail to see how an electron bears any similarity to someone fulfilling 48 prophecies, nor how the number 19,000 comes into the equation\n \n oh, and i fulfilled my 86th prophecy today, and i know a friend who fulfilled 314 prophecies, and shes only 25!! its easy to do, and i can tell you exactly how to do it!",

Scientists usually conduct science for the reason to set out to prove something. They don't just dig for the hell of it--they dig because they think something might be there and they want to prove it. They don't just do an experiment because it might be a way to waste some time; they do it because they ARE biased and want to prove something. And religious archaologists and scientists often conduct digs or experiments just as scientifically as anyone.\n \n The point is that a religious-based journal or article can be just as objective as any other. And a non-religious article can be just as or more biased than one from a religious-based publication. Religion is not the litmus test for bias. This idea that \"oh, that's from a religious-backed publication so it doesn't count\" is a very scientifically reckless knee-jerk stance to take. Imagine where science would be today if the work of Issac Newton had been automatically dismissed just because he was devoutly religious man.",

   "When did I lose my faith? \n \n Once I started questioning it; the fact that there are countless faiths and each one is right; the fact that the mass congregation spoke like a hive mind of zombies and were clearly not really thinking about their \"faith\" in any kind of depth. \n \n I resented its imposition upon me from birth and felt that myself and those around me were being brainwashed. Why should I believe in an religion just because its the one the family I was born into happened to be? What parents the right to impose their beliefs on their children?\n \n Thus began my journey to answer the question; why do people do this.\n \n In my opinion religious belief is a natural response to the combined problem of human intelligence and human emotion.\n \n Human intelligence means that we know about death, human emotion means we fear it. Many religions, and certainly the major religions, are centered around the belief that death is not the end.\n \n People need to believe that there is more to life than our mortal existence because they are afraid that there isn't. If people were not afriad of death there would be no need to believe in an afterlife, reincarnation or what have you.\n \n \n Human intelligence means that we asks questions like \"Why am I here?\", \"What is the meaning of life?\" and so forth. Human emotion makes the lack of answers to these questions unsettling. Religious belief provides the easy answers to these difficult questions.\n \n People need to believe that there they are not an insignificent part of a unimaginably large universe, that they have a reason for being because they are afraid that there isn't. If people did not ask these questions, there would be no need for religion to provide answers to them.\n \n \n Human intelligence means that we ask what is right and what is wrong. Human emotion means that the thought of a world where there is no absolute right or wrong terrifies us. Religious belief provides the illusion of moral authority in an orderless world; clear rules that provide social order.\n \n \n Human intelligence means that we question the how and why of everything. Anything that cannot be explained by current knowledge is given a religious explanation. In a life full of questions religion provides the easy answers in the face of uncomfortable truths or unattainable answers.\n \n When we are afraid, lonely or depressed religion provides comfort.\n \n When we cannot explain something religion provides the answers.\n \n I believe religious beliefs and spirituality are an important part of the human psyche, but is ultimately a myth created by our own minds to protect us from our own weaknesses. It is a delusion about the nature of our existence to makes us feel safe and secure, and enable us to function in life. It is not however, an absolute, religious belief, like everything else, is questioned. Logic, scientific advancement, the acquirement of knowledge, facing our fears and accepting our existence for what it is eliminate the need for religious belief.\n \n Though it provides many social benefits, religious belief also creates many problems, as we are all aware. This begs the question at what point are the benefits of religious belief surpassed by the disadvantages? At what point, if any, were, are we or will we be collectively ready to shed our delusional comfort mechanism and thereby also end the terrible destruction it has wrought upon the world?\n \n Phew! emoticon_zzzz If there is any repitition there I apologise; I'm just trying to find the best and clearest explanation for my opinion.\n \n This is all just theory of course; I have to study theology, philosophy and psychology to develop this any further. And I intend to, eventually. :) \n \n I suppose its ironic that i'm so interested in religious belief and spirituality when I basically think its a delusion. Having said all that; there are plenty of things that our knowledge still can't explain; but I don't think we'll find the real answers to these things by making up stories to explain them.",

He was in effect mocking the corrupt judges in that passage (many other biblical examples) who had become corrupt in their dealings with men. What follows from the 82nd Psalm was this, though: \"I have called you 'gods,' but in fact you will die like the men that you really are.\" Obviously then, they weren't being alluded to as real \"gods\" due to the clarification that followed. With this in mind, it is now clear that when Jesus alluded to this psalm in John chapter 10, He was simply illustrating that what the Israelite judges were called in irony and mockery, Jesus is in reality. \n \n The Jews knew who Jesus was claiming to be (God), and Jesus, as he had done in the past on other arguments, was simply driving home an important truth using Old Testament scripture. I wonder if they ever made the connection of what Jesus was really saying to them?\n \n Now Orion, when you decide to come out of the closet and tell us who your \"god\" is (you know, the one who approves of gay sex, fornication, Wiccanism, and the worship of Satan), and where it lives, etc., and back it up with some credible evidence, you will gain some credibility around here for being a stand-up guy.
