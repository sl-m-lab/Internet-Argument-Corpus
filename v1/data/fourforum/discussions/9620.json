   "This article exposes the real problems with the so called main stream moslem community in this Country and around the World. When one responsible moslem citizen decides that it's time to stand up and speak out against Radical Islam he is immediately ostracized by the members of the mosque at large. This defines for me the intimidation and fear that permeates this violent belief system that rejects any semblance of freedom of thought or individualism.\n \n http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/110144.aspx\n \n (HERE'S AN EXCERPT)When al-Qaeda released a video last fall calling for new attacks against America, Miftah had seen enough.\n \n Now living in Tulsa, Miftah sent a column to the Tulsa World newspaper. It called on all Muslims to speak out against al-Qaeda and terrorism.\n \n Miftah explained, \"I wanted to create awareness among Muslims to not become tools in their hands by committing suicide bombings or terrorist acts.\"\n \n \"It was not for publicity, it was not to get attention -- it was just to convey a message. I think I was duty-bound. I am a proud Muslim, and it was my duty,\" said Miftah.\n \n Miftah expected leaders of his local mosque to approve of the article, since it condemned Islamic extremism. He was wrong.\n \n Miftah thought his fellow Muslims would support his stand. But he says that when he came to the al-Salam mosque, he was surrounded by a group of angry Arab men who physically threatened him.\n \n He says that the imam of the mosque called him \"anti-Islamic,\" and that another mosque official branded him a traitor to his faith.\n \n A witness who wishes to remain anonymous verifies Miftah's version of events. He told cbn News that several men also shook their shoes at Miftah during the confrontation -- a major sign of disrespect in the Middle East.\n \n \"It was just scary,\" he recalled. \"And even this guy -- who tried to rescue me out of the mosque -- he said to the mosque president, 'Don't harm him, don't touch him.'\"\n \n He added, \"It was not just ordinary people. It was the mosque leadership.\"\n \n Miftah filed a police report after the incident. In the meantime, the Tulsa Islamic Society banned him from the al-Salam Mosque.\n \n Miftah said, \"That was not a normal reaction. That was not a sensible or sane reaction. If they had any objection to my article, they could have sat with me and said, 'Okay, why have you written this, or why have you written that?' And I could have explained it. But they were just trying to threaten me.\"\n \n One part of Miftah's article specifically angered the mosque's leaders. \n \n He wrote, \"Even mosques and islamic institutions in the u.s. and around the world have been tools in terrorists' hands and are used for collecting funds for their criminal acts.\"\n \n Blogger Michael Bates, who writes about politics and other events in Tulsa, said, \"He certainly wasn't making that assertion about Tulsa. But the fact that they responded in such a shrill way makes you wonder if there wasn't something there.\"\n \n Bates says he was shocked by the mosque's reaction.\n \n \"They did eventually make a statement to the local newspaper,\" he said, \"They said Jamal Miftah was welcome to come back. That it wasn't about terrorism. But what did come out was what they were really upset about<b></b>: that he said mosques in America were involved in funneling money to terrorist organizations.\"\n \n Bates says there is a precedent there.\n \n The al-Farooq Mosque in Brooklyn and the Bridgeview Mosque in Illinois both have come under federal investigation for funding terrorism.\n \n A 2005 Freedom House Report found that 80 percent of all American mosques have Saudi funding behind them.\n \n CBN News spoke to one mosque member who criticized Miftah's version of events.\n \n \"He wasn't kicked out at all,\" insisted one al-Salam mosque-goer. \"They were asking him why he made a blanket accusation against all U.S. mosques harboring terrorism.\"\n \n Our other attempts to get answers didn't go over so well.\n \n The mosque's leadership declined our requests to be interviewed on camera for this story.\n \n But a mosque representative told CBN News, \"Our issue wasn't with (Jamal Miftah) condemning terrorism. We do have major issues with his statement that leaders at American mosques have pocketed half their donations and given the other half to terrorists. There was a disturbance in the mosque. He wasn't alone in it. He is welcome back.\"\n \n Miftah says he won't be returning to the al-Salam Mosque. He now leads his family in prayer at their home. But he still wants the mosque to apologize for calling him anti-Islamic.\n \n \"It amounts to an invitation to anyone within the Muslim world to come and get me.The more I think about it, the more I get worried about it. And that is what I wanted them to say, that 'he is not anti-Islamic.' And that is what they are not saying.\"\n \n Miftah says that even in Pakistan, he was never treated so badly by his fellow Muslims. He says that if it can happen in America's heartland, it can happen anywhere.",

The same war that has irradiated large regions of Iraq, causing birth defects for generations to come?\n \n What compassionate war are you talking about? I can't think of one.\n\n \n Just wanted to add to this post by mentioning the use of cluster bombs. I'm not sure if they are actually illegal, but it is well documented that many of the bomblets dropped by cluster bombs do not explode on impact; they lie around acting in exactly the same way as landmines (which are illegal). They are hard to recognise for what they are and many Iraqis including children who have been foraging for scrap metal to sell or use have been maimed or killed by these bomblets. These are the total opposite of 'precision' weapons, and will always kill civilians when used in or near civilian areas, which of course they have been:\n \n Revealed: the cluster bombs that litter Iraq\n \nAlthough it is impossible to judge precisely the number of unexploded bombs, landmine experts say that up to 10,000 separate cluster bombs and bomblets could be lying in cities, farmland and on the main road arteries across the country.\n\n \n Cluster bombs leave 'toys' that kill children\n \nSouth Lebanon is littered with thousands of unexploded cluster bombs. They are smaller and deadlier than hand grenades, and they lie where they fall in homes, gardens and trees, threatening communities for months or even years to come. \n Cluster munitions from artillery strikes spray small bombs over a wide area and 25% fail to explode on impact. The United Nations has confirmed 285 Israeli cluster bomb strikes in south Lebanon.\n \n \n Also, about the depleted uranium; just to point out that use of these illegal munitions do not actually irradiate the area as such, the effects are in fact even more insidious: Shells are tipped with DU because it is such a hard metal, giving greater penetration. The shells and the DU they contain obviously disintegrate on impact, and this dust blows across Iraq. It gets into the water supply, into the food chain where it will linger for decades if not longer, and people breathe it in directly from the air. It causes cancer and birth defects:\n \n Depleted Uranium Dust - Public Health Disaster For The People Of Iraq and Afghanistan\n \nDr. Jawad Al-Ali (55), director of the Oncology Center at the largest hospital in Basra, Iraq stated, at a recent ( 2003) conference in Japan: \"Children in particular are susceptible to DU poisoning. They have a much higher absorption rate as their blood is being used to build and nourish their bones and they have a lot of soft tissues. Bone cancer and leukemia used to be diseases affecting them the most, however, cancer of the lymph system which can develop anywhere on the body, and has rarely been seen before the age of 12 is now also common.\"\n\n \n Depleted uranium casts shadow over peace in Iraq\n \nDuring the Gulf war in 1991, the US and Britain fired an estimated 350 tonnes of DU at Iraqi tanks, a figure likely to be matched in the course of the current conflict. In the years since then, doctors in southern Iraq have reported a marked increase in cancers and birth defects, and suspicion has grown that they were caused by DU contamination from tank battles on farmland west of Basra.\n\n \n \nWhy are we fighting a compassionate war to protect innocent civilians?\n\n \n Calling this conflict, which because of the tactics and weaponry used is destroying the lives of innocent civilians, 'compassionate', is at best patriotic ignorance and at worst outrageous moral bankruptcy. No war in history has ever been 'compassionate', and no war, particularly in the modern era, ever can be because of the large-scale effects of modern weaponry, which unless used with incredible restraint and selectiveness (neither of which we have seen in Iraq), will always create a great deal of civilian casualties. \n \n On the subject of the thread, there have been, as BBS has already shown, denouncements of terrorism by major Muslim organisations and religious leaders. One interesting thing about Islam is that unlike Christianity it has no central figure akin to the Pope or an Archbishop; no central authority which can issue a statement of Islam's position on radical Islamism (or Islamofacism, or whatever the buzzword is these days). There are just lots and lots of Imams and Ayatollahs with a vast range of views, and of course the more radical ones get more media attention because their comments are sensational. Peaceful Muslims are far less likely to make the headlines than suicide bombers. \n \n Additionally, Muslims from the countries who have been the victims of Western 'intervention' in the past are far less likely to denounce radical Islamism than their counterparts in Europe and America. For all our leaders' talk of democracy, it was after all the CIA who, in 1953, deposed Mohammed Mossadegh, the democratically elected leader of Iran, replacing him with a hand-picked dictator, a move which fostered the resentment which led to the country's Islamic revolution in 1979 which left all the power in the hands of the Ayatollahs. Similarly, US/Russian Cold War power play in Afghanistan from 1979 through the 80s, destroyed that country and paved the way for the violent, repressive Taliban to take over. I confidently predict that we will see similarities with these events in Iraq over the next few years.\n \n The peoples of the Arabic world have not forgotten these disasters, as they have not forgotten Western support of Israel in its crimes in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. I am in no way trying to justify the violence waged by organisations from these countries, but I would equally never try to justify the outrageous actions of the governments on 'my side' either, and I can fully understand why radical Islamism has such support, both vocal and tacit, around the globe.",

War used to mean beating a total society into submission and forcing all resistance out of their collective will. Trying to kill terrorists as they hide within the innocent communities is like trying to kill specific bees within the same hive without hurting the other bees. In other words, it's impossible to do the intended job without collateral damage.\n \n Beside the fact that every single report I see on a daily basis reports that the suicide, roadside, and mass bombings that are killing civilians and Government workers are commited by arab terrorists and are targeting other arabs. It isn't us killing the innocents, it's the radicals. Why are you defenders of them too ignorant to see that obvious reality ? If we left today, do you think those random and also focused bombings would just end or would they continue untill the radicals destroyed the Democratically controlled Government and plunged Iraq into the oppressive, religiously totalitarian State the Radicals want it to be ?\n \n How can you not understand that when you oppose the Coalition you are by default defending the Terrorists who seek World domination with their religion of hate.

I was very proud of Reagan and the US Government for aiding those underdogs in defeating the evil empire and driving them out of Afghanistan.\n \n Just because the Mohajadeen went radical and turned on the one Country that helped them rise from the brink of annihilation, doesn't mean we did the wrong thing when we helped them for all the right reasons. Just as what we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan is being done for all the right reasons today. \n \n So for you to say we aided Terrorists is just XXXX because we helped arm and train a local militia in the goal of defending their homeland from a foriegn invasion by an Imperialistic and barbaric force that wasn't intending to free the people of Totalitarian Dictators but to plunge them into submission to Soviet Communism.

   "Here's another example of the fear and intimidation people live under throughout the islamic World. This is just a little more blatant and cold blooded. Maybe it will convince you of the cultural reality all moslems live with. If you'll note, anyone who reaches out a hand for peace or negotiations for peace is killed brutally and the perpetrators make sure the deed is well advertised as a warning for all to see.\n \n http://www.yahoo.com/s/135781/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070304/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq\n \n Iraq terror group posts tape of killings\n By BRIAN MURPHY, Associated Press Writer 34 minutes ago\n An al-Qaida-affiliated group said Saturday it killed 18 kidnapped government security forces in retaliation for the alleged rape of a Sunni woman by members of the Shiite-dominated police, posting an online video of the officers being shot in the back of their heads while kneeling in a field.\n \n The authenticity of the three-minute video, posted on a Web site previously used by the Islamic State of Iraq, could not be immediately verified.\n \n The group also said it had killed 14 policemen, whose bodies were found Friday in the northeast province of Diyala, in retaliation for the alleged rape. Some of the victims were decapitated, according to an Associated Press photographer.\n \n Meanwhile, gunmen rounded up two Sunni families that had received death threats for joining U.S.-organized talks with local Shiites, hauling away the men and boys and killing all six Saturday as suspected insurgents expanded a campaign of fear against opponents.\n \n U.S. forces also reported airstrikes and raids on what it called Sunni militant bases linked to al-Qaida in Iraq.\n \n A recent wave of Sunni reprisals appears linked to increasingly high-profile attempts to stir popular momentum against Sunni extremists trying to drive out the Shiite-led government and its American backers.\n \n Among those targeted include a range of Sunnis raising their voices against violence: imams, clan-based vigilantes and activists trying to bridge deep rifts with majority Shiites.\n \n The execution video released Saturday first depicts the 18 men, some in Iraqi military uniforms, blindfolded, hands tied behind their backs and lined up in three rows before a screen. The men in the front row are kneeling. Armed masked men were seen pointing machine guns at the captives.\n \n Two masked militants, with checkered scarves on their heads, then fire from handguns at close range into the backs of the men's heads, while a third militant carries a black banner ahead of them. As they are shot, the victims fall, head forward to the ground. The shooting is accompanied by chants of \"Allahu Akbar,\" or \"God is the Greatest.\"\n \n Male voices chant repeatedly in Arabic during the video: \"At your service, sister\" - a likely reference to the revenge for the allegedly raped Sunni woman.\n \n Another male voice is heard reading from the Islamic State of Iraq's statement posted on the same Web site Friday, saying the group's court had ordered the 18 security troops executed because Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government had failed to meet the group's demands to hand over the officers who allegedly assaulted the Sunni woman in Baghdad last month, and to release all Sunni women detainees from Iraqi prisons.\n \n A 20-year-old woman told Arab television stations that she was detained in a Sunni area of west Baghdad on Feb. 18, taken to a police garrison and assaulted by three officers. The woman gave a name which identified her as Sunni.\n \n Al-Maliki, a Shiite, announced an investigation Feb. 19 but cleared the officers the following day, stirring outrage among Sunni politicians. Al-Maliki said the rape claim was fabricated to tarnish the reputation of the police and the security crackdown in Baghdad.\n \n The two families gunned down at sunrise Saturday had received death threats for weeks after attending gatherings of Sunni and Shiite leaders, police said.\n \n The first meeting, organized by U.S. military officials on Feb. 13, brought together leaders of prominent clans from both sides, said military spokesman Maj. Webster M. Wright III.\n \n The clan chiefs held another round on their own about a week later and appointed a joint council \"to discuss the terms of reconciliation\" around Youssifiyah, a Sunni-dominated area about 12 miles south of Baghdad, Wright said.\n \n At dawn, gunmen stormed the home of two families belonging to the influential Sunni Mashhada tribe, said police 1st Lt. Haider Satar. Two fathers and their four sons were separated from their wives and sisters. They were executed at point-blank range.\n \n In the morgue in nearby Mahmoudiya, AP Television News footage showed at least two victims had their hands bound behind their backs.\n \n Al-Maliki is under strong pressure from Washington to take a stronger hand against Sunni insurgents and the Shiite militia that forms part of his power base.\n \n In an interview with the AP, he said he will reshuffle his 39-seat Cabinet \"either this week or next\" and pursue criminal charges against political figures - and even members of parliament - linked to extremists.\n \n He said there has been coordination between Iraqi and multinational forces from the beginning of the year \"to determine who should arrested and the reasons behind arresting them.\"\n \n The prime minister did not say how many Cabinet members would be replaced. But some officials said about nine would lose their jobs, including all six Cabinet members loyal to radical anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who leads the powerful Mahdi Army militia.\n \n U.S. officials had been urging al-Maliki to cut his ties to al-Sadr and form a new alliance of mainstream Shiites, moderate Sunnis and Kurds.\n \n Al-Maliki has won some breathing room in recent days with a notable - but perhaps temporary - drop in bloodshed in Baghdad. It comes as a U.S.-led security crackdown concentrates on areas considered staging grounds for Sunni insurgent car bombs and mortar attacks.\n \n The Mahdi Army also was strong-armed by al-Maliki to pull back. Its suspected death squads once left dozens of Sunni victims around the city - a figure that has fallen off significantly.\n \n For the second consecutive day, just one major explosion rocked the capital. The latest - a roadside bomb - killed three U.S. soldiers on patrol in central Baghdad, the military said.\n \n In western Baghdad, meanwhile, a top adviser to Iraq's Defense Ministry was kidnapped in western Baghdad, said an aide to Adnan al-Dulaimi, a leader of the largest Sunni bloc in parliament.\n \n Lt. Gen. Thamir Sultan hails from Saddam Hussein's tribe and had been mentioned as a possible defense minister when the current government was organized last year. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.\n \n In U.S. raids north of Baghdad, nine suspected insurgents were captured, including two believed to be responsible for recruiting and helping foreign militants in Baghdad, the U.S. military said. The suspects were also accused of harboring al-Qaida in Iraq leaders, it said, but gave no further details.\n \n U.S. warplanes also struck a suspected car bomb factory in Arab Jabour, south of Baghdad, the military said. Seven suspected insurgents were killed when two precision-guided bombs destroyed the structure where they were hiding, the military said.\n \n ___",

The actions may have been right at the time, but that doesn't make them no longer terrorism. A cat is still a cat regardless of the era. \n \n \nYou seem so intent on demonizing the US when we have never forced other Countries to pay us tribute or become American Tax Paying States against their will.\n\n \n Demonizing the US? How is understanding the history of the US demonizing it? US history is full of bad things. Ignoring them doesn't help anyone. In fact ignoring them helps history repeat itself. How people think that ignoring the past is okay or cherry picking it is acceptable is quite appalling. We criticize Japan for ignoring its Imperial history, yet we cannot accept that our nation has engaged in less then savory actions? The fundemental nature of a Nation state is not clean, and that applies to all nation states. And just because some people highlight the black marks on US history doesn't mean that they believe the US is imperialist in today's world. \n \n \nWe stand for individual freedom and opportunity for prosperity for all people.\n\n \n Or at least we used to.... Thomas Friedman in \"The World is Flat\" brings up a good point. He believes that many non-Americans have a ill view of the US (and subsequentilly Bush) contrary to beliefs a decade or two decades ago for a primarily reason: The US no longer is exporting hope, but Fear. \n \n \nThat and our freedom of thought and freedom of religion is what has made us the mecca of destination and opportunity for the poor, oppressed, and impoverished from every Nation on Earth for more than 200 years now.\n\n \n Not really. It was the opportunity for a better life, a life of economic reward, of education, of class mobility more then thought and religion that brought people to America. The Irish immigration was not because of religion or thought, it was because of poverty. Most of European immigration can be attested to that. Asian immigration was also largely because of better pay and jobs. It was our open economic system that drew and still draws people to America. The American dream is fundementally the chance to get rich. \n \n \nJust tell me why you hate this Country so much SP ? And if you live here, what keeps you here if we're so bad ?\n\n \n So you consider all historians to hate all nations because they understand the black marks in history? It pains me to watch religious people to become the reverse of the roles they used to play in the Middle Ages. Instead of keepers of knowledge, they become fighters for ignorance.",

Bin Laden is also believed to be hiding along the porous Pakistani-Afghan frontier.\n\n \n This is a perfect example of your limited and anti american attitudes that are based on either hatred for this Country or just plain ole ignorance. Just because Pakistan made a peace pact with Terrorists in order to secure their own citizens security on unprotected borders within their own country, it neither means we are promoting Terrorism nor does it mean we condone it.

I can not think of a single time in history where any nation has ever supported any group, or action within its own ranks, that was for the sole purpose of promoting the death and murder of innocents. There has always been a wider goal. Just to kill people for the sake of killing them is expensive and foolish. People (myself included) are\n haing trouble wrapping our heads around what you are saying because it is largely ignorant drivel. \n \n Unltimatly, history decides who was right and who was wrong in such cases. What makes the US fairly unique is that we are the ones writing the history on many of these events, and even WE can't find a way to justify them. We did it...it was evil....now a lot of the evil stuff we have done is coming back to bite us on the butt. \n \n The problem with doing things that are just plain wrong is that you reach a point where you get found out.

You can either own up to your errors and indiscretions, or you can flail around like an idiot, insist that you were NOT wrong, and go on the offensive OR you can admit that you made a mistake and try to make things right. \n \n Personally, I have done it both ways (I think most people have). I am now old enough, and wise enough, to recognize that the first way, while easier at the time, almost always ends with you being more screwed than you would have been if you had just admitted your mistake and tried to make things right. Unfortunatly the second way requires a depth of moral character that most Americans (yourself included) seem to lack anymore. They are not willing to say \"it was wrong of us to support policies and tyrants in the ME that cost millions of people their lives...so lets see what we can to to try to undo some of the damage that has been done\".\n \n So, instead, we flail around like XXXXXX claiming indignantly that WE never did anything WRONG.

Anyboyd who thinks that we can actually fight a \"war on terrorism\" and win is delusional and seriously needs to take a long hard look at history and at our budget. Not only can we not afford to fight an endless war against a phantom enemy, it is a war that we would almost certainly loose even if we DID have the money to fight it to the bloody end. \n \n Right now we could step back, admit that we have done some less than admirable things, and say we are going to try to make some ammends (and mean it) and we would be doing so from a position of relative strength...we are a long ways from being beten currently. The enemy knows they can beat a superpower...they have done it before and we taught them a full proof way to do it. They would just have to balance the advantages of a settlement now against another decade of uncertain sneak attacks. If, on the other hand, we wait another 5 years, we wil not be dealing form a position of strength. By then the cost of our war will have caused serious problems and it is less likely that our enemy would be willing to accept the move. \n \n Atilla never would have been able to attack the Romans if not for the fact that the Romans had alienated everybody on that part of the planet, so he found plenty of allies. \n \n Right now, I think it would be fair to say that more people on this planet would like to see the US fail than succeed. When a nation (or an empire) ends up in that situation it can only survive until either somebody decissive comes along that is willing to take action, with the support of those who would see us fail/\n\n I agree that we should aknowledge our main mistakes of the past and change the current administration's unilateral and arrogant foreign policy. It is such policies of the Bush administration that have so alienated the world. We were far more popular, or far less unpopular, under the more inclusive policies of Clinton. It seems to be mostly the Iraq war and our seemingly one-sided support of Israel, without any real efforts at peace dealing, which have most alienated other countries. \n \n The question of reparations is a far trickier one. Should current generations of Americans pay reparations (through taxes) for acts that were committed by their parent's and grandparent's generation to people where the majority of their populations did not directly experience the negative reprecussions of those acts? There are some African Americans who want to claim reparations for the fact that their ancestors were slaves. What limits does one place on reparations?\n \n Also, many situations are not so clear cut in their morality. We may be supporting Middle Eastern dictators but some of the alternatives are not also nasty to us but also rather nasty to most people in the MIddle East. I am thinking of the idea that those who practice militant extremist Islam might replace some of these dictatorial regimes, were their power to be significantly diminished, and be far worse to most involved in the government they impose. I understand that, in Iran, there was initially a lot of optimism about the government that overthrew the Shaw, where most people thought that there would actually be more democracy. The religious leaders at the time promised to stay out of the government decision making process but ended up backing out of that promise, to the great disappointment of many. The current nascent democracy movements have grown out of the continued frustration with that regime. \n \n As the title of this thread states, in general in the Middle East, the voices of moderate muslims are far too silent to stand up to the often ruthless tactics of extremist Islam. In conversations with a moderate Muslim friend of mine from Morrocco, he has expressed an opinion that a slow transition would be best, where the current regimes would be coerced into opening up more political and economic freedoms, allowing more moderate political and economic elements to flourish. \n \n All I am saying is that I agree that we should not blatantly exploit the Middle East for our own economic and political purposes but, at the same time, we should have a foreign policy that takes all political realities into account. A naively benevolent approach may not be the best answer either.",

Just to admit our past mistakes and say \"and from here on out, we are not going to be doing this kind of #### anymore\" would, IMO, be enough to break the back of those who would harm us....provided we actually mean it. \n \n \nAlso, many situations are not so clear cut in their morality. We may be supporting Middle Eastern dictators but some of the alternatives are not also nasty to us but also rather nasty to most people in the MIddle East.

The religious leaders at the time promised to stay out of the government decision making process but ended up backing out of that promise, to the great disappointment of many. The current nascent democracy movements have grown out of the continued frustration with that regime. \n\n \n You are correct. In the short term, we may end up with governments that oppose us, and we would have to prove to them that we mean what we say. Ultimatly, if we keep acting the way we have been, we will end up with governments that oppose us anyway. The difference is that if we help that process along, we MAY be able to deal with them. If not, we just have an enemy.\n \n Iran is a pretty good example. We had the Shaw in power...\"Our guy\". The government that replaced him was a direct result of his rule. They were completely opposed. The unity that is required in order for a nation to overthrow a tyrant is such that you never see \"half measures\". In order for the peoples overthrow to work, you have to have a polarized nation. The \"other guys\" pretty much have to be the exact opposite of what is already there. \n \n Interestingly enough, you see this same thing in democracies where people \"overthrow\" with their ballots. Typically a highly polarized nation is indicitive of an anti incumbent vote to come. It does not particularly matter which party or group is in power...when the nation becomes really polarized, they had best start packing their bags. \n \n \nAs the title of this thread states, in general in the Middle East, the voices of moderate muslims are far too silent to stand up to the often ruthless tactics of extremist Islam. In conversations with a moderate Muslim friend of mine from Morrocco, he has expressed an opinion that a slow transition would be best, where the current regimes would be coerced into opening up more political and economic freedoms, allowing more moderate political and economic elements to flourish. \n\n \n And a slow transition would be nice, if it would happen. History tells us it is not real likely. Typically political change does not occur over the course of centuries, or even decades, it happens in the course of a few years, or months. A lot of this seems to be becuase of the instability inherent to such a change. There will always be those who during the transition period will take advantage of the instability to encourage chaos. \n \n Obviously different nations will require a different approach. Morroco is a pretty good example of a nation that has made some slow changes over time and done a reasonable job of it. Given their background, I would say that their constitutional monarchy is in fact a reasonably good form of government for them. If they end up with a tyrant on the throne, that could change overnight. Morocco is one place that I have been where I was never afraid of the police. There are very few places like that.\n \n If we look at Saudi Arabia, though, the situation is completely different. There we have a monarcy with virtually no constraints. They rule thier people based on terror and violence. The most dispicable part is that the US has kept them in power. Without US intervention, aid, and support, the huse of saud would have crumbled 30 years ago. \n \n When I went to saudi arabia, my first day there a site foreman who had been in country for several years told me \"DO NOT let the police here take you. Run and make them shoot you, or fight to the death, but DO NOT let them take you. If they do you are dead anyway and nobody will ever know what happened to you. You will just vanish off the planet\". Even without that little warning, I was scared of the Saudi police just absed on the \"vibes\" they were giving off. I was scared of those guys from the minute I first got off the plane at the air port. \n \n Now, I will admit that jusdging a country based on how scary their cops are is kind of an arbitrary way of doing things, but I think that you will find that most people who have done a lot of world traveling will agree that it is a surprisingly relianble indicator of the general state of the country. There is a certain cocky arrogance that police tend to assume in nations where the rule of law means little, and they know that they can do just about anything they want to you and there is not a damn thing that you can do about it. \n \n I digress....\n \n Back to Saudi Arabia. Decades of tyranny and oppression, and we are directly responsible for it. Admitting our mistake there would certainly be difficult to do, and there is nothing that we can do that would \"fix\" those decades of oppression. There are, however, things tht we could do to ensure that we do not continue supporting oppression. If next week we got up and announced that the Sauds have 1 year to make major democratic reforms, or we are going to drop ALL support for the house of saud, you can bet your mothers wedding ring that they would act, and act FAST to ensure that they had some reforms in place. It would cost us very little, and if the Sauds failed to institutue those reforms, and the US completely stopped support, the house of saud would be a bad memory in a matter of a few weeks or (at the most) months. \n \n The problem with both scenarios is that any replacement government is likely to be Anti US. That is axiomatic. Currently, the people who are pro US in saudi arabia are pro US because it has enabled them to stay in power as tyrants. Their opposition is going to be anti tyrant and anti US. That is to be expected. If you actively commit acts of evil against people for decades and then give them a choice, they are going to oppose you. That is just reality.\n \n \nAll I am saying is that I agree that we should not blatantly exploit the Middle East for our own economic and political purposes but, at the same time, we should have a foreign policy that takes all political realities into account. A naively benevolent approach may not be the best answer either.\n\n \n I agree. In US foreign policy, I think that one of the worse mistakes we ever made was in deciding that our foreign policy was not constrained by constitutional principals. I am not necessarily saying that all trade should be prohibited with countries that do not allow their people certain freedoms that we consider to be important, but we should NOT have EVER started propping up people and governments who offer their people no rights and no freedoms. There is simply no percentage in it. Even if you move past the ethical considerations matters of practicality still come into play. \n \n I think the latest example of the practical problems can be found in S America. Throughout the Reagan years we supported tyrants and dictators and ran roughsnod all over S american in the name of capitalism (or \"opposing soviet expansion\" if you prefer the political spin label). Ultimatly, that was unsustainable. It turns out that even S American peasants have souls, minds, and feelings (who would have thought?) and eventually 1 of 2 things happen. Either the people get so ticked off at the tyrants we have been supporting and removes them one way or another, or the tyrants get too big for their britches and we have to smack them down (like panama). \n \n The problem that has arisen is S America, and arises elsewhere that we use similar strategies, is that then you end up with a bunch of people who not only don't agree with you, they also hate you, because you have behaved like a jackass. In the long run, it always seems to work out poorly.",

Some places tourists are relatively safe, it is just the locals that have to worry about abuse. In really totalitarian places there is usually no amnesty for tourists. There is a problem in Saudi Arabai waith people just vanishing...including Americans. If the American government asks the sauds about it they say \"never heard of the guy\" and that is pretty much the end of it. One of the big rules for travelling when we were in Saudi Arabia is that you travel in groups so there are witnesses. At least that way there is some evidence that they DO have you.\n \n Turkey is the same way as are several places in Africa. You will just disappear and if anybody comes looking they shrug and say \"never heard of the guy\". On my little \"scary cops\" ranking, Saudit Arabia tops the list, followed by trukey and Sierra Leone (though I hear that sierra leone is better anymore). The nations with the nicest cops are England, The Netherlands, and Sweden. Swedish cops are a LOT friendlier than British cops (you walk away from a swedish cop wondering if he was hitting on you) but the Britsh cops I have met were some of the most unthreatening, helpful individuals I have ever seen anywhere. It is almost like that take a \"protect and serve\" credo literally. They even treat annoying tourists like they are actual, honest to god people worthy of basic human respect.

There is a problem in Saudi Arabai waith people just vanishing...including Americans. \n\n Do you know why these Americans or foreigners in general are taken? Is it usually those who speak out against the injustices of the Saudi regime? It is scary to think that, as a tourist, one is not more imune from such treatment. We are so used to freedom of speech that criticisms could easily slip out. The people of the area are so used to the oppression that they would be very guarded in what they say.

I don't mean just lip service - I mean actual threats of withdrawal of support. Secondly, are they really still dependent on us for our support? I would think that all of their oil money can buy them the police protection they need to suppress popular revolt - at least on a small scale. They seem to be mainly successfully keeping away large scale revolt by supporting the Madrasas schools, and other such strongly Islamic practices.\n \nSo, what you are saying is that we put them in teh situation they are in, and it was wrong, and the situation is bad, so we should just make them live under the rule of tyrants for a decade or two because it would be more convenient for us?\n\n I am saying that history has often shown that slow change leads to a better result than change that is too abrupt. Revolutionaries rarely make good leaders in peacetime. I have heard that Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries (perhaps Saudi Arabia as well) ARE starting to introduce some democratic reforms, at least on the local scale with local elections.

If we don't, then we are doomed.\n \n Terrorism is not an ideology, it is a tool; but the terrorists kill for an ideology. They call that ideology Islam.\n \n The entire world, both Muslims and non-Muslims claim that the terrorists have hijacked \"the religion of peace\" and Islam does not condone violence.\n \n Who is right? Do the terrorists understand Islam better, or do those who decry them? The answer to this question is the key to our victory, and failure to find that key will result in our loss and death will be upon us. The key is in the Quran and the history of Islam.\n \n Those of us, who know Islam, know that the understanding of the terrorists of Islam is correct. They are doing nothing that their prophet did not do and did not encourage his followers to do. Murder, rape, assassination, beheading, massacre and sacrilege of the dead \"to delight the hearts of the believers\" were all practiced by Muhammad, were taught by him and were observed by Muslims throughout their history.\n \n If truth has ever mattered, it matters most now! This is the time that we have to call a spade a spade. This is the time that we have to find the root of the problem and eradicate it. The root of Islamic terrorism is Islam. The proof of that is the Quran.\n \n We are a group of ex-Muslims who have seen the face of the evil and have risen to warn the world. No matter how painful the truth may be, only truth can set us free. Why this much denial? Why so much obstinacy? How many more innocent lives should be lost before YOU open your eyes?\n \n We urge the Muslims to leave Islam. Stop with excuses, justifications and rationalizations. Stop dividing mankind into \"us\" vs. \"them\" and Muslims vs. Kafirs. We are One people, One mankind! Muhammad was not a messenger of God. It is time that we end this insanity and face the truth. The terrorists take their moral support and the validation for their actions from you. Your very adherence to their cult of death is a nod of approval for their crimes against humanity.\n \n We also urge the non-Muslims to stop being politically correct lest they hurt the sensitivities of the Muslims. To Hell with their sensitivities! Let us save their lives, and the lives of millions of innocent people.\n \n Millions, if not billions of lives will be lost if we do nothing. Time is running out! \"All it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing.\" Do something! Send this message to everyone in your address book and ask them to do the same. Defeat Islam and stop terrorism. This is your world, save it.\n \n The ex-Muslim Movement\n \n www.faithfreedom.org\n \n \n [ Back to About FFI | Sections index",

I have responded to posters who have ignorantly and blindly told me with great confidence that my declared personal relationship with the Living God is a figmant of my imagination that at the end of their lives when the truth is known to all, they will learn how wrong they were in rejecting the truth I share regarding the salvation that comes by Grace to those who accept what Jesus did for us on the Cross.\n \n It is you who extrapolate from that that rejecting God leads to hell and damnation, not that I said it. \n \n \nHow else would you interpret someone who says to his opponents that they'll burn in hell for eternity for disagreeing as someone who DOESN'T preach hatred, bigotry, fear, ignorance and intolerance?

All will see clearly at that time and will know and understand that it was they who spent their lives rejecting God and his Truths, not God who rejected them at all. So I'm not condemning anyone to hell at all. I never would. But neither can I control your ignorant perceptions. In fact, those who reject the Lord in life will condemn themselves to separation from him for eternity, not He who will condemn them. They will understand and agree that they chose their own fate and weren't rejected by His unending love.\n \n \n quite. No one knows if they are going to Heaven.

To claim that one already has achieved salvation is to supercede the will of God with their own, did not Satan do just that? Assert his will over God's? Look where that got him.\n\n \n If you're a moslem this is true because they have no assurance in ultimate salvation. They must perform, work and then hope what they do is good enough to be accepted by their god in the end. And as islam has shown their god demands they kill, murder and basically destroy in order to lift him up as their god. My God is love, grace and unconditional forgiveness. But never forget that that gift of forgiveness must be received by each individual and isn't a blanket covering available to those who spend their lives standing and speaking against God's principles and standards. And as to your insistence that we can never know that we are saved while here, just read the verse in my signature at the bottom of this page and then reconsider your insistence that I don't know for certain that I am saved once and for all time based on the PERSONAL aspect of our relationship. He dwells within me and lives through me. You can't relate to or understand this but never the less it is a fact of life for multiple millions of people alive right now and all around you.\n \n \nFaith doesn't earn salvation. Salvation cannot be earned.\n\n \n Who said it does ? I quoted a verse from the bible that say's It is by grace that we are saved through faith and not by works, so that no man may boast. And you respond by making the above statement as if you possess some deep insight. So tell me, how is accepting that Jesus died for our sins and took them upon Himself which leads to our salvation, and our accepting this by faith, lead to trying to work ones way into heaven ?
