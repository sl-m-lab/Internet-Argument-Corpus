   "Sounds great! Boring never!\n Love the pick up too!\n\n \n Thanks! :)\n \n The Chev vs Ford wars were intense back then! I had heard that the owner of Thorn Hill (a farmer) was a die hard Ford man, as was I, but the Chevrolets ruled down there. (never saw the owner around during the races) There just weren't that many Fords around, and the ones that were usually weren't much. No bracket racing back then, all \"class\" racing. Cars were classified by how they were equipped. \"Stock\", \"modified\" \"altered\" etc. When different classes ran against each other in the final money rounds, there were \"spots\" (head starts) to equalize them. Almost all 4 speeds, very few automatics. Really something watching them blast off the line - seems like they didn't go 30 feet before they were grabbing second gear - no helmets, those long haired guys of that era haha, their hair would be straight back! I remember one guy kept breaking bolts in his seat mounts! They really laid into those shifts! \n \n So many Novas, Camaros, Chevelles, and of course, the 55 - 57 Chevs. A few ho-hum Mustangs, but every once in a while a big body Ford would show up that knew what he was doing, and it was quite fun to watch. Once there was a really clean maroon 64 Galaxie, stock looking except for wide slicks, bubble hood and 427 emblems. (no advertising, seldom any advertising anywhere at that track) He only showed up 4 or 5 weekends, but was always right there at the end - won top money once or twice. (it was a mid 11's piece) My best memory was a somewhat faded blue 68 Torino fastback with a 428. Final round, he was up against an almost new Nova, 396 I think. The Ford seemed to bog off the line a little, but really turned on at the top end. The Nova got the head start. I bet a quarter on it with some disgusting high school classmate who was there watching too. Both 4 speeds, that Nova left really strong, it seemed like he was 1/4 of way gone when the ol Ford dug in and took off after him. The Ford barely edged him - I must have gone 3 feet in the air, I was never so happy to grab that quarter from a red faced guy in my life!!!\n \n Memories are a fun part of getting old!",

   "Cars we used to dream about in England !\n Youve lived the dream man!\n\n \n Oh, I don't know about that - the grass is always greener on the other side. :) I've missed some things by never seeing England, I do hope to visit someday. Or Australia! They've got some real car nuts down there! \n \n So much of car racing in the U.S. was born of bootlegging. Thorn Hill was no different. Page down about 2/3 of the way in this link, and read some interesting stuff about Thorn Hill. Ralf Payne was the Ford-man owner I was referring to above. Several years after I lost interest in going there, one of my mechanic friends used to do work on Ralf's farm equipment. Ralf was never shy about calling any hour of the day - my friend's wife referred to him as Ralf Payne-in-the-a$$. I regret never taking the time to tag along with him and meeting Ralf. \n \n In my quick search finding that link, I also found some other facts about the track - still in full operation, but just a 1/8 mile track now. Opened in 1953. It's hours of operation have been severely restricted by people building/moving in close by, then complaining about the noise. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I distinctly remember the occasional stopping of the racing action in the early seventies to let a small plane land, just like the above airfield link says. I'll have to dig for more history on that place when I get time, I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Don't know for sure if anyone was ever killed there, but it wouldn't surprise me. I never witnessed it, but I know lots of cars went down the last half of the track on their tops, lots of fights too! emoticon_emb\n \n Sorry to hijack JP, but this thread may not have gone far without it. I'd like to see more drag racing stories, or pics of others personally built rides.",

Of course, we'll need to add a rear wing and other aero goodies before putting it on \"kill\". My son and I bought the roller (car w/o engine and trans) almost 3 years ago now. Originally, it was going to get a 632\" BBC engine w/N2O, but we knew a motor builder that told us that the fastest turbo motor was for sale because the owner was switching to an LSX motor class, so I picked it up instead. My son did the majority of the work, including rewiring the entire car, plumbing the turbo system and intercooler, trans cooler, etc., \n Our original intent was to build it to run on E85, so we had 8 x 160# injectors in the intake manifold and 8 more in the throttle body. But, upon advice from a couple of top engine builders and tuners, they advised against it. So for now it's a conventional race gas (C16) turbo motor. Later, we'll play with the 16 injectors and convert it to E85. \n \n \nA thing of beauty indeed!\n\n \n Thanks. We still need to finish painting the hood and doing the bodywork on the rear fenders where it was tubbed.\n \n \nBlack is beautiful! \n \n I used to love to watch drag racing in my younger days (early 70's) - I used to go the track just about every weekend.
