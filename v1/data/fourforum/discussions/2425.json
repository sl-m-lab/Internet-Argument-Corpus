Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, known as UNMOVIC, and played a key role in the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He led the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency from 1981-1997.\n \n He said it was likely the sarin gas used could have been from a leftover shell found in a chemical dump.\n \n \"It doesn't sound absurd at all. There can be debris from the past and that's a very different thing from have stocks and supplies,\" he said. \"I think we need to know more about it.\"\n \n Blix, whose inspection team didn't make any significant weapons finds during months of searching Iraq before the war, has sharply criticized the United States and Britain for their invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\n \n \nThe inspectors were ordered out just before the war began last March, but Blix has said he knew by May \"that there were no weapons to be found\" because the Americans had interrogated many Iraqis and offered reward money for information -- with no results.\n\n \n For those of us who bother watching international stations for international news, this was a no brainer, almost certain to happen. The UN inspection team did not detroy everything they found (uncluding some weapons ontaining mustrd gas that are still unaccounted for). Directly following the invasion, Blix threw a little hissy fit vecause the US had failed to secure the facilities that the inspection team had sealed or where materials that wre tagged for destruction were held (including the chemical dumps, where the UN team disposed of hundreds of such weapons by removing th propellants and keeping the csings intacy as containment vessels).\n \n I am going to have to see a lot more than a single 20 yr olf shell, which both of the former head weapoins inspectors say prove nothing, before I change my mind.\n \n \n I am surprised you \"there ARE WMD's\" folks are harping on tis. Iy looks far better for the US to say \"we thoguht he had hundreds of tons of WMDs and were wrong\" than it does to try to justify the war over a single artillery shell./",

They decomissioned them by removing the propulsion system, then they placed them in a chemical dump (under guard) with the weapon casing intact as the containment vessel. They planned to cover the chemical dumps with concrete, then bury them. Instead, we blew in there guns blazing, the guards left at the beginning of the invasion, and all those shells that the UN inspectors had decomissioned and were awaiting burial were left unprotected. This would account for why the shell was full. The shells that the IRaqis decomissioned (before the UN started overseeing everything) were actually disassembeled and the agents detroyed in an incinerator. The UN put an end to this de to the fact that the fumes from incinerating these compounds were too toxic.\n \n They are still worthless as shells, since they have no propellant, and the propellant tubes cannot be rebuilt or reattached. They could, hwever, use the contents as weapons (which is why they planned to cover them with concrete and bury them....this is what they do with chemical dumps).

Besides, we're too politically hamstrung to do anything - we won't even use air support, while we keep screwing with Sadr in Fallujah and elsewhere.

Wait! There are chemical dumps full of chemical weapons over there that haven't been secured!\"\n \n How would putting concrete over it eliminate the weapons? Couldn't you pull up the concrete?\n\n \n It was the UN that put shells in the chemical dumps, not saddam, and they had them guarded.\n \n When they cap a chemical dump with concrete (They do this in the US as well) they use tons, or even hundreds of tons, of the stuff. it encapsulates the containers, so it is not simply a matter of pulling a cap off, you would have to chisel away at the concrete until you found what you were after. In the case of something like sarin or mustard gas, which can easily be produced in a well equiped high school chemistry lab, it would be easier to just make more.\n \n The UN was aware that the weapons were in the dumps, which is why they were havign them guarded. When we moved in, we failed to secure them, most likely because we didn't have enough manpower.\n \n \n \nI would of figgered you'd realize that the media is no friend of the non-leftists... \n \n \n It could also be because when even the secretary of defense gets up there and downplays the find, it is pretty hard to turn it into a headline. What ould it say? \"Secretary of defense says too early to tell on sarin shell\"? \n \n Personally, I think they are downplaying it (Rumsfeld and powell, who has admitted we were wrong about WMDs) because they think along the same lines as Blix, that this came from a chemical dumpt that was formerly secure. If that turns out to be the case, I think they would prefer to let the story die quitely rather than making a big case of the fact that terrorists now have access to chemical weapons because of our failure to secure weapons that were previously secure.\n \n The possible implications of this are pretty bad. Suppose a shell from an IRaqi chemical dump shows up in a chemical weapon attack on london. I think it would make the anti american outcry in regards to the war look like a whisper. \n \n Much better to leave this one quiet and uninvestigated, at least publicly.",

Most of them are harmful, sometimes even more harmful, whe incinerated than they are as a compound. THere have been some advances in plasma incinerators and such that incinerate completely, but even a relatively small one required several megawatts in order to operate. IRaq doesn;t have that kind of power available (short of taking a city offline to power the incinerator.\n \n We use several industrial chemicals, and they cost a small fortune to dispose of for the same reason.

   "\"By 1968, production of unitary chemical weapons in the US had stopped and the Army\n was disposing of the obsolete weapons by deep ocean dumping, land burial and open-pit\n burning. However, increased environmental awareness and concern led to the banning of\n these methods. In 1969, a National Academy of Science study concluded that ocean\n dumping should be abandoned and in 1972 Congress passed the Marine Protection Act\n which prohibited any further ocean disposal (Bradbury, et al., 1994).\n \n Between 1973 and 1982, the Army extensively researched neutralization, but by 1982 had\n made the decision to use incineration as the preferred technology for chemical weapons\n disposal without input from local citizens. To satisfy the requirement of public\n participation in the decision making process as mandated by the National Environmental\n Protection Act (NEPA), the Army held public Scoping Meetings at all stockpile sites for\n after-the-fact meetings regarding Environmental Impact Statements.

At that time little was understood about the risks of\n incineration, but local citizens were uneasy enough to not want it in their own backyards\n and generally preferred transportation to on-site incineration.

   "Sarin Shells Made Before 1991 War \n \n United Press International \n \n The 155-mm shells containing sarin gas that exploded in Iraq May 17 were manufactured before 1991, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. That was a pre-Gulf War shell, a different category than the weapons being sought by the Iraq Survey Group, Brig. Gen. David Rodriguez, the joint staff deputy director for operations, told a Pentagon news briefing. \n \n The artillery shells were rigged to explode as a roadside bomb but failed to detonate. Apparently unknown to the bomber, the shells did not contain explosives but two liquid chemicals that were meant to mix and create sarin, a deadly nerve agent. \n \n U.S. Army soldiers found the shells and detonated them in place, releasing a small amount of sarin gas that sickened them. \n \n Rodriguez said the sarin shells were the only ones of their kind found yet. \n \n It's the only two we've seen the entire time, said Rodriguez. \n \n An artillery shell bearing traces of mustard gas was discovered in Baghdad, Knight-Ridder reported May 7. \n \n Neither find is being offered as evidence of Saddam Hussein's alleged illegal weapons programs, one of the prime reasons offered by the Bush administration for the March 2003 invasion and war. \n \n Saddam's forces used both sarin and mustard gas against Kurds in Halabja in the 1980s. \n \n \n Photo Copyright Getty Images \n \n \n \u00a9 YellowBrix, Inc.

Invasions always work better than inspections.\n \n \n Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass\n destruction, did we?\n \n A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden.

If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in\n a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war\n with them?\n \n A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons,\n so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.\n \n \n Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die if they had\n all those big weapons to fight us back with?\n \n A: It's a different culture.

We had another good reason to invade them anyway.\n \n \n Q: And what was that?\n \n A: Even if Iraqdidn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was\n a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.\n \n \n Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his\n country?\n \n A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.\n \n Q: Kind of like what they do in China?\n \n A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq.

Cuba, on the other\n hand, is not.\n \n \n \n Q: How come Cubaisn't a good economic competitor?\n \n A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws\n that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba\n until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.\n \n \n \n Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba, and started\n doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become\n capitalists?\n \n A: Don't be a smart-***.\n \n \n \n Q: I didn't think I was being one.\n \n A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.\n \n \n \n Q: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement?\n \n A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein\n came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate\n leader anyway.\n \n \n \n Q: What's a military coup?\n \n A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country\n by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United\n States.\n \n \n \n Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistancome to power by a military coup?\n \n A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf?

Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped\n us invade Afghanistan.\n \n \n \n Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?\n \n A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.\n \n \n \n Q: What did Afghanistando to us on September 11th?\n \n A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians\n hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings, killing\n over 3,000 Americans.\n \n \n \n Q: So how did Afghanistanfigure into all that?\n \n A: Afghanistanwas where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule\n of the Taliban.\n \n \n \n Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's\n heads and hands?\n \n A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's\n heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.\n \n \n \n Q: Didn't the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back\n in May of 2001?\n \n A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job\n fighting drugs.\n \n \n \n Q: Fighting drugs?\n \n A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing\n opium poppies.\n \n \n \n Q: How did they do such a good job?\n \n A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would\n have their hands and heads cut off.\n \n \n \n Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing\n flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for\n other reasons?\n \n A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off\n people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off\n people's hands for stealing bread.\n \n \n \n Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?\n \n A: That's different. Afghanistanwas ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that\n oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they were in\n public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.\n \n \n \n Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too?\n \n A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body covering.\n \n \n \n Q: What's the difference?\n \n A: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet\n fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes\n and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of Patriarchal\n oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and\n fingers.\n \n \n \n Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different name.\n \n A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistanand Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our\n friends.\n \n \n \n Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were\n from Saudi Arabia.\n \n A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.\n \n \n \n Q: Who trained them?\n \n A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.\n \n \n \n Q: Was he from Afghanistan?\n \n A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabiatoo. But he was a bad man, a very bad\n man.\n \n \n \n Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.\n \n A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of\n Afghanistanback in the 1980s.\n \n \n \n Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Reagan\n talked about?\n \n A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Unionbroke up in 1990 or\n thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call\n them Russians now.\n \n \n \n Q: So the Soviets, I mean the Russians, are now our friends?\n \n A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after\n they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided not to support our\n invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at the French\n and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqeither.\n \n \n Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?\n \n A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French\n fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.\n \n \n Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we\n want them to do?\n \n A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we invade.\n \n \n Q: But wasn't Iraqone of our friends back in the 1980s?\n \n A: Well, yeah. For a while.\n \n Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraqback then?\n \n A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our\n friend, temporarily.\n \n \n \n Q: Why did that make him our friend?\n \n A: Because at that time, Iranwas our enemy.\n \n \n \n Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?\n \n A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iranat the time, we looked the\n other way, to show him we were his friend.\n \n \n \n Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes\n our friend?\n \n A: Most of the time, yes.\n \n \n \n Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an\n enemy?\n \n A: Sometimes that's true, too. However, if American corporations can\n profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better.\n \n \n \n Q: Why?\n \n A: Because war is good for the economy, which means war is good for\n America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is\n a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked\n Iraq?\n \n \n Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to, right?\n \n A: Yes.\n \n \n Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?\n \n A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him\n what to do.\n \n \n Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraqbecause George\n W. Bush hears voices in his head?\n \n A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes,\n make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.\n \n \n \n Good night, Daddy.",

   "Yeah, and in the same format please. :p\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Part 1:\n I like this going around the net at the moment...\n \n Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?\n \n A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction which they had used against their own people and against Iran.\n \n Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.\n \n A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them. They fooled inspectors into believing that they were talking to Iraqi scientists when in fact they weren't. They only let inspectors go where Saddam wanted them to and NEVER to Saddam's mansions.\n \n Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?\n \n A: Yep. When Saddam refused to obey a decade old UN Resolution to allow inspections, the US decided \"enough was enough\". He had made a mockery of the UN for too long.\n \n \n Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass\n destruction, did we?\n \n A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we're finding\n some.\n \n \n Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction?\n \n A: To use them in a war, silly.\n \n \n Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in\n a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war\n with them?\n \n A: Well, obviously they didn't use them on the US because we were prepared to counter them and would eventually try all of the Iraqi soldiers, who didn't really like Saddam, for war crimes after we mopped the desert with them.\n \n Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die if they had\n all those big weapons to fight us back with?\n \n A: They didn't choose to die by the thousands. They surrendered in masse just like they did during the first Gulf War. You see, there aren't a lot of soldiers that will remain loyal to a madman if a country as powerful as the US wants him gone.\n \n Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons\n our government said they did.\n \n A: Well, if they didn't have them, then why would their leader continue to refuse open inspections and cost his country $100's of Billions in lost oil sales as a result of the UN's Resolution NOT to allow the sale of Iraqi oil except for food?\n \n Q: And what was that?\n \n A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was\n a cruel dictator, who practiced genocide on his own people, raped, tortured and killed those who opposed him and was openly defiant of International Law, which was another good reason to invade another country.\n \n \n Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his\n country?\n \n A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people. For others, he harbored terrorists and invaded neighboring countries.\n \n Q: Kind of like what they do in China?\n \n A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China hasn't invaded a neighboring nation. The last time it did, we fought them in Korea.\n \n Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate\n gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?\n \n A: Is it exploitation to give a poor person a job, even if the wages aren't up to US standards or do we do the \"moral thing\" and let them starve with dignity?\n \n \n Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?\n \n A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the government. People\n who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.\n \n Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?\n \n A: Sometimes\n \n Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?\n \n A: About a billion people. Do you think that we should take on China if you don't even think that we should have fought Iraq?\n \n Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?\n \n A: Yes, Communists are bad.\n \n Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?\n \n A: Well, for one thing, Cuba is 60 miles from the shores of the US and in the past, they had tried to set up nuclear missile that could be aimed at the US.\n \n Q: Like in Iraq?\n \n A: No. Iraq didn't have Russian-made nukes as Cuba did. They attempted to build their own with the help of a French-designed and built breeder reactor that the Israelis destroyed before it became functional. \n \n Q: And like in China, too?\n \n A: No, thanks to Bill Clinton, China has a nuclear missile capable of hitting the US.\n \n Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?\n \n A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws\n that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba\n until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.\n \n Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba, and started\n doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become\n capitalists?\n \n A: No. As long as Castro is in control, the money will be used to feed his ego, just like in Iraq.\n \n They also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.\n \n Q: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement?\n \n Ayes. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup.\n \n Q: What's a military coup?\n \n A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country\n by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United\n States.\n Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?\n \n A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan wasn't a threat to US interests.\n \n Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?\n \n A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was our friend. \n \n \n Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly\n overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate\n leader?\n \n A: If it was only that simple.\n \n Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?\n \n A: Because they harbored those that planned and executed the WTC attacks on September 11th.\n \n Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?\n \n A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians\n hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings, killing\n over 3,000 Americans led by Osama Bin Laden who was protected by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n \n Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?\n \n A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule\n of the Taliban.\n \n Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's\n heads and hands?\n \n A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's\n heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.\n \n Q: Didn't the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back\n in May of 2001?\n \n A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job\n fighting drugs.\n \n Q: Fighting drugs?\n A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing\n opium poppies or so we thought. Since Clinton had gutted our CIA's ability to conduct covert operations, we didn't exactly have a clear picture .\n \n Q: How did they do such a good job?\n \n A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would\n have their hands and heads cut off.\n \n Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing\n flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for\n other reasons?\n \n A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off\n people's hands for spreading illegal drugs throughout the world. It's an ugly business that demands tough punishments.\n \n Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?\n \n A: Sometimes. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that promoted and harbored terrorists, oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.\n \n Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too?\n \n A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body covering.\n \n Q: What's the difference?\n \n A: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet\n fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes\n and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of Patriarchal\n oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and\n fingers.\n \n Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different name.\n \n A: Yep. They are, after all, both Muslim countries.\n \n Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were\n from Saudi Arabia.\n \n A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.\n \n Q: Who trained them?\n \n A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.\n \n End of part 1.",

   "You need to add a few things to this...\n \n \nPart 1:\n I like this going around the net at the moment...\n \n Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?\n \n A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction which they had used against their own people and against Iran.\n\n \n which they'd purchesed from the USA, with Ronald Regan's blessing, whilst Regan sold arms to Iran as well.\n \n \nQ: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.\n \n A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them. They fooled inspectors into believing that they were talking to Iraqi scientists when in fact they weren?t.

When Saddam refused to obey a decade old UN Resolution to allow inspections, the US decided ?enough was enough?. He had made a mockery of the UN for too long.\n\n \n But the UN wasn't agreed that invasion was the best option, at that time. Hence the security council members France and Russia opposed the war.\n \n \nQ: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, did we?\n \n A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we're finding some.\n\n \n Although the US had massive amounts of 'evidence' of them being in existence, between the taking of the photos and the invasion Sadaam must have just hid them all, all the while those same sattelites were still watching him and they missed that too!\n \n \nQ: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction?\n \n A: To use them in a war, silly.\n\n \n And the US was perfectly happy to sell them.\n \n \nQ: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them?\n \n A: Well, obviously they didn?t use them on the US because we were prepared to counter them and would eventually try all of the Iraqi soldiers, who didn?t really like Saddam, for war crimes after we mopped the desert with them.\n\n \n Well, the Iraqiis had used them against Iran, as you've just agreed.

The last time it did, we fought them in Korea.\n\n \n You forgot about Tibet, but never mind! China's warred against India and Vietnam, supported regiemes in as far-flung nations as Albania, and Cambodia. Never mind that too!\n \n \nQ: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate\n gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?\n \n A: Is it exploitation to give a poor person a job, even if the wages aren?t up to US standards or do we do the ?moral thing? and let them starve with dignity?\n\n \n How noble.\n \n \nQ: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?\n \n A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the government.

   "Commission finds no Iraq-Sept 11 link \n \n The official investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks says in a report there is no \"credible evidence\" that Iraq helped Al Qaeda in any attacks against the United States.\n \n But it does say Pakistan helped the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to harbour Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before the US war to overthrow the hardline Afghan militia in late 2001.\n \n The preliminary report, issued as the official inquiry held two days of public hearings into the September 11 plot, appeared to contradict US administration claims of links between Al Qaeda and ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.\n \n Vice President Dick Cheney said again on Monday that Saddam was a \"patron of terrorism\" who had \"long-established ties with Al Qaeda\".\n \n The report said bin Laden \"explored possible cooperation with Iraq\" while he was based in Sudan in the early 1990s, even though he opposed the secular regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was ousted by a US-led coalition last year. \n \n \"A senior Iraqi intelligence official reportedly made three visits to Sudan, finally meeting bin Laden in 1994,\" the report said. \n \n It added that bin Laden requested space to establish training camps and help in securing weapons.\n \n \n The investigation said there were also reports of contacts with Baghdad after bin Laden returned to Afghanistan, \"but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship.\" \n 'No credible evidence'\n \n \"Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties exist between Al Qaeda and Iraq,\" said the report. \n \n \"We have no credible evidence that Iraq and Al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States.\" \n \n The report gave details on the rise of Islamic militants such as bin Laden and the Taliban before the devastating attacks on New York and Washington, which left about 3,000 dead. \n \n It said Pakistan helped the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to give a haven to Al Qaeda in the face of international pressure and that Pakistan broke with the Taliban only after September 11, even though it knew the militia was hiding bin Laden. \n \n \"The Taliban's ability to provide bin Laden a haven in the face of international pressure and UN sanctions was significantly facilitated by Pakistani support,\" said the report. \n \n \"Pakistan benefitted from the Taliban-Al Qaeda relationship, as bin Laden's camps trained and equipped fighters for Pakistan's ongoing struggle with India over Kashmir.\" \n \n The official investigation has already been highly critical of US intelligence failures and highlighted many signs of the impending attacks by Al Qaeda hijackers. \n \n The US administration, including President George W Bush, has insisted, however, that there was nothing that indicated the date and target of the attacks. \n \n The final official report is to be handed over to the administration next month. \n \n -- AFP\n \n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200406/s1133582.htm",

For the most part, we don't get involved unless it's to \"beat up on the white guys in Africa\". Our track record in Africa, other than helping the collapse of white rule in South Africa (which was ultimately worse for SA) is dismal. Somalia was a farce. We turned our backs on Rwanda because we \"expected\" black-ruled Africa to act barbaric, we traded with IdI Amin Dada, etc. Suffice it to say that we have ZERO idea on how to \"help\" in Africa.\n But, that being said, there's still no reason to think that ridding Iraq of Saddam was a bad thing to do.
