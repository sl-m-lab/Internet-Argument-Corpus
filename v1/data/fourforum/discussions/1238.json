Russia is still there however, but has been softening policy and becoming much more of an ally to the US. And I think you mean, who would win a war between the 2? If it was conventional, The US would probably sweep them without too much problem. If it was still the USSR with it's vast resources, then perhaps it would be a problem. Russia's military has been drastically downsized since the end of the cold war, and the funding severely limited. If it was an all out nuclear conflict, it seems clear to me that nobody wins. We can make lots of nukes pass each other on their way to their targets, we might have a few more than them now, but what is the point. We both have enough to guarantee the total destruction of each others country, and probably the world. In the case of nuclear war, I don't think anyone really wins.",

I hope the U.S. doesn't expect those countries to just release Iraq of it's Debts.\n\n \n I'm not sure why Russia was so powerful with communism. Perhaps someone can fill us in on why that was such a success for a short period of time.\n \n Regardless of that communism was also the cause of the fall of the once powerful Russian nation. It wasn't democracy or the free market that caused Russia to crumble although the transission between communism and free market caused the Russian GDP to fall around 33% in seven years. This left Russias GDP somewhere around $690 billion compared to the $1050 billion GDP they had before the fall of communism in 1990. So at that time the Russian economy looked in peril but it began turning around in 1997. Today the Russian GDP is closer to $1350 billion meaning it has jumped 95% in six year. The Russian government expects that GDP growth will be around 5.8% until 2010 meaning that Russia will have a GDP of close to $2100 billion by 2010. Their GDP is currently the 10th highest in the world and their expected growth rate will keep their GDP growing far faster than the average industrialized nation for the forseeable future.\n \n Capitalism is not a resounding success in Russia as can be seen by the crime, corruption, and poor organization of the country as a whole. Still Russia has been steadily improving it's countries wealth for years now and is once again a force to be recogned with. For this reason I don't expect that they will be looking to go to war with the US in order to gain power. They are gaining power right now because of their relationship with the rest of the world. Why would they risk that by going to war or selling WMDs?",

Is it Russia and a war with the US or is middle east oil, or is it Iraqi debts?\n\n \n I think Rapture is attempting to think of reasons why their should be friction between the US and Russia. The best reason a few years back would be that the Russians were helped primarily by the US to transform their country from communism to capitalism. The attempt faced enourmous failures and really the US is partially to blame for it. No one would have expected how difficult it would be to transform the entire nature of the country and the Russians did hate us for it for a time. However those days are being forgotten now as Russia pushes forward. Today I would have to believe that Russia is more afraid of internal strife and conflict than they are about fighting a war against the most powerful nation on Earth. They are also concerned about the spread of European influences into the former parts of the Soviet Union.\n \n Perhaps 20 years from now Russia and the EU will be at war but even then I can't say that I would know for sure that the US would be facing off against Russia. The US has a growing list of problems with the EU and more and more reason to work along side with the Russians.",
