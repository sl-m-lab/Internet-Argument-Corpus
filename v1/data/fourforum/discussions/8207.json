Fundamental Christianity teaches, \"Repent and be baptized, and believe in Jesus Christ and you will be forgiven, eternally saved. They then go about doing the exact opposite to what the one they supposedly believe in said they should do in His sermon on the Mount.\n \n Many, or most Christians deny they are evil, and yet they are totally materialistic, carnal, and selfish. I said many, or even most but not all. I have met one or two who never portrayed these characteristics, and they were women.\n \n .\n \n .\n \n They passed that law here. I bought one of those plastic cases that cover all that XXXX. Now there's suggesting banning the plastic boxes? What a bunch of moorons. I suggested to the government that legislated this undemocratic law that we should maybe put pictures on the dashboard's or bonnets of cars of mangled dead bodies of children and babies killed in car accidents to try and curb road deaths. Naturally, no response. More people die on our roads than die of smoking.\n \n I see where you are coming from. You know that I have, of my own free will read it \"selfishly\" several times trying to get what I can out of it, and I can tell you that unless I have missed something, reading the Bible does not make one religious.
