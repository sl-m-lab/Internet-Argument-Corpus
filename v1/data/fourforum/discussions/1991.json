   "Hey, wondering if anyone can add more to the information I already have. My partner and I have to make a powerpoint on how the conservative cultural backlash of the 70s/80s affected\n domestic political reaction\n generational attitudes\n court decisions\n social tensions\n creation of new conservative organizations.\n \n Also, we need some background on the topic. For example, Roe v Wade (1973) was a pinnacle of the women's rights/abortion movement and created an atmosphere that encouraged those who would fight against such decisions. There's also the Reagen Revolution as compared to the socialist programs of LBJ . . . etc . . . etc\n Any help would be appreciated (from either side).",
