You may or may not be aware of the 1916 Easter Rising that took place in Ireland (well it was really centered around Dublin). Anyway the Irish Rebels took over certain key buildings around Dublin a dug themselves in (they can't be really be compared to the worst category of terrorist we see today - although IIRC many civilians were killed in the ensuing conflict), there was a split in the Irish over the rising due to arguements about supporting the British in WW1 (which many Irishmen fought in) and over the fact that \"home rule\" (that is, a parliament to deal with domestic Irish issues) had finally been granted but had been postponed due to WW1. Anyway, the rebels lacked popular support and got mashed by the British (as one does when fighting a technologically and numerically superior foe coventionally). Afterwards, the British executed a number of the leaders and this caused outrage across Ireland and won popular support for the Republican movement.

   "...\n \n \n ...\n \n \n \n \n ...\n \n It's been said a thousand times but I'l say it again \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\". I hate the IRA now, they are nothing but thugs, but if I grew up a generation ago when Catholics in the north were being oppressed, who knows what I would think?\nANYBODY using a car bomb or the like for surprize bombings of innocent people is a terrorist no matter whose freedom he is fighting for. Surprize attacks and bombings should be restricted to armies AT WAR with other armies. Civilians and gorilla fighters who use such tactics should be killed for it.\n \n \n \n...I thought you were advocating large scale military action to hunt down and slaughter every last terrorist and anyone who sympathises with them, If I thought you meant a process under the law then this whole debate never would have emerged.\nThere has to be some legal method of identifying terrorists. However, in the case of a known terrorist camp and a fire fight to capture them, I say KILL AS MANY AS YOU CAN. Anyone who doesn't come out with his hands up, waving a white flag SHOULD BE KILLED AT THE SITE!\n \n \n \n ...\n \n \n \n \n ...\n \n \n \n\n No. Depends on context. Depends on context. Depends on context. Murderous does not necessarily equal cowardly. Prudent and practical does not necessarily equal cowadly.\nKilling by surprize is cowardly (except in declared war).\n \n \n \n\n Depends on context. Besides, any soldiers takes cover when prudent.Modern military uniforms are designed to give camoflage you know.\nThe main purpose of uniforms is to provide matched clothing in order to identify friends and foes.\n \n \n \n ...\n \n \n \n\n And if they don't have a free society? Or they have no way to politically influence a foreign power that they perceive as a threat?\nAll groups have influence. The Polish Catholics, the Pope and Ronald Reagan caused the collapse of communism in Poland...without firing a shot.\n \n \n \n ...\n \n\n EDIT: I would just like to add an example from Irish history as a comment on the execution of all those convicted of terrorism. You may or may not be aware of the 1916 Easter Rising that took place in Ireland (well it was really centered around Dublin). Anyway the Irish Rebels took over certain key buildings around Dublin a dug themselves in (they can't be really be compared to the worst category of terrorist we see today - although IIRC many civilians were killed in the ensuing conflict), there was a split in the Irish over the rising due to arguements about supporting the British in WW1 (which many Irishmen fought in) and over the fact that \"home rule\" (that is, a parliament to deal with domestic Irish issues) had finally been granted but had been postponed due to WW1. Anyway, the rebels lacked popular support and got mashed by the British (as one does when fighting a technologically and numerically superior foe coventionally). Afterwards, the British executed a number of the leaders and this caused outrage across Ireland and won popular support for the Republican movement. (Churchill, intelligent man that he was, warned that this would happen). It is widely beleived that had those executions not taken place the Republic of Ireland would not exist today.\nI did not say that people should be prohibited from rising up against an oppressive government with firearms. (The United States would still be a big British colony if we had not gone to war.) What I detest (and think should be punishable by death) is the use of bombs set off in public places to kill randomly whoever is there at the time.\n \n Our boy Timothy McVeigh had a cause to fight for which was just as logical to him as any other cause. He set off a huge bomb and killed many innocent people. He should have (and did) die for his deed. He was put to death after a trial and conviction.",

And it is a prudent and practical part of special forces operations.\n \n Your definitions of what is and is not cowardly in war seems (to me - from what you are saying :) ) to include geurilla warfare as cowardly, which was employed in the American War of Independence and is simply prudent strategy.\n \n Snipering an enemy soldier before they see you is hardly cowardly!
