   "\"Russian scientists recommend the following course of the whipping therapy: 30 sessions of 60 whips on the buttocks in every procedure. A group of drug addicts volunteered to test the new method of treatment: the results can be described as good and excellent.... The professor used the self-flagellation method to cure his own depression; he also recovered from two heart attacks with the help of physical tortures too...'The whipping therapy becomes much more efficient when a patients receives the punishment from a person of the opposite sex.....' \" \n http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/90/360/15176_whipping.html \n \n This sounds like it could have a lot of potential. The body responds to pain by producing endorphins which make you feel good. So I can see the science behind this type of therapy.",

Then he just kind of quit doing all that stuff. HE does not even drink anymore. He SWEARS that it is the physical activity that keeps him clean. At one point he got promoted (not when he was working to me) to an office position, and in a matter of weeks was right back where he had been. He got himself demoted back to field work, and cleaned right back up. \n \n I don't know if it is actually the intense manual labor that keeps him clean, or if it some kind of mental thing.
