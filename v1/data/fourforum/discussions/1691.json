   "Well my history teacher always said if u are unsure about something u can always look into the past to compare and predict. \n \n Well i've done just that with the War in Iraq. If u study the war with Iraq and the Inca conquest u will find there are many similiarities. Pizzaro went into the Inca empire and warped there internal government from despotism to monarchy and used puppets from the high ranking officials in the Inca civilization. Spain gained a lot of resources while Inca civilians are killed everyday in the streets\n \n Today Bush goes into Iraq and warp their internal government by changing it to democracy and we already have some \"Americanize\" Muslims ready to take the title president of Iraq. You might as well call him a puppet because the US will be getting dibs on all the oil Iraq contains. Spain used the idea of spreading Christianity today were using the idea of spreading Democracy. The Inca war strenghtened the Spaniards just like this Iraq war strenghtens the US.\n \n My point is many historians look back at the Inca conquest and denounce it as a act of greed and intimidation. The same thing will happen in this war in the long run. Many today already see it as an act of greed and an act of bullying in the Middle East.",
