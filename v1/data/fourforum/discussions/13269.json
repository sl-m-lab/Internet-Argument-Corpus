   "But yesterday, someone told a real whopper. ABC News, citing the DC fire department, reported that between 60,000 and 70,000 people had attended the tea party rally at the Capitol. By the time this figure reached Michelle Malkin, however, it had been blown up to 2,000,000. There is a big difference, obviously, between 70,000 and 2,000,000. That's not a twofold or threefold exaggeration -- it's roughly a thirtyfold exaggeration.\n \n The way this false estimate came into being is relatively simple: Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, lied, claiming that ABC News had reported numbers of between 1.0 and 1.5 million when they never did anything of the sort. A few tweets later, the numbers had been exaggerated still further to 2 million. Kibbe wasn't \"in error\", as Malkin gently puts it. He lied. He did the equivalent of telling people that his penis is 53 inches long.\n \n Malkin, who to her credit later corrected the error, frets that it might be used to by liberals to \"discredit the undeniably massive turnout\". She's right to be worried -- it absolutely will be used that way. If you don't want to be discredited, then don't, as Kibbe did, tell a ridiculous (and easily disprovable) lie.\n \n Malkin herself did not lie; she merely repeated a lie. It does not particularly call into question her character. It does, however, call into question her judgment. The reason is that if there had in fact been 2 million protesters in Washington yesterday, there would have been no need to lie about it -- the magnitude of the protests would have been self-evident. I was in Washington for the inauguration, an event at which there really were almost 2 million people present -- and let me tell you, it was a Holy Mess. Hotels, charging double or treble their usual rates, were booked weeks in advance. Major stations on the Metro system were shut down for hours at a time. The National Guard was brought in. At least 3,000 people got stuck in a tunnel. Essentially the entirely of the National Mall, from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, was dotted with onlookers. Heaps of trash were left behind. The entire city was basically a warzone for a period of about 20 hours, from midnight through mid-evening.\n \n But there are no accounts of any of those sorts of things happening yesterday. 70 thousand people, rather, is about the number that will attend the Washington Redskins' home opener next week. That's a lot of people. Washington -- actually Landover, Maryland, where FedEx Field is located -- will be inconvenienced. But it won't be shut down. Business will go on more or less as usual.\n \n This was not a small rally. It was also not, in comparison with something like the 2006 pro-immigration protests, a particularly large rally. It was a business-as-usual sort of rally. Mock the protesters at your peril: business as usual suddenly isn't so good for Democrats these days, and the sentiments of the 70,000 people who marched on Washington surely mirror those of millions more sitting at home. They were done a disservice by being represented by a liar like Kibbe.\n\n FiveThirtyEight: Politics Done Right: Size Matters; So Do Lies\n \n Incidentally, the right-wing are already exaggerating their numbers on the issue... emoticon_emb",

   "FiveThirtyEight: Politics Done Right: Size Matters; So Do Lies\n \n Incidentally, the right-wing are already exaggerating their numbers on the issue... emoticon_emb\n\n IT gets even better. NOT ONLY did they lie about ABC's numbers, not only did they exaggerate their numbers, but they also released a photo from years ago in order to exaggerate what the protest looked like! They release one that was taken years ago (1997) of another march so that it looked like there were more people there!\n \n Here's the story:PolitiFact | \"Tea party\" photo shows huge crowd ? at different event\n \n From there:\n \nIn the competitive world of Washington protests, crowd size is often a matter of dispute. Organizers usually boast of huge crowds, while police and the news media offer much smaller estimates.\n \n So supporters of Saturday's \"tea party\" protests against President Barack Obama were quick to highlight their big turnout. To bolster countless claims on blogs and Facebook, many posted a photograph that showed a gargantuan crowd sprawling from Capitol Hill down the National Mall to the Washington Monument.\n \n But it turns out the photo is more than 10 years old, apparently taken during a 1997 Promise Keepers rally.\n \n On Saturday, estimates about the crowd spread quickly through the conservative blogosphere. Many writers, including author Michelle Malkin, pegged the number of people between 1 million and 2 million. Those reports were largely based on information from people in the crowd.\n \n Malkin, for example, updated her blog at 12:34 p.m. noting that, \"Police estimate 1.2 million in attendance. ABC News reporting crowd at 2 million,\" and she cited a Twitter post from Tabitha Hale, writer of Pink Elephant Pundit, who was in Washington for the protest.\n \n Many bloggers said the media was unfairly reporting much smaller numbers, and many included the photo.\n \n \"I have no doubt that Washington Democrats are well aware of how many people turned out, even as their media outlets try to downplay the event,\" said Power Line, a conservative blog that linked to the photograph from Say Anything, another conservative Web site.\n \n \" 'Media' estimates range from 60,000 to 500,000 to around 2 million (yes, 2,000,000),\" wrote John G. Winder for the conservative blog Cypress Times. \"Those estimates, the language employed, and the visuals chosen for use in reporting the rally and representing the people gathered, vary greatly based solely on bias.\"\n \n In the mainstream media, crowd estimates varied.\n \n The New York Times reported that \"thousands\" of protesters \"filled the west lawn of the Capitol and spilled onto the National Mall,\" while Fox News wrote that \"tens of thousands\" marched on Washington. CNN said \"reporters at the scene described the massive crowd as reaching the tens of thousands.\"\n \n Pete Piringer, public affairs officer for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Department, said the local government no longer provides official crowd estimates because they can become politicized. But the day of the rally, Piringer unofficially told one reporter that he thought between 60,000 and 75,000 people had shown up.\n \n \"It was in no way an official estimate,\" he said.\n \n We asked Piringer whether there were enough protesters to fill the National Mall, as depicted in the photograph.\n \n \"It was an impressive crowd,\" he said. But after marching down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, the crowd \"only filled the Capitol grounds, maybe up to Third Street,\" he said.\n \n Yet the photograph so widely posted showed the crowd sprawling all the way to the Washington Monument, which is bordered by 15th and and 17th Streets.\n \n There's another problem with the photograph: It doesn't include the National Museum of the American Indian, a building located at the corner of Fourth Street and Independence Avenue that opened on Sept. 14, 2004. (Looking at the photograph, the building should be in the upper right hand corner of the National Mall, next to the Air and Space Museum.) That means the picture was taken before the museum opened exactly five years ago. So clearly the photo doesn't show the \"tea party\" crowd from the Sept. 12 protest.\n \n Also worth noting are the cranes in front of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. According to Randall Kremer, the museum's director of public affairs, \"The last time cranes were in front was in the 1990s when the IMAX theater was being built.\"\n \n It appears that the photo was actually taken in 1997 at a rally for Promise Keepers, a group for Christian men. According to the group's Web site, nearly 1 million people attended the event. Photos of the Oct. 4, 1997, event that were posted on various Web sites in 2003, 2008 and earlier this year show either the same picture or a similar photo that has identical tents and what appear to be TV screens in the same locations.\n \n Conservative bloggers who originally posted the picture have backed down.\n \n Malkin, like some of her conservative cohorts, retracted the number she had attributed to ABC when the network chastised FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, whose organization arranged the event, for inaccurately telling the crowd that the news organization had reported the crowd at 1 million to 1.5 million people.\n \n Malkin linked to the ABC story on her site, and changed her blog post headline to \"Celebrating the 9/12 rallies; Turnout estimated at 2 million; Update: How many?; FreedomWorks in error.\"\n \n Say Anything updated its original post to say that the picture was \"of the wrong rally.\" An accurate photo \"clearly shows that (the rally) didn't take place on the mall nearly as extensively as the image I mistakenly posted does.\" Power Line took the picture down all together.\n \n But because mistakes can still live forever on the Internet and many people who saw the photo on Facebook were unaware it was found to be the wrong picture, we decided to still rate it on the Truth-O-Meter. And Pants on Fire it is.\n",

I'm against racists signs and if someone were a racist (not saying Obama is..just anyone who actually is) I would say they were. That doesn't contradict. \n \n Maybe Cooper wasn't trying to point out hypocrisy but if that is the case I'm not sure why Cooper framed it like that. It doesn't appear Williams is against unfounded attacks but Williams never said he was in that clip...at least from what I read in the article posted. \n \n So a lot to do about nothing yet again. This wouldn't be the first protest to have a nutcase as one of the \"leaders\". The Iraq War protests were full of them.",

   "This in from Bill Moyers' journal about a major tea party and \"FreedomWorks\" organizer, Bill Armey. What Armey's army doesn't know about Armey's deep and abiding love affair with taxpayer subsized government health plans when it comes to himself:\n \n ---------------\n \n BILL MOYERS: Gingrich became Speaker of the House and Armey the House Majority Leader.\n \n But they did nothing about health care except let its costs soar while their corporate backers reaped huge profits. Since then costs have more than doubled and are escalating now at twice the rate of inflation. There were around 39 million americans without health care coverage then. There are more than 46 million now. \n \n And Dick Armey? He retired from his government job to lead an advocacy group called FreedomWorks, which aims to torpedo healthcare reform once again. Curiously, they refuse to disclose their corporate donors. They say they want to protect against \"aggressive attacks on companies who people have claimed are donors but aren't even donors.\" Got that? \n \n But here's the catch. Something these marchers who came to Washington at Armey's urging could hardly be expected to know. For most of his adult life, their leader has benefited from just the kind of government, tax-supported healthcare he's fighting to keep them from having, too. \n \n When Dick Armey taught economics at the University of North Texas for 13 years his health insurance was administered by the state and supplemented by the taxpayers. \n \n When he was elected to Congress, he was covered by the federal employees' health benefit plan. And when he retired from Congress eighteen years later, he was insured by that plan until he turned 66 and Medicare, another government program, kicked in. All the time he's been making some half a million dollars a year working for FreedomWorks and raking in lobbyist fees amounting to what he recently called \"a darned handsome pile of dough.\" \n \n You can't blame him for keeping his government health plan. It's great. It gave him a lot of options, dozens of private insurers to choose from, and with eight million members in it, the federal government's got the muscle to negotiate some of the best premiums and drug prices in the country. That's not all. Taxpayers subsidize these federal health insurance plans by as much as 75% of the premium cost. Beneficiaries -- including members and retired members of congress like armey -- pay their share of the premiums with pre-tax dollars. \n \n Not bad. \n \n Now get this: Dick Armey thought so much of that federal health plan - the cadillac of coverage --that he tried to keep it as his primary carrier, instead of that other federal program, medicare. \n \n Mr. Armey wanted an option. A government option. How about that? \n \n But he couldn't get out of medicare without losing his Social Security (they're hitched together -- you give up one, you give up both), so he's suing to divorce the two ... And now he says he's happy to buy his health insurance on his own - and why not? He's got that pile of dough. And there's the rub. \n \n Dick Armey is the epitome of those people with power and privilege who are insured against the vicissitudes of life, and want no government assistance for any suffering ... Except their own. \n \n And all those members of congress sitting there during the president's speech last week? Joe Wilson, included. They; too have Cadillac federal coverage subsidized by tax dollars. \n \n That's no lie. \n \n Bill Moyers Journal . Watch & Listen | PBS\n \n --------------------\n ;)",
