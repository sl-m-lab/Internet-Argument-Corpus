   "i was recently expelled for staring fires at a school with two of my friends. i do not agree with the zero tolerance punishment system because it is an unfair and unforgiving. no one deserves to be put out of school for a mistake or even a purposful act of crime. i was expelled and i was not given a second chance, i had no previous record and had done nothing wrong in the past three years of my middle school life. as i started my research i realized that kids all around the country are being treated the same way that i was. i went to talk to my senator and i found that he really didnt care about the states expelled children he only cares about the ones thta follow the rules. our government i believe is the same way and zero tolerance is just an easier way to \"wash the schools hands\" of us troublsom kids!!",

   "I don't think that such a policy is a good idea. Children who do something bad once aren't neccecarily bad - they may have made a mistake, done something by accident, or been wrongly judged. I once accidentally broke a window, for example.\n \n However, I do think that children who misbehave and break rules need to have something done about them. I live in England, where we don't have anything like this policy. There was a girl in my class called Emily, who cared nothing for school and regularly insulted, teased and bullied many members of the class. She had been in the junior school (our school is split into 2 sections, the 4 years under 11 and the 11 to 18) and had behaved the same way, yet when she had applied to join the senior school she was allowed to join even though she had that bad record. She wasn't expelled until Christmas of third year.\n \n So I think that zero tolerance is a bad thing, but being lax about bad behaviour isnt good either. I propose a middle path - perhaps three strikes would be good? What do other people thing about that?",

The picture detailed the same picture he had hanging in his bedroom. His uncle stood in full uniform, at attention with a rifle on his shoulder. The child was expelled for drawing that gun.

If Jimmy knew, 1 punch and hes out of school, he wouldn't start the fight with John, and John in turn wouldn't have blasted Jimmy away. (Their is no Jimmy or John if your wondering)\n \n The Zero Tolerance policy is enacted not so much to be unfair to kids, but to ensure that Jimmy will think very hard before punching out John. Of course this policy has been expanded and now covers the bringing of weapon-like objects to school. But, as shown before, John may not bring an Ak47 to school, he could go nuts with a saw he was using for shop class. \n \n The idea of Zero Tolerance is the same idea behind nuclear deterints. The idea that war (fighting) is such a horrible possiblity makes non-nuclear countries (Jimmy) think twice about attacking a nuclear power (John). Because the nuclear power (John) could come back with nukes and blast the hell out of Jimmy.\n \n Its just a natural response. Of course even a baseball bat can kill somebody. Another point for not bring weapon-like objects to school is that sometimes John wouldn't walk into the classroom and blast Jimmy away, sometimes John will meet Jimmy in the parking lot and kill him with a rock. Its horrible to face, but Zero Tolerance has one purpose, make one guy think before he fights somebody else, so that the chain of events isn't started that will end up with that one guy getting his head bashed in with a blunt object. \n \n And about the medicene. Unless a note is given, teachers don't know if the medicene would kill the kid.
