(actually, if we're talking Judeo-Christian tradition it would be more like 5000 years)\n \n \n The people who wrote the Bible were superstitious, ignorant people who were just beginning to discover science. I don't know about anyone else, but the reason that I am so... skeptic of \"millions to billions\" or people's beliefs is because those beliefs are centered around an extremely old book written by your average uneducated, superstitious, bigoted, biased, ignorant man-of-two-thousand-years-ago. But other than that, I'm fine with religion! And I am not intolerant towards their beliefs, rather, as I have said before, I am a skeptic. From what I have seen, it is mostly the RELIGIOUS people who are intolerant of me because I am an atheist.\n\n \n I do find it interesting that, for example, in parts of Afghanistan and surrounding countries which are Muslim they will respect you if you're Christian (unless you try to convert anyone) but look at you like a dog if you are atheist. Obviously, they find it to be self evident that there is a God. Indeed, it seems that most people do. I have heard that according to one estimate 95% of the world beleived in a God (or Gods?) in 1991.\n \n Its easy to think of old civilizations as stupid, that does seem to be a popular idea these days. I suppose it depends on how closely you base your worldview on progressive evolution. What always suprises me when I read older books or think about age-old discoveries is how often my assumption that these people are amusingly ignorant is smashed to bits. There's the famous example of the Greek guy who had to figure out if a crown was pure gold or had been cheated on with a lead center. I still can't figure out how that one works! We know so much about things like gravity and relativity, but thats because of the work of people who came before us. It is true that the last few centuries have seen a stunning flowering of knowlege, but I don't think that means we are any more wise or moral. One person described us as \"well educated barbarians\", refering to a lack of morals despite the wealth of knowledge. And hasn't this century been the bloodiest of all? Estimates of the deaths (murders in particular) inflicted by communist nations on their own people run around 60 to 100 million. \n \n Also, looking closer at the progressive evolutionary perspective, it has been a very short time since the beginning of written history, just several thousand years. That is much less than the blink of an eye in evolutionary history, and it seems unlikely that remarkable progress could have been made which would invalidate old traditions on the basis that they were authoured by less evolved people.\n \n One thing I enjoy about being a Christian is that I don't have to have an arrogant position towards traditions and ancient peoples. C.S. Lewis noted that when he was an atheist he had to convince himself that the vast majority of people were wrong, but when he became a Christian he could be more open-minded and see that other religions all had an element of truth. If I see a tradition that many people have held for a long time, I think people aren't stupid and there's probably something to be said for it. I think that a long-held tradition should automatically be given more weight than a very new one. It just doesn't make sense to me that old ideas are instantly suspect. Why have these beleifs survived if they are so ridiculous? I do recognize that there are horrible traditions out there, I just don't have to reject them out of hand.\n \n When you say that those who wrote the bible were ignorant, bigoted, and such, do you mean the whole thing, cover to cover? I suppose that you wouldn't agree with people who claim that western civilization and science as we know it were founded by the Judeo-Christian worldview.",

The Bible posesses excellent morals and stories and examples for living a good life, but what I am saying is that the parts about who is right and wrong and who gets to go to heaven and who gets to go to hell is influenced by their fears and misgivings about others. They feared differences in people, and as such, they excluded the outcasts or made for punishing the outcasts and misfits. Sorry if I was a little unclear there. I do not believe that the whole of the Bible is trash; it has very good morals things to live by. \n Thanks",

Maybe I'm just reading it wrong, but either way... emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \n \n What I mean is, what makes things like truthfulness good - as opposed to lying being good? How do you decide whether one thing is good or not?\n \n One view is that there is an ultimate standard of right and wrong (which would be a standard created by God - actions which God approves of are Good), and you can decide what is right by comparing it to what that standard says. If that standard says that truthfulness is good, then that's why truth is a good value. C.S. Lewis noted that, as an atheist, his arguement against an all-loving, all-powerful God was that evil existed. Then he realized that, for him to beleive that some things were evil, and others good, he must be measuring them against an absolute standard - you can't tell whether a line is crooked unless you have a straight line to compare it to. \n \n Otherwise, morality is nothing more than subjective personal taste and if a culture or person believes something is right, then it is right for them. Lewis couldn't accept such a theory because that would mean that the Nazi's did nothing truly wrong - its just our opinion that their actions were immoral.\n \n It seems that a third way of measuring morality, proposed by Secular Humanists, is by what gives the most people the best lives. An example would be arguements I've seen at the Abortion section to the effect of: abortion is good because it prevents unhappy lives of children who are unwanted, or who would live in poverty. However, how do you judge what is a \"good\" life? And how do you judge what will bring the most people this \"good\" life? Unless you appeal to a universal moral standard (which defeats the purpose) you end up with a subjective measurement, no different from the one which Lewis rejected. How do you know that a poor person will live an \"unhappy\" life and how do you know whether, in the end, it is actually good to live a \"happy\" life? And if poor people are living lives unworthy of being lived why don't we simply kill them - especially if it is expedient to the rest of us? In fact, that's just what the Nazi's did - killing off retards, the elderly, the gypsies, and the Jews - simply in the quest to improve the lives of everyone else. And I'm convinced that we are doing the same to the unborn babies of our nations. \n \n According to the subjective morality, if I think its good to murder someone, it is right for me. You might say that it isn't because it \"hurts\" someone else. Who says that its \"bad\" to hurt other people, I might ask? And who is my victim to force their belief that I shouldn't kill them down my throat? (and if the victim agrees that I should kill them, there can really be no opposing it at all - unless you believe it is wrong to murder regardless of what the murderer and victim think about it)\n \n I'm kind of going off topic. emoticon_emb I guess my question is, how do you measure whether lying is good or bad? Do you think that there is a Creator (whether the Christian God or not) who believes that lying is wrong? Or do you think that lying is bad because you think it is - and if someone else thinks it is good, then it is for them? Or do you beleive that lying is bad simply because it is bad for human relations - its bad because people don't get along without honesty? In that case, I would ask why do you think its good for humans to get along. \n \n Why is it good for people to be good? (and how do you know that they are good?)\n \n Well, I must apologize for such a long answer. I hope that I've made my question a little more clear with my ramblings. Thanks for reading this! emoticon_xhoho",

   "Back on the subject that's actually supposed to be debated . . .\n Scientists have isolated a \"gay gene,\" as they misleadingly call it, located on the X chromosome. That is common knowledge and has been widely spread by the media. However, if you take a closer look at the experiments done, you will notice that they lack the control of heterosexual testing for the same gene. Rather, the researchers just tried to find connections between homosexuals in families, and came up with this gene that was found in a majority of the cases. That does not mean that your sexual orientation is determined by your genetic code, just like your political orientation is not determined by it (though it would make things interesting).\n \n Also, it is rare that a single gene would create such a big impact. Each gene in the human body codes for a single polypeptide, many of which are needed to build a single protein. There is also the question of dealing with polygenic (correct the terminology if it is incorrect) influences, in which many genes have an additive effect on the expression of them.\n \n Basically, God does not play dice. Since we are humans, we were given a mind that knows the difference between right and wrong and that can fight more against instincts, unlike animals. It is environmental influences that play the larger part.\n \n And why does every single thread turn into a religious discussion?",
