This hurts business (sp).\n Another example if is a non smoker is bothered by all the amount of smoke in a resturaunt he or she may not go there again. This once again only hurts the resturaunt. \n The government does not have a right to say whether a resturaunt should or should not allow smoking. \n Although most resturaunts will designate sections in which the smoker is allowed to continue is habbit.\n Now as far as a movie theater goes, the state has no right to decide if that movie theater should allow smoking or not. But if I was a manager of a movie theater I would outlaw smoking in the theater simply because as a veiwer of the movie I would be annoyed by smoke for two hours. \n Thats just my personal preference.

   "Well, you've still got to show a definite and serious connection (so not some tiny 2% increased chance) between passive smoking and deadly diseases.\n\n \n Okay, if you insist, and I won't limit myself to lung cancers caused by environmental tobacco smoke as it has been linked to many other adverse health effects:\n \n http://www.ash.org.uk/html/passive/html/passive.html\n \n http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/news/pressreleases/smoking_CMO_3July\n \n http://cis.nci.nih.gov/fact/10_14.htm\n \n http://www2.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/smokehealth.htm\n \n http://library.thinkquest.org/19796/data/e013.html\n \n http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/asp/healthy_living/lifestyle/smoking/what/health.asp\n \n http://www.news-medical.net/?id=6270\n \n http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000837.htm\n \n I could go on, and on and on..... I'm sure you get the gist.\n \n \nThe government can't change huge laws to save a dozen or so lives a year. If it wanted to do that, you'd have to reduce the speed limit, get back prohibition and so on.\n\n \n Wrong. Semi automatic centerfire rifles were made illegal after Hungerford. Handguns were made illegal after Dunblane. There are about 30 lives lost to prompt that action. And in the case of UK passive smoking we are talking hundreds of preventable deaths per year.\n \n \nknow the risks now. Stopping smoking in 'public' places may reduce the amount smoked, but I don't really see the point. Yes it will save lives, but it takes away people's freedom as well.\n\n \n You see the taking the away, I see the giving- of life and freedom from other peoples smoke.\n \n \ne is a strong link between passive smoking and various deadly diseases, then I wouldn't mind a ban on public smoking.\n\n \n Look where that attitude got the UK on BSE/vCJD.......... The link is there on passive smoking, all we have now is a question of time until action is taken. \n \n In addition I'd like you to outline just what level of evidence you think is necessary before the government take action on passive smoking.\n \n \n\n My condolences. \n \n -Wez\n\n \n I hope it is something you never have to experience.",

   "you should not be allowed to smoke in a public place which is inside, such as a restraunt or a pub. espeically in places like brewsters ( family pub with food and play area for kids), innocent children shouldn't have to breath in your smoke while playing harmlessly, it isn't there choice. and if i want to go to the local pub to see a band which is playing i shouldn't have to do so while being killed be your smoke, dispite not wanting to breath in your smoke i dont want to have to aviod every pub, restraunt and bar your the one who wants to smoke so you dont go there, or better still go outside, it's not hard. \n i can't see how the government could inforce a law on not smoking outside though, it would get broken just as much as no dropping litter or no underage drinking.",

   "Surely ,passive smoking is even more harmful thanif you smoke yourself...That`s the choice-to smoke or to be smoked!emoticon_xangel \n \n Seriously,as for me,it`s much more pleasant to smoke outside,in an open air....Of course,it`s the matter of taste\n I think so:smoke and let others smoke!!!:p",

   "It's not hazardous to your health to be in the same restaurant as a smoker.\n\n Involuntary exposure to second-hand smoke results from non-smokers breathing air containing second-hand smoke. Involuntary smoking involves inhaling carcinogens, as well as other toxic components, that are present in both mainstream and sidestream smoke. Carcinogens that occur in second-hand smoke include benzene, 1,3-butadiene, benzo[a]pyrene, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and many others (IARC Monograph, Volume 83. Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking. 2002). \n \n The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in its 2002 Monograph on tobacco smoke and second-hand smoke that that \"there is sufficient evidence that involuntary smoking (exposure to second-hand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) causes lung cancer in humans\" and makes the overall evaluation that \"Involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\" \n \n It has been said that a cigarette is a white object with a fire on one end and a fool on the other. I won't argue that, but since some of the smartest people I have known have been smokers, I must conclude that a foolish act does not a fool make. One thing I am very sure of, something I live with every day, is the destruction of health this foolish habit can cause. My beautiful wife of 45 years was a smoking addict for over 20 years. She is now on oxygen 24/7 and her activity severely limited. Numerous pulmonary specialists have said that her lungs were damaged by her smoking. If your health and the health of those around you have any value, then stop being the one at the end of that white object.\n Dono",
