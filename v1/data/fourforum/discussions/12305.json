But we can't depend on the police to protect us any more.\"\n \n He said Chattanooga is the 57th most dangerous city in the country, and to many criminals \"the value of human life means nothing to them.\"\n \n The judge said, \"With 7,000 foreclosures every day and 6,000 kids dropping out of school\" that the crime situation is going to get much worse.\n",

Cook and Jens Ludwig explain, 'The case of Kennesaw, Georgia, which adopted an ordinance in 1982 requiring every household to keep a gun, has been prominent. There have been several published analyses of the burglary trends in Kennesaw around the time of the ordinance, with contradictory results. In any event, this is not a good test of the deterrence hypothesis, since the ordinance was purely symbolic. Most homes in Kennesaw already had a gun before the ordinance, and it seems unlikely the ordinance had any effect on prevalence since there was no penalty specified in the law for refusal to comply.' ('Guns and Burglary', Evaluating Gun Policy, pages 81-82)\n \n \"The gun ownership rate of Kennesaw could have actually decreased because there has been a big increase in the population of Kennesaw since 1982, and it's not certain how many of the new residents abide by the ordinance. Nationwide the gun ownership rate has decreased according to the General Social Survey. So if Kennesaw has followed nationwide trends the gun ownership rate in Kennesaw would have also declined.\"\n Gun Control and the Second Amendment",

   "I wish you'd participate here more often. I agree with you, we have a violence problem in the US. The fact that we are awash in handguns only exacerbates the problem by making fatality more likely.\n\n \n There is another side to that. I have been places that have violence problems AND strict gun control, and people still have guns. \n \n By having the gun control we do, it does to some degree limit the kind of hardware that bad guys are likely to have. If you are going to make all guns illegal, and I am a bad guy who decides I am going to have a gun anyway, there is really no reason for me to pick a baretta over a fully automatic uzi. After all, both are illegal, so why not? Why do a drive by with a semi auto tech 9 instead of an RPG? Right now it is because a tech 9 is legal and easier to get. Outlaw guns, which means guns on the streets will have been smuggled, and there is no reason to waste time smuggling in a glock when for the same time and trouble you can bring in a SAW.\n \n It sounds silly, and a lot of people are going to dismiss that entire thought process but in the DRC, for example, guns are strictly controlled, and everybody has a heavy machine gun. The cops are scared to death to try to enforce their gun control laws because they are the only ones who DONT have heavy machine guns. \n \n It is drug mule logic...if you are going to carry a pound, you may as well carry a ton. You are just as screwed either way. \n \n I have been posting here for a long time and I think most of you folks who have been around for a while know I have an EXTENSIVE gun collection. If it seemed like there was even a chance that more gun control would lessen the violence in the US, I would back it 100%. I am not kidding. I would be the brady campaigns biggest donor.\n \n It just does not seem logical to me that it would work. We have a violence problem, and trying to take away or control the method of violence is like giving pain pills to somebody with a brain tumor. It might make them feel better for a while, but the tumor is still there and will continue to grow until either it is treated, or the person dies. \n \n A more apt analogy comes from a friend of mine who is a recovering alcoholic. He says that if you take the alcohol away from an alcoholic, he is just a dry drunk. To actually stop being an alcoholic, he has to change the way he lives his life. \n \n A lot of people and organizations seem to have ideas about how to get rid of guns, but none of them seem to have any idea how to solve our violence problem, which means that all their ideas really boil down to is how to get rid of LEGAL guns. \n \n Even if we did manage to round up and detroy all the guns in the country next week, our government cannot manage to stop millions of illegal aliens and millions of tons of drugs entering our country every year. How long do you think it would really take before we started seeing weapons being used on the streets again? Criminals would be clamoring to get them because in an unarmed society, being the guy holding the AK gives you an INCREDIBLE advantage. It makes you nearly invincible when it comes to the average guy on the street.\n \n Even if we did manage to destroy all the guns in the world and prevent new ones from being produced, do you think the violence problem would go away? Do you really think that civilization would get better? In a situation like that, the guy in charge is the biggest and meanest guy in the room. You are talking about reverting back to primal social order there. I am sure that we have all heard the saying \"God created man, Sam Colt made them equal\". That is not entirely untrue.

I'd bet non-gun related crime is considerably lower than most other states.\n\n \n Of course other factors are more likely. They do not have as big a violence problem as the rest of the nation. \n \n If you click on the link at the bottom of my last post it is a progression of concealed carry laws since the early 80s. The one thing we have learned as virtualy the entire country has gone \"shall issue\" is that whether you allow concealed carry or not, violence levels do not really change and the proportion of firearms related crimes does not change. \n \n The thing is, the answer to our violence problem is incredibly simple. It is not even debatable. There is virtually no correlation between gun ownership and violent crime. Nobody has ever managed to show any correlation there at all. There is a STRAIGHT LINE correlation between poverty and violent crime. There is also a straight line correlation between the gap between rich and poor and violent crime. If you combat poverty, you combat violent crime. \n \n If you visit places like Finland, where every other person owns a silenced machine gun, or Switzerland, where people are issued machine guns by their government, one thing that you can not help but notice is that they are actually NICE places to live. Most US cities are absolute cess pools by comparison. Switzerland had to literally invent their own definition of poverty because nobody in the entire country actually fit most normally accepted definitions. They came up with something along the lines of \"Not being able to afford what most take for granted\". This seems to increasingly mean things like Plasma screen televisions and BMWs. The poor bastard with the CRT and the volvo gets government aid. I saw an article a while back about a swiss youth lighting a homeless mans pants on fire. I was SHOCKED.
