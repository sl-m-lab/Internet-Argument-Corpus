   "I had to come back to get the answer to this quick question. It comes from personal curiosity.\n \n When asked if gay marriage should be allowed to exist equally with marriage, but with a different name, gay rights advocates respond that this would separate it from marriage and cause discrimination. They say the two should not be separate because there is no fundamental difference between them. The only difference is that one is man-man (or woman-woman), and the other is man-woman. Therefore, the difference is only gender related, which is a shallow dividing line.\n \n My question is that if gender is not a fundamental difference, why do we call men men and women women? Doesn't this difference in nomenclature suggest a fundamental difference between the two, and make discrimination automatic and inescapable? The two genders are similar in that both seek happiness, both extol certain virtues, both seek truth, etc. etc. So, they are different only for shallow reasons, not fundamentally, right? So should we abolish the words \"male\" and \"female\" and \"boy\" and \"girl\" etc.? Thanks.",
