   "As a probable candidate for US Republican presidential primary election in \n 2000, assuming he can mend fences with the national committee, is McCain planning ahead with his current stance?\n \n His bill restricting administration from currently being able to define their own program for 'protecting America', banning torture, secret prisons in countries we buy and CIA exemption from all legislation has majority support in congress, administration fighting that tooth and nail. A version of Blair's recent experience of being reined in by his own party? Definitely a party line to soften his reputation as a rebel. \n \n On the other hand, he's advocating enough resources including combat troops to secure Iraq. I view that as a red herring, especially with his Vietnam experience, to, in a few years, allow him use of the Nixon political strategy of political campaigning to get out of an unpopular war. Are we in that cycle again? \n \n I'm not for or against McCain, just curious about his political strategy.",
