   "A Conservative Con Game\n \n Why pretend (or deny) the 'culture wars', driven by inane sound bites, idiotic innuendo & mental masturbation techniques does not impoverish serious & rational political discourse? \n \n Why pretend (or deny) this mindless, manipulative & opportunistic rhetoric is not, when all is said & done, simply political marketing/advertising in the guise of campaigning based on integrity? \n \n Why pretend (or deny) the marketing of fear has seemingly been the most lucrative commodity in the last twenty years or so. Marketing fear as a commodity? A 'bait & switch' marketing scam at best & an impotent security strategy at worst. Looking back to the time before September 11th, there were already precursors to the present day fiascoes & debacles (healthcare & financial reforms spring to mind). Playing the 'national security card' through the use of fear mongering swiftly drew attention away from the very real (& near) economic & other related fiascoes & debacles of our present day. \n \n Why pretend (or deny) this shallow political sophistry does not lead to (or at the very least reinforce) equally shallow media coverage? [*]The 'circus' part of this 'bread & circuses' phenomenon being characterized by the use of slogans, inane sound bites & symbolic messages & replaces  critical analysis of complex issues. [*]This formulaic brand of mass entertainment masquerading as news coverage apparently succeeds in coding anything that would make a person think as 'elitist', i.e. anything that is experimental, egalitarian or especially has no commercial value is branded as being 'elitist.' [*]Serious news coverage is sacrificed & replaced by sensational yet ironically impotent news 'fluff'.[*]Advanced technology has made communication of information more efficient & immediate, although the song remains the same, shallow & essentially just more of the same o lame o mental masturbation.\n Why pretend (or deny) mistrust of government is not always based on well-informed constituents but perhaps equally based on unfacts, propaganda or misinformation? [*]The narcissistic escapist messages do not lead to an increase in social awareness or even creative enterprise, just more of the same o lame o ideology. [*]A healthy dose of cynicism is fine (& even beneficial) when considering government's role in social &/or other types of change. However when the cynicism remains indifferent to, or even contemptuous of, complexity in favor of simplistic & habitual skepticism? This only serves as yet another obstruction to meaningful discourse & progress. [*]These simplistic slogans & sound bites do not lend themselves as easily to issues of complexity, such as the values of cooperation, conceptualization & abstraction. [*]Abstraction & conceptualization techniques are important tools for framing change & progress. [*]Finding solutions to existing problems may require a different level of thinking, one that just may include a certain amount of tolerance for ambiguity, nonlinear thinking, contextual or causal considerations, (et more).\n Why pretend (or deny) the essential democratic & liberal values of equality & tolerance are being shunned for the empty, fleshless & soulless (& mostly 'conservative') sound bites & slogans? \n [*]A contemptuous & persistent disdain for any kind of change is not only inconsistent with reality but denies or works to destroy a living democracy which only remains alive with the spark of creative & critical thought & action. [*]The conservative mindset in stone (with accompanying sound bites, slogans, etc.) has become just another word for the preservation, justification & legitimization of the status quo. Empty words bereft of life or meaning.\n 'Don't ask' for these empty sound bites to connect to reality - 'don't tell' when they don't. Protect & preserve the status quo at any cost! For heaven's sake (no pun intended) 'don't rock the boat - but dammitt keep on bailing!' Don't question the sacred cow of capitalism as savior, don't question the pointless search for that ever elusive holy grail of the really real really pure FREE? market! \n \n Don't continue to be lulled into grasping at these straws, fear mongered into the desperation of believing in 'invisible hands' & other imaginary concepts! Please don't forget the 'end game' where the rapidly disappearing middle class is conned into bailing out these sacred cows. All the while, it's 'business as usual.'\n \n Or, you can continue to heed the conservative message of 'don't rock the boat.' Everything will be just fine if you can just get yourself to believe in the con game or delusion, 'even if you know it's idiotic, believe in it!' (paraphrasing Glenn Beck here in case you're not one for sarcasm or parody).",

Not to mention (ok I'm going to emoticon_xbye), appeals to fear, emotion, & perhaps as a phenomenon? The Mean World Syndrome:\n \n \nMean World Syndrome is a phenomenon where the violence-related content of mass media convinces viewers that the world is more dangerous than it actually is, and prompts a desire for more protection than is warranted by any actual threat. Mean World Syndrome is one of the main conclusions of cultivation theory. The term \"Mean World Syndrome\" was coined by George Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the effects of television on society. His investigations discovered that people who watch a lot of TV tend to think of the world as an unforgiving and scary place, something he called the \"mean world syndrome.\"\n \n Individuals who watch television infrequently and adolescents who talk to their parents about reality are said to have a more accurate view of the real world than those who do not, and they are able to more accurately assess their vulnerability to violence and tend to have a wider variety of beliefs and attitudes.\n \n \"Fearful people are more dependent, more easily manipulated and controlled, more susceptible to deceptively simple, strong, tough measures and hard-line measures,\" said Gerbner when he testified before a congressional subcommittee in 1981.\n \n \"You know, who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour,\" he said. 'It used to be the parent, the school, the church, the community. Now it's a handful of global conglomerates that have nothing to tell, but a great deal to sell.\"\n Mean World Syndrome - Home\n\n \n There's a Native American saying (Navajo?), 'The ones who tell the stories, rule the world.'\n \n Then there's Mr. Goldman Sachs who claims, 'I'm doing 'God's work'.\n \n \nThey are the rainmakers' rainmakers, the biggest swinging dicks in the financial jungle. Their assets total $1 trillion, their annual revenues run into the tens of billions, and their profits are in the billions, which they distribute liberally among themselves. When they have finished getting \"filthy rich by 40\", as the company saying goes, these alpha dogs don't put their feet up. They parachute into some of the most senior political posts in the US and beyond, prompting accusations that they \"rule the world\".\n \n ... \"We have a social purpose.\" Even though he proudly pays himself more in a year than most of us could ever dream of - $68m in 2007 alone, a record for any Wall Street CEO, to add to the more than $500m of Goldman stock he owns - he insists he's still \"a blue-collar guy\". \n \n ... Whatever the truth behind the bail-out, not even the smartest Goldmanite can deny that it is only thanks to government aid that the bank still has a financial system to work with. Washington has bolstered the US economy and banks to the tune of $12 trillion. Does Blankfein not acknowledge that it is maddening for most of us to watch Goldman gobble up so much cash while we struggle? Quite the opposite. He insists we should be celebrating his bank's success, not condemning it. \"Everybody should be, frankly, happy,\" he says. Can he be serious? Deadly. Goldman's performance, he argues, is the firmest indication of a nascent economic recovery that will benefit not just him and his firm but all of us. \"The financial system led us into the crisis and it will lead us out.\" \n I'm doing 'God's work'. Meet Mr Goldman Sachs - Times Online\n\n \n The fact he acknowledges the financial sector led us into the crisis is one thing, but to claim to be like Moses?\n \n There's another Native American saying, 'It's difficult to awake a people who are pretending to be asleep.\"\n \n Open your eyes! There's work to do!\n \n (Does anyone honestly believe they are doing 'God's work'? That they have a 'social purpose'? If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.)",
