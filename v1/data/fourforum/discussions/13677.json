   "For the purpose of the argument it should be agreed that the Christian God exists and that the Bible is accurate enough to be used as reference without getting into translation, forgery or misunderstood verse issues at each post.\n \n My contention is that based on the Bible, the evidence, if any, that God truly cares for his creation in a loving, compassionate and selfless manner is fiction and/or rendered meaningless by the overwhelming evidence that words such as indifferent, incompetant, spiteful, selfish and unfair provide a more accurate description of the Biblical God.\n \n I list 5 examples below, but was able to think of at least 15 without using any type of reference.\n \n 1) God didn't want the original existence described in Genesis for Mankind. God created a scenario in which 2 people were told they were not to do something. Having no idea what the consequences actually meant. Placing a being of superior intelligence in their midst who had just been banished for causing a rebellion and war in Heaven by defying God's will. God allows Adam and Eve to fall, punishes them with not only the promised death, but adds additional penalties to the punishment including labor, suffering and evicts them from Eden and extending his retribution to all mankind forever.\n \n \n 2) After an extended absence God selected a group to be his chosen. For this he kept them under the curse of Adam. Made covenants with all of them and all their children forever. Punished all of them when a random number of descendants breached the covenant, which typically did not state repercussions when given, also noteworthy there seems not to be a choice or ability to negotiate. Although the agreement was with all, a random number, representing a portion and known only to God was sufficient to permit God to declare the covenant broken. The only noticeable blessing appears to be their continued existence in a hostile world and to later share their most favored status with every Tom, Dick and Harry who believes in Christ, which is also a free pass to ignore the Mosaic Laws. Those not chosen were destroyed for failing to adhere to laws not made known to them or living in areas they were not told were reserved for the chosen. Several of those not chosen managed to create advancements still in use, as a basis for further advancement or something we are still unable to reproduce despite such intentional God given obstacles such as flood, sabotaging communication, plague, Satan and the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n 3) God's actions seem geared towards insuring we never defy his wishes again. From Adam and Eve's first act of defiance every act of obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished. Salvation is conditioned on living the cursed life caused by Adam in all it's misery, all the while thanking God for it and repeatedly affirming the desire to submit without question to his will so that one may reach Heaven where one will spend eternity praising God. Those who don't will be destroyed with the rest of his creation that he regrets and has already wiped out once. Which seems odd that in sparing Noah to start over decided to not remove the penalties from Adam & Eve.\n \n 4) Mankind being initially created in God's image has evolved farther than God. Comparing the two God has abilities Man does not, but it is not unreasonable to speculate that given the time that gap may become very small. We would share traits in common with God such as anger, passion or pride. Man has shown it posses traits that God will never posses Fear, Courage, Sacrifice, Humility, and possibly others such as Responsibility, Perseverance or Curiosity. \n \n 5) I find it unbelievable that the world as was and is and will be with it's ups, downs and unknowns. It's fragmented rules of conduct, ethics, values, morals, judgments, obligations, conditions and punishments and it's continuation without the possibility of anything different is the best that an omnipotent, omniscient compassionate, understanding, concerned and interested God can come up with. Seems more like a spur of the moment half aXXed plan to deal with a pet you got from your now ex girl/boyfriend.\n \n Think I have completely missed the whole concept of God? Show me where any of Gods benefits are unconditional and/or the best and/or fairest course of action or result. Then show it 1 more time than when the opposite is true.",

Even those who reject Him. Here's how an excerpt from the gospel account puts it. \n Why Did Jesus Die for Man's Sins?\n By Dianne E. Butts \n Guest Writer\n \n CBN.com - When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden, God gave them skins to cover up with (Genesis 3:21). To get those skins, some animal had to die. In other words, God sacrificed an animal to cover their sin. From the beginning, God has declared the payment for sin is death, and so blood must be shed to cover sin:\n \n - Leviticus 17:11: \"For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.\"\n \n - Hebrews 9:22: \"In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.\"\n \n We could shed our own blood for our own sins, but that wouldn't do us much good because then we'd be dead. God doesn't want us dead-he wants us alive. But that leaves him with a great dilemma: we each have sinned and must die for our sins, so how can we live?\n \n God devised a plan. Early in the Old Testament God introduced the idea of one innocent being shedding its blood in place of the sinner's. After the incident in the garden, he introduced the sacrificial system in the Tabernacle-Temple ceremonies. That's what those sacrifices were all about<b></b>: \"He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him\" (Leviticus 1:4).\n \n However the solution of sacrificing bulls and goats and lambs for the sins of each person's sin was a temporary fix. The next year, another animal would have to be sacrificed for the same person. A more permanent solution was needed.\n \n That meant a human was needed to die for humans' sin. But all humans are sinful, so another sin-filled person dying for us just wouldn't work. A human without sin was needed.\n \n But ever since Adam, every human born is sin-filled, so how could a sinless man happen? The only way was if God did it Himself.\n \n So he did.\n \n God became a man, known as Jesus-whose name, Joshua in Hebrew, means \"the LORD saves\" (1)-and died for us in our place. Therefore, anyone who accepts the sacrifice of Jesus on his or her behalf is covered by his blood and is saved.\n \n Buddha didn't die for us. Mohammad didn't die for us. Name any other god and whoever you name, they 1.) weren't sinless, and 2.) didn't die for us.\n \n Only Jesus satisfies God's requirement of a perfect, sinless person who was sacrificed in our stead.

Other than from a position of complete ignorance of our relationship with Him and denial of the promises He has made to us? \n\n \n \n In one respect you hold God above all things, while at the same time content, even grateful for what any reasonable person would consider spiteful, vindictive, careless and manipulative.\n \n We can agree that Adam & Eve sinned by disregarding the only rule stated by God. The punishment for disobeying was to be death. Let's assume somehow they understood the concept of death. Is it not reasonable to wonder if both would have eaten of the fruit if they had known in addition to death they would be expelled from the Garden, experience pain, have to work and just have a poor life in general by comparison AND this punishment would effect every person until the end of time. God got mad because Satan caused man to defy God just as he got Angels to. Gods whole plan as we know it is designed to believe he is blameless and submit to his will unquestioningly. How many times did he forgive his chosen? What is gained by punishing 200+ generations worth of humanity? \n \n Atonement through blood is symbolic. Is it your belief that God can only forgive when given blood to compensate for transgressions? That God will forgive all sin, but one if offered cups or quart or gallons of fresh animal blood? Why is God limited to reaction to our actions. What if no one accepted Jesus as their savior? We fear death, because it is unknown and we think it the end of the existence we know and survival is hardwired into us. These things would not apply to Jesus. He knew he was coming back and he knew he would be rewarded. On the 44th day Jesus was right back where he started, just as he knew he would. But let's say no that he died for our sins. What was God waiting for? Why wasn't Cain or Abel or Seth or Abraham or Noah Jesus? God could make sinless people it appears at will. Why is he still waiting? Jesus paid the price, why must the punishment of life without the possibility of parole continue? Why must redemption only be given once we die and then only for those who submit to his will. He seems to lack the same compassion and forgiveness for those who don't acquiesce to his demands.\n \n \nAlso, since we fell from grace through the disobedience of Adam and Eve, and were ejected from the Garden of Eden, God has never promised us a rose garden in this fallen world. We have had to exist within a sinful world of our own creation since it was our parents, Adam and Eve who chose willful disobedience rather than obedience in that paradise he placed us in.

God doesn't want us dead-he wants us alive. But that leaves him with a great dilemma: we each have sinned and must die for our sins, so how can we live?\n\n \n This is a good example of the need for this to be right. This statement makes no sense, but I would bet 9 out of 10 Christians would accept this as having significant meaning. The only people who will still be alive are those at the time of the second coming. Until then we do die. If God wanted us alive what is stopping him? How many people not even yet thought of will be made to endure the punishment for the actions of two naive people who were left unattended with Satan who was in open rebellion against God and had already successfully convince other Angels to do likewise. \n \n Would you leave your son at a Nambla convention, your daughter alone at a park frequented by rapists, your toddler with a stranger? We require by law that parents take care of their creations. Failing to adequately do so is a punishable offense. You would have us believe that God has no responsibility for the fall and further that the punishment imposed is both reasonable and beyond the ability of God to rescind except under an extraordinary set of circumstances. If your grandfather got a speeding ticket the day he got his license would it be fair for your entire family to have their insurance rates raised and each person including your great grandchildren would be required to pay the fine as well?\n \n \nGod devised a plan.

But all humans are sinful, so another sin-filled person dying for us just wouldn't work. A human without sin was needed.\n \n But ever since Adam, every human born is sin-filled, so how could a sinless man happen? The only way was if God did it Himself.\n\n \n Or he could have made one for that purpose. Why not another Adam or send Jesus at any point earlier than 3000 - 5000 years after the fact. If Cain was going to kill Abel, why not let Jesus play the role of Abel, there is your sacrifice. He could have made us think he did but really didn't, because the sacrifice isn't necessary for him. If your wife wraps your car around a telephone pole because she was looking for lip gloss most people are angry but eventually forgive her without requiring her to first buy you a newer model and tell you how good you are and how bad she is until you decide she doesn't need to anymore and oh be happy about the arrangement.\n \n \n \nSo he did.\n \n God became a man, known as Jesus-whose name, Joshua in Hebrew, means \"the LORD saves\" (1)-and died for us in our place. Therefore, anyone who accepts the sacrifice of Jesus on his or her behalf is covered by his blood and is saved.\n \n Buddha didn't die for us. Mohammad didn't die for us. Name any other god and whoever you name, they 1.) weren't sinless, and 2.) didn't die for us.\n\n \n Buddha didn't condemn us either. There was no reason for Buddha to sacrifice himself. According to Mohammad it wasn't necessary for him to do so. The one who says he died for our sins, which he reminded us of when he came back to life and before he returned to heaven, is the only one who said it was necessary\n \n \nOnly Jesus satisfies God's requirement of a perfect, sinless person who was sacrificed in our stead. Therefore, Jesus is the only way.[/b] [/COLOR]Why Did Jesus Die for Man's Sins?: Spiritual Life in God\n\n \n The guy who beats his wife loves her and shows it most of the time. Only when she provokes him, which she knows she does, does he punish her. \n \n The abusive parent loves his kids, he hurts them to make them better to teach them lessons they will need\n \n Why do we not accept this logic from our fellow beings, but find it completely reasonable when God is concerned?",

How many times did he forgive his chosen? What is gained by punishing 200+ generations worth of humanity? \n\n \n Even back in those times people were justified righteous by faith in God (Genesis 15:6). And for the record, God already knew what would happen in the Garden of Eden.\n \n \"All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast-all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world.\" - Revelation 13:8 \n \n You see, the atoning sacrifice of Christ was ordained from the foundation of the world - long before Adam and Eve walked the earth. God already knew Adam and Eve would take Satan's bait. Here's how it plays out:\n \n God does not tempt anyone, He allows Satan to do it - He allows Satan to engage in this activity, subject, of course, to God's permissible will. \n \n With this in mind, we go back to the garden of Eden and who do we find? That ancient serpent, Satan. What is he doing there? Was Adam not evicted from the garden because of his fall into sin? Why wasn't Satan? If the garden is a sanctified and holy area, one would think that God would have the sovereign power and desire to keep it that way. Unless, of course, there was a divine purpose involved for Satan to be there. And what would that purpose be? To tempt Adam into the fall so that man would come into the knowledge of good and evil, overcome it through the power Of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, and be raised complete in the image and likeness of God. Man cannot be an overcomer until he has something to overcome, like sin and Satan. Satan is the \"smoking gun\" of the Garden of Eden who unwittingly served the greater purpose of God. \n \n Whereas Genesis 1:26 states that God was to create man in His own image and likeness, Genesis 1:27 shows that man was only created in God's \"image.\" It wasn't until Genesis 3:22 when Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that he became \"like\" God.  Genesis 3:22 - \"And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.\"\n \n To Summarize:\n \n 1. Man was to be created in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26).\n \n 2. Part of this \"likeness\" was a knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:22)\n \n 3. For Adam to be truly \"like\" God, he had to acquire a knowledge of good and evil.\n \n 4. The means to that end was eating of the tree of the knowledge of good \n and evil.\n \n 5. To do that a \"tempter\" was likely needed to entice Adam and Eve into sin.\n \n 6. God provided, or allowed, Satan as the tempter.\n \n 7. God knew in advance what the outcome would be, but allowed it anyway.\n \n 8. God knew atonement would be required, and provided Jesus Christ as the\n \"Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth\" (Revelation 13:8).\n \n 9. Man achieves the likeness of God, acquires a knowledge of and overcomes\n evil, partakes of Christ (the \"tree of life\"), and is reunited in paradise with \n God. Man, like God, is now an overcomer.\n \n The key to all this remains, \"Is acquiring a knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite to coming into the likeness and image of God? If the answer is yes, I think Adam has to eat from that tree, and God has to make it happen. If the answer is no, then I think you have to look back to Genesis 3:22 and reconcile that with Genesis 1:26, explaining how Adam is \"like\" God, but at the same time lacks a knowledge of good and evil. Also, how does man acquire that knowledge without eating of the fruit of that tree? ",

   "[QUOTE=Easyrider;381861]Originally Posted by simone:  \n I'd like to know whether or not I should care whether or not God cares?\n \n \n \n \nYou can't earn your way to God. He knows who and what people are when he saves them.\n \n \"Therefore, since we have been justified (righteous) through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. \n\n \n Why do we need an intermediary? Why does God not make this covenant like every other covenant in the bible? If we have been reconciled with God why does Adam's punishment stay with us until we die?\n \n \nYou see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" \n\n \n You keep saying we are all sinners, as if we had some responsibility for being born sinners. It's like being punished for being born male or female. Christian doctrine is we are born this way and cannot be in other way. God isn't doing us a favor by fixing his mistake.\n \n \nNot only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.\" - Romans 5\n \n \"But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.\" - Titus 3\n\n \n Tell me how many times God says I love you to us in the entire bible. Not someone saying he does and not some obscure interpretation. You will be greatly disappointed. Now look how many times it says we are to love him and then how many times we are to love him or else. It's a really one sided relationship which seems to become a love hate relationship often.\n \n So we are doomed to live life and then die. Which when we were created was not the case, but Adam & Eve angered God and mankind forever pays the price. God decides we haven't done anything to deserve life after death but he will grant it to us anyway. As long as we agree to be obedient to him in all things and we must endure the punishment inflicted upon Adam and Eve for being disobedient. \n \n Is the pattern becoming clear because obedient/reward disobedient/punishment is the most consistent theme in the bible.",

   "Even back in those times people were justified righteous by faith in God (Genesis 15:6). And for the record, God already knew what would happen in the Garden of Eden.\n\n \n Yes that is why two verses later God required a sacrifice and Moses was given the Law after the Exodus and Jesus died so we could be saved thru faith that we already had.\n \n What then was God's point and why did he become angry?\n \n \n \n\"All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast-all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world.\" - Revelation 13:8 \n\n \n The age of prophets was over by the time revelation was written wasn't it?\n \n \nYou see, the atoning sacrifice of Christ was ordained from the foundation of the world - long before Adam and Eve walked the earth. God already knew Adam and Eve would take Satan's bait. Here's how it plays out:\n \n God does not tempt anyone, He allows Satan to do it - He allows Satan to engage in this activity, subject, of course, to God's permissible will. \n\n \n Oh today that person is called the responsible party or an accomplice. You see setting into motion events or having the ability to control the actions of others doesn't mean that God is in someway insulated from the results of what he initiated or permitted or instructed to happen.\n \n \n \nWith this in mind, we go back to the garden of Eden and who do we find? That ancient serpent, Satan. What is he doing there?\n \n \n Inciting defiance among God's creation. With God's blessing if you are right.\n \n \nWas Adam not evicted from the garden because of his fall into sin? Why wasn't Satan? If the garden is a sanctified and holy area, one would think that God would have the sovereign power and desire to keep it that way. Unless, of course, there was a divine purpose involved for Satan to be there. \n\n \n Both Adam and Satan were sent from the Garden or God punished the serpent who was possessed by Satan who then left the serpent to God's punishment.\n \n \n \nAnd what would that purpose be? To tempt Adam into the fall so that man would come into the knowledge of good and evil, overcome it through the power Of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, and be raised complete in the image and likeness of God. Man cannot be an overcomer until he has something to overcome, like sin and Satan. Satan is the \"smoking gun\" of the Garden of Eden who unwittingly served the greater purpose of God. \n\n \n Would not telling Adam and Eve to eat the fruit been both less devious and honest? How about simply not saying you will die if you eat the fruit?\n \n In a perfect world there isn't anything necessary to overcome. That was the original idea of the garden.\n \n It was The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil not The Tree of the Potential to Learn the Knowledge of Good and Evil. \n \n Questions - Why is there a tree that will allow one to have knowledge of something that doesn't yet exist?\n \n Would it not be reasonable to assume that good entered into the world along with evil based on the name of the tree? Or would it not imply that there was no good or evil in the world at that time? How about both existed in the world and A & E were ignorant of the difference until they defied God, but that would mean that A & E didn't bring it into the world and it is impossible to consider that maybe the people 3000 - 4000 years ago didn't have the best of resources to use in making determinations on the beginnings of the world and man \n \n \nWhereas Genesis 1:26 states that God was to create man in His own image and likeness, Genesis 1:27 shows that man was only created in God's \"image.\" It wasn't until Genesis 3:22 when Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that he became \"like\" God.  Genesis 3:22 - \"And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.\"\n\n \n \n So now we are the image and likeness of God. Why do we know have to learn to overcome? How exactly is Jesus giving us a free pass teaching us to overcome sin and Satan? \n \n So sin entered the world thru Adam, which God wanted, and thru sin came death. How does God's removal of the Tree of Life fit into that equation? It's mentioned after the like one of us verse, maybe the name is misleading, but it seems that would have kept death away.\n \n \nTo Summarize:\n \n 1. Man was to be created in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26).\n \n 2. Part of this \"likeness\" was a knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:22)\n \n 3. For Adam to be truly \"like\" God, he had to acquire a knowledge of good and evil.\n \n 4. The means to that end was eating of the tree of the knowledge of good \n and evil.\n \n 5. To do that a \"tempter\" was likely needed to entice Adam and Eve into sin.\n \n 6. God provided, or allowed, Satan as the tempter.\n \n 7. God knew in advance what the outcome would be, but allowed it anyway.\n \n 8. God knew atonement would be required, and provided Jesus Christ as the\n \"Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth\" (Revelation 13:8).\n \n 9. Man achieves the likeness of God, acquires a knowledge of and overcomes\n evil, partakes of Christ (the \"tree of life\"), and is reunited in paradise with \n God. Man, like God, is now an overcomer.\n \n The key to all this remains, \"Is acquiring a knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite to coming into the likeness and image of God? If the answer is yes, I think Adam has to eat from that tree, and God has to make it happen. If the answer is no, then I think you have to look back to Genesis 3:22 and reconcile that with Genesis 1:26, explaining how Adam is \"like\" God, but at the same time lacks a knowledge of good and evil. Also, how does man acquire that knowledge without eating of the fruit of that tree? \n\n \n I gave 5 examples all the nonsense above is addressed there, but again instead of a tempter how about just tell them eat the fruit or don't tell them they will die if they do. \n \n Where did the rest of our knowledge come from? \n \n The entire bible is a means of making man submissive. Over and over again God wants people to worship him. \n \n The God of the Bible (just read it don't listen to what people say) acts more like the descriptions of Satan. Over an over it is repeated God loves us, but it doesn't say that anywhere, not from him. He is angry, vindictive, demands blood sacrifices, inflicts the most severe punishments on innocents, is possessive, jealous and narcissistic. But nobody says that somehow it's not his fault, they deserved, it was necessary, and so on and so on.",

Otherwise this response makes no sense when applied to this whole series.\n \n \nWhat did it say in the chapter(s) you were reading?\n\n \n Genesis after the fall. I know the official interpretation is that God's punishments are done only out of need and love. Which I disagree with. I have yet to get any response to God said to eat of the fruit would cause Adam & Eve to die. He did not say it would carry to all generations, he did not say they would not be allowed to stay in the Garden, he did not say they would know suffering and endure labor. Why the additional punishment? Had they known what other things would happen would that have been enough to discourage them? \n \n Why was there a tree to give knowledge of something that didn't exist? Was good brought into the world with evil? While true that death came to the world thru A & E sin, there is no mention that it was God who removed access to the tree of life because he did not want us to live forever.\n \n \nNot from what I see in Scripture.

Jesus the Jew, Paul, the Jew, Peter the Jew and every other first generation christian that practiced and believed Judaism would have no problem disregarding Jewish belief that Malachai was the end of prophecy. Later Christians would have some further use for it so decided to bring it back.\n \n I have read the whole bible. How else do you think I keep coming up with all these questions you are not able to answer?\n \n \nTell me how you would create man with free will while at the same time making him perfect so he will never sin? \n\n \n If I were God I would have been around more, allowed man to learn with some guidance, been clear on what the expectation were, understood that if man was perfect what need would he have of me. Only an imperfect man has need of God.\n \n The is no free will under God. Belief in God offers conditional choice, not free will. \n \n \nEvidently you want a god that appeases evil, never punishes wrongdoing, and who let's murderers, thieves, and adulterers, etc., run amock screwing everything up.

And they got it. Every last bit of it.\" Congratulations.\n\n \n I see so your backed into a corner and so lash out with the worst of the worst is all everybody elses fault as who sit back and think just wait someday you will be proven right and I'll be sorry then.\n \n If you must blame someone for the Godless state of the world because you think it serves some purpose then lay blame where it belongs. God fearing, homo hating, gun wielding conservative republicans are just as likely to create, maintain, participate or be any one of what you name above. The real group responsible for the current situation facing the Christian world is due to Christians. \n \n Early Christians were given a purpose and they blew it. Once they got into power they spent the next 1200 - 1500 years shirking their responsibilities abusing the trust given them and while desperately trying to increase their power, wealth and influence. No not every Christian was this way, and most are not today. The more control they tried to exert the less credibility the retained. The church has long fought against man's advancements in understanding our world. Beleiving itself to be infallible and breaking every one of God's commandments repeatedly rather than question the words of men who were still trying to figure out fire and 10th generation walking upright. \n \n I think there are a lot of people like me who would like to believe, but see nothing offered that makes sense. If questions are asked the answers either don't make sense or are met with anger. Christians themselves experience this but instead of looking to find out what is right they feel oppressed until they start their own denomination allowing the oppressed to become oppressors themselves. \n \n You want Christianity to spread make it worthwhile, make it make sense, and that doesn't mean let people do whatever they want. People follow rules everyday without question or complaint. Let God be God and man be man because man acting like God or God acting like man seems not to be working.",

   "Since Christians believe they are not subject to the Laws handed down by God thru Moses the OT references to homosexuality don't apply. That means you are left with the NT references. They may be applied to male prostitution, sex slaves, pimps, slave masters and promiscuous sexual acts all of which were addressing these acts being performed as part of pagan rites. Jesus' commandments were to love God and your neighbor as yourself something that all the above violate, but same sex relationships that are monogamous are not mentioned by Jesus or Paul and do not violate Jesus' commandments.\n \n You pick and choose what flavor of Christianity tastes best to you. When you need all of it to strengthen your opinion you use all of it, when parts are convenient then only parts are applicable. You have been trained that to entertain that something once true may have been misunderstood is a weakness of faith and belief in God. Look how long the church denied the earth rotated around the sun and look at the steps taken to defend that position. \n \n The church has been wrong before and will be wrong again, not about everything, but the church is nothing but a group of men who contrary to what some may think have special insight to understanding of the mind and will of God.\n \n God likes to test his subjects, maybe homosexuals are a test for Christians. Will you love them as you love yourself, will you judge acting as if you were God, will you treat them as one of Gods creations. Maybe they are the next chosen people faced with the test to persevere under contempt and hatred. \n \n If your faith is strong then some queen floating around making eyes at you isn't going to tempt you. He isn't right? You did your part, gave him the chance to think like you told him what is wrong with his life and why he needs to change and ignored anything he had to say that didn't sound like agreement with you. \n \n If they are going to face an eternity of torment then at least let them enjoy the reason for it.\n\n \n While I do agree with you on some points I do disagree with a few of them. Archie's beliefs and his ideals are his and while I do believe your opinion of them are correct in terms of just homosexuality it may be different in other areas.\n \n We see Archie here as a perfect example of faith driven life and reason. One's beliefs then drive their means and shape the way they live and the way they are thus as a person in society.\n \n Is it then that we can lightly throw aside the rationale and subconscious thoughts that shape us as humans? If one is driven in action and earnest by unbridled lust can is also be driven by unbridled faith?\n \n Jumping into forgone conclusion without testing the water in which they tread. Such is with Archie. His faith is so profound and so gripping that it is not a question of if, or of a matter of non biased personal belief, but a matter of conviction. Such a term as zealot would be appropriate.\n \n Is such faith a negative? Possibly. It is balance one must trod with belief. Weighing fact and context with belief and personal spirituality. If you stray to far to either side it becomes perilous. Such is the blindness that grips most fundamentalists.\n \n Myself, being raised Christian and knowing in my heart the truth which is empowered by faith I also do not forsake fact and context based upon my faith. I understand the context in which the Bible was written, studied Archaeological evidence and read upon the cultures which shaped the faith.\n \n Does such knowledge diminish my faith? Certainly not. But it also keeps in check that which may be turned into questioned theory and weighing of maybe into a unshaken fact in mind that would hinder my further understanding of the questioning behind it.",

   "Genesis after the fall. I know the official interpretation is that God's punishments are done only out of need and love. Which I disagree with. I have yet to get any response to God said to eat of the fruit would cause Adam & Eve to die. He did not say it would carry to all generations, he did not say they would not be allowed to stay in the Garden, he did not say they would know suffering and endure labor. Why the additional punishment? Had they known what other things would happen would that have been enough to discourage them?\n\n \n There's nothing that says what we see in the Genesis Eden account is everything that was ever said by God, etc. I already laid out my understanding of how the fall went down, so I'll refer you back to that. \n \n \nYes how silly of me. Jesus the Jew, Paul, the Jew, Peter the Jew and every other first generation christian that practiced and believed Judaism would have no problem disregarding Jewish belief that Malachai was the end of prophecy. Later Christians would have some further use for it so decided to bring it back.\n\n \n It's all one continuous saga. Did you forget the New Covenant was foretold in Jeremiah 31:31-34? You and the Jews should have seen it coming. There's nothing in the OT that says prophecy had to end in the OT, or even in the time of the NT. Even in Malachi (the end of the OT, it says God would send the Prophet Elijah, whom many Christians believe is to be one of the two witnesses of Revelation). Jesus is the \"Prophet like Moses\" who was foretold. So it's clear prophecy was not to end in the OT.\n \n \nI have read the whole bible. How else do you think I keep coming up with all these questions you are not able to answer?\n\n \n I can only elaborate on what's written. You're asking tons of questions on things that aren't written down (in the Eden account). \n \n You're missing a lot of basics. You missed on your prophecy claim and appear to have forgotten about the New Covenant, the Prophet like Moses, and other things. So, while you may have read the Bible, you clearly do not understand many of its important issues and principles. I think you gave it a superficial review and haven't taken sufficient time to have studied it in depth.\n \n \nThe is no free will under God. Belief in God offers conditional choice, not free will. \n\n \n You have free will to do whatever you want. From time to time God may step into the affairs of men and nations, but you can do anything from wooing a gerbil to engaging in mass murder. So yeah, contrary to what you argue, you and the rest of mankind do have free will to a very large extent.\n \n \nIf you must blame someone for the Godless state of the world because you think it serves some purpose then lay blame where it belongs. God fearing, homo hating, gun wielding conservative republicans are just as likely to create, maintain, participate or be any one of what you name above. The real group responsible for the current situation facing the Christian world is due to Christians. \n\n \n Every man-made scourge on this planet is the result of people - religious or non-religious - violating the teachings of Christ / God. Christianity isn't to blame, but the abrogation of its principles.\n \n \nThe church has long fought against man's advancements in understanding our world. \n\n \n Great Scientists who held a Biblical worldview.wpd\n \n \nI think there are a lot of people like me who would like to believe, but see nothing offered that makes sense. If questions are asked the answers either don't make sense or are met with anger. Christians themselves experience this but instead of looking to find out what is right they feel oppressed until they start their own denomination allowing the oppressed to become oppressors themselves. \n\n \n Jesus fulfilled hundreds of Messianic prophecies. That makes sense to hundreds of millions of believers. It's all there. You can start with Isaiah 53, which even the majority of ancient rabbis believed was Messianic. You're just choosing to not believe. \n \n The truths of the Bible are spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:14, etc.). Just ask Christ to show you the way, and in time he will.",

I am not mixing biblical law and moral law. You referred to scripture making no mention of moral law. \n \n Your statement concerning moral law is incorrect. Although the concept of Natural Law dates back to Greek and Roman philosophers, by the 12th century natural and moral law believed by Christians was still being developed. To think that scripture did not heavley influence it is naive. To think that what is understood as moral has never changed is just as naive. To think that moral law established by male heterosexuals is objective is your third strike. \n \n There is a reason for the insistence that homosexuality is a choice. This choice would permit the argument that it isn't natural and therefore goes against the natural law and therefore is immoral. If it isn't then it is not inconsistent with natural law and it could only be argued promiscous premarital sex isn't consistent with natural law and therefore not immoral. By the way there is a reason natural law isn't used very much these days. Advances in our understanding of nature have shown many of the past beliefs supporting the Christian understanding of moral law have been proven incorrect. Since it takes an act of God to change the mind of most Christians (sometimes even that is insufficient) it is easier to just ignore the evidence and find some other way to prove themselves right.\n \n \nThis is more compromising of Gods truths in order to satisfy your preferred world view. The NT is as clear as the OT is that homosexuality condemned by God as an abomination which destroys its practitioners.

This isn't the original English translation is it? No it's not. \n \n Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders\n \n Do you not know is now understood better as Do not be deceived? Pure propaganda. Try and explain how this isn't meant to change the understanding from neutral, the reader isn't aware, to negative the reader is being intentionally lied to. Effeminate is now a male prostitute? I guess we are to assume this is a gay prostitute? Or a prostitute who services male or female and female prostitutes are implied or ok. Homosexual offenders, I guess if you translated the English to English this could work, but since the Greek to English translation has some problems, so to would this English to English.\n \n \n \nHere's another NT Passage:\n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.

It is so obvious that you must corrupt there meaning while accusing me of doing it. \n\n \n You submit text that has been changed to now be more consistent with your belief. My guess is that these changes were at least in part to evidence that the two Greek words used by Paul do not mean what was thought. Bible publishers can't make changes that contradict what is thought to be correct. You know that was one of the conditions in determining The Canon. The text had to support what was believed to be true. A requirement that is still practiced today. What do you think would be more lucrative? Publish a bible that is more more supportive or less supportive of what is thought to be? I have not changed the text have I? YOU DID! Since when did man have the right to edit the word of God?\n \n \nThe bolded is a blatant lie which you cannot prove is true in any way at all. I do not pick and choose that which I hold true in Gods word. A christians greatest challenge and most vital priority is to properly discern Gods intent from His word which many times can be interpreted in various ways. \n\n \n Sure can. What form of Christianity do you belong to? Why? Because if your Catholic you find their belief correct. This makes it appealing to you, it meshes better than any other with your sense of what are Gods desires for man. Eastern Orthodox, Baptist, Protestant, Mormon, Methodist whichever the case may be, while they have certain concepts in common God, Jesus, they differ strongly enough to establish a separate denomination. There are 30,000 different Christian groups in the world, 150 of those have 1 million or more members. That is a lot of different for groups sharing the same basic concepts. The only rational explanation, personal preference.\n \n \nBy admitting this is true in some areas of the bible, please don't interpret that to apply to the issue of homosexuality because in that area where both the Old and New Testaments agree it's an abomination, there is no doubt that God abhors this unnatural expression of sexual perversion.\n\n \n There was no doubt the world was flat. There was no doubt that the Sun revolved around the Earth. There was no doubt the Earth was made before the Sun. \n \n I don't expect to change your mind, but hold on to your beliefs either because of the facts or because it feels right for you, I don't care. Just don't confuse the them for people who are interested in separating the two",

Because you wrote: \"...Jewish belief that Malachai was the end of prophecy.\"\n \n Like I wrote before: There's nothing in the OT that says prophecy had to end in the OT, or even in the time of the NT. Even in Malachi (the end of the OT, it says God would send the Prophet Elijah, whom many Christians believe is to be one of the two witnesses of Revelation). Jesus is the \"Prophet like Moses\" who was foretold. And if you think some other Jew was the \"Prophet like Moses\" then identify that person.

There's many Jews who are Messianic Jews who would tell you that you're dead wrong. And as many times as God levied judgment on the people he referred to as a \"stiff necked people\" - those who broke his covenant (Jeremiah 31:32) - I wouldn't put a lot of faith in that. The written word says otherwise, as I have noted.\n \n Also, concerning gentiles: Isaiah has a lot to say concerning God's promises of salvation to the gentiles. Jesus spent a lot of time with gentiles and healed many of them. You might also read Romans chapters 9, 10, and 11 concerning how the Jews messed up for a time and the gentiles were ingrafted into God's plan. Plus, there's this from Galatians chapter 3:29 \n \n \"If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\" Also, from Romans 9:8: \"...it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.\" The promise came by faith, not by birth.

   "I'd like to comment on your first point. \n \n \n1) God didn't want the original existence described in Genesis for Mankind. God created a scenario in which 2 people were told they were not to do something. Having no idea what the consequences actually meant. Placing a being of superior intelligence in their midst who had just been banished for causing a rebellion and war in Heaven by defying God's will. God allows Adam and Eve to fall, punishes them with not only the promised death, but adds additional penalties to the punishment including labor, suffering and evicts them from Eden and extending his retribution to all mankind forever.\n\n \n Adam and Eve knew that they were not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. They knew that. We read in Genesis: \"He [Satan] said to the woman, \"Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?\" And the woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'\" (Genesis 3:1b-3) \n \n They had been commanded by God not to do something. That is enough. Also, they had been provided for by God immeasurably up to this point and had no reason but to conclude that God was and is a loving, caring God. \n \n You must also understand that God is just. He is all that is just. If someone sins against Him they will be punished. But when you look at God you do not only see a vengeful God who acts against the wicked. You also see a merciful and loving God who forgives sinners who repent and trust in Christ.",

We read in Genesis: \"He [Satan] said to the woman, \"Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?\" And the woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'\" (Genesis 3:1b-3) \n \n They had been commanded by God not to do something. That is enough. Also, they had been provided for by God immeasurably up to this point and had no reason but to conclude that God was and is a loving, caring God. \n \n You must also understand that God is just. He is all that is just. If someone sins against Him they will be punished. But when you look at God you do not only see a vengeful God who acts against the wicked. You also see a merciful and loving God who forgives sinners who repent and trust in Christ.\n\n \n Amen. Welcome to the fray.\n \n Jesus is Lord!!\n \n Easyrider",

Nobody born into this world lives a complete and whole righteous life.\n \n \n If you wish for responsibility to be borne by the one who caused the event, then that blame goes to God. Death to A/E was the only consequence they were to receive as a result of their actions. Anything additional is at God's discretion. He was not required by his earlier words to curse the world or impose any other penalties on A/E or future generations, but he did.\n \n \nThat is why all people suffer the wrath and judgment of a holy God, unless they cry out for mercy and receive forgiveness as a result of what Jesus Christ has done. \n \n God knew Adam and Eve would disobey Him. But, He never made them disobey Him. He did not create robots. He allowed them to make their choice because it is right that a person should take accountability for the wrong they have done.\n\n \n A little extreme don't you think? Exactly what is it they are to take responsibility for? Because they made an evil choice? They didn't know what evil was. They were told one thing and later another. You expect them to understand deception, but how, they had never been deceived prior to that. The concept of not listening to God being something bad didn't exist for them.\n \n \nAlso, in allowing them to disobey Him (and in so doing damning the entire race) He knew it would allow Him to do the unthinkable. It would allow God Himself to die on a cross and take the punishment for the sin of all humanity. It would allow Him to show the extent of His love for His creation.\n\n \n Do you think that there might have been a more effective means by which to teach this lesson? Your repeating without any thought behind the words. It couldn't be unthinkable, it was the intent of the whole thing. Your describing a set up. One by a God who is so insecure he feels compelled to create a disaster so he can be seen as the hero.\n \n All humanity didn't sin. \n \n If God is dead who are you praying to? \n \n \nInstead of arguing with God regarding the state the world is now in, instead of arguing against the existence of hell, turn to Christ and receive forgiveness.\n\n \n I don't argue with God. I don't blame him for the condition of the world. I don't know if there is a hell and neither does anyone else so arguing about it's existence would be meaningless. \n \n If the events as described by you are accurate, we are not the ones who should be asking for forgiveness.\n \n \nEverybody deserves to go to hell. But nobody has to go to hell. Not one person. Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\n\n \n You make your creator so proud. You have given up on yourself. You admit that what your creator has made is, was and forever will be something that requires pity. Will never be self sufficient and while begging for mercy, knowing without a doubt that the creation does not deserve anything for it's failure still wants the reward. The creation is confident that it will be given what it doesn't deserve because it is easier to take advantage of the loving creator than to fulfill it's potential.\n \n If we all deserve to go to hell, then take responsibility and go. Why not if that is what you deserve? Why is mercy and compassion an option now, but not for A/E?\n \n \n\"For God so loved the world, that He gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16)\n\n \n Rather limiting for an omnipotent being. \n \n Why does that make logical sense to you?",

In case you missed it, in Job chapter one God allows Satan to try to make his case. So God allowed the fall of man so man could have free will without being a pre-programmed robot who just does good. Therefore, man was reasonably free (subject to God's intervention at times) to do either good or evil. Some pick good, and others pick evil.

That is the definition, there is no getting around it. As soon as God established a reward or a consequence for our actions there no longer was free will.\n \n Secondly, there is no free will if there is prophecy. If the future has been established, which permits prophecy, then regardless of how contrary one's choice may seem, it will always be the one that is consistent with the predetermined outcome.\n \n So there is no free will if there is salvation and damnation or prophecy.

I do believe that those who have been witnessed to the Word and decided that they did not want the salvation will be judged at the final judgment for whatever disposition it has been chosen. For all others God also has His disposition as planned. What that judgment is is Gods prerogative. \n \n If it is truly as you note, and that God desires a certain specific amount, then we should be thankful that, for whatever reason, we had the opportunity to be drawn into His family.
