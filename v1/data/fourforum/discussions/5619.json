   "This thread is to discuss how our value structures relate to the moral status of abortion.\n \n Our value structures are basically preference orderings of various things. One obvious example is a rational value structure that, ceteris paribus, more of one variable is preferable to less of one variable. \n \n This might be written as a list:\n \n 1. <\n 2. <\n \n Or a set ordered left to right:\n \n [<, <]\n \n Or as a network of conditional statements:\n \n If < and < Then <\n If < and < Then <\n \n Oh, and here's a handy link for your edification:\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/",

   "The reason I brought this up is that most sides of the abortion debate have logically valid arguments for their positions, and what the disagreement comes down to is a matter of values, those assumptions that we take as primitive before any conclusions are drawn, and upon which those conclusions are built.\n \n Certain kinds of christians take their interpretations of the Bible on faith, as the basic values that determine their moral world. \n \n Other kinds of christians take their interpretations of the Bible with a grain of salt, and try to determine what set of basic values the Bible is an example of. \n \n And so on. What propositions do you take for granted when you argue that abortion should be legal or not?",
