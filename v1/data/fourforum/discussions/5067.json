Americans pay little attention to foreign affairs other than favorable to the US info fed them by the media/politicians. To the world, it did make the UK look like a US lapdog. Every country other than the UK in the 'Coalition of the Willing' was known to be bought and paid for by the US. Not exactly sterling company for the UK global image.",
