   "Associated Press\n \n GREENSBORO, N.C. -- An off-duty police officer's concealed gun went off during the Atlantic Coast Conference quarterfinal game between Maryland and Wake Forest on Friday night, injuring the officer in the buttocks, police said.\n \n The gun accidentally discharged about midway through the second half. No other injuries were reported.\n \n The officer, whose name was not immediately available, was taken to receive medical care. His injury is considered minor.\n \n \"It was purely an accidental discharge,\" said Laura Mullinax, a watch operations specialist with the Greensboro Police Department.\n \n Police said the officer was from another state, but would not say which one.\n \n Authorities said the officer was in violation of North Carolina law, and an investigation is ongoing.\n \n \"The Greensboro Coliseum and the Greensboro Police Department consider this violation a serious matter and charges will be filed as appropriate,\" officials said in a joint statement early Saturday.\n \n \"I didn't know what happened, I heard a sound, but I didn't know what it was,\" said Wake Forest coach Skip Prosser.\n \n Maryland coach Gary Williams said he heard the shot but at first didn't know what it was.\n \n \"Then when I found out and they stopped play, I was worried because it was when we were playing well,\" he said. \"But the refs did a great job of keeping the players involved with what was going on on the court and not what was going on off of it.\"",
