The same policies that has spawned huge numbers of followers for the Jihadists. In makes perfect sense for them to support a candidate who will indirectly help further their goals. The only reason Iraq is getting better is because the Bush foreign doctrine policy was revoked almost entirely. Hamas has a bad rep in the US. Not so much in other places in the world, but the rest of the world isn't voting in our election. Your personal insults need work.

However, if a dope like me can read it, what makes you think he didn't? He supported his pastor, though he knows of at least some of his veiws.\n\n \n Got it, idle speculation is all you have. No evidence that Obama read the document, supporting printing it or was in any position to do anything about it. By that logic, everyone who is some form of organization is responsible and believes everything that organization does and prints regardless of their actual power. That kind of thinking is why we think you are a fool. \n \n \nTimes change. I think \"we\" means \"you\".\n\n \n Those with a brain consider you a fool. Ask Steeeve and Daewoo to read your stuff. And then watch as they shred you to pieces. The only real support you have comes from spammers like bassman, who is essentially a coward as he flees all posts with opposition. \n \n \nCan you support that?\n\n \n Explain to me how someone who is making $14.2 million is actually going to be seriously financially injured by Obama's tax rates. Furthermore, these people are already engaging in salary deferrals to further decrease their tax liability. Essentially they defer large amounts of their pay to spread it out and reduce their tax liability. Furthermore, the smart ones are getting pay in the form of muni bonds which are tax free or through long term capital gains. Warren Buffet is correct: CEOs have lower tax brackets then their workers due to structuring of their incomes. Obama's direct income tax raises can't actually hurt them unless they are stupid enough to take their entire salaries as earn income in one period. \n \n \nYou may speak of this when alternative fuels are abundant. You may speak of this when Osama follows through on his hollow claims to pass laws that demand hybrids (in reality, he couldn't pull that off in two terms.)\n\n \n Did you entirely skip economics in college? High prices for a commodity increases competition to take those economic rents, resulting in substitutes. High oil prices causes higher natural gas prices, thus causing other forms of electrical generation to be profitable as they can raise their prices. Thus, there is more incentive for more wind and solar as well as nuclear, but that's another issue. Furthermore, when and if we can get off of oil as a fuel source, we can abandon the oil trading schemes that favor people we don't like. I don't know about you, but having my dollars go to Iran to prop up that government isn't something I like. You may disagree and you probably do. \n \n \nExcuse me? You support things like Penfold. You only scream \"YOU'RE WRONG!! YOU'RE WRONG!!!\".\n\n \n Show me where I have stated such. Or you are lying.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/11843-commercial-products-creationism.html\n http://www.4forums.com/political/elections-debates/11505-mccain-net-neutrality.html\n http://www.4forums.com/political/elections-debates/11496-mccain-obama-ticket-insolvency.html\n http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/11128-late-carboniferous-athropods-literal-creationism.html\n \n Looks like you are wrong (again). But that's not exactly news. \n \n \nOnce again, you can pull this bunny out of your sleeve when this is a secure option.\n\n \n Apparently you are ignorant to the debt situation.How much do you think we borrow daily from the world? How much do you think our annual debt payments are? How much do you think we need to borrow weekly just to have the government operate on a basic level? Did you realize that the $700 billion socialist welfare bailout is going to be funded by nothing? That they are going to print money and simply pretend that it is worth $700 billion? That's the road to hyperinflation. \n \n \nI wasn't denying that they exist. I was just making things harder on you. Of course, Osama's tax plan would leave one hell of a gap in supplies.\n\n \n Come again? How would that leave a gap in supplies? It would probably reduce demand, or do you not understand what supply and demand are? Probably given your intelligence....\n \n \nCEOs would think \"**** this, I don't wanna be CEO anymore.\" Speaking of inflation.\n\n \n Because of what? Inflation was a result of the poor dollar and oil prices, which in a sense are a vicious cycle. Now that oil prices are declining, it shouldn't be a problem. And increasing taxes doesn't result in increasing inflation. But your economic knowledge is pretty pathetic. \n \n \nAnd finally, for a third time, would you support your paranoid delusion of the catasprophe that McCain would release unto our economy?\n\n \n $5 trillion in additional debt.
