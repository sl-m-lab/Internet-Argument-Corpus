I am NOT going to hazard newsweeks poor search function to find the article back in 2002 where the oil minister of Kuwait said whatever the hell. \n \n If somebody specifically asks for a link or an explanation of how you came to a conclusion, I think you should accomodate them generally. I have no interest in visiting a board where 4000 people just re-iterate news bits or political speeches. I am far more interested in folks collective conclusions regarding events.",

   "It's called \"Citation\" by the way, and it's not about proving stuff but rather about acknowledging ideas. Trying to prove stuff with citations, especially on the internet is pointless. Better to explain why you're claiming whatever it is that you are. \n \n Proof is done through demonstration.\n \n On the internet this can be done by agreeing to a set of propositions and then deriving entailments from those propositions. If you both agree to the propositions, and you make valid inferences, then you either have to agree to the conclusion or demonstrate that you're dumber than a sack of hammers.",
