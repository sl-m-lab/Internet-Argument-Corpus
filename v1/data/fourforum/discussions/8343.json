   "I am going to Alaska. I will fly on 9/11 like I did to Hawaii in 2003. I have a flexible plan, flying into Anchorage and taking either a bus or the Alaska Railroad to Denali National Park. From Denali, I will travel to Fairbanks close to the Arctic Circle. The northern lights are visible 240 nights a year from Fairbanks. I want to experience them in their glory before heading back to Anchorage.",
