However, I'll venture to guess -- and you can certainly correct me -- that you don't think homosexuality should be illegal. Even though you think it's immoral.\n\n \n You may be asking the wrong person here. Because I'm a realist, I don't assign any morality at all on anyone's sexuality. I don't know where you get that I do or don't think gay marriage should be \"allowed.\" In fact, I can direct you to some posts where I say that gay's could still enter into all sorts of marriage like contracts even if the government were to refuse to recognize their unions as \"marriages.\"\n \n I believe that homosexuality is just as gentically influenced as is a person's heterosexuality. I also believe that there is a lot of people somewhere in the middle and that their sexuality also is for the most part \"genetic.\" So, (in my opinion) saying that homosexuality should be illegal is a lot like saying that people who are left handed or born with red hair should be criminalized. It would be idiotic to do that.\n \n Finally, I believe (regarding gay marriage) that the government (U.S.) is charged with promoting the \"general welfare\" and not with seeing that each and every conceivable \"union\" be recognized as a legitimate \"marriage.\" Specifically, since human beings are most naturally reproduced heterosexually,... It makes sense to me to recognize that as fact as we consider the \"general welfare\" application for \"marriages.\" Add to that that our children (in general) are best served to meet the needs of the \"general welfare\" of our society by having a Male role model and a female role model (still speaking generally here) that \"heterosexual marriage\" best fits that template. And lastly, because I believe it's easiest to avoid incestual problems of half siblings hooking up with one another,... Bigamy is probably a bad idea too. So, the \"marriage\" model that best suits the \"general welfare\" of the nation is, was and always will be a \"one man one woman marriage.\"\n \n Not because making babies is a requirment for marriage,... but because making babies and rearing them to be productive citizens is most suited to the nations \"general welfare\" using the one man one woman relationship.\n \n Gay's can \"marry\" all they want,... call it whatever they want,... I personally don't care. But I'll still defend the governments right to define marriage as IT sees fit to meet the \"general welfare\" needs of the nation,... even if that means treating all the other variations to marriage with indifference.",

I do see how same gender marriage is in the interests of families, including same gender partners and children, who are also part of this nation.\n \n Bigamy, which you mentioned, is not a marriage variation, but a form of fraud.

First of all, common law couples fall under the same laws as those who get legally married. Gay partners do not attain the same protections afforded by law to those who married under common law. Secondly, polygamy is an entirely different question, ILLEGAL in the United States, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is, that U.S. marriages are based on monogamous relationships between two persons.\n \n I notice you keep holding up artificial examples of relationships that are entirely different, but using the ploy of appealing to people's emotional responses to those other relationships. For example, incest -- which is rape. Bigamy -- which is a form of fraud. And now polygamous households, which is an entirely different subject, just for starters, because of the NUMBER of people involved. These are all -- illegal. All of these examples are not addressing the logic of the issues. You are just making an appeal to prejudice and emotional knee-jerk reaction.\n \n \n2: I don't buy the closet thing,..

Let's take away heterosexual's right to legally marry and see how insignificant you find that to your life. After all, in your words, you can still \"marry\". No one's stopping you.\n \n \n3: This is the first time I've seen anyone use the \"let's streamline government\" line to justify gay marriage demands\n\n \n That's because you're not familiar with literature citing the number of rights and privileges attached to marriage in the U.S. Your opinion isn't based on factual data or anything well researched.\n \n \nOur country will, can and has survived just fine without gay marriages. \n\n \n People said the same thing down south about integration.\n \n \nIt's just not the same.\n\n \n That's about all your argument is, isn't it.

It would be idiotic to do that.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Yes it would.\n \n \n \n Chuz Life\n Not because making babies is a requirment for marriage,... but because making babies and rearing them to be productive citizens is most suited to the nations \"general welfare\" using the one man one woman relationship.\n Gay's can \"marry\" all they want,... call it whatever they want,... I personally don't care. But I'll still defend the governments right to define marriage as IT sees fit to meet the \"general welfare\" needs of the nation,... even if that means treating all the other variations to marriage with indifference.\n\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Does your selected group of those worthy of marriage include left handed people? How about red headed people? I am quite sure it does. A few paragraphs ago homosexuals were part of the left handed red headed members of society. Suddenly where marriage is concerned homosexuals are left at the back of the bus. What is about them that makes you feel that they should not be able to be married? What is about red headed and/or left handed people that makes you feel they should be able to marry?\n Anything that makes it okay to treat law abiding, tax paying, hard working citizens of a free nation, with indifference is not okay! Two consenting adults is not a variation on marriage.",
