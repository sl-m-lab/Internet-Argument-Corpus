To deny them of that is the murder of every bit of potential that exists within them just as when a 5 year old child is hit by a car, it is a waste of all of his future potential. After all, a 2 day old baby is no more valuable or independent potentially speaking than an unborn child is 2 days before it's born, but the 2 day old child has all of the rights that you have to life. Weird huh ? That doesn't make any sense at all does it ?

   "It can include the Fetus in some cases.\n\n \n Not true. Murder is defined as \"illegal killing with malice aforethought.\" Abortion fails this definition for two reasons. First, abortion is not illegal, and second, there is no evidence to suggest that expecting mothers (even those that don't want to be pregnant) feel any malice towards their own flesh and blood. Perhaps the Encyclopedia Britannica says it in the most clear manner:\n \n \nIn English tradition, murder was defined as the willful killing with malice aforethought of a human creature in being within the king's peace, the death occurring within a year and a day of the injury. Most of these elements remain in modern definitions of the crime-the requirement that the victim is \"in being,\" for instance, distinguishes abortion from murder.&#8232;\n",

   "So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.\n \n Or am I missing something? Care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?\n\n \n Thinking, logical people do not automatically accept that government entities are qualified to make logical, well thought out rulings on things that truly matter. Who would ever have dreamed that officials could or ever would decide that destroying a life which exist, though it is incapable of expressing it's will to survive, as is natural for any living being, should be snuffed out at the whim of someone who indulged in the activity which produces life when they were not ready to deal with that life? Thus they give little thought to what those who spin un-thought out ideas as evidence.",
