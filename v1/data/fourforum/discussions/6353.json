   "I wrote in response to another post: \n \n A Christian is one who lives their life according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. \n \n There are many who wrap themselves in the word Christianity but they are \"anti-Christians\". \n \n They are \"anti-abortion\" because they say that is the teaching of Jesus. It is not. \n \n They are pro-death penalty and try to justify that as Christian. It is not. \n \n They support attacking another country because that country \"may pose a threat\". They claim that it is a justifiable act in Christianity. It is not.\n \n They are dishonest, hypocritical, and anti-Christian. They should be called to task for distorting the teachings of Jesus Christ.\n \n That does not mean that they do not believe what they say, but that does not make it true. That does not mean that many are not good people, many are. It does not mean that they do not do good works, many do and for that we should all be grateful. However, they should be called to task for distorting the words of Jesus, not only for their own edification, but more importantly because the words of Jesus Christ deserve to be defended against those who distort it.\n \n If they are Christians, as they claim, why are they so afraid to reference what Jesus Christ himself said about these things?",

   "\"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge: \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n I Corinthians 5:13: \"Are you not to judge those inside (the church)? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you.\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:4: \"Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church.\"\n \n (also note 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15).\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?\n \n Howard Beale, is Jesus God?",

Or even to \"correct judgments\" for that matter? He just says that you treat him like a pagan or a tax collector - as someone who is unavailable to hear anything. Jesus does not say to go to the government and take the guy to court.\n \n \nGod commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

He does not say \"every tree that does not bear good fruit you should cut down or the church should cut down and throw into the fire.\" Doesn't it bother you to misrepresent the words of someone that you yourself say is God.\n \n \nJesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n\n Where does he condemn them to? He just calls them for what they are: wicked and hypocrites. I am all with him in calling things for what they are - like people who twist the words of Jesus to their own ends. Combine those verses of Matthew with these:\n \n Mt:6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n Mt:6:6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n And you get a pretty good idea of what Jesus would say about many congregations today - imagine what he would say about televangelists! Talk about praying I public! They seem pretty close to the Pharisees, don't they.\n \n I haven't even scratched the surface of your misrepresentations of Jesus' words. Of 14 verses you sight, 8 are from others (mostly Paul) and of the six that quote the words of Jesus, you misrepresent 5 of them.

   "As far as who Jesus was, I agree with who he said he was in all its complexity.\n\n \n Why the evasion, Howard? Why not have the guts to come out and say, \"YES, JESUS IS GOD!!!!!\" Or, \"NO, JESUS IS NOT GOD!!!\"\n \n But for your edification:\n \n Did Jesus Claim To Be God?  \n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9).\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB).\n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6). \n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" \n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? \n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. \n \n (This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart.)",

   "[Jesus said,] \"For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ... At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\"\n \n \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.\" \n (Matthew 24:27, 30-34)\n \n\n \n But clearly, that generation, and a great many others since, have passed away without the second coming of Jesus. Here we have not only an example of a false Biblical prophecy, but one spoken by Jesus himself. Jesus is a false prophet!\n \n Some have tried to get around this embarrassing predicament by saying that the original word that was translated as \"generation\" could also be translated as \"race\", such that \"I tell you the truth, this [race] will not pass away until all these things have happened.\" Is there any reason to doubt this attempt to avoid Jesus being a false prophet? Yes. The Bible - in fact, the very same book in it, the book of Matthew - makes it clear that Jesus meant generation, as in the people currently alive when He made the statement, and not race.\n \n \nThen Jesus said to his disciples, ... \"For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with the angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\"\n (Matthew 16:24, 27-28)\n \n\n \n We see Jesus make the same general claim in both the book of Mark and the book of Luke:\n \n \n[Then Jesus said to his disciples and the crowd,] \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels\". \n \n And he said to them, \"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.\"\n (Mark 8:38 - 9:1)\n \n\n \n and:\n \n \n[Then Jesus said to them all,] \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\"\n (Luke 9:26-27)\n \n\n \n So Jesus's prophecy failed. What does the Bible itself, back in Deuteronomy, tells us about people who foretell prophecies that fail to come true?\n \n \n[The Lord God said,] \"You may say to yourselves, 'How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord?' If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously.\"\n (Deuteronomy 18:21-22)\n \n\n \n So the Lord God Himself tells us that Jesus does not speak for Him. But worse, for Jesus, is what the previous verse tells us should be done to a false prophet like Jesus.\n \n \n[The Lord God said to me,] \"... a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death.\"\n (Deuteronomy 18:20)\n \n",

Stop misrepresenting what Jesus said!\n\n \n Rebuking people who are lost or full of folly is an established Biblical concept, i.e. Ecclesiastes 7:5 - It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools. And Proverbs 17:10 - A rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred lashes a fool. Even Jesus said it's okay to rebuke people, i.e. Luke 17:3-4 - \"If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 4 If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him.\" Nice try.\n \n \n Then Jesus said to them all, \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\" (Luke 9:26-27). So Jesus's prophecy failed. \n\n \n Did Jesus not say the \"kingdom of God is within you in Luke 17?\" Jesus replied, \"The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, 21 nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you.\" Recommend you read up on the Holy Spirit and what the \"kingdom of God\" is.

Maybe because if you looked at how many of these preachers and teachers lived their lives, judging, condemning, degrading other people... if you held their words and actions up against the teachings of Jesus they would be seen for the hypocrites that they truly are. They tell you to give money to their \"churches\". Don't you remember Jesus throwing those same kinds of people out of the temple? They have to distract you with untruth to keep their positions of power and wealth.\n \n Use the brain God gave you. The teachings of Jesus are important. What he taught is more important than silly arguments over whether he really existed; whether he is really God; whether Mary Magdalene was his wife... those are all ways of avoiding the study of his teachings and the living of life according to them. \n \n Use the brain God gave you.

It is ridiculous to have them quote their teachers who say, \"The teachings of Jesus are not the important aspect of Christianity.\" These teachers are not Christians.\n \n Read what I wrote. Those comments of mine were not directed at anything you said. They were directed at others who take the position that the writings of Paul, Peter and others are of equal importance as the teachings of Jesus. They quote from all these others much more than from Jesus. I have no problem quoting anything anybody said, but, if you are a Christian, the teachings of Jesus are paramount and all other teachings must been seen through the teachings of Jesus. Otherwise why did he bother to say anything?",

For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having know it, to turn from the holy commandent delivered to them.\n (2 Peter 2:20-22)\n \n\n \n \nFor it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentence, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.\n (Hebrews 6:4-6)\n \n\n \n \nBrethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, let him know that who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.\n (James 5:19-20)\n \n\n \n \n \nIt is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yolk of slavery.\n (Galatians 5:1)\n \n\n \n And this parable/story told by Jesus also indicates a saved person can then be lost.\n \n \nThen the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. ... Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, \"You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on your? And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.\n (Matthew 18:23-25)\n \n\n \n The Bible contradicts itself. Can a saved person be lost? The Bible says Yes, and the Bible says No. Are we saved by grace or by our works? Parts of the Bible say the first, part of the Bible says the other. What does a person need to do to be saved? Different parts of the Bible give different requirements. Basically, the Bible is a jumbled mess of contradictions and inconcistencies.\n \n You guys go ahead and continue your arguments about this or that part of your religion.

   "Why Israel Cannot Be the Suffering Servant of Isaiah Chapter 53\n \n Israel does not even fit the description of the Servant in Isaiah 53:\n \n The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\" \n \n When did Israel suffer and not open her mouth (v. 7)? Are you suggesting that Jews have never complained about their oppression? That doesn't match history either. \n \n When was Israel cut off from the land of the living (v.8)? \n \n When was Israel assigned a grave with the rich (v.8)? \n \n When can we say that Israel did no violence (v.9)? Isaiah chapter 1, verse 15 states, \"Your hands are full of blood.\" They also went on a violent tear under the leadership of Joshua, etc., etc. \n \n When did Israel bear your iniquities (v.11)?

And Isaiah speaks similarly of the time when he shall appear, without father or mother or family being known, He came up as a sucker before him, and as a root out of dry earth, etc....in the words of Isaiah, when describing the manner in which kings will harken to him, At him kings will shut their mouth; for that which had not been told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have perceived.\" (From the Letter to the South (Yemen), quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 374-5)\n \n Rabbi Mosheh Kohen Ibn Crispin: This rabbi described those who interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to Israel as those: \"having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined after the `stubbornness of their own hearts,' and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah....This prophecy was delivered by Isaiah at the divine command for the purpose of making known to us something about the nature of the future Messiah, who is to come and deliver Israel, and his life from the day when he arrives at discretion until his advent as a redeemer, in order that if anyone should arise claiming to be himself the Messiah, we may reflect, and look to see whether we can observe in him any resemblance to the traits described here; if there is any such resemblance, then we may believe that he is the Messiah our righteousness; but if not, we cannot do so.\" (From his commentary on Isaiah, quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 99-114.)\n \n Additional Rabbinic quotes in the following link:\n \n http://www.hearnow.org/isa_com.html\n \n Orion, the whole world is wanting to know when you are going to decide to come out of the closet and tell us who your so-called \"god\" is (you know, the one who approves of gay sex, fornication, Wiccanism, and the worship of Satan), and where it lives, etc. (I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR \"SCHOLARSHIP\" ON THAT GEM - LOL)!!!  \n \n Only then you will start to gain credibility around here for being knowledgeable and an informed commentator on Biblical Scholarship. It's not enough to constantly bark at other people's religious beliefs - if you want to run with the big dogs you have to be able to document your own beliefs. Which you are unable to do.\n \n You are the type that would go to Africa and drink poision Kool-Aid. emoticon_frazzled\n \n Being able to memorize what is written in a book is one thing (an \"idoit savant\" for example).

But the human mind has no power to reach the thoughts of the Creator, for His thoughts and ways are unlike ours. All these matters of Jeshua of Nazareth and of the Ishmaelite who stood up after him (Muhammad) are only intended to pave the way for the Anointed King, and to mend the entire world to worship God together, thus: \"For then I shall turn a clear tongue to the nations to call all in the Name of the Lord and to worship him with one shoulder.\"\n \n \"How is this? The entire world had become filled with the issues of the Anointed One and of the Torah and the Laws, and these issues had spread out unto faraway islands and among many nations uncircumcised in the heart, and they discuss these issues and the Torah's laws. These say: These Laws were true but are already defunct in these days, and do not rule for the following generations; whereas the other ones say: There are secret layers in them and they are not to be treated literally, and the Messiah had come and revealed their secret meanings.

   "There's another problem with the Bible: store of Moses freeing his people.\n \n You see, before Moses even went to see the Pharaoh, God said:\n \n \nThe Lord said to Moses, \"When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.\"\n (Exodus 4:21)\n \n\n \n So God says that he will TAKE AWAY PHARAOH'S FREE WILL! GOD will MAKE Pharaoh not let the slaves go.\n \n In fact, throughout the story, this is confirmed.\n \n \n[Then the Lord said to Moses,] \"But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonder in Egypt, he will not listen to you.\"\n (Exodus 7:3-4)\n \n\n \n Again, God clearly saying that He - God - will be responsible for Pharaoh's actions.\n \n And then the Bible confirms what God said He would do:\n \n \nYet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.\n (Exodus 7:13)\n \n\n \n This is Pharaoh's fault? NO!!! God said, beforehand, that HE would harden Pharaoh's heart and that HE would not let Pharaoh free the slaves. \n \n We see the same thing as the above passage a few more times.\n \n And then later, after God inflicted numerous other miseries on Pharaoh's people and livestock, we see this:\n \n \nBut the Lord hardended Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said to Moses.\n (Exodus 9:12)\n \n\n \n This continues until God kills all of the first born of Egypt.\n \n What we have hear is God playing out some vicious, malicious, perverted, unrighteous, game, with Moses and Pharaoh being mere pawns. God is controlling the entire game; HE keeps hardening Pharaoh's heart, just as He said He would beforehand. But then God kills all of the first born of egypt, because Pharaoh did what God made him do?!?!?!?!?!?!?\n \n God's one sick mother.",

I'm talking about Jesus's death on the cross, and the silly religious mumbo jumbo Matthew padded his account of it with.\n \n \nBassMan: When Christ was crucified, the temple veil that shrouded the Holy of Holies was ripped right down the middle! \n\n \n There is consensus about THAT in the gospels, but not about Matthew's fable of the dead leaving their tombs and then later entering the city. Please stay on target.\n \n Here, since you apparently don't know what the actual discussion is about<b></b>:\n \n \n\"And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.\n \n At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus's resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\n \n When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\"\n (Matthew 27:50-54)\n \n\n \n The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life and they came out of their tombs AT THE MOMENT THAT JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS. \n \n Later, when Jesus was resurrected, THE RESURRECTED DEAD WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND WERE SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE.\n \n You've yet to give anywhere near an adequate explanation for why something so absolutely amazing and supernatural as this, allegedly witnessed by those at the crucification and then by others in the holy city a few days later, was not reported by even one other of the gospel writers.\n \n \n \nBassman: God made His way of salvation accessible to all by faith.
