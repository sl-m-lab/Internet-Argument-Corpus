   "When will you people grasp that we aren't sharing our opinions so there is no arrogance which motivates us at all. It is God who has defined what truth is, not man. \n\n \n That is your 1st and 2nd mistake. You are correct that you are not sharing, forcing would be a more accurate description. Is there a word more appropriate to describe the setting of one's self above or superior to another, to insult, to express false pity based on your perception of another's need of it? No arrogance is not what motivates you, it's one of the justifications you hide behind. What motivates you is fear. Christians fear knowing God's truth. I can only assume because they feel by accepting they must keep searching for it they may not find it or what they find may not be acceptable to them. This irrational fear is what allows them to disregard logic and accept without question anything that supports the belief, even if later shown to wrong.\n \n \n \nBut not so with the secular humanist who seeks to rationalize that which can't be comprehended in the natural mind.\n\n \n Yet your natural mind has been able to? That which you hold true is so because you comprehend it, but the evidence clearly shows that, at least in part, it isn't understood. That is denied to what purpose? Obviously not in the desire to know God. Any attempt at truth for Christians is severely handicapped in that the truth must conform to what it is believed already to be. When finally backed into a corner the response then becomes only God knows or we are not able to understand, then stop insisting that you do.\n \n \nAlso, it is your arrogance which looks down on our absolute acceptance of what God has revealed to us because we did humble ourselves before Him as the sinners we admit we are. You just prove that your thinking is completely backwards on every level of spiritual rationale.\n \n \n What you perceive as arrogance is disbelief that Christians think God has revealed something to man that is so many inconsistent. That so many who have never read the bible, who never question the bible and who never bother to form an opinion of their own simply accept what they are told and then insist they are right. There is nothing humbling in the acceptance of God or at least no more so than acknowledging one's mistakes, accepting responsibility or that one does not have all the answers. Is your disagreement with my thinking what makes it backwards?\n \n \nChristian truth is universal since even non christian societies practice many of the same laws and values found in the bible. So it is confirmation of those truths and the source of them which come from Gods word and God has confirmed for us these truths by way of His Holy Spirit which dwells within each believer. It is He whom we fellowship with and through.\n\n \n Would those be truths that can be found existing before the bible and in societies that had know knowledge of God? Are those truths the same as they were 2, 3, 4 thousand years ago as being the word of God they should be? So again you accept what supports your belief without giving serious consideration to the accuracy.\n \n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;387862]And I never joined christianity from islam at 22 as if it was some club to sign up for. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and have followed Him ever since, not the church which sends out memos updating my beliefs each month as you infer.[QUOTE]\n \n Your inclusion in Islam I do not know if was by choice or not. Your departure was because there was something unfulfilled within you that Islam did not provide. There was a need for something that now has been found in Christianity that makes you in a sense complete or fulfilled or both. You were willing to leave one God, technically the same God,or maybe the teachings of the truth that was revealed to his followers is a better description. You made a switch in ideology, finding something more appealing to you. What do you think people would be willing to do to make sure that sense of fulfillment or purpose or security is not lost or changed?\n \n \nYou secularists and atheists must depersonalize the relationship we have with God through Christ and His Holy Spirit which indwells us. You must minimize and even ignore that fact that our relationship is as personal and intimate as any relationship you have with a flesh and blood person you know and love in your life. That is the relationship I have with my God and you MUST ignore or marginalize that fact so you can reject what we say and relegate it to a belief system rather than a life changing relationship.\n\n \n Then simply put, keep your very personal relationship to yourself and those who wish to participate in it with your consent. When you choose to make others a part of it then accept they may not have wanted to and don't enjoy the same benefits as you. When you forceably inject your belief, and yes make no mistake it is your belief that you consider true, into the daily lives of those who don't want it it is you who marginalize and discount. It is your arrogance that you know better. The secular part of this society is content to not interfere with your beliefs in exchange for you not interfering with theirs. Christians look to defend their perceived right to impose their version of God's will with the Bible. If you used the phone book for the same purpose then people would look for mistakes in the phone book to try and show that you do not have the rights claimed",

Since when?\n\n \n You must be very biased and ignorant if you think Christians mock atheism any more than atheists mock Christians.

It is simply disbelief, a refusal to grasp what is not demonstrably true.\n\n \n That's not the point. I'm not discussing wether or not there is a God. I'm discussing your double standards. You would definitely take a Christian insulting and mocking atheism (which I have yet to see on this forum) much more seriously than you would if it were vice versa.\n \n I do not count Christians trying to \"save\" you as an insult.

   "Assuming he lived in America when he converted my guess is he probably felt the need to do what everyone else is doing.\n\n \n I was born here so I felt no compunction to need to fit in with the natives as you suggest. I am a totally americanized arab of syrian/lebanese descent who was a partying pot smoker in the early 70s. I worked in a family business, owned a Volkswagen Bus, and either went to the beach each weekend or camped and hiked in the summer, ski'd in the winter and always had a hot girlfriend on my arm. The only thing that would keep me from leaving town on weekends for a road trip was a good keg party which I was invited to. Do you guys get it?\n \n I wasn't some lonely schmuck sitting in his house wringing his hands about his eternal condition and worrying about death. What happened to me as a result of that very sincere prayer I prayed at 15 years old when I asked God to reveal Himself to me IF HE EXISTS AT ALL, was that I who was popular, very active with a great social life, and the center of attention at every party I attended constantly felt alone and unfulfilled in the center of all of these friends who wanted to be around me. \n \n I wondered what it was that was missing in my life and how I could be surrounded by friends yet still feel so incredibly alone and unfulfilled. Add to that that every time I turned around some born again christian was approaching me out of the blue, even at these keg parties on weekends; cool people whom I liked, respected and sensed something good and fulfilled in, but you know how I reacted to their message of salvation? By no means as rudely as you atheists but my standard answer was that I was born a moslem and I will die a moslem. The idea of converting to another religion was reprehensible to me.\n \n But as I have said around a million times here, I didn't convert to another religion by becoming a born again believer, I accepted what Messiah did on the cross and became a new creature in Him as His Holy Spirit came to indwell me from that day forth. I no longer feel all alone in a crowded room of friends as I once did. I know who I am and why I exist. I carry that confidence and assurance of my eternal salvation with me in my life and like those believers who witnessed to me as that lost kid who wasn't seeking any religion or religious experiences at all, I too share Gods message of unconditional love with those whom the spirit moves me to share with. \n \n I know that it isn't I who saves souls but the word of God never comes back void and just as what those kids who approached me and shared Jesus said, led to my salvation, so will my words lead to the salvation of those who are sincere in their desire to know the eternal truths of the living God, if He truly exists, of course. Because it is God who will complete His good work in all of those who believe, AMEN... And that is the question for them just as it was for me at 15 when I groped out into the darkness of this world seeking God. And just as the bible promises, GOD FOUND ME based on my sincere desire to know Him if He existed at all, and according to that same promise, He revealed Himself to me. \n \n So please don't attempt to psycho-analyze me and make excuses for why I accepted Christ as my savior when you don't know me or have any clue as to who I am or what my history is as an american or a person of islamic descent who had no desire EVER to convert to christianity. Especially since you can't even imagine the concept of a personal salvation relationship with the living God. Who I am is the result of meeting my maker in a personal way. His Holy Spirit now indwells me as He has hundreds of millions, if not billions of other believers throughout history. I am not an aberration or an anomaly in this world even though I am now a citizen of heaven who is just visiting here.\n \n But atheists and secular humanists must attempt to marginalize us in order to minimize Gods impact on humanity. How better to reject God than to just focus on the christian in front of you as if he is the only one in existence as you mock him and his beliefs. Just remember that you play your dishonest games of semantics at your own peril. You will meet God one day, of that fact there is no question at all. All that remains to be seen is if you will meet Him in this incarnation as born again believers like me and receive the eternal redemption which only comes from the shed blood of Christ? Or if you will meet Him for the first time at the \"Judgement Seat of Christ\" where perfect sight kicks in and you condemn yourself as you can no longer lie to yourselves. Like it or not, those are the truths and your only options in life. It isn't I who condemns you or saves you, it is only God who can and will save you or judge you based on your free will choices. So choose well since you have one life, and then the judgement. \n \n Here is what we believers look forward to. What is it that you atheists are looking forward to? Annihilation of your soul as your body decomposes in a bed of dirt? Well let me inject some eternal truth into your reality.\n Rev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer {any} sea.\n Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.\n Rev 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,\n Rev 21:4 and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be {any} death; there will no longer be {any} mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.\"\n Rev 21:5 And He who sits on the throne said, \"Behold, I am making all things new.\" And He said, \"Write, for these words are faithful and true.\"\n Rev 21:6 Then He said to me, \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.\n Rev 21:7 \"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.\n Rev 21:8 \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\"\n Mock and scoff at these words if you like, but you are literally betting your very soul on the truths both I, and Gods word have spoken to you here. This passage summarizes what Gods goal has always been since the fall from grace by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The time is coming when God will end His outreach program for the salvation of Humanity and the harvest will occur. The question is, will you be the wheat or the chaff? \n \n How long will you rebel against the God who is telling you to be good and righteous and to live by a standard which you know is beyond what we are naturally capable of living by? And how can you feel justified in attacking such a Creator who if believed universally by all of humanity, His values would lead to a world of unity and peace for all? Be counted among the cowardly unbelievers if you like, but I would suggest that you truly consider that God considers those who don't believe to be cowards at all. Ask yourself why that is and why can't you see the courage it takes for we believers to abandon our free will as sinners to follow a God we cannot see or touch in this incarnation but who resides within us via His Holy Spirit.

God revealed Himself to me by way of His Holy Spirit as He does with everyone who sincerely seeks His truth, and then put the ball back in my court to either accept or reject the salvation He freely offers each of us in love who seek Him; I accepted. You choose to evade the real issues and deny the reality I am warning you to consider as you refuse to accept my very honest testimony above. You must justify your rebellion by rejecting my explanation of how it really is for humanity. You remain void of any understanding or acceptance of our spiritual nature which is why it's a waste of time reasoning with you until God removes the blinders from your eyes, if He chooses to, that is.

   "Oh yeah I know arch you're different or somehow special aren't you.\n\n \n ONCE AGAIN, No, you ignorant schmuck, that isn't what I said at all. Either you have no long term memory or you are just incapable of comprehending simple english. Either way, I can see I'm wasting my time on you. Here, reread my previous post and see that this response is idiotic.\n \n I was born here so I felt no compunction to need to fit in with the natives as you suggest. I am a totally americanized arab of syrian/lebanese descent who was a partying pot smoker in the early 70s. I worked in a family business, owned a Volkswagen Bus, and either went to the beach each weekend or camped and hiked in the summer, ski'd in the winter and always had a hot girlfriend on my arm. The only thing that would keep me from leaving town on weekends for a road trip was a good keg party which I was invited to. Do you guys get it?\n \n I wasn't some lonely schmuck sitting in his house wringing his hands about his eternal condition and worrying about death. What happened to me as a result of that very sincere prayer I prayed at 15 years old when I asked God to reveal Himself to me IF HE EXISTS AT ALL, was that I who was popular, very active with a great social life, and the center of attention at every party I attended constantly felt alone and unfulfilled in the center of all of these friends who wanted to be around me. \n \n I wondered what it was that was missing in my life and how I could be surrounded by friends yet still feel so incredibly alone and unfulfilled. Add to that that every time I turned around some born again christian was approaching me out of the blue, even at these keg parties on weekends; cool people whom I liked, respected and sensed something good and fulfilled in, but you know how I reacted to their message of salvation? By no means as rudely as you atheists but my standard answer was that I was born a moslem and I will die a moslem. The idea of converting to another religion was reprehensible to me.\n \n But as I have said around a million times here, I didn't convert to another religion by becoming a born again believer, I accepted what Messiah did on the cross and became a new creature in Him as His Holy Spirit came to indwell me from that day forth. I no longer feel all alone in a crowded room of friends as I once did. I know who I am and why I exist. I carry that confidence and assurance of my eternal salvation with me in my life and like those believers who witnessed to me as that lost kid who wasn't seeking any religion or religious experiences at all, I too share Gods message of unconditional love with those whom the spirit moves me to share with. \n \n I know that it isn't I who saves souls but the word of God never comes back void and just as what those kids who approached me and shared Jesus said, led to my salvation, so will my words lead to the salvation of those who are sincere in their desire to know the eternal truths of the living God, if He truly exists, of course. Because it is God who will complete His good work in all of those who believe, AMEN... And that is the question for them just as it was for me at 15 when I groped out into the darkness of this world seeking God. And just as the bible promises, GOD FOUND ME based on my sincere desire to know Him if He existed at all, and according to that same promise, He revealed Himself to me. \n \n So please don't attempt to psycho-analyze me and make excuses for why I accepted Christ as my savior when you don't know me or have any clue as to who I am or what my history is as an american or a person of islamic descent who had no desire EVER to convert to christianity. Especially since you can't even imagine the concept of a personal salvation relationship with the living God. Who I am is the result of meeting my maker in a personal way. His Holy Spirit now indwells me as He has hundreds of millions, if not billions of other believers throughout history. I am not an aberration or an anomaly in this world even though I am now a citizen of heaven who is just visiting here.\n \n But atheists and secular humanists must attempt to marginalize us in order to minimize Gods impact on humanity. How better to reject God than to just focus on the christian in front of you as if he is the only one in existence as you mock him and his beliefs. Just remember that you play your dishonest games of semantics at your own peril. You will meet God one day, of that fact there is no question at all. All that remains to be seen is if you will meet Him in this incarnation as born again believers like me and receive the eternal redemption which only comes from the shed blood of Christ? Or if you will meet Him for the first time at the \"Judgement Seat of Christ\" where perfect sight kicks in and you condemn yourself as you can no longer lie to yourselves. Like it or not, those are the truths and your only options in life. It isn't I who condemns you or saves you, it is only God who can and will save you or judge you based on your free will choices. So choose well since you have one life, and then the judgement. \n \n Here is what we believers look forward to. What is it that you atheists are looking forward to? Annihilation of your soul as your body decomposes in a bed of dirt? Well let me inject some eternal truth into your reality.\n Rev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer {any} sea.\n Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.\n Rev 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,\n Rev 21:4 and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be {any} death; there will no longer be {any} mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.\"\n Rev 21:5 And He who sits on the throne said, \"Behold, I am making all things new.\" And He said, \"Write, for these words are faithful and true.\"\n Rev 21:6 Then He said to me, \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.\n Rev 21:7 \"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.\n Rev 21:8 \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\"\n Mock and scoff at these words if you like, but you are literally betting your very soul on the truths both I, and Gods word have spoken to you here. This passage summarizes what Gods goal has always been since the fall from grace by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The time is coming when God will end His outreach program for the salvation of Humanity and the harvest will occur. The question is, will you be the wheat or the chaff? \n \n How long will you rebel against the God who is telling you to be good and righteous and to live by a standard which you know is beyond what we are naturally capable of living by? And how can you feel justified in attacking such a Creator who if believed universally by all of humanity, His values would lead to a world of unity and peace for all? Be counted among the cowardly unbelievers if you like, but I would suggest that you truly consider that God considers those who don't believe to be cowards at all. Ask yourself why that is and why can't you see the courage it takes for we believers to abandon our free will as sinners to follow a God we cannot see or touch in this incarnation but who resides within us via His Holy Spirit.

But ultimately it makes you look as foolish as they are. It's like watching Einstein debating a couple of deaf, ill-tempered three-year-olds. Again and again and again...\n \n Gets kinda boring.\n\n \n Here once again the very arrogant and pompous LA attempts to define us based on his anti-christian prejudice and bigotry. Which as a homosexual who claims we hold prejudice against him, but can't even see in his own bigotry toward us. But more importantly he attempts to define us as brainless boulders who haven't the intelligence to have a rational thought at all. And all because we hold to a spiritual awareness of our sinful nature according to the most widely read and distributed book in the history of the world. \n \n He is so daft he attempts to compartmentalize and marginalize what we believe, that he misses the fact that billions of human beings have lived for and died for Jesus Christ since He ascended on high with His promise to return, 2000 years ago. furthermore, he is so unoriginal in his intellectual simplicity that he believes that by simply attacking our intelligence and disregarding the gospel we hold to and share here, that he wins this debate since he is, in his mind intellectually superior to us. Thus, the total arrogance of the atheist elitist who feels superior as he admits he lacks any spiritual insight at all and reveals that he is only a shell of the human being his Creator intended him to be as he condemns our recognition of God as a personal Father.\n \n Yet in spite of this glaring shortcoming in his own character, he dares to judge my human condition as if my seeking redemption through Christ in a fallen world is some bad thing which makes me an enemy of humanity, personal intelligence and right thinking. Of course in any other venue, this glaring hypocrite will declare how tolerant he and his community is as they are oppressed by traditional moralists like christians. But when it comes to allowing anyone who disagrees with his unnatural lifestyle to exist and hold to their own opinions and beliefs, he comes out like the hate monger we know he is in his empty attempts to condemn us. \n \n But there is more people. LA, in his arrogance speaks like this of me here on 4forums just as the radical and liberal socialist left attacks Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck in each and every comment on the condition of public discourse they spew in America today. But look at the reputation and viewership Rush and Glenn enjoy as the number 1 & 2 voices in media today, Glenn Beck voted America's second most influential conservative; will Democrats really be happy? so the masses rush to hear their opinions on every issue which directs our futures as a society. \n \n Then let's look at our little world here @ 4forums and we see that I have received more visits to my private profile than posts I have written here. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel People peruse my posting history from other sites for arguments to take elsewhere and use in debates in other forums. Tell me LA, how much interest has been shown by anyone about you personally via your personal profile if you are such an intellectual magnet for your fellow members and outsiders who peruse these forums? How many PMs have you received by members who have written to compliment you on the depth and quality of your arguments over the past years? Especially since you have been a member here 3 years longer than me, if memory serves. \n \n So I have garnered 40 friends over time while you have none. I have garnered over 10,000 visits to my personal profile while you have just broken 100 by only 4 different members, me being one of them for this post. You haven't even had the limit of 10 members visit your profile. That speaks volumes as to how interesting or challenging your opinions are as they never go any deeper than lashing out at those you disagree with. So tell me LA, why would so many people flock to someone who doesn't have the intelligence of a boulder as they ignore your great intellect, enmasse? Can you make sense of that LA? Why do I provoke such a strong following while you sit in your dark corner of anonymity completely invisible to the masses who pass through the halls of 4forums if I am the simpleton? It seems to me that you have deluded yourself and think more of yourself than you ought to, and far less of me than you should, if you had any intelligence to speak of that is. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI was born here so I felt no compunction to need to fit in with the natives as you suggest.

I post it in refutation of your personal attack against me which is founded in your anti-christian hatred, bigotry and prejudice against every good thing I represent here. It seems that your constant cries for placing me on ignore has gone unheeded while it is you that people ignore. \n \n If you want to debate our moral values, feel free to post what you consider good and complimentary to our american way of life and I will respond accordingly.

   "Rubberneckers. People will drive miles to see a spectacular train wreck.\n\n \n That's how you explain my popularity? That 40 people have become my friends, and my profile is a popular source of information for members and guests alike because I'm a train wreck? And you actually expect to be taken seriously as a source of objective truth and commentary? Oh wait, I forgot, that ship has long since sailed and you know better than to ever expect to be taken seriously since you're nothing more than the token 400 pound joke in the room. \n \n \nHere once again the very arrogant and pompous LA attempts to define us based on his anti-christian prejudice and bigotry. Which as a homosexual who claims we hold prejudice against him, but can't even see in his own bigotry toward us. But more importantly he attempts to define us as brainless boulders who haven't the intelligence to have a rational thought at all. And all because we hold to a spiritual awareness of our sinful nature according to the most widely read and distributed book in the history of the world. \n \n He is so daft he attempts to compartmentalize and marginalize what we believe, that he misses the fact that billions of human beings have lived for and died for Jesus Christ since He ascended on high with His promise to return, 2000 years ago. furthermore, he is so unoriginal in his intellectual simplicity that he believes that by simply attacking our intelligence and disregarding the gospel we hold to and share here, that he wins this debate since he is, in his mind intellectually superior to us. Thus, the total arrogance of the atheist elitist who feels superior as he admits he lacks any spiritual insight at all and reveals that he is only a shell of the human being his Creator intended him to be as he condemns our recognition of God as a personal Father.\n \n Yet in spite of this glaring shortcoming in his own character, he dares to judge my human condition as if my seeking redemption through Christ in a fallen world is some bad thing which makes me an enemy of humanity, personal intelligence and right thinking. Of course in any other venue, this glaring hypocrite will declare how tolerant he and his community is as they are oppressed by traditional moralists like christians. But when it comes to allowing anyone who disagrees with his unnatural lifestyle to exist and hold to their own opinions and beliefs, he comes out like the hate monger we know he is in his empty attempts to condemn us. \n \n But there is more people. LA, in his arrogance speaks like this of me here on 4forums just as the radical and liberal socialist left attacks Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck in each and every comment on the condition of public discourse they spew in America today. But look at the reputation and viewership Rush and Glenn enjoy as the number 1 & 2 voices in media today, Glenn Beck voted America's second most influential conservative; will Democrats really be happy? so the masses rush to hear their opinions on every issue which directs our futures as a society. \n \n Then let's look at our little world here @ 4forums and we see that I have received more visits to my private profile than posts I have written here. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel People peruse my posting history from other sites for arguments to take elsewhere and use in debates in other forums. Tell me LA, how much interest has been shown by anyone about you personally via your personal profile if you are such an intellectual magnet for your fellow members and outsiders who peruse these forums? How many PMs have you received by members who have written to compliment you on the depth and quality of your arguments over the past years? Especially since you have been a member here 3 years longer than me, if memory serves. \n \n So I have garnered 40 friends over time while you have none. I have garnered over 10,000 visits to my personal profile while you have just broken 100 by only 4 different members, me being one of them for this post. You haven't even had the limit of 10 members visit your profile. That speaks volumes as to how interesting or challenging your opinions are as they never go any deeper than lashing out at those you disagree with. So tell me LA, why would so many people flock to someone who doesn't have the intelligence of a boulder as they ignore your great intellect, enmasse? Can you make sense of that LA? Why do I provoke such a strong following while you sit in your dark corner of anonymity completely invisible to the masses who pass through the halls of 4forums if I am the simpleton? It seems to me that you have deluded yourself and think more of yourself than you ought to, and far less of me than you should, if you had any intelligence to speak of that is. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n This quoted post is an excellent example of why members and visitors alike read my posts and contact me with compliments on the depth and clarity of my beliefs and opinions. I post it in refutation of your personal attack against me which is founded in your anti-christian hatred, bigotry and prejudice against every good thing I represent here. It seems that your constant cries for placing me on ignore has gone unheeded while it is you that people ignore. \n \n If you want to debate our moral values, feel free to post what you consider good and complimentary to our american way of life and I will respond accordingly. Oh, but wait, you neither read nor respond to my posts since you're an arrogant and pompous elitist. I forgot...  emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \nONCE AGAIN, No, you ignorant schmuck, that isn't what I said at all. Either you have no long term memory or you are just incapable of comprehending simple english. Either way, I can see I'm wasting my time on you. Here, reread my previous post and see that this response is idiotic.\n \n I was born here so I felt no compunction to need to fit in with the natives as you suggest. I am a totally americanized arab of syrian/lebanese descent who was a partying pot smoker in the early 70s. I worked in a family business, owned a Volkswagen Bus, and either went to the beach each weekend or camped and hiked in the summer, ski'd in the winter and always had a hot girlfriend on my arm. The only thing that would keep me from leaving town on weekends for a road trip was a good keg party which I was invited to. Do you guys get it?\n \n I wasn't some lonely schmuck sitting in his house wringing his hands about his eternal condition and worrying about death. What happened to me as a result of that very sincere prayer I prayed at 15 years old when I asked God to reveal Himself to me IF HE EXISTS AT ALL, was that I who was popular, very active with a great social life, and the center of attention at every party I attended constantly felt alone and unfulfilled in the center of all of these friends who wanted to be around me. \n \n I wondered what it was that was missing in my life and how I could be surrounded by friends yet still feel so incredibly alone and unfulfilled. Add to that that every time I turned around some born again christian was approaching me out of the blue, even at these keg parties on weekends; cool people whom I liked, respected and sensed something good and fulfilled in, but you know how I reacted to their message of salvation? By no means as rudely as you atheists but my standard answer was that I was born a moslem and I will die a moslem. The idea of converting to another religion was reprehensible to me.\n \n But as I have said around a million times here, I didn't convert to another religion by becoming a born again believer, I accepted what Messiah did on the cross and became a new creature in Him as His Holy Spirit came to indwell me from that day forth. I no longer feel all alone in a crowded room of friends as I once did. I know who I am and why I exist. I carry that confidence and assurance of my eternal salvation with me in my life and like those believers who witnessed to me as that lost kid who wasn't seeking any religion or religious experiences at all, I too share Gods message of unconditional love with those whom the spirit moves me to share with. \n \n I know that it isn't I who saves souls but the word of God never comes back void and just as what those kids who approached me and shared Jesus said, led to my salvation, so will my words lead to the salvation of those who are sincere in their desire to know the eternal truths of the living God, if He truly exists, of course. Because it is God who will complete His good work in all of those who believe, AMEN... And that is the question for them just as it was for me at 15 when I groped out into the darkness of this world seeking God. And just as the bible promises, GOD FOUND ME based on my sincere desire to know Him if He existed at all, and according to that same promise, He revealed Himself to me. \n \n So please don't attempt to psycho-analyze me and make excuses for why I accepted Christ as my savior when you don't know me or have any clue as to who I am or what my history is as an american or a person of islamic descent who had no desire EVER to convert to christianity. Especially since you can't even imagine the concept of a personal salvation relationship with the living God. Who I am is the result of meeting my maker in a personal way. His Holy Spirit now indwells me as He has hundreds of millions, if not billions of other believers throughout history. I am not an aberration or an anomaly in this world even though I am now a citizen of heaven who is just visiting here.\n \n But atheists and secular humanists must attempt to marginalize us in order to minimize Gods impact on humanity. How better to reject God than to just focus on the christian in front of you as if he is the only one in existence as you mock him and his beliefs. Just remember that you play your dishonest games of semantics at your own peril. You will meet God one day, of that fact there is no question at all. All that remains to be seen is if you will meet Him in this incarnation as born again believers like me and receive the eternal redemption which only comes from the shed blood of Christ? Or if you will meet Him for the first time at the \"Judgement Seat of Christ\" where perfect sight kicks in and you condemn yourself as you can no longer lie to yourselves. Like it or not, those are the truths and your only options in life. It isn't I who condemns you or saves you, it is only God who can and will save you or judge you based on your free will choices. So choose well since you have one life, and then the judgement. \n \n Here is what we believers look forward to. What is it that you atheists are looking forward to? Annihilation of your soul as your body decomposes in a bed of dirt? Well let me inject some eternal truth into your reality.\n Rev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer {any} sea.\n Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.\n Rev 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,\n Rev 21:4 and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be {any} death; there will no longer be {any} mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.\"\n Rev 21:5 And He who sits on the throne said, \"Behold, I am making all things new.\" And He said, \"Write, for these words are faithful and true.\"\n Rev 21:6 Then He said to me, \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.\n Rev 21:7 \"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.\n Rev 21:8 \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\"\n Mock and scoff at these words if you like, but you are literally betting your very soul on the truths both I, and Gods word have spoken to you here. This passage summarizes what Gods goal has always been since the fall from grace by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The time is coming when God will end His outreach program for the salvation of Humanity and the harvest will occur. The question is, will you be the wheat or the chaff? \n \n How long will you rebel against the God who is telling you to be good and righteous and to live by a standard which you know is beyond what we are naturally capable of living by? And how can you feel justified in attacking such a Creator who if believed universally by all of humanity, His values would lead to a world of unity and peace for all? Be counted among the cowardly unbelievers if you like, but I would suggest that you truly consider that God considers those who don't believe to be cowards at all. Ask yourself why that is and why can't you see the courage it takes for we believers to abandon our free will as sinners to follow a God we cannot see or touch in this incarnation but who resides within us via His Holy Spirit.

What will be such a shock to you and your ilk and a rude awakening is when you learn that you were the maximum fool in life as you rejected and mocked not only the God who sought to save your soul, but the very people He sent to share His truth with you. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n It's amazing how dense you are.\n \n You are a product of your environment period.\n \n Had you been born somewhere else you would be a member of whatever religion was popular there and badmouthing Christians as violent warmongers.\n \n If you had been born in an area where Muslim was the prevalent religion you would be talking about you life changing experience when Allah answered your payers.\n \n You are a fundamentalist Christian but had you lived in the Middle East you would have been a fundamentalist Muslim and fundamentalist are scary no mater who's side they are on.",

   "The more people ridicule them, the more rational facts that are posted that annihilate their fantasies, the more desperation comes out in their posts, the more they feel they have to post, the more they result to name-calling, the more they start posting to each other in the wee hours for validation (assuming they ARE more than one person... the alternative is REALLY scary). And the less anyone in their right mind would think, \"Gee, this guy really makes sense--they've converted me to their kind of Christianity!\"\n \n No one but a blatant nutcase is going to react to AA and ER's terminally bizarro posts in anything but the way a person would react to someone sitting on the bus next to them with a bullhorn and a placard reading \"JESUS SAVES.\" They've more than shot themselves in the foot--they've shot themselves in the groin, heart, and head (not so they'd notice). OVER and OVER AGAIN. But they keep on shooting, obliviously. Why?\n \n Because they're TOTAL LOONS. It's OBVIOUS from their every post! \n \n And responding to nutcases is a waste of bandwidth and man-hours. \n \n Look: THEY may be content to while their days away spouting religiosity-packed bullpucky on the day room computer, but there's no reason you have have to shovel chum into their whacko waters.\n \n Every time you do, you're sinking to their level, playing their game, falling prey to their weirdo pathological mindset. Don't you know?--they LIVE to have you respond to them! That gives them a target, an enemy they can call names and tell themselves that they warped caricature they call \"Jesus\" (no resemblence to anyone of the same name in the Bible) would approve. They'd rather do that than SLEEP, for pity's sake. They're on this board more than anyone else, because THIS is their reason for living. Can you conceive of a more pathetic existence??\n \n I suggest you do what I did long ago: PUT THEM ON IGNORE. You want to fight them? Refuse to feed their psychoses. If no one responds to them, they can't get their psycho-religioso rocks off. \n \n They're TROLLS, plain and simple.\n \n I know it's tempting to blast such easy targets out of the water, and in short run it can even be fun and fun to read--but in the long run it amounts to nothing shooting fish in a barrel, and ultimately there's no satisfaction in it. And there are better, more productive ways to spend your time, better discussions to be had, better fights to fight.\n \n These whacks willl never--and I mean NEVER--respond to your arguments, even if they understood them which they clearly don't want or WANT TO. they are impervious to what even a bright seven-year-old recognizes as logical argument. Which means they'll just keep coming back with the same ol' sheiss, and you'll keep running your head against a wall, which is what they get off on, because they are THAT SICK.\n \n So please. Just give it a rest.\n\n \n Here once again the very arrogant and pompous LA attempts to define us based on his anti-christian prejudice and bigotry. Which as a homosexual who claims we hold prejudice against him, but can't even see in his own bigotry toward us. But more importantly he attempts to define us as brainless boulders who haven't the intelligence to have a rational thought at all. And all because we hold to a spiritual awareness of our sinful nature according to the most widely read and distributed book in the history of the world. \n \n He is so daft he attempts to compartmentalize and marginalize what we believe, that he misses the fact that billions of human beings have lived for and died for Jesus Christ since He ascended on high with His promise to return, 2000 years ago. furthermore, he is so unoriginal in his intellectual simplicity that he believes that by simply attacking our intelligence and disregarding the gospel we hold to and share here, that he wins this debate since he is, in his mind intellectually superior to us. Thus, the total arrogance of the atheist elitist who feels superior as he admits he lacks any spiritual insight at all and reveals that he is only a shell of the human being his Creator intended him to be as he condemns our recognition of God as a personal Father.\n \n Yet in spite of this glaring shortcoming in his own character, he dares to judge my human condition as if my seeking redemption through Christ in a fallen world is some bad thing which makes me an enemy of humanity, personal intelligence and right thinking. Of course in any other venue, this glaring hypocrite will declare how tolerant he and his community is as they are oppressed by traditional moralists like christians. But when it comes to allowing anyone who disagrees with his unnatural lifestyle to exist and hold to their own opinions and beliefs, he comes out like the hate monger we know he is in his empty attempts to condemn us. \n \n But there is more people. LA, in his arrogance speaks like this of me here on 4forums just as the radical and liberal socialist left attacks Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck in each and every comment on the condition of public discourse they spew in America today. But look at the reputation and viewership Rush and Glenn enjoy as the number 1 & 2 voices in media today, Glenn Beck voted America's second most influential conservative; will Democrats really be happy? so the masses rush to hear their opinions on every issue which directs our futures as a society. \n \n Then let's look at our little world here @ 4forums and we see that I have received more visits to my private profile than posts I have written here. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel People peruse my posting history from other sites for arguments to take elsewhere and use in debates in other forums. Tell me LA, how much interest has been shown by anyone about you personally via your personal profile if you are such an intellectual magnet for your fellow members and outsiders who peruse these forums? How many PMs have you received by members who have written to compliment you on the depth and quality of your arguments over the past years? Especially since you have been a member here 3 years longer than me, if memory serves. \n \n So I have garnered 40 friends over time while you have none. I have garnered over 10,000 visits to my personal profile while you have just broken 100 by only 4 different members, me being one of them for this post. You haven't even had the limit of 10 members visit your profile. That speaks volumes as to how interesting or challenging your opinions are as they never go any deeper than lashing out at those you disagree with. So tell me LA, why would so many people flock to someone who doesn't have the intelligence of a boulder as they ignore your great intellect, enmasse? Can you make sense of that LA? Why do I provoke such a strong following while you sit in your dark corner of anonymity completely invisible to the masses who pass through the halls of 4forums if I am the simpleton? It seems to me that you have deluded yourself and think more of yourself than you ought to, and far less of me than you should, if you had any intelligence to speak of that is. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI was born here so I felt no compunction to need to fit in with the natives as you suggest. I am a totally americanized arab of syrian/lebanese descent who was a partying pot smoker in the early 70s. I worked in a family business, owned a Volkswagen Bus, and either went to the beach each weekend or camped and hiked in the summer, ski'd in the winter and always had a hot girlfriend on my arm. The only thing that would keep me from leaving town on weekends for a road trip was a good keg party which I was invited to. Do you guys get it?\n \n I wasn't some lonely schmuck sitting in his house wringing his hands about his eternal condition and worrying about death. What happened to me as a result of that very sincere prayer I prayed at 15 years old when I asked God to reveal Himself to me IF HE EXISTS AT ALL, was that I who was popular, very active with a great social life, and the center of attention at every party I attended constantly felt alone and unfulfilled in the center of all of these friends who wanted to be around me. \n \n I wondered what it was that was missing in my life and how I could be surrounded by friends yet still feel so incredibly alone and unfulfilled. Add to that that every time I turned around some born again christian was approaching me out of the blue, even at these keg parties on weekends; cool people whom I liked, respected and sensed something good and fulfilled in, but you know how I reacted to their message of salvation? By no means as rudely as you atheists but my standard answer was that I was born a moslem and I will die a moslem. The idea of converting to another religion was reprehensible to me.\n \n But as I have said around a million times here, I didn't convert to another religion by becoming a born again believer, I accepted what Messiah did on the cross and became a new creature in Him as His Holy Spirit came to indwell me from that day forth. I no longer feel all alone in a crowded room of friends as I once did. I know who I am and why I exist. I carry that confidence and assurance of my eternal salvation with me in my life and like those believers who witnessed to me as that lost kid who wasn't seeking any religion or religious experiences at all, I too share Gods message of unconditional love with those whom the spirit moves me to share with. \n \n I know that it isn't I who saves souls but the word of God never comes back void and just as what those kids who approached me and shared Jesus said, led to my salvation, so will my words lead to the salvation of those who are sincere in their desire to know the eternal truths of the living God, if He truly exists, of course. Because it is God who will complete His good work in all of those who believe, AMEN... And that is the question for them just as it was for me at 15 when I groped out into the darkness of this world seeking God. And just as the bible promises, GOD FOUND ME based on my sincere desire to know Him if He existed at all, and according to that same promise, He revealed Himself to me. \n \n So please don't attempt to psycho-analyze me and make excuses for why I accepted Christ as my savior when you don't know me or have any clue as to who I am or what my history is as an american or a person of islamic descent who had no desire EVER to convert to christianity. Especially since you can't even imagine the concept of a personal salvation relationship with the living God. Who I am is the result of meeting my maker in a personal way. His Holy Spirit now indwells me as He has hundreds of millions, if not billions of other believers throughout history. I am not an aberration or an anomaly in this world even though I am now a citizen of heaven who is just visiting here.\n \n But atheists and secular humanists must attempt to marginalize us in order to minimize Gods impact on humanity. How better to reject God than to just focus on the christian in front of you as if he is the only one in existence as you mock him and his beliefs. Just remember that you play your dishonest games of semantics at your own peril. You will meet God one day, of that fact there is no question at all. All that remains to be seen is if you will meet Him in this incarnation as born again believers like me and receive the eternal redemption which only comes from the shed blood of Christ? Or if you will meet Him for the first time at the \"Judgement Seat of Christ\" where perfect sight kicks in and you condemn yourself as you can no longer lie to yourselves. Like it or not, those are the truths and your only options in life. It isn't I who condemns you or saves you, it is only God who can and will save you or judge you based on your free will choices. So choose well since you have one life, and then the judgement. \n \n Here is what we believers look forward to. What is it that you atheists are looking forward to? Annihilation of your soul as your body decomposes in a bed of dirt? Well let me inject some eternal truth into your reality.\n Rev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer {any} sea.\n Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.\n Rev 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,\n Rev 21:4 and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be {any} death; there will no longer be {any} mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.\"\n Rev 21:5 And He who sits on the throne said, \"Behold, I am making all things new.\" And He said, \"Write, for these words are faithful and true.\"\n Rev 21:6 Then He said to me, \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.\n Rev 21:7 \"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.\n Rev 21:8 \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\"\n Mock and scoff at these words if you like, but you are literally betting your very soul on the truths both I, and Gods word have spoken to you here. This passage summarizes what Gods goal has always been since the fall from grace by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The time is coming when God will end His outreach program for the salvation of Humanity and the harvest will occur. The question is, will you be the wheat or the chaff? \n \n How long will you rebel against the God who is telling you to be good and righteous and to live by a standard which you know is beyond what we are naturally capable of living by? And how can you feel justified in attacking such a Creator who if believed universally by all of humanity, His values would lead to a world of unity and peace for all? Be counted among the cowardly unbelievers if you like, but I would suggest that you truly consider that God considers those who don't believe to be cowards at all. Ask yourself why that is and why can't you see the courage it takes for we believers to abandon our free will as sinners to follow a God we cannot see or touch in this incarnation but who resides within us via His Holy Spirit. Nuff said... :angel:\n\n \n This quoted post is an excellent example of why members and visitors alike read my posts and contact me with compliments on the depth and clarity of my beliefs and opinions. I post it in refutation of your personal attack against me which is founded in your anti-christian hatred, bigotry and prejudice against every good thing I represent here. It seems that your constant cries for placing me on ignore has gone unheeded while it is you that people ignore. \n \n If you want to debate our moral values, feel free to post what you consider good and complimentary to our american way of life and I will respond accordingly. Oh, but wait, you neither read nor respond to my posts since you're an arrogant and pompous elitist. I forgot...  emoticon_xgood",

If you happen to not share whatever version of Christianity is sitting in front of you they tend to still want to see you in the afterlife, but not the one they intend to go to. Most non-believers don't get the sense of joy that vindictive spite brings to Christians when thinking of a person being damned. \n \n Yes as a matter of fact they do indeed enjoy physical and mental benefits from worshiping. Ask a Christian what they get from their belief or why they believe and I promise you the response will not be they get nothing or just read Archangels posts.\n \n I truly hope you are not implying there are not large numbers of Christians who view non-believers with contempt, disdain, ridicule and/or belittle. Non-believers are exposed to a level of patronizing arrogance, and condescension in far greater instances the believers by non.\n \n I would agree with the last sentence as both sides are guilty \n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;388552]You have defined the truth of what we, or at least what I represent perfectly in this paragraph, COBHC, thank you for that.

No one, at least here, is forced they way it was a few hundred years ago, but there is still a large segment of the population that isn't given a choice.\n \n \nThe only reason these discussions get angry and confrontational is because the response we receive from the militant and hateful atheists is one of condemnation for our beliefs and direct attacks on our intelligence and motivation for simply daring to first believe, and then share our strongly held convictions and beliefs.

It's not like God has believers on a commission plan for every one they lead to Christ.\n\n \n If not for your own personal experience you might possibly have remained in Islam or dropped out of religion altogether so don't knock people for not having the same experience you had. There is a segment of Christianity that fully believes it is commanded by God to spread the word as well as a desire to artificially begin Armageddon and end times. Not the majority, but by no means fringe or insignificant. If they would remain your strongly held convictions then there would be less of need for non-believers to defend against those convictions that are yours, but feel compelled to make me live with.\n \n \nWe also understand that all we can do is share that good news, it is Gods Holy Spirit which draws the hungry and searching soul who is seeking real truth toward Himself and completes the salvation process.

It's also important to recognize that I have never suggested any denomination to join as I believe God will guide every believer according to His perfect will. Thanks again for getting it... emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xangel\n\n \n Here lies the big problem. Christians fail to recognize some really important concepts or they do but not as they apply to other people. The motivation, at least in part is the defense as well as promotion of your theology. It's the survival instinct that requires affirmation of the belief. This is done to preserve the meaning to life that is achieved to the believer only through God. Ask them there isn't anything more important and how far would one go to not have the most important thing taken away? The Christian will speak of their experience or how fulfilling their life is with God. They become angry at non-believers thinking they discount or disregard their reasons for their faith. How would a non-believer know? Is it not possible that non-believers have not had the same experience or find fulfillment in something other than God? Before you say it's not the same or think how yours is more rewarding, just as they cannot know for you, you cannot know for them.\n \n Christians have chosen to ignore or accept those portions of the religion that are inaccurate or just make no logical sense. Which is perfectly acceptable, but understand that not everybody is willing to do so. Also understand that religion is an unverifiable theory and that the actions of those representing that idea have created a problem with credibility for what is already an unbelievable series of events. Your truth is your truth and yours alone. If you wish to share do not get offended if some don't wish to accept your belief as their truth.\n \n You should be thankful that non-believers exist. There is no guarantee that your particular flavor of Christianity would be permitted in a theocracy. It wasn't those who were insistent that other believe as they do that allows you to worship the God of your belief and in the manner you see fit. History both past and present confirm this. \n \n Last thing the next time you feel like explaining to me how you are not arrogant, go read the post to Mr. Write LA. I don't think I have ever witnessed somebody so proud and full of themselves as they elevated themselves higher by stepping on the throat of someone else. That was indeed a very Christian example of humility. Have I mentioned that condescending attitude you also denied?",

   "You couldn't be more wrong in your reasoning or in your attempt to get Easy to compromise the full value and importance of the Resurrection as the completed process which the Crucifixion began. The resurrection is evidence that Jesus didn't just die for our sins on the Cross, but He literally defeated death which has held humanity in its clutches since the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden. We believers have received a spiritual resurrection from death to life at the moment we accepted Jesus as our savior. Thus the term BORN AGAIN applies to us since we have become new creatures in God through Christ Jesus, our Messiah.\n \n Now you will obviously come back and disregard everything I have said by just dismissing it as myth and legend, but I am personally attesting to you that I have experienced what the bible described must happen 2000 years ago through quotes of what Jesus taught and through what the Apostles recorded in the NT. So this isn't debatable at all, even though you will attempt to refute it with your secular humanist reasoning.\n\n \n No I am not going to disregard everything you say. I will restate what I said with a little more clarity though. I am not trying to discount the significance of the resurrection, it being the first or second event of greatest importance to Christians.\n \n Being born again is symbolic of choosing to accept Jesus and the new life that comes with that. I will apologize now, as I don't know how to say this without sounding insulting, which isn't my intention. At the end of the day one is still the man of flesh and everything that goes with it. BAC may conduct themselves as a completely different people and honestly live as a model Christian, but it isn't until, well, between now and when God decides that the promised rebirth happens. I recognize the value of of being born again, but I guess view it as practice for the future. That sounds worse than than I thought it would, but the concept I think is right.\n \n Comparing the resurrection to the crucifixion, it's hard to visualize one without the other as one must be dead in order to be raised, the purpose of Jesus was to give salvation. If Jesus had not been raised, there would be fewer who believe, but those who do would still receive salvation. If Jesus had not died or maybe accidentally or natural causes, the sacrifice having not been made even were he to rise there would be no salvation. I don't suggest the resurrection to be meaningless, but if one had to make a choice of one event not taking place it would have to be the resurrection. (not some slick way to have anybody say they would actually be ok with it not having happened)\n \n My whole point in all of this was to emphasize a problem within Christianity. That being the willfull act of ignoring errors and the cover up of those errors. I think in the long run nothing has hurt Christianity more than it's loss of credibility. I think you will agree it's a series of events that is easy not to believe. Now add as the source an organization that has a mediocre reputation and continues to insist against all logic that 2+2 = 9 and I hope you see where I am going with this. Sure some will jump all over the admission as well what else is wrong. But there will be those who will be asking Jesus that. \n \n God made some of us more skeptical than others, we serve a role making sure all of us don't own bridges in Brooklyn. I don't see God punishing us for that. Maybe were supposed to keep the bible from becoming one of those bridges. But time will tell.",

   "Any born again believer would know the answer to that. He denies Jesus, denies the Holy Spirit is a person, denies the Christian faith is legitimate, argues against every Christian except the far left loons and the unrepentant gays, and generally does the work of the devil in trying to lead people astray. And you're so lost you have to ask, \"How is he (Trebor) resisting the Holy Spirit?\" \n\n \n Oh the far left loons and unrepentant gays whoosh.... There ya go Easy.... man is there ANY time you don't bring up gay people or something gay at all???\n \n And as far as I see it he is asking questions of the faith. Sure he may be someone who denies the validity of the faith at the moment but people change. Just like Saul.\n \n And yet... you already brand him an outcast, someone not worthy of even having an opinion, and once again destroy any change the Holy Spirit has by working in his heart.\n \n Do you honestly think he is going to think seriously about faith when there are people like you constantly giving him evidence to think otherwise???\n \n \nHow dense can you possibly be? \n\n \n I'm not dense I'm just hoping he is seeking a methodical look into faith and perhaps if you don't keep running it into the ground he may actually see some validity of it....\n \n \nAstonishing.\n You told me to \"dry up\" before you edited your post. Nice touch Mr. Saint.",
