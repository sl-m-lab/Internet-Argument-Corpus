   "Can anyone tell me if this is a case of double talk or back talk or merely a typo?\n \nI have never been more horrified in my life. I cannot believe what I read today, your church completely freaks me out. I read the article written about boys and what they are not allowed to do and what to do to prevent them from becoming homosexual. This article should be banned, it is abusive, degrading, cruel, unloving and against everything that is right. I am a Christian and completely believe that men should be with women and vice versa. I believe that being with the opposite sex is against everything right by the Lord, but I also believe that the Lord is forgiving and loves us all no matter what we do. So, if other people want to do things in their own way, who are we, more so, who are you to judge them so harshly. I believe that the problem today is not people's sexual preferences or how they may act, but the fact that people like you make this world a judgmental place to live. You have no right to take over as God. I know what is written in the bible and I feel strongly that God is a loving God and He himself is most likely disgusted by your \"Geneva Convention\" like actions. You think you are doing right and no matter what I say, you will continue to practice your degrading beliefs, but I am sickened that my fellow brothers and sisters are exposed to your unloving and cruel beliefs.\n\n \n Notice the underlined part of the bolded part.
