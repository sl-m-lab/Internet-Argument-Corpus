Why!?emoticon_angry\n\n \n The simple answer is \"Those that fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.\"\n Roosevelt could not get an isolationist Congress to agree with his opinion that the US should enter WWII. His lack of aggressive defense amidst the warnings of impending Japanese hostilities was inexcusable. The tragedy at Pearl Harbor could have been minimized if Washington had taken more measures to safeguard American lives in vulnerable parts of the world. A six carrier fleet the size of Admiral Yammato's should have been spotted and watched. The memos warned of impending hostilities and should have been taken seriously. FDR failed as Commander-in-Chief because he willingly sacrificed Pearl in order to get the US public behind an unpopular war. \n \n \nThey didn't sacrifice themselves, they were sacrificed by the president, who'd rather kill thousands of americans than risk his popularity by declaring war directly.\n \n Trying to paint roosevelt as the victim here is seriously demented and just goes to show how easy it is to delude the public with a lie repeated often enough.\n\n \n FDR, in my opinion, was one of the worst presidents to ever occupy the Whitehouse. The combination of his personal ambition and socialist philosophy have left a legacy of destruction of the American Way of life since he first took office. :xcensored",

What is being called into question is how someone can present these documents as proof that the FDR administration was complicit in the attacks on 12/7/1941. They offer no evidence of such. \n \n\n I suggest that a little research into Richard Sorge's life might help you find that smoking gun. Or maybe this:\n \n\n 10 August 1941, the top British agent, code named \"Tricycle\", Dusko Popov, told the FBI of the planned attack on Pearl Harbor and that it would be soon. The FBI told him that his information was \"too precise, too complete to be believed. The questionnaire plus the other information you brought spell out in detail exactly where, when, how, and by whom we are to be attacked. If anything, it sounds like a trap.\" He also reported that a senior Japanese naval person had gone to Taranto to collect all secret data on the attack there and that it was of utmost importance to them. The info was given to Naval IQ.\n Early in the Fall, Kilsoo Haan, an agent for the Sino-Korean People's League, told Eric Severeid of CBS that the Korean underground in Korea and Japan had positive proof that the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor before Christmas. Among other things, one Korean had actually seen the plans. In late October, Haan finally convinced US Senator Guy Gillette that the Japanese were planning to attack in December or January. Gillette alerted the State Department, Army and Navy Intelligence and FDR personally. \n 24 September 1941, the \" bomb plot\" message in J-19 code from Japan Naval Intelligence to Japan' s consul general in Honolulu requesting grid of exact locations of ships pinpointed for the benefit of bombardiers and torpedo pilots was deciphered. There was no reason to know the EXACT location of ships in harbor, unless to attack them - it was a dead giveaway. Chief of War Plans Turner and Chief of Naval Operations Stark repeatedly kept it and warnings based on it prepared by Safford and others from being passed to Hawaii. The chief of Naval Intelligence Captain Kirk was replaced because he insisted on warning HI. It was lack of information like this that lead to the exoneration of the Hawaii commanders and the blaming of Washington for unpreparedness for the attack by the Army Board and Navy Court. At no time did the Japanese ever ask for a similar bomb plot for any other American military installation. Why the Roosevelt administration allowed flagrant Japanese spying on PH has never been explained, but they blocked 2 Congressional investigations in the fall of 1941 to allow it to continue. The bomb plots were addressed to \"Chief of 3rd Bureau, Naval General Staff\", marked Secret Intelligence message, and given special serial numbers, so their significance couldn't be missed. There were about 95 ships in port. The text was: \n \"Strictly secret.\n \n \"Henceforth, we would like to have you make reports concerning vessels\n along the following lines insofar as possible:\n \n \"1. The waters (of Pearl Harbor) are to be divided roughly into five\n subareas (We have no objections to your abbreviating as much as you\n like.)\n \n \"Area A. Waters between Ford Island and the Arsenal.\n \"Area B. Waters adjacent to the Island south and west of Ford Island.\n (This area is on the opposite side of the Island from Area A.)\n \"Area C.

   "The simple answer is \"Those that fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.\"\n Roosevelt could not get an isolationist Congress to agree with his opinion that the US should enter WWII. His lack of aggressive defense amidst the warnings of impending Japanese hostilities was inexcusable. The tragedy at Pearl Harbor could have been minimized if Washington had taken more measures to safeguard American lives in vulnerable parts of the world. A six carrier fleet the size of Admiral Yammato's should have been spotted and watched. The memos warned of impending hostilities and should have been taken seriously.

You of all people should realize that grasping at thin air produces nothing. Yes the attack on Pearl solidified a nation and unified her efforts to enter the war.\n \n But you cannot simply sit here and blame FDR simply because our nation was ill prepared for such a tactical and brilliant strategy on the part of the Japanese.

The US broke Japanes codes and intercepted dozens of messages between Yamamota and his fleet on its way to Hawaii in NOVEMBER. They were highly classified until relatively recently. \n \n\n Do Freedom of Information Act Files Prove FDR Had Foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor? \n March 11, 2002\n Robert B. Stinnett, Douglas Cirignano\n An Interview with Robert B. Stinnett by Douglas Cirignano\n \n On November 25, 1941 Japan's Admiral Yamamoto sent a radio message to the group of Japanese warships that would attack Pearl Harbor on December 7. Newly released naval records prove that from November 17 to 25 the United States Navy intercepted eighty-three messages that Yamamoto sent to his carriers. Part of the November 25 message read: \"...the task force, keeping its movements strictly secret and maintaining close guard against submarines and aircraft, shall advance into Hawaiian waters, and upon the very opening of hostilities shall attack the main force of the United States fleet in Hawaii and deal it a mortal blow...\"\n \n One might wonder if the theory that President Franklin Roosevelt had a foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack would have been alluded to in this summer's movie, Pearl Harbor. Since World War II many people have suspected that Washington knew the attack was coming. When Thomas Dewey was running for president against Roosevelt in 1944 he found out about America's ability to intercept Japan's radio messages, and thought this knowledge would enable him to defeat the popular FDR. In the fall of that year, Dewey planned a series of speeches charging FDR with foreknowledge of the attack. Ultimately, General George Marshall, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, persuaded Dewey not to make the speeches. Japan's naval leaders did not realize America had cracked their codes, and Dewey's speeches could have sacrificed America's code-breaking advantage. So, Dewey said nothing, and in November FDR was elected president for the fourth time.\n \n Now, though, according to Robert Stinnett, author of Simon & Schuster's Day Of Deceit, we have the proof. Stinnett's book is dedicated to Congressman John Moss, the author of America's Freedom of Information Act. According to Stinnett, the answers to the mysteries of Pearl Harbor can be found in the extraordinary number of documents he was able to attain through Freedom of Information Act requests. Cable after cable of decryptions, scores of military messages that America was intercepting, clearly showed that Japanese ships were preparing for war and heading straight for Hawaii. Stinnett, an author, journalist, and World War II veteran, spent sixteen years delving into the National Archives. He poured over more than 200,000 documents, and conducted dozens of interviews. This meticulous research led Stinnet to a firmly held conclusion: FDR knew.\n \"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars,\" was Roosevelt's famous campaign statement of 1940. He wasn't being ingenuous. FDR's military and State Department leaders were agreeing that a victorious Nazi Germany would threaten the national security of the United States. In White House meetings the strong feeling was that America needed a call to action. This is not what the public wanted, though. Eighty to ninety percent of the American people wanted nothing to do with Europe's war. So, according to Stinnett, Roosevelt provoked Japan to attack us, let it happen at Pearl Harbor, and thus galvanized the country to war. Many who came into contact with Roosevelt during that time hinted that FDR wasn't being forthright about his intentions in Europe. After the attack, on the Sunday evening of December 7, 1941, Roosevelt had a brief meeting in the White House with Edward R. Murrow, the famed journalist, and William Donovan, the founder of the Office of Strategic Services. Later Donovan told an assistant that he believed FDR welcomed the attack and didn't seem surprised. The only thing Roosevelt seemed to care about, Donovan felt, was if the public would now support a declaration of war. According to Day Of Deceit, in October 1940 FDR adopted a specific strategy to incite Japan to commit an overt act of war. Part of the strategy was to move America's Pacific fleet out of California and anchor it in Pearl Harbor. Admiral James Richardson, the commander of the Pacific fleet, strongly opposed keeping the ships in harm's way in Hawaii. He expressed this to Roosevelt, and so the President relieved him of his command. Later Richardson quoted Roosevelt as saying: \"Sooner or later the Japanese will commit an overt act against the United States and the nation will be willing to enter the war.\"\n \n To those who believe that government conspiracies can't possibly happen, Day Of Deceit could prove to them otherwise. Stinnett's well-documented book makes a convincing case that the highest officials of the government-including the highest official-fooled and deceived millions of Americans about one of the most important days in the history of the country. It now has to be considered one of the most definitive-if not the definitive-book on the subject. Gore Vidal has said, \"...Robert Stinnet has come up with most of the smoking guns. Day Of Deceit shows that the famous 'surprise' attack was no surprise to our war-minded rulers...\" And John Toland, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the Pearl Harbor book, Infamy, said, \"Step by step, Stinnett goes through the prelude to war, using new documents to reveal the terrible secrets that have never been disclosed to the public. It is disturbing that eleven presidents, including those I admired, kept the truth from the public until Stinnett's Freedom of Information Act requests finally persuaded the Navy to release the evidence.\"\n \n Do Freedom of Information Act Files Prove FDR Had Foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor?: Newsroom: The Independent Institute \n",

A radio communication between the top two Japanese commanders of the strike force (who both maintain that the fleet observed strict radio silence) which gives specific information as to what they are going to do and where they are going to do it, all while knowing full well that any radio communication could be direction finded back to their position enabling the US to intercept the fleet before they even get in striking distance? Even if you are trying to say that the US ignored or burried information in order to allow the attack to progress as a \"surprise attack\", how do argue that the Japanese must be lying about their radio silence? Are they to be considered knowing co-conspirators with the FDR administration?",

   "So a memo from the East Asian ONI director to the US ONI director and a naval historian are evidence of FDR's policy? And furthermore, what exactly is wrong with a policy against pre-emptive action, and how does this policy make the situation more volatile? \n \n \n My point JP is that if this guy was able to include the actual reports in his book, then it would stand to reason that they would be freely available in other sources. I have seen no evidence of them, which makes them nothing more than hearsay in my book. \n \n \n A site called \"whatreallyhappened.com\" that talks about a \"secret station H\" that is mentioned nowhere else I can find, except on this site? And at the bottom of the page, what book does he site as a great source? \n \n What about reports from the Japanese who were part of the strike force, the after action reports, and the official Naval Historical Record of Japan which all clearly state that not only was strict radio silence observed, but steps were even taken to disable radios? That's the general problem with conspiracy theories and why they are often viewed with such contempt. They ignore glaring contradictory evidence while supporting there own revisionist conclusions with flimsy, often single sourced information of questionable origin. \n \n \n Think about this...does it really make sense to you? A radio communication between the top two Japanese commanders of the strike force (who both maintain that the fleet observed strict radio silence) which gives specific information as to what they are going to do and where they are going to do it, all while knowing full well that any radio communication could be direction finded back to their position enabling the US to intercept the fleet before they even get in striking distance? Even if you are trying to say that the US ignored or burried information in order to allow the attack to progress as a \"surprise attack\", how do argue that the Japanese must be lying about their radio silence? Are they to be considered knowing co-conspirators with the FDR administration?\n\n \n It's not often that I have to admit that I may have erred, but in this instance, I may have. Every time I tried to find original documents to verify statements made, I hit brick walls or as in the case of the cryptographers, they paint a different story. For instance, the cryptographer that supposedly intercepted pre-Pearl chatter stated in a memorial ceremony years later that he was sorry that they hadn't been able to uncover anything pre-Pearl.\n I also found several references that stated that the radios in the fleet were physically disabled so that they were inoperable during the transit.\n \n I will try to find the book, Day of Deceit in the library over the holiday, but I'm not holding out much hope of it actually being indisputable proof.",
