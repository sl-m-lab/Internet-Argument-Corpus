There certainly is not a consensus in society now about whether or not the unborn is a person.\n \n \nYour example is coercive since it enforces your will upon me and the conventions say you have not this right. The case of choice in abortion is NOT coercive since no force is employed against a person by those who choose abortion and likewise by those who choose to have a child.\nBut if the assumption is that the fetus is a person then wouldn't this be you forcing your will onto another person?\n \n \nThe convention says that I am person have the right to defend myself and make my own decisions. You wish to violtate that convention by your attack. I am a person note, not a non-person. Conventionally for the first two trimesters a fetus is NOT a person and does not have the rights of a person. I also do not understand what convention you are talking about. If it is the law then this argument is terrible as slavery was once a law and I'd have a hard time believing you'd defend that one as it is convention.\n \n The situations are not parallel within our existing social construct.\nWhat convention? I know of no such convention. Furthermore, for someone who says they shouldn't impose beliefs you certainly are imposing one that says the fetus is not a person. If one believes the fetus is a person then wouldn't they want the same rights for that person? And wouldn't it be ok to impose a belief in that case? You are imposing a belief in your statement anyway. You say I should go with these \"conventions\" which are nothing more than your beliefs.\n \n The parallel is there. I can't go around claiming you are not a person and therefore I can hurt you. Why? Because a belief system is imposed on me and I have live with that.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "As I see it, there are a few issues that have to be addressed in detail here:\n \n 1. Why should we limit when people make important life-critical decisions for others?\n My own answer is that I would not like others to make decisions for me since the decisions they make may not coincide with my desires and would cause me to suffer. It is a matter of personal freedom and desire to control the most critical aspects of my own life. Without freedom, I would personally suffer. My moral approach is reciprocal, so I would expect others to have the same freedoms.\n \n 2. When is it permissible for others to make life-critical decisions for someone and why?\n If I were unable to make the decision for myself, someone capable and well-intentioned would have to make the decision for me. This situation applies to childhood, when a trusted adult (usually the parent) makes the life-critical decision since the child lacks the knowledge or reasoning ability to make the decision for him/herself. Freedom is automatically given up, but it is assumed that the decision maker is both capable and trustworthy (making the decision based on what they would think is best for the child). This is also true for someone who is incapacitated - in a coma, or unable to communicate, etc. However, once again, the freedom of making one's own decision is given up but there is an assumption that the decisionmaker is trustworthy and capable.\n \n 3. What are the consequences of a bad decision imposed on another?\n I would say that the chief consequence is suffering. The consequences of a bad decision could cause physical suffering or death when that physical suffering or death is not desired. It could also cause psychological suffering, where a decision made for someone to, say, amputate a leg or have brain surgery could leave the person disabled and limited for the rest of their life. \n \n 4. How is this relevant to late stage fetuses?\n The assumption is that, sometime around the third trimester, fetuses start gaining mental abilities to suffer, feel emotion, pain, fear, etc. It may not know the concepts of life, suffering, etc. but it can still suffer, may have an instinctual will to live, etc. One can feel empathy toward that late stage fetus.\n \n 5. Is this relevant to early stage fetuses?\n With early stage fetuses, there is no suffering, no sense of pain, no desire to live, no desire for freedom of decision, no mental existence whatsoever. The relevant consequences that would apply to adults or children that would have a bad decision made for them do not apply for those early stage fetuses/embryos. The only real consequence is one of potential - in that the early fetus could grow up into someone who does feel a will to live, can suffer, etc. However, that is not yet real - it lies in the future. The only negative is the taking away of that potential.",

   "That you are not concerned indicates the depth of your consideration of the issue. That is the easy way to lose your freedoms, by not knowing what has happened elsewhere and elsewhen.\n\n \n You are correct. I have considered this issue very deeply, which is why I know that abortion has only been legal because 7 men in 1973 decided it was a good idea, and 5 people in 1992 decided that it was still a good idea.\n \n The interesting thing is that very same institution gave us the Dred Scott decision as well as the Lochner decision, so it does not good to say that the Supreme Court only does good things. In fact, historically, it is quite clear that the United States democratic process (by which I mean legislative process) has been the most consistent avenue of righting injustices.\n \n \nNope but they have had laws frocing sterilizations of women and men, and they have had laws enforcing slavery and segregation and disenfranchisement! If you trust them you put your freedoms at risk.\n\n \n Freedoms are established by majorities, and they are also regulated by majorities. That is how government works in the United States--the people get to govern themselves. Sometimes they do bad things, but most of the time they do good things.

The major cause of the civil war was slavery and the movement was not \"suffering is bad\"...it was \"these are people and as such have rights\". Those rights happen to include not getting whipped but the abolitionists were not just concerned with those that suffered in this manner. Ones that were treated well were still included. Reading an abolitionist book or text would reveal they cherished people as people and were not just against whipping or what have you.\n \n\n Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but the assumptions I claim were made by 19th century supporters of Slavery were indeed largely disprovable (appart from the ones that came from a distorted Christian faith).

Perhaps I missed something since I don't know what you are referring to.\nAgain this is irrelevant when looking at the common belief at the time. But as a fact, your \"science\" even felt that blacks were subhuman and in general they were considered subhuman just by definition alone. This is similar to how you define \"person\" today and define it so that the fetus is left out. \n \n \nWhat one defines as the minimum definition of \"person\" is arbitrary:\n - I (and presumably chemist99a) define person as human with some level of mind\n - You define a person as a living entity with a complete set of human DNA that has started the growth process (which are the main characteristics of a zygote)\n - Someone else might define a person as an unfertilized egg or a sperm cell which, after all, are human, alive, and have the potential to become one of us - they simply lack the second set of DNA to get the process started.\n \n Your definition is as arbitrary as anyone elses. \nAnd one could define it as only people who's skin is white.

Of course one can push their beliefs on you because they feel you are violating another just like if I arbitrary claimed you weren't a person then society can push its beliefs on me and force me not to hurt you. \n \n I really don't understand how one could defend the argument \"don't push your beliefs on me\" with abortion yet deny the argument was false for slavery. It is the same argument with the same backing and reasoning behind it.\n \n \nLastly, I do not think that chemist99a chose to define the convention of who gets rights by randomly choosing it. I am sure that he had reasons behind choosing that convention. If you think that the convention he presents is arbitrary and that yours is not, then why don't the two of you compare the rational arguements behind the chosen convention and then debate those rational arguements instead of continuing an essentially silly arguement about a definition of \"person\". If, by the word \"person\", you both mean a human with rights, then doesn't it make sense to address the question of the reasons behind having rights?\nThe whole point of this argument is to show that the argument \"don't push your beliefs on me\" is an idiotic one and lends itself to comparison with slavery. \n \n The rest of what you want to talk about is going to have to responded to in another topic of PM because I've told you once I'm sticking with this one argument for now.",

   "Again, the key is that they were people. empathy and suffering are all irrelevant if people is not part of the equation. The major cause of the civil war was slavery and the movement was not \"suffering is bad\"...it was \"these are people and as such have rights\". Those rights happen to include not getting whipped but the abolitionists were not just concerned with those that suffered in this manner. Ones that were treated well were still included. Reading an abolitionist book or text would reveal they cherished people as people and were not just against whipping or what have you.\n\n If no slave ever wanted to be freed and all prefered to stay in their current situation, I highly doubt that the abolitionist movement would have taken shape. The great majority of slaves were unhappy with their lot and would have prefered another one. Indeed, many faced the risk of torturous punishment or death in order to escape. These stories were a major draw of support for the abolitionist movement. Yes, it was people who were suffering (as opposed to horses or sheep) but it was people who were suffering. Both aspects were important. Now, one could imagine future scenarios of sentient robots or human/animal hybrids - neither of which fit into either of our definitions of people - but who many would argue also deserve rights. The important question in all of this is why we assign rights to begin with. It is through that question that we can best approach the issue of when to begin assigning rights.\n \nAgain this is irrelevant when looking at the common belief at the time. But as a fact, your \"science\" even felt that blacks were subhuman and in general they were considered subhuman just by definition alone. This is similar to how you define \"person\" today and define it so that the fetus is left out.\n\n The \"science\" of the time was as shoddy as some of the ID \"science\" is now. In other words, the conclusions were made first and the evidence was selectively chosen to fit those conclusions. I don't claim that science has always been objective. Science is conducted by humans who are fallible. Science is much more objective on social issues today, though not yet ideally so, than it was in the 19th century. As for our definition of person, as we are saying, the term \"person\" has no fixed societal definition, which is why it has some arbitrariness to it. The definition that we choose is that the being needs to be a human and to have some mental existence. We then use science to determine when that point starts and science tells us that it can start around the beginning of the third trimester. Do you dispute that scientific finding (of the potential beginning of mental existence)?\n \nAnd one could define it as only people who's skin is white. This was what was done during this time period. Now, when you do this and someone says \"don't push your beliefs on me\", doesn't this present a bad argument? Of course one can push their beliefs on you because they feel you are violating another just like if I arbitrary claimed you weren't a person then society can push its beliefs on me and force me not to hurt you. \n\n That is why we should not deal with arbitrary definitions of person but should deal with reasons behind who gets certain rights, and we should be ready to fully defend those reasons with demonstratable evidence. The people who supported slavery made no great efforts at demonstrating evidence to support their reasons for slavery - they just made unsupported assumptions. If you claimed I wasn't a person (in the sense that I was not deserving of rights), then you would have to present excellent, well supported reasons for why I would not be deserving of certain rights. If your reasons were valid (for ex., if I were a child or mentally incapacitated), then your reasons would win out and my freedoms would be limited. If your reasons were bogus, then you would have no justification in imposing your views on me in trying to take my rights away. Who decides what types of beings get what types of rights? Ultimately, society decides. However, if one wants to keep society from imposing unfair practices (as with slavery), then the structure of who gets which rights has to be fully debated based on supportable reasons.\n \nI really don't understand how one could defend the argument \"don't push your beliefs on me\" with abortion yet deny the argument was false for slavery. It is the same argument with the same backing and reasoning behind it. \n \n The whole point of this argument is to show that the argument \"don't push your beliefs on me\" is an idiotic one and lends itself to comparison with slavery. \n\n Society often pushes its beliefs on people in the form of laws, but those laws have to be based on rational reasons. Otherwise, as with slavery, the society can become very unfair in its treatment of others. You have presented no rational reasons as to why a pre-mentally existing fetus should have rights - no reasons behind those rights, no mention of negative consequences if the fetus does not get rights, nothing. You just claim that it should because of the proclamation that \"zygote = person\" and that \"person = someone with rights\" - proclamations unsupported by reasoned arguement. \n \n The bottom line is that society has every right to push its views on people if those views are based on rational reasons. In allowing the institution of slavery, it pushed its views on African Americans but those views were not based on rational reasons but on bogus reasons that were easily disproven if given the chance. US law does not allow people to murder others (born people) since it acknowledges the rights of born people, where empathy is a large driving force in such laws. US law allows for abortion (at least up to viability) since nobody (including you) has presented any rational reasons why an early fetus should have rights - especially when those rights interfere with the rights of an acknowledged person with rights.\n \n Lastly, how would you like it if someone came around claiming that unfertilized eggs are people and should therefore have rights and that you are acting like a slaveholder in refusing them rights.",

A person is a human being with at least some level of mind / mental existence. African Americans certainly fit that definition.\n \n But that is just a definition of the word. If the word \"person\" remained just a word without any consequences, then it wouldn't matter how we personally define it. The significance of that definition is that the term \"person\" in this thread seems to attach to it the assumption of having rights. Therefore, it is not the word itself that is important but the thought process behind why certain beings have rights and others dont. That is the importance behind the convention of calling someone a \"person\" from the point of rights. My main point is that the convention has to be based on reasoned arguement. Otherwise, arbitrary unfair laws can be imposed. We would view laws against early term abortions as being unfair (since we think your assigment of rights to newly fertilized eggs is unsupportable) just as you would view laws as being unfair that would force women to constantly get pregnant to support an unfertilized eggs right to life (since you would think an assignment of rights to an unfertilized egg as being unsupportable).\n \n\n I'd disagree with them.\n \n But again, you missed the entire point of my argument and continue to try and substitute something else in its place.

If you deny that, then would you sit back and accept those laws being pushed on you? I doubt it. Presumably, you think the concept of an unfertilized egg being thought of as a person and having a forced right to life is absurd and would fight against any laws that would be introduced as a consequence of that.

   "Again, this is monday morning quarterbacking...you just can't do that when looking at an argument.\n\n Of course we have every right to judge the past, why shouldn't we have that right? (Assuming that is what you mean by Monday morning quarterbacking). The only reason I commented on the scientific views of that century where race was concerned was because you had compared 19th century science to current science as if they were the same. I was demonstrating how they were different. Do you have any particular arguements against my claims or do you deny me the right to even make any judgements, even though you had made judgements?\n \nIt appears you missed what my argument was. The argument was that logic an reason alone do no good in the situation of determining what a person is. The slave holders made assumptions and now you make assumptions. Either way they are worthless. So when one says \"ohhhh, well my assumptions are right so therefore you can't push your belief of what a person is on me\" then I laugh because the slave holders felt their assumptions were right to.\n\n Somehow we need to say when rights start. Do you think this should be chosen arbitrarily? If not, then when should it be chosen to start? You say conception but what do you base those views on? For example, why not at an unfertilized egg or at the start of mental existence? I could just as easily claim that your restriction of rights to fertilized eggs (as opposed to unfertilized ones) is the same type of arguement as slaveholders used since you take it upon yourself to define personhood and rights. \n \nIt appears you are strawmanning this one.\n\n I am only throwing your arguements back at you. It is not a strawman since I am not distorting your views. I am presenting a parrallel view to prove a point. Namely, your arguements sound to us just like the sample hypothetical arguements I presented would sound to you. The structure of the arguements is identical. \n \nHow dare you try to push your belief on what a person is to me! Only blacks are people in my view. I'm going to go enslave some whites now. \n \n What is wrong with that sarcastic remark I just typed? Well, you can push beliefs on me and not just because my position is irrational. It is only irrational to you much like your view is irrational to me. Again, you can't claim rational logic is needed to \"push a view\" when the entire idea is based on belief anyway (ie no rational logic).\n\n If you can present a view of rights that is fully supportable, where the great majority of people would agree with that reasoning, then you could indeed impose your views on others since those views would be supportable. For example, it is a supportable arguement that children should have fewer rights than adults. Certainly, children, particularly teenagers, think that such a view is being forced on them, but nearly all people would agree that such a rule is just since there are good reasons behind the rule.\n \n You have yet to explain your detailed reasons as to why zygotes should have rights. Until you explain your reasons, it is just as arbitrary as saying that an unfertilized egg should have rights.\n \nThere is a difference between saying \"don't push your beliefs on me\" and \"you are wrong\". You can push your beliefs but that doesn't make your beliefs right.\n\n Wait a minute. I thought that your arguement was against people saying \"Don't push your beliefs on me\". If people supported the rights of unfertilized eggs enough to force a ban on contraception and to force pregnancy, would you not think and argue that they were trying to force their views on you? How is that different than pro-choice supporters claiming that pro-life people are trying to force their views on us in banning early abortion for those women who want abortions?",

We may like to have the right to drive 100 miles per hour on the roads, but society imposes speed limit rules for a reason so we grudgingly accept it.

As such, I don't believe \"conventions\" are a good form of evaluation as they have obviously been proven wrong and the ones today could just as easily be proven wrong.\n\n As long as you do not blame the scientific method for justifying slavery, then I will let your comments stand. The scientific method was not practiced objectively during that time and it was mainly due to that lack of objectivity - i.e. bias - that science supported racism. As for conventions, I agree that conventions need to be re-evaluated whenever new arguements or evidence comes in. I don't think any of us believe that they should be fixed in stone. If there are sound rational supportable reasons to change a convention, then it should be changed. I assume chemist99a agrees with me there.\n \nLegally speaking you can make a law for whatever reason you want. As a matter of principal I think you can never say you have no right to push beliefs on others (into law) as you certainly should be able to push what is right into law. \n\n But the structure of our legislative process was meant for these laws to be based on reasoned debate by competent legeslators. I admit that this process has degraded in recent years and may never have been perfect, but that is how the founders apparently intended for it to function. If we accept the idea of laws being based not on rational discourse but on gut reaction, then what prevents us once again from enslaving minority groups? After all, if the white power movement ever would gain a large majority, then that is not impossible. \n \nEither way, if I believe the fetus is a person then you would be pushing beliefs onto that person and violating your own standard oddly.\n\n We allow parents to push their authority onto teenagers despite their approval because society has presented fully debated reasons to do so. Those rules are mainly for the good of the teenagers but also for the ease of the parents and society that do not want to have to deal with the extreme unruly behavior that completely free teenagers could practice. \n \n Nearly all of us agree that how we treet an unfertilized egg is irrelevant because nobody has presented reasons why unfertilized eggs should have rights that are based on any idea that a majority might agree with. So, most of us feel that it is premissible to destroy unfertilized eggs with contraception. A small percentage of people may disagree, but they have not won the rational debate and have not made much of an attempt at winning a rational debate.\n \n The situation with an early term fetus is similar. Almost two thirds of Americans do not think that first trimester fetuses should have rights, and would allow abortion in that case. The pro-life supporters have not successfully made a reasoned case as to why first trimester fetuses should have rights.\n \n Taking away rights is only bad if there are bad consequences that can be pointed to. The consequences of taking away the rights of unfertilized eggs are that a life form that could have become a full person has been killed. That life form was so early in its human development stage and needed the far-from-probable development of fertilization, as well as all the growth steps in order to get to a full person. So, the great majority of people don't particularly care what happens to that life form.\n \n The consequences of taking away the rights of first trimester fetuses is that a life form that could have become a full person has been killed. This life form is far closer to its final - mutually accepted person with rights - stage so it is more important to people than an unfertilized egg was. For most pro-choice supporters, this importance is outweighed by the importance of the rights of a woman to her own body. For pro-life supporters, that potential is more important, plus there seems to be the proclamation of \"all human life is precious\", which pro-choice supporters do not fully agree with. So, the case has not been proven to pro-choice supporters that the negative consequences of early term abortion outweigh the negative consequences of a woman having her rights to her body taken away - so the judgement is for the woman.\n \nI believe all are derived from ethical and moral principals and by definition have to be. But if someone is to disagree with the law then obviously the belief is pushed onto him.\n\n Do you believe that ethical and moral principals have to be based on reasoned arguement or can they be based on unsupported proclamations?\n \nYou can't even provide me with a non-arbitrary definition of person. How on each can you get a rational argument from that?\n\n As I said before, the word \"person\" itself is not important. What is important is the fact that we attach rights to that term. So, the question we are actually addressing is \"who gets rights and why?\". As I have mentioned in an earlier post, a major reason for me in why we attach rights is because of the suffering or negative consequences in a human's experience which lack of rights can introduce. The consequences of a zygote being aborted are no worse than that of a newly fertilized egg being aborted. Its experience is no better or no worse.\n \nLook at this argument of defining person: \"Only those with black skin are people\".\n \n Why is this argument wrong? The only way it could be wrong is if there is some objective definition of person that refutes this. You would certainly say \"well you need a rational reason for that definition\"...but how is a definition irrational to begin with? It just is what it is. Short of begging the question you can't claim that to be wrong unless another standard (a true one) exists. \n\n As I mentioned, the word \"person\" itself is not imporant. What is important is who we assign rights to and why. Then, in answer to the statement \"Only those with black skin get rights\", I would contest that in demanding reasons for only black skinned people getting rights. You would have to support those reasons. Ultimately, the majority decides, but that majority has to answer all the challenges presented by the minority. They cannot just end it at \"because we say so\". \n \nYour assumption on what the first amendment means is wrong and any look at history would show this. I'd have a hard time believing that the framers said you have to exclude any religious thought from your mind when deciding laws. In other words, people of faith are disallowed from being members of government.\n\n There is a difference between being inspired by religion and making a law based on religious beliefs. For example, one cannot take away the rights of homosexuals only on the basis of quotes from the Bible. Similarly, I am certainly glad that certain extremist Islamic beliefs would also be blocked by such separation of religion from government. For example, our system of government would be meant to exclude any imposition of head scarves on the female population of the US based on quotes from the Koran. Would you think it permissible if, in several decades, the majority of the US ended up being from the Islamic religion and tried to impose Islamic law on all of us through majority rule in congress?\n \nBecause in the argument I am presenting now I never claimed the fetus should get rights. I merely said you can't say \"don't force your beliefs on me\".\n \n You inadvertently did something which I feel many folks do in the course of a debate. You added an argument never presented and choose to refute that argument instead of the one addressed. As such you presented a strawman argument.\n\n You presented the arguement that our view was like the view of slaveholders. It is perfectly legitimate for me to then compare your view, in a similar way, to a hypothetical view. \n \n Also, my main point to all of these posts here is that we need to incorporate reasoned debate into decisions of who has rights and who doesn't. That is not a side issue but is core to the very idea of when people can impose their views on others and when they cannot.\n \n The bottom line is that groups can indeed impose their views on us if those views have been fully debated based on rational supportable reasons. My main claim, and I think chemist99a might agree, is that it is views imposed on us without that fully supported rational debate which are views that we resent being imposed on us. I am sure that you would resent a hypothetical extremist US Muslim majority imposing aspects of Islamic law on you. Supported reasoned debate is the best method for getting laws which are as fair as possible.",

The pro-life supporters have not successfully made a reasoned case as to why first trimester fetuses should have rights.\nFirst off, who cares what 2/3rds of Americans think? 2/3rds of Americans can and have been wrong...on a very similar issue no less. Secondly, I see no more reasoned argument than \"the unborn is a person and people have rights and therefore abortion should be illegal\".

If I believe the fetus is a person then it is perfectly reasonable for me to fight for that persons rights. This would be the same as a slave owner believing the slave is not a person but an anti-slavery supporter feeling it is and thus fighting for the rights of the slave. There is no rational argument for defining person...it just is what it is.\n \n With option 2 you find it irrelevant whether or not it is a person. If this is the case then you can violate your own statement because if it is a person you have pushed beliefs onto that person and in this case endangers their life.\n \n The third option is that we go with the so called \"convention\". This is a bad argument because the convention in the 1800s was that blacks were sub-human and as such have no rights and are property. Your logic would have to conclude here that the slave owners and supporters of slavery were correct in arguing that others shouldn't impose their belief system on them.

   "You are claiming it would violate the core of the constitution and yet I am the one lost? Aside from the obvious point that separation of church and state is not in the constitution and Jefferson is not the supreme reference to the constitution, I'd say the \"core\" of the constitution is setting up a system of government that is functional. The fact that the 1st amendment is an amendment shows this wasn't even part of the \"core\" document.

   "and there is only one correct way to interpret a legal document. It happens to be the same way you interpret anything. \n\n Well then, it is clear from the Constitution (First ammendment) that no law can be introduced based purely on religious arguements since that is imposing religion on the population. Also, other ammendments support a right to privacy.... Those are the only correct ways of interpreting the Constitution.:) \n \n Of course, you think otherwise. When the Constitution is not 100% clear on an issue, interpretation needs to take place. That is why Supreme Court justices are not just clerks but well educated and well experienced justices.\n \nI have a problem with people doing something that is wrong but I don't argue that you can't impose your will. You take the good with the bad in a democracy.\n\n But, if you require no reasons to be presented for a law, you will have a lot more bad than you would otherwise. Indeed, there would be nothing stopping a super-majority from re-imposing slavery. Is that the type of political culture which you really think is right? Not me. I think we need to stress a political culture of reasoned debate. That is the only way to prevent extremist ideas from coming into practice through law.\n \nChemist never claimed this for one. And I deny you need a reasoned debate anyway.....I don't even know what a reasoned debate is to you. It seems when legislatures make laws they always have a debate then they vote. \n\n Ideally, they should actually be debating every issue and those debates should be able to convince independent minded senators of the path to take on a particular issue. In reality nowadays, it seems that most congressmen come into a debate with predetermined conclusions and rarely is a congressman's mind changed by a debate - the debate seems to recently be more of a formality than anything else. I have heard (partly through Al Gore's book but also elsewhere) that this used to be much less so. Apparently, congressmen are rarely seen actually debating nowadays since they are out so often campaining or searching for funding sources for their campaigns (at least according to Al Gore's book). Indeed, CSPAN is not allowed to move the cameras to the senate or house floor itself and has to stay on the speaker - probably to avoid showing the embarrassing truth that so few congressmen actually stick around for debates. Debates seem to happen more often in the news in order to convince the public with sound bites. \n \nI'm lost on this...are you asking if reason plays a part in determining if something should be allowed to be pushed on another? If so, then reason is not a requirement to do so. I'd prefer that someone pushed the right thing rather than a faulty reasoned wrong thing.\n\n But how can you find what the \"right\" thing is if you don't engage in reasoned debate? If the reasoning is faulty, then presumably the opposition would point that out. \n \nThat doesn't make them any less of a proclamation. Reasons are debated but they don't have to be anything more than 'this is right'.\n\n Saying \"this is right\" without supporting that is not giving a reason - just another proclamation. Sometimes no reasons are given behind a particular proclamation since few people object to it. For example, few people would object that murder of born people is wrong, so a law against murder is not contested. However, there are many proclamations that people do object to and which need to be discussed by reasoned debate - ex. Homosexuality is immoral, Zygotes should have rights, Minorities should get automatic preferential treatment in academic admittance because of their race, illegal immigrants who pay their taxes should get amnesty, etc. (I have tried to include contentious proclamations on both sides in this list). \n \nOnly if there is a standard by which they had to live up to. If they had debated and had to justify it in a Christian world view then they would have lost. If they had to justify it to society norms then they would have won. They did the latter.\n\n They made many false claims about the inherent inferiority of blacks in order to justify their views on slavery. They would have failed if they were taken to task to prove those views about the inferiority of blacks. As for the Christian world view, ironically, many Southerners did apparently quote the Bible in passages that were interpreted as supporting the dominance of the white race over the black race. Then, it would have been a battle of interpretation of Scripture, which would have gone around in circles.\n \nThis is only true if there is an objective standard of who gets rights outside of what people create.\n\n Even the Southerners did not argue that it was because of the skin color alone that the rights were taken away. They argued that the race of that skin color was inferior in many ways and it was that inferiority that justified slavery. Most people have SOME grasp of logic. \n \nThey are no more supported than what the slaveholders had. You claim person means X and the slaveholders said person means Y. Both are just random claims that can't be justified but are the basis for your position. This is not true if you can show (or just claim) an outside standard that is true though.\n\n I claim that rights are limited to X, slaveholders claim that rights are limited to Y and you claim that rights are limited to Z (fertilized as opposed to unfertilized eggs). We each make claims about who gets rights. We on the pro-choice side are at least willing to present, debate and defend our arguements about why only X get rights. Slaveholders have made some arguements behind their proclamation but they were unwilling to hold them to debate - probably because they knew they would lose the debate. You don't seem to even be willing to present your arguements behind your proclamations.\n \nThere is no evidence that would satisfy you as your have predefined person to exclude the fetus. At that point who wouldn't be for abortion. With slaveholders their definition excluded blacks and they had reasons which are just as wrong as yours. \n\n I include the late term fetus because mental existence is critical to the reasons I see for people having rights to begin with. If you could prove that fetuses can experience mental existence much earlier, then I would have to change my timeframe for when I would keep abortion fully legal. You claim that zygotes have souls (a supernatural form of mental existence). If that were shown to be true, then I would have to change my stance. So far, there is no evidence for that whatsoever - it is just a guess. I do not base my view on guesses but on evidence. \n \n Also, we all have made choices about who we think deserve rights - YOU INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just because a choice is made doesn't make it wrong. If you claim that the fact that we make a choice about who gets rights makes us just as guilty as slaveholders, then you are ALSO just as guilty as slaveholders because YOU ALSO MAKE THAT CHOICE!!!\n \nI'm not using the argument \"don't impose your beliefs on me\" nor am I claiming a difference between human and person. You can claim what you wish though.\n\n I am also not presenting an arguement \"don't impose your beliefs on me\". As I am repeating over and over and over and over (and you just don't seem to get), I am presenting an arguement \"don't impose your UNSUPPORTED beliefs on me\" (unsupported being unsupported by rational debate). \n \n Furthermore, once again, you also are limiting who you claim is a person (i.e. someone with rights) by saying that unfertilized eggs don't have rights.",

Namely, if one considers that mental existence is important to the existence of rights, then third trimester fetuses (especially late in that term) could well have mental existence and, therefore, be as deserving of rights as a newborn baby. Yes, the fetus is imposing itself on the woman but the woman had at least five to six months to decide to get an abortion before that mental existence (and rights) kicked in. If she did not want to accept the responsibility over that mentally existing person, she should have aborted earlier. That is my view, anyway, and I think it is well defensible.",

It is a word that different people attach to different levels of human development because the criteria that people place for \"person\" is different for different viewpoints (just like you place the criteria that the human egg needs to be fertilized). The IMPORTANCE to that word is that we attach consequecnes to that term - such as rights. If no consequences were attached to that word, then why would that word be significant? You could call a mouse a person and nobody would care. We care because that word carries consequences - rights being the most important of these. It then makes sense to me to address the issue that IS important (i.e. rights and the detailed criteria of who gets them) as opposed to the six letter word \"person\".

Different people use empathy to different degrees, but, according to psychologists, the great majority of people have the capacity for empathy. Indeed, even most pro-life arguements appeal to that sense of empathy when talking about \"innocent\" unborn children...

And then there is the concept of Limbo which I think is being tossed out by the church.\n\n The Church did indeed historically vary on its stance on abortion. For most of its history, ensoulment was thought to happen at \"quickening\", not at conception. It was only in the 19th century that abortion started being considered murder from conception on. A good web site which summarizes the history (with supporting references) is:\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm\n So, religious reasoning and Scriptural interpretation varied during Church history - even though they were talking about the same text, the Bible.\n \n As for the general subject of views being imposed on a populace: I think, in general, the great majority of people have SOME level of logic in discussing reasons behind their views. Even the worst dictators and murderers had some justification in mind when they committed their heinous acts - though in nearly all cases, it would have been hard for them to support their reasons with evidence. I think that is what would limit the extent of brutal behavior in people and nations, were full rational supportable debate allowed - the desire of most people to justify their behavior with logical reasons. Logical reasons depend on one's assumptions. Religious reasoning is ultimately based on faith (which is essentially traditional guesses) and is not supportable with empirical evidence, as Scientific reasoning is. Therefore, despite many good influences that have come from religion, religious reasoning has also been a major cause of various brutal conclusions and actions. Scientific and secular reasoning, on the other hand, could potentially have stopped many of the brutal treatments of the past by proving to the Southerners that blacks are indeed not automatically inferior because of their race, by proving to Hitler that it was only a small subset of Jews that were responsible for Germany's loss during World War I (and other accusations he held against the Jews) not all of them, by provint to the Aztecs and Mayans that human sacrifice plays no role whatsoever in the movement of the sun, etc. Scientific and secular reasoning may not guarantee a world that we would all be happy with, but it would have eliminated many of the injustices that this world has historically experienced.\n \n As for the question of when rights start: Yes, one cannot prove what a person is by science, but one can include a list of important criteria for why creatures get rights, argue why those criteria are important, and then use science to support claims as to when some of those criteria arise.",

It soon became apparent that the country was approaching zero population growth, which carried alarming implications for future labor supplies for further industrialization. The government responded in 1966 with a decree that prohibited abortion on demand and introduced other pronatalist policies to increase birthrates. The decree stipulated that abortion would be allowed only when pregnancy endangered the life of a woman or was the result of rape or incest, or if the child was likely to have a congenital disease or deformity. Also an abortion could be performed if the woman was over forty-five years of age or had given birth to at least four children who remained under her care. Any abortion performed for any other reason became a criminal offense, and the penal code was revised to provide penalties for those who sought or performed illegal abortions.\n\n \n \nThe Ceausescu regime took more aggressive steps in the 1980s. By 1983 the birthrate had fallen to 14.3 per 1,000, the rate of annual increase in population had dipped to 3.7 per 1,000, and the number of abortions (421,386) again exceeded the number of live births (321,489). Ceausescu complained that only some 9 percent of the abortions performed had the necessary medical justification. In 1984 the legal age for marriage was lowered to fifteen years for women, and additional taxes were levied on childless individuals over twenty-five years of age. Monthly gynecological examinations for all women of childbearing age were instituted, even for pubescent girls, to identify pregnancies in the earliest stages and to monitor pregnant women to ensure that their pregnancies came to term. Miscarriages were to be investigated and illegal abortions prosecuted, resulting in prison terms of one year for the women concerned and up to five years for doctors and other medical personnel performing the procedure. Doctors and nurses involved in gynecology came under increasing pressure, especially after 1985, when \"demographic command units\" were set up to ensure that all women were gynecologically examined at their place of work. These units not only monitored pregnancies and ensured deliveries but also investigated childless women and couples, asked detailed questions about their sex lives and the general health of their reproductive systems, and recommended treatment for infertility.\n \n Furthermore, by 1985 a woman had to have had five children, with all five still under her care, or be more than forty-five years old to qualify for an abortion. Even when an abortion was legally justified, after 1985 a party representative had to be present to authorize and supervise the procedure.\n",

If you want to argue definitions, then \"a person\" is also a definition of \"a human\". When you hear the term human rights invoked, it generally shows up with presentations of suffering of people who are denied their rights. The bottom line is \"why do people have rights to begin with\" and, there, since the arguements for rights that I have heard have all appealed directly or indirectly to empathy and a sense of reciprocity (ex. How would YOU like it if YOU were treated that way), then zygotes don't need rights, just as unfertilized eggs don't need rights.\n \nI never said it did.\n\n When someone claims that something is a fundamental right, then the word \"fundamental\" implies truth in an absolute sense. Am I misinterpreting you or are you accepting that this fundamental right is just a view of you and many others, not an absolute truth?\n \nI'm not here to give a lesson on what words mean but the context in which was given clearly indicates what that means. In any event the point was only to show that my line of thinking is not exactly out there.\n\n I know that your line of thinking is not out there, since the pro-life side has quite a large minority behind it. You yourself once said that the main difference between an egg and a zygote is that the zygote has a soul (which I would state is a supernatural form of mental existence). If that were proven to be true, then many pro-choice supporters would also be swayed since many, such as myself, are swayed by arguements of empathy (which is a main reason why I would limit third trimester abortions). The trouble is that there is no evidence for human souls - they are just religious statements that appeal to certain emotion needs (they appeal to me for emotional reasons). Even the history of Christianity shows that there was no clearly defined point of ensoulment - it varied throughout history. I suspect that empathy also plays a role in your determination of human rights, then, given that you think a soul exists in that zygote.\n \nHow does observation make something true? In fact, it seems observation has a pretty crappy track record. \n\n It has a very good record where observation under properly practiced scientific method is concerned. Scientific conclusions may be fairly shaky when they first come out, and many early conclusions turn out to be wrong, but theories that stand the test of time have had quite a good record.\n \nno, I believe we have empathy. I just don't see how that really matters to human rights. I have empathy for my cat but I don't think she deserves rights.\n\n However, you would hate to see someone torture her. Enough pet owners feel similar empathy to their animals that animal cruelty laws have been introduced to prevent that. Unfortunately, there are also many animals that few people care about, so they get no protection (ex. rats). Also, I am not saying that empathy is the only criteria - just that it is the main emotion appealed to when arguing for certain human rights.\n \nPerhaps it is not a main motivation for rights but rather a means to ensure rights remain among others? In other words the emotion is not for creating rights but preserving them.\n\n The arguement for the elimination of slavery appealed greatly to the emotion of empathy. The book \"Uncle Tom's cabin\" presented a good man that was treated badly under slavery - a character who people could sympathize with. This drew in a lot of supportors of abolition. The arguement against slavery, in the legal sense, may have been an arguement about the definition of person with rights, but the underlying force which drove it was an emotional /moral arguement appealing to empathy.\n \nHow do you argue using empathy for someone that has no empathy for something? If I believe white people are property then I have no empathy for them. How would you use empathy to convince me they have rights?\n\n I would try to use logic to convince you that they are just the same as you are, since you are probable thinking about them as OTHER. Most historical attrocities and discriminatory thinking that I can think of, offhand, have been done because people generalized negative attributes to those Others. Slaveholders viewed blacks as inferior humans who could not take care of themselves. Hitler thought that Jews were destroying good aspects of civilization and that all needed to be destroyed (he didn't take into account that only some Jews, not all, were responsible for some of the things that he accused all Jews for).",

If I feel they are no more important than my cat then how could I have empathy? \n \n There are only two answers here: 1) There is something built it to us that lets us know who is worthy of human rights or 2) You first convince someone that they are worthy of human rights. \n\n If someone is trying to convince you that all the members of their group should be treated differently than all the members of another group, then they would have to show a few things:\n 1) How are the groups inherently different, supporting that with evidence\n 2) How is this difference relevant to rights, supporting that with debatable reasons\n 3) Show that ALL the member of the other group have that difference and NONE of your members have that difference.\n \n People who believed in slavery would not be able to present the needed arguements. \n \nNo, the difference is I realize that one can't reason everything and must have a basic belief system to work from. It is without this belief system that one uses oneself to establish proclamations that benefit them and leads to things like slavery. \n\n It is interesting to note that many slaveholders quoted certain passages of the Bible in order to support slavery. As long as a belief system remains unquestioned, it is possible for it to be arbitrarily cruel.\n \nThe reasons you provide are only circular in nature or unexplained. For example, why is it that empathy leads to rights for humans but not for fish? Or perhaps a better one would be why is empathy for an unborn less of an argument than empathy for a born?\n\n One cannot have empathy for a being with no mental existence. Therefore, I do not empathize with an early fetus as I can with a late fetus. One sometimes empathizes with living entities with no mental existence but then what one is really doing is anthropomorphizing (attaching a personality where there is none). I do it myself occasionally. It is all in the imagination. However, though one can conduct one's own life that way if one wishes, it is irrational to impose laws on others due to arguements out of the imagination.\n \n As for animals, I admit that I am not being entirely fair to them in their treatment. Part of it is that they are the Other, where I have a clear bias for our species. If we were to give animals the same rights as humans, then we would die off as a species. Also, the reciprocal moral relationship does not hold. They will not follow moral rules. A tiger would eat me without a second thought. A deer will eat from my garden with no concern about property. They cannot control their behavior, so therefore they would not get the same rights. Anyway, those are just a few arguements as to why animals do not get the same rights that we do. I do, however, support laws against animal cruelty and would extend that as widely as possible.",

I'd note that my responses are directed towards here and I'd hope you wouldn't respond changing the frame of the debate but rather only respond to my responses to you. Otherwise it will get ugly and confusing.\n\n I would say that the subject of this debate is \"Why is mental existence a condition for the existence of rights\". I would agree to holding a debate that restricts itself to this general topic. This topic will, of course, get into the subject of why rights exist to begin with. From that point of view, the debate will naturally tend toward a two-way debate, not just a one way debate. In other words, I would feel uncomfortable with a debate where you are the only one who gets to challenge. I will answer your challenges but I would expect to also pose my own challenges about why rights exist to begin with. If you do not wish to answer my own related challenges, then I will probably hold this debate for a while but will stop if I find myself too constrained by one-sided rules.\n \nI'd ask that you first state why you should get rights. If you use anything involving empathy then I feel obligated to warn you that you will have come full circle and will be using circular reasoning to make a conclusion.\n\n Rights are a social construct delegated by the societies that allocate them. They exist to begin with because the negative consequences associated with not having rights led underprivileged groups to demand their rights. They came about historically because some groups (Monarchy, Aristocracy, etc.) were treated by law in a far better manner than other groups (Merchant class, peasants, etc.) where the reasons given for the preferred treatment (ex. a claim of divine right) was not accepted by many people and was unsupportable. The people suffered under the reduced rights and were not given reasonable reasons for that. The rights typically came about because of comparison with the rights of privileged classes in arguments that basically came down to \"Why should THEY get to have these rights, and we don't\". These questions were being asked more often to begin with because of the influence of Enlightment thought, where it was thought that reason could explain everything in the world. Sometimes, this push for rights led to the classes with fewer rights gaining rights. Sometimes, it led to privileged classes losing rights (ex. losing the privilege not to pay taxes). Either way, it was the negative consequences of not having rights (suffering - either mental or physical) that drove those with fewer rights to demand and win rights. Privileged classes usually had a wide range of reasons why they thought they should maintain their privileges but they used their political power to avoid being held accountable for those reasons. Therefore, things did not change until the people were fed up enough to use their own power of numbers in revolutions (17th Century English Revolution, 18th Century US and French Revolutions, etc.) and either open or assumed threat of revolution to force their rights to be accepted. Ultimately, the ideal became that all people should be viewed equally under the law. Again, this historical change was driven by the people who suffered under unequal rights. \n \n In practice, even in what is considered the ideal, rights are not perfectly equal but can be taken away for reasons. For example, children and severely mentally incapacitated adults have little control over their behavior and have very limited powers of reasoning. Therefore, their freedoms (ex. of movement, of major decisions) are restricted and few contest those restrictions (except for teenagers). Others, such as criminals, get rights taken away as a consequence to their actions. Sometimes rights are restricted because they interfere with the rights of others (ex. you don't have the right to take other people's property).\n \n So, I would say that rights exist to begin with because of the negative consequence of not having rights (mental and/or physical suffering) and rights are unequal when there are debatable accepted reasons for those rights not to be equal (children, mentally incapacitated adults, criminals, etc.). Since rights exist to begin with because of the mental and/or physical suffering caused by not having rights, when rights are denied a particular group, then it is an appeal to the suffering of that group and the sense of \"Why are they excluded from rights you take for granted\" that is the common response. Part of this is an appeal to empathy and part is an appeal for fairness (equal rights unless you present a reason why they should not be equal). At least these are the appeals that have been used in debates on rights up to now. \n \nIsn't \"mental existence\" being a factor just an unsupported proclamation?\n\n Without mental existence, most rights are irrelevant (ex. right to property, rights to act in certain ways, etc.). If one talks about rights of a non-mentally existing being to life, then the question arises - what are the negative consequences of destroying that life? For a mentally existing being, mental and physical suffering could result. For a non-mentally existing being but one that could become a mentally-existing being, the consequences are the curtailing of the potential to grow into more. That is true both for early fetuses and for unfertilized eggs, just to different degrees since one is much farther along the process than the other. Since the traditional appeal to empathy for suffering does not work in this case, then one would need to appeal to the importance of the negative consequence of losing potential in comparison to the negative consequences of a woman being forced against her will to carry that fetus (which IS a traditional appeal to empathy). One would also have to explain where one would place the limit of the potential argument (early fetus vs unfertilized egg) and why. This is a very different arguement than has been used for gaining rights in the past and has shown itself to be a hard sell in situations where reasoned argument prevails, as opposed to religious or other proclamations. \n \n Do you believe marriage is a right by the way?\n\n Marriage is a social construct. I wouldn't say that there is a \"right\" to marriage but if you grant it to one group of people then you have to have good reasons for not granting it to another. \n \nThis too is an unsupported proclamation. An ant can feel pain but are you feeling empathy towards it?\n\n Any being that can suffer, feel pain, emotion, have experiences, etc. is a being that can be empathized with. It is harder to empathize with lower animals because we might well be attaching emotions and feelings to it that it is not capable of having. That is probably true for the ant. I can try to guess what it is feeling based on its actions but, without close consultation with scientists who have analyzed its neural network, I would probably be wrong in my guess. It is much easier with people (at least the normal range of people) since we ourselves have had similar experiences to those we would empathize with - we would be much more likely to be accurate in our estimations of what they are experiencing and feeling.\n \n I would be open to discussing potential animal rights but would prefer if it were moved to another thread, since it would be too much of a tangent to this thread. There are many potentially related points we could address, but we have to keep in mind how much those points make us digress from the main point. You yourself have used this argument before, so I will use it here. Lets stick to the human species.\n \nAnd again unsupported by anything. I will state that I don't find anything wrong with proclamations but you have stated you do and there have been at least 3 in this post alone.\n\n It is UNSUPPORTED proclamations I am against. It is the support (reasons) behind the proclamations which are important. Which proclamations have I made which I have not tried to support with reasons?",

This is more a side thing so we can drop it...I was just wondering if you thought it was a right. Is equality a right?\n \n \n\n Any being that can suffer, feel pain, emotion, have experiences, etc. is a being that can be empathized with. It is harder to empathize with lower animals because we might well be attaching emotions and feelings to it that it is not capable of having. That is probably true for the ant. I can try to guess what it is feeling based on its actions but, without close consultation with scientists who have analyzed its neural network, I would probably be wrong in my guess. It is much easier with people (at least the normal range of people) since we ourselves have had similar experiences to those we would empathize with - we would be much more likely to be accurate in our estimations of what they are experiencing and feeling.\n \n I would be open to discussing potential animal rights but would prefer if it were moved to another thread, since it would be too much of a tangent to this thread. There are many potentially related points we could address, but we have to keep in mind how much those points make us digress from the main point. You yourself have used this argument before, so I will use it here. Lets stick to the human species.\nIt certainly is not a tangent. If you can't explain to me why empathy for one \"group\" is not as important than empathy for another group then you have violated your test that you gave me. It still is a proclamation anyway and if you want to stick with the human species then I suppose you admit then that the unborn is a member of the human species. This gets me back to the idea that one should never discriminate against any human and to do so would be just as bad as the slaveholders.\n \n \nIt is UNSUPPORTED proclamations I am against. It is the support (reasons) behind the proclamations which are important. Which proclamations have I made which I have not tried to support with reasons?\nYour reasons are basically that you believe in empathy and mental existence. Either way, it comes down to beliefs and any belief is by itself an unsupported proclamation which can only be supported by faith.",

   "So we are back to what is a person...\n\n No. How did you come to that conclusion from the section that you quoted?\n \n I hope we aren't confusing legal and philosophical rights here. \n\n What are you calling \"philosophical rights\"? Ideally, rights one derives from philosophical / rational arguements should be equal to legal rights. I though we were discussing what we thought actual (ultimately legal) rights SHOULD be and why. What do you think we are discussing?\n \nI disagree that those with handicaps have natural rights restricted. I also disagree that there ever was a \"right to take others property\".\n\n I didn't say those with handicaps have limited rights. People with paralized legs have just as many rights as anyone else. They just have limited mobiility that they try to get around with wheelchairs and ramps. I was talking about people with such limited mental capability (due to birth defects or brain damage) that, for example, they do not realize that it is dangerous to walk full speed into heavy traffic, or walk off a bridge to try to catch the pretty butterfly. They may want to go running after that butterfly but you restrict their rights for their own good by restricting their freedom of movement. \n \n Also, rights are what people define them to be. There is freedom of speech because the founders realized that this was necessary in order to be able to have a functioning Democracy.\n \nNone of this answered my question about why you should get rights. Again, if you use empathy then we have done circular reasoning. I can show you how if you like.\n\n I used the historical reasons why rights were introduced to begin with, and those had a lot to do with people wanting to avoid the suffering caused by limited rights and the sense of unfairness that someone just like them but who is born into a noble family should get rights that they don't because of bogus excuses (ex. divine rights). Rights do not exist as some perminent fixed abstract entity (I suspect you think they do). They are social constructs dictated by a society. From that point of view, it is important to note what drives societies to give rights to begin with. I just think that it is important that societies take all arguements into account when making decisions - which means debating the reasons until there is nothgin left to debate. Just because there were historical reasons for rights to exist does not mean that we have to restrict ourselves to the historical reason. However, if you want to deviate from historical motivations for rights, you need to present new compelling reasons. So, what are YOUR reasons for thinking that rights exist?\n \nBut this is simply a proclamation. You think rights are useless if you can't understand or feel anything if they are gone. I disagree. We are also using circular reasoning here. Why is empathy important...because that is what we use to create/give rights...well who gets those rights...those with mental existence...why is mental existence important...because we have empathy for certain beings. Round and round.\n\n Rights of a zygote to act in certain ways is irrelevant if it has no capability of \"acting\" anyway. Rights of freedom of speech for a zygote is useless if it has no capability of communicating. Other rights are useful such as a right to life of a zygote. However, such a right is just as useful for an unfertilized egg. The consequences of either a zygote or egg being destroyed are nearly the same.\n \nYou can look at that a few ways...anyone really is allowed to marry. This is more a side thing so we can drop it...I was just wondering if you thought it was a right. Is equality a right?\n\n No. Children are not treated equally to adults. The rich typically have easier lives than the poor. Intelligent people typically have better jobs than stupid people. There are many examples where people get unequal treatment - both in everyday life (rich/poor, intelligent/stupid) and in the law(adults/children, law-abiding/criminal). \n \nIt certainly is not a tangent. If you can't explain to me why empathy for one \"group\" is not as important than empathy for another group then you have violated your test that you gave me. It still is a proclamation anyway and if you want to stick with the human species then I suppose you admit then that the unborn is a member of the human species. This gets me back to the idea that one should never discriminate against any human and to do so would be just as bad as the slaveholders.\n\n I do not have a fully explored theory on rights of animals so I cannot present one to you. Nobody has claimed other rights for animals in this thread so there is no compelling reason to address it. If this were a thread about animal rights, I would explore the reasoning. I might even be convinced by certain arguements. As it is, the subject is only tangentially relevant. I will try to think about it and address it if and only if you address the issue of why YOU think rights exist to begin with and answer my points, as I am answering yours.\n \nYour reasons are basically that you believe in empathy and mental existence.

I am afraid that we are losing touch with that ideal, and that can be dangerous for our democracy. What I am particularly afraid of is the non-insignificant numbers of the religious right who would impose their will on others based on religious creed, not rational arguement. I am afraid when I look at this administration which so often has ignored the reality of the situation (such as the fact that Iraq wouldn't just neatly fall into peaceful Democracy grateful to America as soon as Saddam was toppled).

   "Not being able to prove something does not make it relative nor does it make it not exist. As for your example, some cultures do believe that I would say their idea of natural rights is incorrect. \n\n Then how do YOU determine what natural rights are. If they are based on religious assumptions, then someone of another religioius belief could just as easily say that your idea of natural rights is incorrect. Indeed, the slaveholders thought that their view of blacks as inferior and justified as being slaves was supported by Christian doctrine. There are apparently many passages in the Bible (mainly the Old Testament) that talk about slavery as a normal occurrence. If there is no basis behind what one determines to be natural rights, then your view is just as arbitrarily chosen as that of the slaveholders.\n \nIf it comes down to a value judgment (as it does) then how is this any different than number one? The only difference would be different reasoning. I'd say your approach is more prone to changes and selfish thinking than looking at rights as something outside of ones control. \n\n My view is different than the first one (natural rights) because most people's system of judgement is not either purely value judgement or purely reason. We are creatures of BOTH reason and emotion. Most of the attrocities I can think of in human history (apart from the occasional attrocities of people who felt no need to justify themselves) were due to reasons that could have been debated away. The slaveholders held their views about the inferiority of blacks not because of the skin color itself (it would have been hard to justify that rationaly) but because they felt that races with darker skin were inherently inferior. This would have been much harder to prove were they ever to be held accountable to that. It was a wrong understanding of reality that could have been cleared up with rational debate. The same is true about discrimination against women. The treatment was largely based on wrong assumptions that could have been eliminated in rational debate. Hitler blamed all Jews for actions that only a small minority was guilty of. Most wars that are fought are filled with propaganda which villifies the enemy and makes him seem sub-human. Most or all of this wrong thinking could have been eliminated with rational debate (assuming that the debate actually would have stayed rational and people would have held themselves accountable to it).\n \n Yes, often the debate might ultimately come down to value judgements, but meanwhile, one has eliminated all the bogus reasoning that has so often led to injustice. Your method (i.e. jumping to assumptions about what natural rights are) allows the bogus reasoning to remain and allows more injustice to happen.\n \n Lastly, a debate that uses reason that ultimately leads to a value judgment does not automatically lead to selfish conclusions. People treat others well not only for selfish reasons (treating others well so they would also be treated well) but because of empathy as well. It is the culture that inspires empathy. It doesn't matter if it is religious or secular. There are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired noble acts, just as there are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired attrocities. I get so tired of people suggesting that those who don't base their morality on religion are automatically selfish. History does not bear that out.\n \nIncorrect values allowed slavery....politics had little to do with it.\n\n Politics had a lot to do with it since the founders fully realized that the Southerners had no intention of holding themselves accountable to real discussions about slavery. They were economically dependent upon slaves and had no intention of changing, no matter what rational or moral arguement would have been presented. The founders knew that the country would split appart if slavery were outlawed and, at that stage in history, the nation was too weak to afford such a split (or so the arguement goes). In the end, it took a war to stop slavery.\n \n Also, the values were incorrect because they were based on bogus reasoning - in that the Southerners thought blacks were automatically inferior and that slavery was their natural state. Again, all of that could have been eliminated with rational debate.\n \nThat aside, when it comes down to legal rights you have to take a different mindset. The system will allows be flawed and inconsistent but the will should be to achieve natural rights. A good example of this might be the banning of abortion except in cases of rape and incest. This is inherently a contradiction but perhaps would be the best we can do given a flawed system.\n\n Most people on the pro-choice side would see a right to one's own body as a natural right. Unless there is some rational way of defining natural rights, everyone can just go with their own view, which leaves us back at the starting point of might of numbers making right. I just think that rational debate is ultimately better than might of numbers as a determination of who gets rights, what kind and when.",

All definitions of person in those gray regions are inherently arbitrary.

It is that lack of accountability that led to attrocities.\n \nThe first and second are still the same anyway as they all come down to value judgment or they come down to a circular argument.\n\n You are continuing to ignore the fact that all decisions are not purely value judgements. Most decisions are a combination of reasoning and value judgements. For example, one might make a value judgement that you do not think that people who hurt others should have the same rights as those who would only act harmlessly toward others. That is a value judgement that I think a lot of us would agree with. (One could probably even argue reasons behind that value judgement.) However, if you say that all red haired people harm others and therefore should have fewer rights, then not only are you making a value judgement (hurtful people get fewer rights) but you are also using wrong reasoning (red haired people are hurtful). This was true for slaveholders, sexists, and many others who engaged in unfair treatment of groups.\n \nThey had many discussions on slavery. In fact you could just look to the Lincoln Douglas debates for an example.\n\n But they didn't fully explore the reasoning and didn't hold themselves subject to the debates conclusion. \n \nand they would be wrong.\n\n Similarly, they would claim that you are wrong in saying that a right to ones own body is not a natural right. After all, it is an inherent part of a person's liberty. That just shows the trouble with defining natural rights in such an arbitrary way. You use one set of rights. Another group uses another set of rights. Ultimately, it would come down to a fight of numbers in our Democracy. \n \nNo amount of \"rational debate\" would ever get you to a point of what is or isn't a right.\n\n Rational debate could have ultimately convinced the southern slaveholders that blacks were not inherently inferior. For example, successful African Americans could have been pointed to. An experiment could have been set up to raise a black slave child under identical circumstances to a white child from a good family to show how much upbringing and opportunities matter. Many such points could have been made. The trouble, of course, was that the southerners had no intention of holding a full rational debate. When people have their minds set, no amount of rational argument could convince them. I am simply presenting rational argument as an ideal goal for society to hold up since people who value rational arguement are more likely to engage in it and, therefore, more likely to get at the truth.",

The only way would be to say that belief is wrong and to say that would mean you know what the correct belief is.\n \n \nBut they didn't fully explore the reasoning and didn't hold themselves subject to the debates conclusion. \nSo the countless hours of debates on slavery and you write it off as \"they didn't get it\". Well I agree they were wrong but it was only well after the fact that they understood why. And now the reason they were wrong then is the reason you are wrong now and yet you want to tell me your reasoning is ok and theirs was wrong? \n \n As one who has studied the civil war an slavery I'd say the reasoning used in debating slavery was very sound given the beliefs some held. It was the beliefs that were wrong though. Your idea of \"rational\" debate was used and got no where and it was the change of hearts and the death of many that solved the question.\n \n \nSimilarly, they would claim that you are wrong in saying that a right to ones own body is not a natural right. After all, it is an inherent part of a person's liberty. That just shows the trouble with defining natural rights in such an arbitrary way. You use one set of rights. Another group uses another set of rights. Ultimately, it would come down to a fight of numbers in our Democracy. \nIn a democracy, yes, it comes down to numbers. I'd say trying to seek the natural rights is more beneficial than trying to hold on to relative rights which are more subject to change.\n \n \nRational debate could have ultimately convinced the southern slaveholders that blacks were not inherently inferior. For example, successful African Americans could have been pointed to. An experiment could have been set up to raise a black slave child under identical circumstances to a white child from a good family to show how much upbringing and opportunities matter. \nHow do you know this would have changed peoples minds? I doubt it would considering it was skin color that was the problem to begin with. Just look at some of the Lincoln Douglas debates where they talked about how skin color is what determines where you stand in the world. Sure some claimed less intelligence and others claimed other things but many expected that they were men and just found that because their skin was black it was inherent they were to be slaves..that was what they were born to be. You need to realize that, in the end, the reasons didn't even really matter because many just wanted them to be slaves. With abortion I see the same thing among many...it doesn't really matter whether the fetus is a human being a person or whatever because they always want the mother to have the right to abort. \n \n \nMany such points could have been made. The trouble, of course, was that the southerners had no intention of holding a full rational debate. When people have their minds set, no amount of rational argument could convince them. I am simply presenting rational argument as an ideal goal for society to hold up since people who value rational argument are more likely to engage in it and, therefore, more likely to get at the truth.\nYour arguments are no better than theirs were.\n \n I was oddly enough in Galesburg (they have a new train museum going in by the way which looks to be pretty nice) a few months ago reading one of the Lincoln Douglas debates and I remembered a quote that Lincoln said (not at the debate I don't think). I didn't remember it exactly but luckily Wikipedia has it.\n \n\n I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why may not another man say it does not mean another man? If that declaration is not the truth, let us get this statute book in which we find it and tear it out.\n\n Lincoln argued the same thing I do which is that by principle all human beings are the same.",

   "The reality implies an absolute..something you disagree with. Your's is arbitrary because once again you can either appeal to an unprovable claim (such as natural rights) or you can go in circles. You choose circles.\n\n I do think there is an absolute reality out there. For example, I am nearly 100% certain that the sun, earth and moon are real, that the computer in front of me is real, etc. There was a whole discussion on this in the \"Metaphysical Discussions\" thread many months back. However, where morality is concerned, that I do not view as an absolute because it is something invented by people and, since people vary, the ideal morality would vary. You may claim that the morality you hold, which comes from your religion, is the one that is absolutely true, but that is just an unsupported claim on your part. Slaveholders also made unsupported claims and were just as certain that they were right as you are. \n \n Since human psychology varies, the things they value ultimately have some variety. When people make decisions, they make them mainly out of a combination of reasoning and value judgements - a combination of logic and emotion. When logic is flawed, rational debate can correct that. For example, the claims of slaveholders that blacks were inherently inferior was flawed - rational debate and demonstration could have corrected that (if it were given a chance).\n \n I'm not sure what you are calling circular reasoning. If it is merely the fact that there is no one fixed answer and that it ultimately comes down to a value judgement, then you are forgetting that the main goal of the rational debate is to eliminate the bogus reasoning that surrounds that value judgmenet - where it is the bogus reasoning that has historically been a main cause of attrocities.\n \nAnd what would this standard be? How can you possibly say you could \"rationally\" tell slaveholders they are wrong when the only way possible is to either show them how they are inconsistent in a belief or that their belief is wrong based on an outside criteria?\n\n I keep saying over and over and over that I would demonstrate to them that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites. Do you claim that is an impossible task?\n \nIt would appear I'm debating now. And yes they did have debates. \"Full rational debate\" has no meaning in the way you are putting it because rational means reasons that you prefer and that by itself makes it irrational.\n\n When children argue with each other back and forth just yelling out their views \"It's A\", \"No, it's B\", \"No, it's A\", \"No, it's B\"... that is irrational. Rational arguements address the concerns of the other side and support ones own views with evidence or at least with more reasoning. Are you claiming that southerners would have been able to support their view of the inferiority of blacks in full rational debate without resorting to irrational arguements such as \"because I say so\" or \"because such and such a quotation from the Bible says so\"?

All I read over many pages were debates about politics, not about essence. I did not read a debate which came down to \"Why do you think blacks should be slaves\" and then questioned in detail each point brought up, including challenges to Biblical quotations. If you know of such a detailed arguement, please post a link to it. By full rational debate, I do not mean a debate that just skims along the surface of the issue. I mean one that delves fully into it, questioning everything without fear of political reprecusssions.\n \nAs one who has studied the civil war an slavery I'd say the reasoning used in debating slavery was very sound given the beliefs some held. It was the beliefs that were wrong though. Your idea of \"rational\" debate was used and got no where and it was the change of hearts and the death of many that solved the question.\n\n Rational debate, from the example of the Lincoln/Douglas debate which you mentioned, did not delve nearly deep enough.

I'd say trying to seek the natural rights is more beneficial than trying to hold on to relative rights which are more subject to change.\n\n Thn we are going in circles because pro-choice people would say that a right to ones own body is a natural right. You disagree, but neither side is absolutely right in their claim since THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTELY DEFINED NATURAL RIGHTS. If you claim there are, prove it.\n \n Without an absolute standard on natural rights that can be proven, then anyone can make a statement on rights and claim that they know what is right (as the southern slaveholders did). I think that is a situation more frought with possibilities of injustice than a situation where one gets rid of bogus reasoning through rational debate.\n \nHow do you know this would have changed peoples minds?

   "And yours are unsupported too.\n\n I have presented no bogus reasoning, as the slaveholders had.\n \nNo, and you can't show that it would.\n\n You are seriously claiming that there are no rational arguement that can show that blacks are not inherently inferior to whites? How about all the examples of successful African Americans in a wide range of fields. Even in the 19th century, one could point to examples such as Frederick Douglas as intelligent, cultured, successful African Americans. How about the argument of bringing up a black child under the same circumstances as a white child and see what comes of it. Many arguements could have been given if full rational debate (which, by definition, means that the two sides actually listen to each other and respond to each others points in defendable manner) were given a chance. Mainly, the arguements of the slaveholders about how blacks were inherently inferior could have been countered.\n \nI disagree, bogus beliefs cause this.\n\n What was bogus about it then, that it didn't adhere to an arbitrary standard or that it was not based on reality? I say it was not based on reality. Blacks were not inherently inferior. It could have been proven in its day, given the chance, as it is now.\n \nCircular reasoning is when you can't prove anything and so you refer to a previously made claim to prove that same claim. It also can be called begging the question.\n\n You mean like claiming that zygotes are people who deserve rights? I never claimed that there are absolute standards for rights, as you did. Just as in morality in general, moral rules are relevant to the people who make them. However, when people make rules about morality, rights, etc., it is important that they take all arguements into account. Otherwise, they are just working blindly based on gut reaction or arbitrary claims.\n \nIt is only possible if you change a belief like I said. For this to be true you have to state that one belief is wrong and another is right.\n\n And again, we come to the example of slaveholders where, if they let themselves be subject to full rational debate, could have been convinced that blacks were not inherently inferior. \n \nConsidering all thoughts come down to beliefs then a debate on the reasonings from those beliefs would be fairly easy for me to win. Again, the only way to challenge a belief is to indicate there is a right one that they do not adhere to (other than showing they are inconsistent in their own belief). \n\n All thoughts do not come down to beliefs. Unless you want to get into metaphysical discussions, the thought that the ground is hard, or the sun is hot today, is not a belief - it is an observation. Observations are not the same thing as beliefs. Noticing that the sun is hot is an observation. Thinking that the hot sun is moved around by the God Apollo is a belief. \n \nThere were 7 debates for one thing. Slavery was the main issue in all of these (and a large part the expansion of it). \n \n I'm not gonna give you a history lesson on the debates over slavery. If you don't believe they happened then you are a fool. We had a civil war over it.\n\n All I am asking for from you is one reason which the slaveholders gave which could not have been countered by rational debate (again, rational debate forcing the slaveholders to give layers of reasons or evidence behind their answers). Is this too much to ask of you? You are the one claiming that rational debate could not have resolved this issue. If this is what you claim, then show why.\n \nAnd yet my point is rational debate is fine but you aren't going to convince someone they are wrong on a point unless you can provide a right answer. Your rational for abortion is not going to fail in any logic because it is reasonable based on your unsupported beliefs. This is true for me as well. The only way to address this would then to show why your beliefs are wrong and mine are not...or visa versa. \n\n The ultimate decision on abortion may come down to a value judgement, but many arguements could be made along the way. For example, one could hold a rational debate about when mental existence starts. Since souls are a sort of supernatural mental existence, it would be required of you to present arguements and evidence about why you think souls exist and why you think they would start at conception. I could show scientific evidence on my side of the arguement.

Rational debate can help eliminate some of the bogus paths that people take and which have often led to attrocities or injust actions.\n \nYou don't get that this doesn't matter. Evidence to support your own reasoning that comes from a belief does you no good when the other has another belief. You are flawed in your thinking here because you belief a slaveholder is starting from the same premise as you when they clearly are not. This premise is supported only by belief (or circular reasoning which is not really a support) and thus you would have to convince someone the belief is wrong and there is no evidence that could do that....just claims and perhaps showing of those claims.\n\n If slaveholders were able to stick with a rational debate, then they would have had to concede that blacks were not inherently inferior. I just do not know why you do not see this.\n \nI believe whites are inherently inferior to blacks and therefore they can be slaves. I'd like to see you knock down that claim with your so called evidence. \n\n Well, first I would ask you why you think whites are inherently inferior to blacks.

Rights are desired and given by people, after all. The reasons the people strive for rights are therefore important - where empathy has historically been involved either directly or indirectly with most of those reasons. As for whether we have empathy, I argued that it is an inherent capability in most of us (as claimed by psychologists).

Ultimately, the debate came down to the fact that we humans are inherently (from our evolution / biology) capable of empathy and empathy has historically been a main driving force for rights. It is what is most often appealed to, directly or indirectly, when rights are taken away. How is that circular?\nI'll address how it is circular. \n \n You claim you only have empathy for those with mental existence. That is fine but why do you think mental existence is important? The answer to that question (which we have done) simply gets back to empathy which creates the circular argument. \n \n It further doesn't address the question about how you give rights to something if you don't have empathy for it. If you had no empathy for a certain class of people then how do you convince them they should? Likely you would claim mental existence is important but that is simply an opinion and a matter of faith and inconsistent among species.\n \n \nFirst you have to define what inferior is. How is one group inferior to the other and how is that relevant to rights? These types of questions are how rational debates are held.\nThey are inherently inferior. This is relevant to rights because of the belief that rights are granted to those who are of equal value. \n \n \nI suspect that the reason for that is that you claim to know it is right since you claim that your religion defines the absolute truth. Your religion tells you that zygotes have souls and that, therefore, they are people whereas unfertilized eggs are not. (or at least that is the difference you outlined in an earlier thread). You know that your views are based on faith, not on evidence or fully debatable reasons, so you try to claim that no other views involve debatable reasons or evidence either - a false claim.\nNot only that, I claim reasons do not have evidence that is relevant and that your claims are based on faith.\n \n \nHere we were addressing the fact that southerners claimed that blacks were inherently inferior - and they didn't mean that they were equal in all ways except for skin color. So, the question arises - how were they thought inferior? Most aspects of human nature are testable - from intelligence, to physical fitness, to questions of courage, etc.\nThey are thought to be inherently inferior. It just so happens that the only way to tell who is inferior is by the skin color and that is rather testable. \n \n \nI never claimed that there is an absolute criteria for rights. I claimed that for most people, empathy plays a role, since most appeals I have heard of for rights appeal either directly or indirectly to empathy and since the historic roots of people striving for rights was because they were suffering without them.\nWhile I disagree with some stuff here it is irrelevant since you seem to think there is no absolute criteria for rights. If there is no absolute criteria then I have a heard time understanding why my criteria is wrong. Perhaps there is an absolute criteria for determining if your method of evaluating rights is reasonable?\n \n \n Rights are desired and given by people, after all.\nI disagree and I'm not alone in this thinking. \n \n Of course with legal rights I do agree but I am under the impression we aren't talking about those.\n \n \nI argued that it is an inherent capability in most of us (as claimed by psychologists).\nEmpathy is actually something learned and is only partially inherent. \n \n \n As for whether one can empathize accurately with a being with no mental existence, apart from the type of empathy that is a false attachment of personality (such as with pet rocks), the very definition of empathy requires a mental existence in the one you are empathizing with. How is all that circular?\nWell for one we assume empathy is important for establishing rights. This is something I disagree with. It might be ok for arguing for someone to get rights but that doesn't mean it is the reason they have them to begin with. Certain animals have more mental existence than a 1 day old baby but I wouldn't have much empathy if the animal died and I wouldn't say this animal deserves rights. \n \n As for circular reasoning, this statement is not circular by itself but simply an unprovable statement.\n \n \nBut that is why I bring up \"inherent\" inferiority. Of course, someone who was brought up as a slave would have much less knowledge and intellectual adaptness (on average) than someone who was brought up as the son of a rich man. However, if you take the socio-economic considerations into account, then the differences would have been much, much smaller.\nirrelevant. The reason blacks were treated so poorly for so long is that the people during the time period grew up learning things a certain way. If you start out believing blacks are inferior then it is darn near impossible to convert that thinking and to have any empathy for a black person. The only reason this changed was that some folks simply had beliefs and upbringing that would allow for empathy or realization that blacks are in fact people as well and thus deserving of rights. It only took an act of showing where ones views were inconsistent to change minds. \n \n A good example might be a kid that kills someone. Often times a kid like this will really have no concept that what he did ended a life and that this is a bad thing. Someone like this will never really be able to function in society as they cannot comprehend why they shouldn't kill someone. An odd concept I realize but since you look to psychology I took the liberty of asking my psychologist friend who gets to deal with people like this all the time (not like that provides anything convincing to you). The point to this is what if everyone became like that. Would we no longer have rights against killing? I suggest no because I find right to be inherent and natural. Because of this I can claim blacks always had rights and that the unborn has rights as well.",

   "This isn't truth though. This is simply making conclusions based upon accepted assumptions that most agree with (such as definition of hot, what observation is, that we are in fact existing...etc etc).\n\n You seem to be thinking in extreme terms - i.e. either something can be proven 100% or it is faith. I strongly disagree. As an analogy, take a murder trial. If there is no evidence (via observations of various sort - witnesses, fingerprints, motive, etc.), then the probability of that particular person being guilty is quite small. However, the more evidence on has, the higher the probability of guilt. That does not mean that someone who has a lot of evidence stacked against him may not be innocent (and just being framed, for example, or unlucky). However, that probability is quite small and the relatively low statistics of innocent people being convincted shows this. Evidence is the APPEARANCE of something being true. It is usually not absolute proof. That doesn't make it useless. Far from it. \n \n So, am I understanding you correctly that you think that either something is proven 100% or its is faith?

Indeed, there are two definitions of empathy:\n (from the Mirriam Webster online dictionary)\n 1 : the imaginative projection of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it\n 2 : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner; also : the capacity for this \n \n If there is no mental existence in the entity one is empathizing with, then one is talking about the first type of empathy - i.e. falsely attaching a personality to an object. This would be true if you were empathizing with a doll, a rock, an egg, .... and a pre-mentally existing fetus.\n \n True empathy is the second definition. When one has empathy toward a mentally existing being, then there ARE \"feelings, thoughts, and experiences\" in that being. Then, the question just remains whether or not one is accurately guessing what those feelings, thoughts and experiences are. Since people are similar enough to each other, we can usually be fairly close in our guesses as to what another is feeling. Where non-mentally existing beings are concerned, having a feeling of empathy toward such beings will always be 100% wrong since there ARE NO feelings, thoughts and experiences that the being can have by the very definition of mental existence.\n \nIt further doesn't address the question about how you give rights to something if you don't have empathy for it. If you had no empathy for a certain class of people then how do you convince them they should? Likely you would claim mental existence is important but that is simply an opinion and a matter of faith and inconsistent among species.\n\n As I said before, there are no absolute rules about who gets rights and of what type. This is determined by humans for both rational and irrational reasons. My stress of empathy comes from the fact that most of us are capable of it. Most appeals for rights that I have heard are appeals for people to empathize with the suffering of those without rights. Besides, I also have the reciprocity part of my moral stance - treating others as you expect to be treated. Even if you strongly dislike the others, that reciprocity part of the moral stance still holds.\n \nThey are inherently inferior. This is relevant to rights because of the belief that rights are granted to those who are of equal value. \n ...\n They are thought to be inherently inferior. It just so happens that the only way to tell who is inferior is by the skin color and that is rather testable.\n\n Thinking that someone is inherently inferior is not the same as that person BEING inherently inferior. That needs to be proven and the slaveholders would have been hard pressed to fully prove that blacks were INHERENTLY inferior. Of course, blacks of those days were certainly uneducated and ignorant, poor, and without high class manors, ... but that was an obvious result of their state of life as slaves. That is not INHERENT inferiority. Inherent inferiority would mean that they would be inferior even under the same conditions of life as whites - that was not the case. Otherwise, if it is ONLY skin color that the slaveholders thought caused inferiority, then they would have to admit that, when they themselves would get their skin tanned by the sun, they would become inferior - there are obvious logical inconsistencies that they would have to face.\n \nWhile I disagree with some stuff here it is irrelevant since you seem to think there is no absolute criteria for rights. If there is no absolute criteria then I have a heard time understanding why my criteria is wrong. Perhaps there is an absolute criteria for determining if your method of evaluating rights is reasonable?\n\n Yes, I do not think there are absolute criteria for rights (just as there is no ABSOLUTE proof of any of our knowledge). However, methodoligy at getting at any decision is important. A well thought out decision (as in the decision about rights) will mainly yield more just results than an arbitrary decision. Most decisions that people make are not purely emotional value judgements or purely rational reasoning but a combination of the two, where those two types of thought are also often interdependent. The only way one can affect value judgements is by appealing to other emotions - such as sympathy or, on the opposite side, anger or vengeance. However, rational reasoning also plays a role since value judgements are not made in a vacuum of knowledge but on a certain understanding of reality, where that understanding can be fine tuned through rational discussion. Hitler was able to rally anti-semitic feelings, allowing him to lead the Holocaust, but the only reason he was able to get away with it is because German people believed the lies and propaganda he spread about Jews. Rational discussion would have been able to lay bare the falsehood of that propaganda. Similarly, most decisions should be based on as REAL an understanding of the relevant reality as we can get, and that is most achievable with fully rational discussion.\n \nirrelevant. The reason blacks were treated so poorly for so long is that the people during the time period grew up learning things a certain way. If you start out believing blacks are inferior then it is darn near impossible to convert that thinking and to have any empathy for a black person. The only reason this changed was that some folks simply had beliefs and upbringing that would allow for empathy or realization that blacks are in fact people as well and thus deserving of rights. It only took an act of showing where ones views were inconsistent to change minds. \n\n THat is why I stress rational discussion - where rational discussion means that people base their decisions and understanding on the reasons and evidence presented in the rational discussion. Being stuck in a belief system (such as the slaveholders had about blacks) simply because one was raised that way is not rational if one does not truly weigh in all the opposing evidence. I fully realize that full rational discussion is not possible for many people. I simply feel that it should be held up as an ideal in our society since a culture that stresses rational discussion will be more likely to practice it.\n \nA good example might be a kid that kills someone. Often times a kid like this will really have no concept that what he did ended a life and that this is a bad thing. Someone like this will never really be able to function in society as they cannot comprehend why they shouldn't kill someone. An odd concept I realize but since you look to psychology I took the liberty of asking my psychologist friend who gets to deal with people like this all the time (not like that provides anything convincing to you). The point to this is what if everyone became like that. Would we no longer have rights against killing? I suggest no because I find right to be inherent and natural. Because of this I can claim blacks always had rights and that the unborn has rights as well.\n\n You cannot convince someone if they are not open to rational discussion - such as the murderous kid in this case. People are often stuck in their emotional circles and do not register or allow themselves to think about opposing views - no matter how much you try to show them that \"2 + 2 = 4\", they will insist that \"2 + 2 = 3\". Kids that grow up in nasty neighborhoods often have a huge psychological wall set up against any vulnerability since they know they have to be strong to survive. Allowing themselves to be swayed by rational discussion or arguments of value or empathy would be a type of vulnerability in their eyes. As I said before, I fully realize that many people are incapable of rational discussion. I just think that it should be held up as an ideal since a culture that stresses rational discussion is more likely to practice it.",

The outcome of harvesting organs and abortion are the same.\n \n The real question is; can we defend something before it comes to being?\n Danger here. Because there are many living organisms that would be covered under such conditions. Like sperm and eggs in general.\n \n Should we have laws that prevent women from having periods without sexual relations to try and get the egg to become what it was designed for? Prevent men from masturbation for the same reasons. Both items have probabilities of becoming children like a fetus or fertilized egg.\n \n Should we have laws that force women to be checked for fertilized eggs before the beginning of a period so that the embryo can be protected? There are fertilized eggs or embryos that are even flushed down church toilets without the host ever knowing. The embryos could become a productive human being if laws where in place to protect them. In fact Bush is protecting such things now by not allowing these embryos to used in science. The only failure under these conditions is attachment and we can easily take care of that.\n \n What about a person in kidney failure. We could attach tubes from a male host for nine months so we can repair the issue. With the man's organs supplying the filtering the person would not die.

   "Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)\n This diagnostic test is usually performed between 8 and 11 weeks gestation, sometimes as late as 13 weeks. This is generally a test for people who have a high risk of genetic abnormalities. Test results are available within 7 to 14 days. Miscarriage rate from CVS is about 4%, recent studies indicate that if the CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation there is an added risk (.5% to 1.7%) of limb deformity, and about 3% CVS is associated with serious decline in amniotic fluid protection. There is a greater incidence of false positives because of the differences between the cellular genetic material of the choirionic villi and the fetus. There is a small chance that the sex they determine is wrong as well.\n \n Amniocentisis\n \n This diagnostic test is performed as early as 9 weeks and for diagnostic purposes, 18 weeks gestation. There is a risk of 1-1.5% miscarriage and 1% chance of other pregnancy complications (infection, premature labor, injury to the fetus, cord, or placenta, rupture of membranes, etc.). The tests take about 2-4 weeks to run. There is a small chance that the sex they tell you is incorrect.\n \n Ultrasound\n \n While ultrasound can be performed at any stage of pregnancy for the purpose of finding out the sex it is best done between 18 and 26 weeks. Most care providers will not give an ultrasound for the specific purpose of finding out the sex, and the American College of OB/GYNs has issued a statement against routine ultrasound exposure during pregnancy. However, most physicians do not heed this warning. Adequate studies on ultrasound safety have not been done, but we do know that ultrasound exposure can change the way the cell reproduces and moves. There have also been studies indicating that ultrasound heats up the cells. This method is the most frequent for finding out the sex of a baby, however, it is the least accurate. Accuracy depends on several factors: baby's cooperation, gestational age, technician's ability, etc. \n \n Doctors don't determine the sex of a baby. They don't do that because of the risk of miscarriage. 4 out of 100 means the doctor would be sued beyond recognition in a very short time.\n \n Its the lies and misleading #### that really blows my mind.\n \n What are you going to do when you find out nearly every doctor on the planet really wants to do good?\n \n People are NOT basically evil, that is a lie.

   "You seem to be thinking in extreme terms - i.e. either something can be proven 100% or it is faith. I strongly disagree. As an analogy, take a murder trial. If there is no evidence (via observations of various sort - witnesses, fingerprints, motive, etc.), then the probability of that particular person being guilty is quite small. However, the more evidence on has, the higher the probability of guilt. That does not mean that someone who has a lot of evidence stacked against him may not be innocent (and just being framed, for example, or unlucky). However, that probability is quite small and the relatively low statistics of innocent people being convincted shows this. Evidence is the APPEARANCE of something being true. It is usually not absolute proof. That doesn't make it useless. Far from it. \nI'd say in your murder example there are still elements of faith. That is why we go with \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". There is always some level of faith.\n \n\n So, am I understanding you correctly that you think that either something is proven 100% or its is faith?

I disagree that empathy is the thing that grants rights.\n \n As for the circular argument I did not mean to say the definition is circular but the way you use it to deny the unborn rights is. I guess to avoid this you would need a valid reason why empathy is the means by which you have rights. \n \n Oh, I also disagree that it is always the case that people think of rights in terms of empathy. For example many people think marriage is right but you really can't play empathy into that very much. Furthermore, I am sure many do not have empathy for what happens to a person who abuses children but I'd still say they have rights. Finally, it still doesn't really address why we place a different level of rights on humans as opposed to beings that may have higher mental existence.\n \n \nThinking that someone is inherently inferior is not the same as that person BEING inherently inferior.

You just need to understand that he is coming from a totally different belief structure. To the kid there is nothing rationally wrong with killing. If he/she grew up without empathy then what would be your argument? \n \n It seems hard to comprehend these things sometimes I realize but at some point you have to see that we all come from different backgrounds and that truly shapes the way you rationalize. In the end it still comes down to that basic belief structure and that seems to be the only disagreement between you and I.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I'd say in your murder example there are still elements of faith. That is why we go with \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". There is always some level of faith.\n ...\n I'm saying everything has a faith aspect to it.\n\n If, by faith, you mean a knowledge of reality that is not 100% certain, then I would agree that , by that definition of faith, every bit of our knowledge of our reality has some uncertainty in it, so there would be some level of faith. That is not the traditional definition of faith, since the traditional definition of faith involves belief without evidence, so I will refer to your definition of faith as \"faith\" in order to differentiate them.\n \n Ok, so if everything has some elements of \"faith\", then wouldn't you agree that some beliefs rely more on \"faith\" than others and that there is a gray scale of faith vs proven certainty, where the amount of evidence determines that gray scale? This relates to the analogy of the murder trial since the more evidence one has for guilt, the more probable that guilt is. Or do you deny this?\n \nI disagree that empathy plays a role in who gets rights. It may be good for arguing why one should not be denied their rights but I would say they had rights before but were being denied them and thus the question becomes how did they get them. I disagree that empathy is the thing that grants rights.\n \n As for the circular argument I did not mean to say the definition is circular but the way you use it to deny the unborn rights is. I guess to avoid this you would need a valid reason why empathy is the means by which you have rights. \n \n Oh, I also disagree that it is always the case that people think of rights in terms of empathy. For example many people think marriage is right but you really can't play empathy into that very much. Furthermore, I am sure many do not have empathy for what happens to a person who abuses children but I'd still say they have rights. Finally, it still doesn't really address why we place a different level of rights on humans as opposed to beings that may have higher mental existence.\n\n One thing we disagree on is that you really believe in a concept of \"natural rights\" presumably \"endowed by our creator\" which may be a nice concept to think about and makes for nice rhethoric in the Declaration of Independence but it is not the legal basis on which our country is founded (the legal basis is the Constitution) and is very problematic since different people come to different conclusions on natural rights. For example, those on the pro-choice side would view a right to ones body as a natural right - an inherent part of liberty. \n \n Instead of believing in some abstract natural rights, I acknowledge that it is the people of a country that ultimately determine rights, where the founders were wise enough to make it difficult for people to vote their rights away (by requiring a large majority to do so). Since it is people who make these decisions, my stress of empathy is that, directly or indirectly, empathy was the main emotion that people appealed to in claiming rights. Even the marriage right that you state, if you were to inquire why others should have the right of marriage, then I would claim both reciprocity and empathy play a role (remember that reciprocity ...\"treat others as you would be treated\" was also part of my moral standard). Couples want to have their love and lifelong committment ackowledged in marriage - which also gives respectibility to their union. Without it, their relationship would not be the same. Since most people see the positive aspects of marriage, they would also not deny it to others. When it comes to the question of support for gay marriage, both of those moral stances play a role - reciprocity in treating gay couples just like any other couples who are in love, and empathy in acknowledging that gay couples have most of the same feelings and needs as straight couples. The opposite arguments are essentially based on a negative view of gays - either through religion (\"God says homosexuality is immoral\") or through the general homophobia of this culture. I, personally, have no problem with gay marriage but, acknowledging that it is difficult to change a culture overnight, I would be more of a supporter of civil unions at this point.\n \n Proven based on what? Surely you aren't suggesting there is a standard by which they have to prove. This would get us back into that circular arguing again. The only thing they would need to show would be that skin color is different and since the belief exists that black skin equals inferior then that is what plays out.\n ...\n tanning your skin doesn't change your genetics but that is really beside the point. You seem to be suggesting a certain standard but are unwilling to say this is the standard.\n\n Oh, so it is not skin, after all, but the genetics that determine skin color. Then, how about Italian Americans or Greek Americans - who are relatively dark skinned compared to WASPs, would they have been considered inferior to WASPs because of their skin color, which is genetic? A main point is that differentiating people based purely on skin color and nothing else, leads to many complicated inconsistencies. Another main point is that people do not just randomly spit out rules but they nearly always feel the need to justify those rules - even the slaveholders. They did not claim that it was only dark skin itself that made the difference - they were prejudiced against the race that inherently had black skin for a number of reason (some reasons were interpreted quotes from the bible). In the idealized case, rational discussion could have laid bare the falsehood of many of these assertions. \n \n I think in the case of abortion you will always come out to an arbitrary decision because you make so many assumptions and statements of faith along the way.\n\n That is why the gray scale of \"faith\" vs proven certainty is important. For example, many on the pro-life side do try to appeal to the emotion of empathy in people when they talk about the \"innocence\" of the early fetus, where some have even written imaginary letters from that fetus to the mother that would abort it. It is a tool that is often used by the pro-life faction. Rational discussion would lay bare those assumptions as either being false or being based on unproven religious belief in a soul (where separation of church and state would keep such a belief from being imposed on the populace). \n \nI'd argue that most decisions are based upon what makes a person comfortable (selfishness) with possible input from emotion and rational reasoning.\n\n Well, people certainly do fight for their own rights, but when it comes to the rights of others or decisions about others, then they are swayed by both emotional value judgements and reason. \n \nKind of an off the subject remark but how can you be so sure you aren't falling victim to believing things that may not be true in reality?\n\n In that example, I was speaking of the idealised case where people would engage in rational discussion and allow themselves to be held accountable to it. I fully realize that reality is not that way and some people will continue to believe that \"2 + 2 = 3\" if it suits them, no matter what rational arguements are presented. I bring up the idealized case simply to show what that ideal could have achieved - in order to try to convince you and others in this culture to try to hold up rational arguement as an ideal.\n \nThe thing is they thought they were having rational discussion and in a sense they were. It was the underlying beliefs that were wrong but the conclusions from those beliefs were very rational. I don't disagree that reasoning is a good thing but it does have many limitations and once you get to that point you are going by faith alone. It turns out that at this point if you have two different beliefs you either find a way to live with it or you decide which side will prevail. Sadly it took 750,000 lives to decide who's belief would prevail in the Civil War. \n \n But he would be open to rational debate I'm sure. You just need to understand that he is coming from a totally different belief structure. To the kid there is nothing rationally wrong with killing. If he/she grew up without empathy then what would be your argument? \n \n It seems hard to comprehend these things sometimes I realize but at some point you have to see that we all come from different backgrounds and that truly shapes the way you rationalize. In the end it still comes down to that basic belief structure and that seems to be the only disagreement between you and I.\n\n As I said before, most decisions and views that I have heard people express show a combination of reason and emotional value judgements. Rational discussions can get rid of a lot of the bogus reasoning that has caused injustice, as long as it is fully participated in. That is why I mainly refer to rational \"discussion\" not rational \"debate\". Debate, in my view, is when people try to convince others - either in the opposition or in an audience - of their point of view. It says nothing about their open-mindedness in having their own minds changed. In order to fully participate in rational discussion, I would claim that you also have to be willing to have your mind changed - something that is difficult for many people to do due to ego, self-interest, or other issues. That open-mindedness is critical to having effective rational discussions. Without it, not much gets accomplished - as can be seen on so many debates on 4forums.com as well.",

If your mother was forced by law to have you, what effect would that have on you? Knowing your mother was forced to take the trauma of your coming into being? Should we hold a gun to your mothers head?\n \n You and I can be against abortion, but can we force a woman to carry a fetus morally? Simply tie people down and force them to host something?\n \n If a man is in liver failure, and you change his outcome by connecting another human to him, he would become parasitic and live by means of his host. What would the host's choices be? Bare in mind the parasitic side of the question. This person qualifies as a human being in all detail.\n \n The only difference between pro-choice and pro-life is the use of a doctor. Abortion happens and will happen. Abortion is very simple. Abortion is so simple an 8 year old with a stick can do one. The path to the fetus is extremely easy to follow, and the fetus is in a thin membrane. As far as pro-abortion, I have yet to see people running around telling people to abort.\n \n There is no way to stop an unwilling host to a fetus. We would have to tie her down and force her to allow the gestation. If we don't, we are asking for the loss of not only a fetus but the loss of the host. Morally, we would be complaisant in the hosts death.\n \n Mexico had 1.5 Million abortions during its last year of law preventing abortion. 8000 women died and 40,000 (think it was) where hospitalized.\n \n The United States had 1.2 Million abortions, less than Mexico even though it is legal.",

   "Ok, so if everything has some elements of \"faith\", then wouldn't you agree that some beliefs rely more on \"faith\" than others and that there is a gray scale of faith vs proven certainty, where the amount of evidence determines that gray scale? This relates to the analogy of the murder trial since the more evidence one has for guilt, the more probable that guilt is. Or do you deny this?\nThat's actually kind of a hard question to answer. I'm sure it's true but if you have elements of faith then without knowing the truth you don't know how wrong you could be. \n \n You know, this is really an aside anyway. The only point to this was we all have faith and I'd say we have a lot more than you probably think we do.\n \n\n One thing we disagree on is that you really believe in a concept of \"natural rights\" presumably \"endowed by our creator\" which may be a nice concept to think about and makes for nice rhethoric in the Declaration of Independence but it is not the legal basis on which our country is founded (the legal basis is the Constitution) and is very problematic since different people come to different conclusions on natural rights. For example, those on the pro-choice side would view a right to ones body as a natural right - an inherent part of liberty. \nAt least you can see my views are not limited to just me.\n \n But aside from that I'd say the DoI reflected the views of the people who mainly wrote the constitution. Furthermore, the constitution's man goal was to set up a system of government and only in the amendments did they get into making some rights harder to reach. Interestingly, the constitution doesn't need to define terms like \"liberty\" as it clearly states how this word can be defined (due process). So the idea was the let the people decide what they want liberty to mean in hopes of achieving natural rights. Obviously there are disagreements on what they are.\n \n \nInstead of believing in some abstract natural rights, I acknowledge that it is the people of a country that ultimately determine rights, where the founders were wise enough to make it difficult for people to vote their rights away (by requiring a large majority to do so).\nas stated above I agree our rights are basically codified by laws and voted on by the people. This doesn't disprove or prove a natural rights idea though.\n \n \n Since it is people who make these decisions, my stress of empathy is that, directly or indirectly, empathy was the main emotion that people appealed to in claiming rights.\nBut I stress again it is hard to promote empathy if you are not empathic to the being to start with. Furthermore, it implies the right already exists outside of empathy and therefore you have to show how it is given to both parties. \n \n \nCouples want to have their love and lifelong committment ackowledged in marriage - which also gives respectibility to their union. Without it, their relationship would not be the same. Since most people see the positive aspects of marriage, they would also not deny it to others. When it comes to the question of support for gay marriage, both of those moral stances play a role - reciprocity in treating gay couples just like any other couples who are in love, and empathy in acknowledging that gay couples have most of the same feelings and needs as straight couples. The opposite arguments are essentially based on a negative view of gays - either through religion (\"God says homosexuality is immoral\") or through the general homophobia of this culture. I, personally, have no problem with gay marriage but, acknowledging that it is difficult to change a culture overnight, I would be more of a supporter of civil unions at this point.\nmeh, we might want to get off this topic since this isn't the gay rights forum but I tend to disagree with a lot said here.\n \n \nOh, so it is not skin, after all, but the genetics that determine skin color. \nIs it not?\n \n \nThen, how about Italian Americans or Greek Americans - who are relatively dark skinned compared to WASPs, would they have been considered inferior to WASPs because of their skin color, which is genetic? \nI'm pretty sure they limited it to just Africans. \n \n\n A main point is that differentiating people based purely on skin color and nothing else, leads to many complicated inconsistencies. \nNo it doesn't. If you are going to claim that my argument has to be \"you gain rights the lighter your skin gets\" then why couldn't I claim your argument is \"you gain rights the more developed your brain gets\"? That would lead to the same complicated inconsistencies. \n \n \nAnother main point is that people do not just randomly spit out rules but they nearly always feel the need to justify those rules - even the slaveholders. They did not claim that it was only dark skin itself that made the difference - they were prejudiced against the race that inherently had black skin for a number of reason (some reasons were interpreted quotes from the bible). In the idealized case, rational discussion could have laid bare the falsehood of many of these assertions. \nWell I'm a firm believer that they knew it was wrong but it seems they did just make rules based upon a belief. Yes some spit out certain claims from science to the Bible and yet \"rational discussion\" didn't solve this. The idea that they were weak-minded then and we are so perfect now is foolish. Thinking hasn't changed much since then.\n \n\n Well, people certainly do fight for their own rights, but when it comes to the rights of others or decisions about others, then they are swayed by both emotional value judgements and reason. \ndoubtful\n \n\n In that example, I was speaking of the idealised case where people would engage in rational discussion and allow themselves to be held accountable to it. I fully realize that reality is not that way and some people will continue to believe that \"2 + 2 = 3\" if it suits them, no matter what rational arguements are presented. I bring up the idealized case simply to show what that ideal could have achieved - in order to try to convince you and others in this culture to try to hold up rational arguement as an ideal.\nIf everyone thought 2 + 2 = 3 would you say it does (abstractly)?\n \n \nRational discussions can get rid of a lot of the bogus reasoning that has caused injustice, as long as it is fully participated in. That is why I mainly refer to rational \"discussion\" not rational \"debate\". Debate, in my view, is when people try to convince others - either in the opposition or in an audience - of their point of view. \nYou weren't one to defend me when I was getting rid of the bogus reasoning that goes like this: \"Don't push your beliefs on me\". In fact, I challenge you to call people on your side when they give a bogus reasoning and I'll do the same (which I tend to do anyway). \n \n That aside, I have never disagreed that rational discussion is bad, in fact, I think it is good but I'd disagree that it would lead anywhere but having two separate belief structures. I also disagree that it is full proof as it is extremely limited to ability to comprehend and numerous other factors. \n \n \nIt says nothing about their open-mindedness in having their own minds changed. In order to fully participate in rational discussion, I would claim that you also have to be willing to have your mind changed - something that is difficult for many people to do due to ego, self-interest, or other issues. That open-mindedness is critical to having effective rational discussions. Without it, not much gets accomplished - as can be seen on so many debates on 4forums.com as well.\nOf course open mindedness is hard to prove. All I can say is I used to be pro-choice and was convinced otherwise....the hardly proves anything though.",

I did, however, say that abortions performed to save maternal life were significantly lower than 52,000.\n \n 1.3 million abortions will not \"happen anyway.\" Some certainly will. But not 1.3 million.\n \n \nHere is the basic problem, if your arguing abortion should be permitted for health reasons then you'll need a percentage of risk or the courts will be flooded with people having actual health reasons for an abortion.\n \n Still need the God like percentage of chance.\n\n \n No, I do not advocate abortion for health reasons.\n \n \nHow many times will the Doctor be wrong? \n \n 800 women died last year in childbirth. Someone was wrong or they took your advice.\n\n \n The problem here is in your assumption that none of those 800 women (a number that you have not justified with a citation) could have chosen to proceed with the pregnancy even in the face of death.\n \n \nCancer actually happens.\n Heart defects are real.\n Tons of scenarios and by the way.\n\n \n Tons of hypothetical scenarios. But, again, when we look at the actual facts, we find that it is a very rare occasion indeed that an abortion is necessary to preserve a woman's life. That is just the way it is.\n \n \nI am pro-choice so the scenarios are not my issue. Your for law to prevent access, so they are yours to ponder.\n\n \n There are unjustifiable reasons for abortion. Gender selection is just one example of an unjustifiable reason.\n \n \nBare in mind, I am saying I can't make those decisions, your saying you can.\n \n Yet you won't do that. Simple, simple question that must be addressed. What percentage of risk must a host of a fetus have before choice is granted?\n\n \n I answered this already. The abortion option should not be present except where it is necessary to preserve maternal life. I understand that to be very rare circumstance. Doctors are in the best position to know when an abortion would be necessary to save a mother's life.",

   "Well lets look at your words. ALLOWING women to choose the option of abortion does NOT \"condone, endorse, and support\" abortion as the prefered option.\n\n \n ALLOWING a southern plantation owner to own slaves does NOT condone, endorse, and support slavery as the preferred option. That is a viewpoint that is gutless and ultimately morally bankrupt.\n \n \"I don't support abortion for the purpose of gender selection (for some mysterious, illogical reason), but I won't do anything to stop people from obtaining said abortions.\" That is ridiculous.\n \n \nAbortion is an option to be used thoughtfully and after due consideration by the individual concerned NOT BY THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n \n The government is perfectly entitled to govern in this area as it has traditionally done so.\n \n \nThe risk ratio concept allows the benefits of allowing abortion to be rationally assessed by women considering it and by society. And your premise is flawed since its far far far from being a settled issue as to whether a fetus is a human being. As to killing another human being justified under some circumstances we already allow for justifiable homocide in our legal system should you claim that we must not do so.\n\n \n My point is that if we can draw out an exception for justifiable homicide in our murder statutes, then we can surely do the same for justifiable abortion. A risk ratio is neither possible nor necessary for a definition of justifiable abortion just as a risk ratio is neither possible nor necessary for a definition of justifiable homicide.\n \n In order for this risk ratio argument to be consistent, it would necessarily have to be applied to the situation of self-defense statutes. And my point is that it is as absurd to suggest that a risk ratio is necessary for exceptions to an abortion ban as it is absurd to suggest that a risk ratio is necessary for a self-defense statute.\n \n \nThe logic goes this way in case you missed it:\n \n The pregnant woman is a persoon.\n The unborn fetus is not a human being.\n Having an abortion does not kill a human being.\n The woman is the person best situated to make a choice as to whether or not she wishes to carry the fetus (a non-person) to term.\n The choice therefore logically is the womans to make.\n If she chooses abortion no human-being is killed or injured as a fetus is not a human-being.\n \n OK whats bogus about that logic? The logic mind you not your obscession with the premises.\n\n The logic here is flawless. It just happens to be wrong. I would have as much problem with abortion as I do with appendectomies if it were true that the fetus were not a human being. And to that degree I would be more consistent with my belief than the pro-choice person who says, \"It's not the killing of a human life, but nevertheless I personally oppose it.\" I say that if it is not the killing of a human life, then I have no reason to personally oppose it. When I look at the facts I simply can't come to the conclusion that a fetus is no different than an appendix, a strand of hair, or a fingernail. And apparently, neither can many pro-choice advocates.\n \n Now, I must directly address your question as you seem to have ever-so-slightly shifted the scope yet again. The logic I called bogus was not the logic you stated, but rather the logic that says an abortion ban necessarily needs to specify some abstract, made-up principle of risk ratio. Not only have I shown that to be wrong, I have also shown that the people advancing that principle don't really believe it themselves.",

I have not said that a mother should be allowed to kill her baby in order to save her life. What I said, periodically, is that abortion should only be an option to preserve maternal life. I say that as shorthand. In the very rare circumstance where a mother's life is jeopardized by a pregnancy, the physician should save the life that he can save. In the rare circumstance where a pregnancy threatens a mother's life, the physician will have the option of acting to save the mother's life, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing her child; or the physician will have the option of trying to save the life of the child, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing the mother. In these scenarios, my understanding is that the latter scenario is never likely. If the physician were to opt to try and save the child's life, both the child and the mother would die.

It is similar to the scenario where a student walks into a classroom building and opens fire on unsuspecting students.

   "That's actually kind of a hard question to answer. I'm sure it's true but if you have elements of faith then without knowing the truth you don't know how wrong you could be. \n\n That may be the basis behind our difference in perspectives. At least my stance is consistent. I can understand your hesitation in answering this question since, in the murder case analogy, you would probably feel obliged to say that evidence does count, whereas agreeing that evidence does count in our knowledge about origins of humanity, supernatural beliefs, ... then that same stance about evidence would go against your beliefs. \n \nYou know, this is really an aside anyway. The only point to this was we all have faith and I'd say we have a lot more than you probably think we do.\n\n I follow the results of evidence, which has been a pretty good indicator of reality up to now - at least it has been consistent in the reality it shows (where it comes to the physical understanding of our world). The less evidence one has, the more uncertainty one has. With no evidence, one is left with belief without evidence - defined as faith. I occasionally allow my self leaps of faith, but I do not pretend to be certain about them. I would not be able to be intellectually honest if I claimed certainty in beliefs of faith. Where views based on evidence are concerned, then large amounts of evidence convince me. I do not believe every scientific theory is true - the string theory in Physics comes to mind (Occam's razor arguement) - just the ones that are well supported by evidence.\n \nAt least you can see my views are not limited to just me.\n\n I knew from the beginning that your views were not limited to you. However, I know that many of your views are based on religious beliefs. If you were not trying to impose your largely religious-based views on the populace at large via laws, then I would not be arguing as strongly against them. My stance is that laws need to be based on rational, supportable (with evidence) arguements. Our founders were wise in separating church and state. Heck, even Jesus said \"Let Caesar have what belongs to him, and God have what belongs to him\". \n \nBut aside from that I'd say the DoI reflected the views of the people who mainly wrote the constitution. Furthermore, the constitution's man goal was to set up a system of government and only in the amendments did they get into making some rights harder to reach. Interestingly, the constitution doesn't need to define terms like \"liberty\" as it clearly states how this word can be defined (due process). So the idea was the let the people decide what they want liberty to mean in hopes of achieving natural rights. Obviously there are disagreements on what they are.\n\n But that is the trouble - there is disagreement on what they are, where pro-choice proponents would view a right to ones own body as an essential part of liberty. After all, if the state can control what one does with ones own body, then what does one have left to control - only the mind?\n \nBut I stress again it is hard to promote empathy if you are not empathic to the being to start with. Furthermore, it implies the right already exists outside of empathy and therefore you have to show how it is given to both parties.\n\n Empathy is different than sympathy, where you are talking about sympathy. Empathy is a realization that others have similar feelings and reactions. For example, one can empathize with a serial killer being killed in a gunfight without sympathizing with him, since you might think he deserves the suffering. However, if you recognize the fact that they might suffer, then you have to think about the consequences of that. Apparently, many slaveowners didn't empathize with their slaves in realizing that they had the same feelings and reactions as any white person would have had in that situation. Some did realize that and didn't care because of their own greed and self-interest. Then, they had to think of contorted ways to justify that oppression. Again, I stress empathy as a main driving force since that is what was most appealed to (directly or indirectly) historically in the fight for rights.\n \nIs it not?\n\n I only wrote that it is genetics in response to your comment suggesting that it was genetics that were important (when I made the comparison of white people tanning their skins darker).\n \nI'm pretty sure they limited it to just Africans.\n\n You are missing the point. My point is that any arguement they presented purely about skin color (which was what you were suggesting) would have to be self-consistent in addressing all variations of skin color in the human race.\n \nNo it doesn't. If you are going to claim that my argument has to be \"you gain rights the lighter your skin gets\" then why couldn't I claim your argument is \"you gain rights the more developed your brain gets\"? That would lead to the same complicated inconsistencies.\n\n First, I am only arguing againt the purely skin color argument since you were the one who introduced it in this discussion (i.e. that the slaveholders could have used skin color alone as an arguement). My goal was to show the inconsistencies in that arguement. As for my arguement, I am not argueing that \"you gain rights the more developed your brain gets\". I am arguing that there is a point at which rights start, in my view, and that is the first possibility of mental existence since mental existence is critical, in my view, to the existence of rights. Similarly, you say that rights start when there is a complete set of DNA and when the growth process starts. Both of our views acknowledge a point where rights begin.\n \nWell I'm a firm believer that they knew it was wrong but it seems they did just make rules based upon a belief. Yes some spit out certain claims from science to the Bible and yet \"rational discussion\" didn't solve this. The idea that they were weak-minded then and we are so perfect now is foolish. Thinking hasn't changed much since then.\n\n Again, rational discussion would require them to be open-minded and accept that they could be wrong and live by that if their views could not be fully supported by evidence - which they could not.\n \nIf everyone thought 2 + 2 = 3 would you say it does (abstractly)?\n\n If everyone thought that 2 + 2 = 3, then they would all agree that 2 + 2 = 3 since nobody would be arguing otherwise. However, in such a situation, nobody would feel a sense of injustice.\n \nYou weren't one to defend me when I was getting rid of the bogus reasoning that goes like this: \"Don't push your beliefs on me\". In fact, I challenge you to call people on your side when they give a bogus reasoning and I'll do the same (which I tend to do anyway).\n\n Well, I admit that some people on the pro-choice side can also go too far on occasion, and occasionally I call them on it - admittedly not often enough. Where chemists arguement of \"don't push your beliefs on me\" was concerned, I recognized that arguement as being about unsupported beliefs, not ANY beliefs, which turned out to be what he really meant, when I asked him in a later post. If he had meant that people cannot push any views on others, then I would have disagreed with him since people have a right to push a view if they have supporting arguements and evidence for that view.\n \nThat aside, I have never disagreed that rational discussion is bad, in fact, I think it is good but I'd disagree that it would lead anywhere but having two separate belief structures. I also disagree that it is full proof as it is extremely limited to ability to comprehend and numerous other factors. \n \n Of course open mindedness is hard to prove. All I can say is I used to be pro-choice and was convinced otherwise....the hardly proves anything though.\n\n Open mindedness is hard to prove, but it can be demonstrated by people letting their minds be changed by full rational discussion. If someone holds a belief that cannot stand up to scrutiny, then there is a large chance that that belief is wrong. Open-mindedness would then have them change their minds. Sometimes, there is no obvious answer and we do not have enough knowledge to prove one view vs another. Other times, the decision has as much to do with value judgement as with evidence. In both those situations, I would agree that all that might be achieved is for each side to at least understand the other and agree to disagree. However, the great majority of decisions that have been made by our government are not only value judgements but judgements based on an understanding of reality that can either be supported or knocked down with evidence. I think rational discussion leads to a better, more accurate, understanding of the reality on which we can then make decisions.",

   "You distort what I said and my stance is perfectly consistent. I don't doubt we use evidence and things like that for a murder case because it is the best system we have but that doesn't speak to how much faith is involved in 2 unique situations.\n\n So then, how much do you think evidence plays a role in showing what our reality is about? This includes anything from satelite images of weather patterns helping to predict future local weather, to knowledge that has been gained from evidence about the origins of humanity and our solar system, to knowledge about the forces of nature, etc. My main point is that one either sees evidence as useful or one ignores it, or one questions the ways the evidence was taken or presented and proposes an alternative explanation. You can't have it both ways. \n \nThis assumes you known what reality is. Of course you have no way of knowing this and thus even that is based on faith.\n\n At least with the knowledge that has been gained through evidence, that knowledge is so very consistent with our experienced reality that untold numbers of accurate predictions have been made based on that knowledge - not so with religion. I can't think of a single religious prediction that has been accurately made - except for those that were re-interpreted after the fact (which isn't very useful). I am not saying that there is any absolute proof against religion - indeed, I remain hesitatingly hopeful that some evidence will someday be found for some aspect of the supernatural - but, until that point, one cannot state any confidence that one \"knows\" a supernatural truth. Probability of a view being true increases with evidence.\n \nBut even those have elements of faith in them which was the point of this argument. If we relate this to the abortion forum then I'd say there is nothing but faith. There is no evidence supporting the idea that mental existence is important in giving rights and for that matter there is no evidence that we are to have rights.\n\n You seem to approach this issue as if there is one right answer to abortion rights - there isn't. I don't think in such absolute terms as you do. I acknowledge that it is people who ultimately determine their rights in a democracy, but I am continually stressing that any laws (including those about rights) that are determined by people's representatives need to be based on rational discussion. That doesn't exclude value judgements. As I said before, I think people use both emotion and reason in their decision making, where reason includes ones understanding of reality. Reason can be optimized by rational discussion. Emotion can be swayed by emotional appeals, where empathy has most often been used in such emotional appeals for rights. You seem to claim that a desire for rights from conception is equally valid to a desire for rights only for blue-eyed, red haired people, is equally valid to a desire for rights for those with mental existence,... I disagree. I think the validity of the views is based on the arguements they present.\n \nThis can get us back into the murder of an adult question and why is that illegal. There is no evidence to support why some humans are valuable and not allowed to be killed other than a belief this is wrong. As for \"rational\"...my belief on abortion is the only rational conclusion from my belief structure just like your belief is the only rational conclusion from yours.\n\n But much of your belief structure is based on religious faith. The separation of church and state does not allow for laws based on religion. You have some non-religious arguements as well, but when I asked you the basic question of the critical difference between an unfertilized egg and a fertilized one that determines rights, you said \"a soul\" - that is a religious belief (both in a soul and when it enters the body).\n \nI disagree that separation of church and state means that one set of beliefs is not permitted in government.\n\n If that set of beliefs can be supported by non-religious arguements, then yes.\n \nThere is no trouble there. The constitution sets up a system to solve the issue...vote on it. If a pro-choicer finds different then convince the people and change the law. I'm not sure why people are fixed on the idea that democracy doesn't work.\n\n In your apparent view of democracy, you would see nothing wrong if a hypothetical future extremist muslim majority in the US (it could hypothetically happen someday) would vote in Sharia law. I do see something wrong with that. A law shouldn't be introduced because a group says \"we say so\" but because a group presents compelling arguements that people can agree on. The reality of democracy is that a large enough group (say 75%)could vote in whatever they want (ex. a law to kill all red-haired people) - that doesn't make it right.\n \nThat is not exactly true. It is a feeling brought on by another's situation. It has nothing to do with whether another has similar feelings to you or not.\n\n Empathy is trying to imagine what the other is feeling. We can only do that because we humans are relatively similar to one another.\n \nAgain, I think you distort the meaning of empathy here. Nevertheless, this still doesn't address how you get a slaveholder to empathize with a slave. Furthermore it doesn't speak to where the rights come from. I agreed that empathy can be a tool for fighting for rights but that hardly establishes how the right came to be and who deserves it anyway.\n\n Rights didn't come from some abstract absolutist land, they come from people, where people can be swayed by arguements of emotion (largely including empathy) and arguements of reason. There are rational rights and irrational rights. Laws need to have solid reasons behind them. Slaveholders were not exactly open-minded about the prospect of slavery so you wouldn't have been able to convince most of them with reason, no matter how much evidence was presented. I am simply stating rational discussion as an ideal that we should strive for, so I present idealized scenarios of what rational arguement could have achieved if true open-minded rational discussion had been participated in. \n \nIf you want to get picky with it then just say you get rights if you are not of that natural skin color (ie black). I thought it was clear this is what I meant.\n\n But there were many slaves who had more white ancestry than African ancestry and whose skin color was even lighter than many of those from, say, Italy or Greece. How would that have been defended using your argument?\n \nI would claim that everyone would be wrong and thus everyone committed an injustice (assuming that wrong was an injustice I suppose).\n\n If nobody is suffering, where is the injustice? \n \nThis does bring up an interesting point regarding a relative belief system. I still maintain that such a system would never allow one to say another is wrong or cant' do something.\n \n Your final sentence would imply there is such thing as as right and wrong.\n\n Relative reasoning does not mean arbitrary reasoning. That is something that is so often implied by you and others who hold on to belief in absolute truths, but something that is wrong. Saying that we need to restrict the rights of mass murderers is very different than saying that we need to restrict the rights of, say, red-haired people since one is based on rational arguement and the other is not.",

The southern states would never have separated in the first place if they did not feel that the institution of slavery was threatened with the election of Lincoln. However, Lincoln did not engage the Northern states in the Civil War to begin with for slavery but in order to keep the Union intact. The Emancipation Proclamation came later.

The reality of democracy is that a large enough group (say 75%)could vote in whatever they want (ex. a law to kill all red-haired people) - that doesn't make it right.\nAgain you try to establish an absolute here. What if 99% of people made a law to kill all red-haired people...does that make it right? Considering your 2+2=3 answer some posts ago I would say you would have to say it does make it right. \n \n As for my views of democracy, if extremist Muslims got a majority then I wouldn't have any other choice than to follow the laws they enacted. I would probably leave the country though.\n \n \nEmpathy is trying to imagine what the other is feeling. We can only do that because we humans are relatively similar to one another.\nAn appeal to the human being again. Interesting. Now, if a human being was not and could not suffer would you have empathy for them if something bad happened?\n \n \nRights didn't come from some abstract absolutist land, they come from people, where people can be swayed by arguements of emotion (largely including empathy) and arguements of reason. \nI'd like to know how you think people had empathy to begin with. Furthermore, can you show this to be true? Obviously many people disagree that rights came from people...including the people that created our government.\n \n \nSlaveholders were not exactly open-minded about the prospect of slavery so you wouldn't have been able to convince most of them with reason, no matter how much evidence was presented. I am simply stating rational discussion as an ideal that we should strive for, so I present idealized scenarios of what rational arguement could have achieved if true open-minded rational discussion had been participated in. \nYou are flawed in that you seem to believe people have to have the same thoughts as you do. There would be no difference in me claiming you do have the ability to \"rational argument\" as you claim the slaveholders didn't. It seems your argument here is really \"if people saw things the way I do then they are open-minded and will see the light\". \n \n You may not seem like you are doing this but, in fact, you are. It is the exact reason why I say a belief system like that is based upon oneself which has an inherent selfish basis (don't take this paragraph to be a low-blow...I don't mean to insult but state a point).\n \n \nBut there were many slaves who had more white ancestry than African ancestry and whose skin color was even lighter than many of those from, say, Italy or Greece. How would that have been defended using your argument?\nYou are still black at that point. But lets assume for arguments sake that the belief was a color X you are considered black and thus no rights (perhaps they had a little paint chart or something). How would you go about denying this belief and showing them they should have empathy when they clearly do not?\n \n \nIf nobody is suffering, where is the injustice? \n Suffering does not equal injustice.\n \n \n\n Relative reasoning does not mean arbitrary reasoning.\nYes it does\n \n \nThat is something that is so often implied by you and others who hold on to belief in absolute truths, but something that is wrong. Saying that we need to restrict the rights of mass murderers is very different than saying that we need to restrict the rights of, say, red-haired people since one is based on rational arguement and the other is not.\nThis is only true if you believe in an absolute right and wrong.",

The southern states would never have separated in the first place if they did not feel that the institution of slavery was threatened with the election of Lincoln.

   "http://www.civilwar.vt.edu/jr/jr.html\n \n The guy in that link would smack you if you said it was about anything other than slavery. The \"union intact\" was not a real reason. Dr. Robertson states many times that it was almost all about slavery. It's fairly hard to argue that he was wrong given his background.\n\n It depends on what his arguements are. The link you showed was only to his biography.\n \n Before the Civil War, Lincoln had no intention of freeing all slaves. His view was that he would use his power to prevent any new slave-permitting states to arise from the US territories so that, eventually, the government would be composed of mainly anti-slave states and, thus, slavery would eventually expire. However, this was enough for the Southern states to separate. Then, Lincoln went to war to keep them from seceding and to keep the Union together. It is interesting to note that, even with the Emancipation Proclamation, he did not have any slaves freed that were in Union states. Also, at the beginning of the war, Lincoln prohibited his generals from freeing slaves even in captured territories.\n \n Much of this was gleaned from :\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery\n as well as various Discovery Channel and History Channel programs, which were also developed by experts.\n \n So, the bottom line is that slavery was the main underlying cause of the civil war since the states would never have seceeded if not for the political threat to the institution of slavery posed by Lincoln's election, but that the war itself was started because of that secession not directly because of slavery. One can say that the main in-direct cause of the civil war was slavery but the main direct cause was keeping the union together. \n \n Alternatively, there are various statements that can be made:\n \n 1. The southern states would never have seceded if not for the threat to slavery.\n \n 2. The civil war would never have happened if not for the secession. So, if the Southern states would have kept their slaves and just complained in the official political process, without secession, then slavery as an institution would have continued for at least some decades to come before an anti-slave political state majority would have voted it off.",

   "It is hard to say with 100% certainly how much of a role evidence place in reality since you can't be 100% sure what reality is. I have stated that given this you do the best you can and obviously evidence is important to that. You get beyond that and can look at whether or not someone is using the evidence to make a valid conclusion.\n\n How about the evidence for an earth and solar system being billions of years old - do you accept that evidence as demonstrating the reality or do you question its validity and, if so, why? The same thing on all the fossil evidence showing that humans evolved from lower primates? \n \n can you give an example of a prediction the Christian faith has made that proved to be not true to reality? This, of course, assumes you know true reality (an absolute principal I might add).\n\n There were many predictions of appocalypses happening at various stages of history - including at the first millenium and at the second millenium. There were also many claims that God caused this or that natural disaster because of the sinfulness of the local people, etc (though that is not a prediction but an attempted explanation after the fact).\n \nFurthermore, I disagree that a consistent experience indicates truth. In fact, common theories have been disproven many times as this gets back to the ability for one to understand. One might say that if the sun rises a bird will fly. Now this will happen repeatedly but does not indicate a truth of relationship. This is obviously easily shown to be wrong now but throughout our past we have found that what has been a \"set in stone\" finding really was wrong afterall. I see no reason why today is any different.\n\n That is why one performs further experiments to get rid of all other explanations. The more evidence and exploration a theory has, the more it withstands the test of time, the more consistent it is with reality and lesser chance that it will ever be disproven. Many theories are simply explored in time in further detail - as with the Theory of Evolution and even Newtons Laws. Newtons laws remain valid (to within useable accuracies) for the range of objects we humans deal with everyday - relatively large (compared to, say, atoms, but not so large as giant stars) and relatively slow (compared to the speed of light). It was just made clear that for the tiny or enormous or super-fast, they no longer hold true, so other explanations needed to be found. \n \nYou say you don't and base conclusions on that but in reality you do but deny it. You believe in some absolutes. Understanding of a on reality is an absolute for example. You may not think absolute rights exist but if that is the case then rights are certainly more vulnerable.\n\n Well, we were talking about rights and morality, which are mental ideas, not physical objects, which, yes, I think do not have absolute answers - mainly because human psychologies vary. I do believe that there is a real absolute physical world out there. We do not know it 100% nor can we have 100% certainty that the knowledge we do have about it is true, but evidence of its workings can lead us closer and closer to an understanding of that physical reality. As for the supernatural, much as I could see benefits to such belief and would like it to have some truth behind it, I cannot have ANY confidence in a supernatural until some evidence shows itself - otherwise, it is just a blind leap of faith with a deluded confidence.\n \nAnd rational discussion has no meaning as far as I can tell. You would probably indicate that you have to provide evidence for everything but not everything has evidence. Many laws are based purely on beliefs of a society and those can only be but into law but common beliefs. \n\n As I said before, people generally make decisions based on a combination of emotional and rational reasons, where the rational reasons include an understanding of reality. That understanding of reality is what is most relevant to required evidence. I can't think of many laws that are PURELY value judgement and that have no demonstratable evidence of a reality that underlies that value judgement, or a need for such evidence. Can you think of a law that is PURELY value judgement?\n \nI don't think they are equally valid. I think mine is right and the others are wrong. I do, however, believe that beliefs are a valid reason for a law.\n\n So a hypothetical majority's belief that all red-haired people should die would be a valid reason for a law that states that all red-haired people should be killed?\n \nYou just happen to be wrong about what our first amendment means. I also hope this isn't your only reason for saying abortion laws shouldn't be enacted.\n\n Well, I know that our sides interpret the first ammendment differently. We think you are wrong and you think we are wrong. I just don't see how you can think that religious-based rules being introduced would not be invalidated by that first ammendment since the first ammendment says that a state cannot impose religion (as the Church of England had been imposed on people). Your view would allow, for example, Sharia law to be introduced bit by bit by a hypothetical Muslim majority until all laws were based on Sharia law. How would that not be a state imposing religion on a people?\n \nAgain you try to establish an absolute here. What if 99% of people made a law to kill all red-haired people...does that make it right? Considering your 2+2=3 answer some posts ago I would say you would have to say it does make it right.\n\n Presumable, the red-haired people would complain and introduce opposing arguements, which would require the 99% to justify their views. If they were not able to justify their views in rational discussion, then they would lose and not be able to implement their laws (in my idealized case). \n \nAs for my views of democracy, if extremist Muslims got a majority then I wouldn't have any other choice than to follow the laws they enacted. I would probably leave the country though.\n\n That is a reality of democracy, but if the need for rational discussion were stressed in this country and accepted by the culture, then the Muslim majority (idealized case of Muslims who accept the results of rational discussion) would not be able to implement Sharia law.\n \nAn appeal to the human being again. Interesting. Now, if a human being was not and could not suffer would you have empathy for them if something bad happened?\n\n I could have empathy with anything he is feeling or experiencing - empathy is not only about suffering. One can empathize with someone who is feeling happy, or angry, or horny... it is just trying to imagine what someone is feeling in a situation. Since we humans have similar patterns of emotional reactions, this allows us to have some accuracy in these imagined emotions. It would be much harder for us to empathize with, say, a spider since the spider's brain and reactions are so different that we would probably be wrong about a lot of aspects.\n \nI'd like to know how you think people had empathy to begin with. Furthermore, can you show this to be true? Obviously many people disagree that rights came from people...including the people that created our government.\n\n If the people who greated our government disagreed that rights came from people, then they never would have written down rights in the Constitution, would they? No matter what ones theory is about rights, it was obvious to all that, in a functioning government, rights and laws are determined by that government and the constraints (as in Constitution, etc.) that are placed upon it. This means that, in a democracy, the people ultimately determine the government so that it is the people who decide on their rights. As for empathy, psychologists say that what distinguishes psychopaths is that they do no have the capacity for empathy - meaning that everyone else does. Note that capacity for empathy is not the same as use of that empathy. Cultures or social groups can suppress that empathy (as in Nazi Germany) or support it. We have many emotions that can be appealed to - empathy is one of them, anger and jealousy and resentment are others that tend to counter it. I often refer to empathy simply because it was the emotion that was most often appealed to in arguements for rights - the main subject of this discussion.\n \nYou are flawed in that you seem to believe people have to have the same thoughts as you do. There would be no difference in me claiming you do have the ability to \"rational argument\" as you claim the slaveholders didn't. It seems your argument here is really \"if people saw things the way I do then they are open-minded and will see the light\". \n \n You may not seem like you are doing this but, in fact, you are. It is the exact reason why I say a belief system like that is based upon oneself which has an inherent selfish basis (don't take this paragraph to be a low-blow...I don't mean to insult but state a point).\n\n I am not saying that people have the same thoughts that I do, just that people are able to grasp logic and evidence if they at least seriously try. Logic and evidence will not always lead to the same conclusions, because we also have emotional value judgements in the mix, but they do at least limit the range of decisions that people can rationally make.\n \nYou are still black at that point. But lets assume for arguments sake that the belief was a color X you are considered black and thus no rights (perhaps they had a little paint chart or something). How would you go about denying this belief and showing them they should have empathy when they clearly do not?\n\n Empathy is the ability to imagine feelings, emotions, etc in another. They would have to explain how those others have no feelings or emotions, etc. Otherwise, they would have to explain why those feelings or emotions don't matter. Again, rational discussion doesn't mean that one side is being rational and the other side need not give any answers. It means that both sides make serious attempts to justify all of their reasons and hold themselves accountable if they lose the arguement.\n \nThis is only true if you believe in an absolute right and wrong.\n\n We humans have a built-in structure of emotions, reactions to pain and suffering, thoughts, logic, etc. that is the starting point of any social interaction. If we as humans were strange beings that loved pain, then our whole social system and moral structure might be very different. As with an earlier discussion we had about morals, we are not starting with a blank slate but with the inherent biologically driven reactions - that is a basis on which so much of our reality is centered. Our psychologies have enough difference that there are differences in value judgements, points of view, etc but that does not mean that we do not have a tremendous amount in common. It is that common human experience that forms a basis to discussions on morality and rights. Again, I brought out empathy since that is a common experience that we are at least capable of having - whether or not we actually practice it is another issue. We can all understand the desire to avoid un-necessary physical pain because we have all experienced pain and, except for a tiny percentage of people, we don't like it. There are vast amounts of common human experience that we build on. I don't know if you want to call that an absolute right and wrong (since another hypothetical type of being might, for example, actually enjoy the feeling of pain), but it is a starting point that we take for granted.",

I don't count a spark as a reason just like you don't count a gun being fired as the reason a war starts.\n\n It very much depends on what actions the North would have taken to try to stop slavery. The ideas of Lincoln and the Republican party were ideas that would have kept the elimination of slavery legal, from a constitutional sense, but their ideas still would have led to the elimination of slavery. It is certainly possible that the South would have precipitated a war or at least a secession (that would lead the north to war) to avoid giving up the lucrative enterprise of slavery. If they hadn't seceded after Lincoln's election then they might well have seceded years or decades later once his anti-new-slave-state policies produced anti-slave political majorities. On the other hand, perhaps those decades would have led to a re-assessment of their organization of slaves and a reorganization into something more akin to the sharecropper system.\n \n I admit that it would be unlikely that the South would have taken the elimination of slavery lying down and most likely would have seceded once the North made any strong attempt at getting rid of slavery. Also, I doubt that the North would have allowed slavery to continue indefinitely. There was just too much momentum against it and we were one of the only countries left that still supported it.

   "Right, slavery was literally the number 1 issue of the time and heavily caused the secession and civil war. \"States rights\" was just a made up issue after the fact and no on really believed that.\n\n It seems that you are trying to force an either/or scenario in that you think that one can say that either secession caused the civil war or slavery caused the civil war. I continue to claim that BOTH caused the civil war. The issue of slavery caused secession which, in turn, caused the civil war. Secession was not the only option that the slave states had to the election of Lincoln and the eventual threat that posed to slavery. It was just the only option they found palatable at the time. As Winston Smith said, and as I have heard on various History Channel programs, before the Civil War, the federal government wasn't nearly as strong as it is today and most people felt more of an allegance to their state than to the country. States had more rights and more sovereignty than they do today, so the idea of secession was not just made-up but a real political reality.",
