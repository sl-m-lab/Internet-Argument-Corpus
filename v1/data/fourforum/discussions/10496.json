Seems to me that if they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at all then they pretty much qualify as Christian, and the rest is just detail.\n \n Is that the only reason you feel they aren't Christian, or is there more?\n\n \n \n As was stated by Jo, Mormons view Jesus as something different than what's mentioned in the 'Christian' bible they also believe in.\n \n J.W's believe that Jesus is the Archangel Michael, also something different than what they bible states.\n Of course, they believe the standard (common) bible to have been corrupted and thus have their own version.\n \n Word of Faith calls upon Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit at length but pretty much deny the soverignity of them, stating, in effect, God/Jesus can do NOTHING without human permission and that they are also bound (by covenant) to give you what you want provided you follow certain formulaic practices.\n Basically, Jesus is a cosmic genie and all you need to do is rub his lamp properly to get your wishes.\n \n For all these faiths, the centuries old beliefs in who the Christ was is reinterpreted to be something new(ish). \n \n While some may try to lay claim that they're following ancient belief systems on Christ by those initially in opposition to the church then, fact of the matter is not much of those competing faith systems exist intact today.\n Many will state that WofF is gnostic, and in practice they appear to be so but, in reality there's no proof that todays form of gnosticism resembles the form of nearly 2000 years ago founded by Thomas.\n \n Much like pagans who follow a Celtic system/ pantheon. Todays believers pretty much have to fill in laerge holes in the belief and find alternatives to some practices simply because the Celtic system didn't survive the test of time intact. And some practices would be outlawed. \n \n As many know, religions are dynamic and regardless of what believers claim change over time too.\n Think of people who are enamoured with 'that old time religion' or 'things were better in the 1950's' mentality. Dispising what today has to offer and living in a romanticized past that really doesn't reflect the reality of those times.\n \n I'm sure those and many other reasons exist for why people follow a NRM (new religious movement). I know in my area, many pagan/ new agers typically are ex-catholics seeking something more personal, something that focuses on the self rather than the whole, something that makes them feel special. Something they can adapt to their own personalities.\n Others today may still wish to cling to some form of their root faiths but still want that, thus evangelicalism and emotion based pentecostalism.\n \n When Mormonism started, while me may scoff at it and wonder how people could buy into something so nonsensical, people always want something different and something with purpose. A new LDS book appears and answers some questions the new world posed that basic Christianity didn't. Toss in polygamy (that the OT bible seemed to support) toss on a charismatic and dynamic leadership with a strong vision and moral compass in those times of (percieved) lawlessness and you get a decent base that later blossoms from a cult into an accpetable religion with strong roots in one area of the world that they carved out themselves.\n \n When the JW's were formed, the world was being inundated with new technologies and ways of doing things. Change brings dissociation for some who reach out to cling to something stable. A new movement that seeks to follow basic Christian principles such as meekness and pacifism while predicting the end of the world (esp after seeing the unadulterated face of conflict in WWI) just right around the corner.\n Couple that with a mild mannered approach to bring the faith to all vie personal evangelism and going door to door and you have something appealing.\n \n Pentecostalism also started around the same time. Using the ideals that if Christianity was to be spread to Jew and Gentile then it didn't matter what race you were, God loves all and Jesus died for everyone. So, mixed race congregations were a radical departure for most then, especially in the face of rampant racism. God was personal and miracles (even if counterfeited) were something God wants his followers to experience every day as part of the signs and wonders.\n \n WofF spring boards off of that but takes it to personal reward in this life with the same covenant Abraham is said to have...one that brought him financial abundance and prosperity.\n When dealing with most people, they will ALWAYS say they could 'use a little more'. Imagine being brought up from poverty or having your debts erased. Imagine having all troubles removed (even ones you cause yourself) from your life. They promise all this and more.\n \n \n \n And while I, as a non-believer, see that many such beliefs can be and often are damaging and have manipulative practices ingrained into them, I also know that they are composed of a wide variety of people both ingnorant and intelligent.\n I've experienced a lot of different events.\n From those who have preached about violence against their enemies to those who are very accepting.\n \n I once went to this black Oneness Pentecostal church for a few weeks with my youngest son out of curiousity. It was a Forest Gump experience ;)\n They were some of the nicest, most accpeting people I have ever met. And while the pastor was tripping over himself in a theological sense trying to push a 'Jesus only non-trinitary' message, he at least was doing so with questions and answers for the followers who certainly gave him a run for his money with questions backed up with scripture that he really couldn't answer. So I saw honesty there. My thinking is he was trying to be a big dawg with T.D. Jakes whom he named dropped often and most likely had financial arrangements with but wasn't quite up to pimp standards yet...he was trying to get the congregation to pay for a bigger, newer church away from being across the street from the 'projects'.\n But, the members were very welcoming. I experienced no racism and my son was welcome with open arms by the children there who played with him as an equal.\n \n I also have been to the less passive types of churches where, I'm pretty much running for the doors afterwards and simply say 'peace be with you' to those who block my path as I dodge past them.\n \n I've had a JW visit the house for close to 2 years on and off who discussed theology with the wife as I passively sat there playing a video game or something. It was probably the only time my wife was somewhat articulate on religion.\n \n I've known Mormons who try to live a simple moral life and those who've a history of doing lines of cocaine...yet still plan to go do their missionary work.\n \n I've known pagans who are litterally kooks. And I've known those with a decent grounding in reality and college educations. One of my gaming friends is an Egyptian oriented pagan who happens to be a drill sgt in the Army...another one was a pseudo-chaplain for pagans when he was in the army. \n \n Also here, we see a wide variety of athiests. From those who know exactly what the various religions entail to those who simply seem to make stuff up or perpetuate myths and stereotypes.\n \n Just like politics, what I'd believe to be nonsensical is somehow embrassed and useful by another.\n I think psychology has more to do with these choices than not.\n \n One of the things I find interesting about these forums and life is that 2 people can nod in agreement like bobble headed dolls on one topic and them seem to want to kill each other on other issues.",

The Gospels is one of the best ways to hide their agenda by calling it God's will. The Arians had significant secular power during the later part of Rome. What better way to destroy any possibility of them or others from gaining power by specifically putting emphasis on parts that deem them heretics? That's brilliant. In some ways it is similar to putting in writing in a Constitution that bans a competing group or ideology.

The Crusades are one of the better examples of the Pope using religion to essentially take secular power. \n \n \nIt is of course helpful to you to make out that the compilation of the Bible was a political power grab rather than an honest attempt to record humanity's encounters with God.\n\n \n Honest attempt? Hasn't several thousand years of history taught you that humans will use whatever they can to screw their opponents and consolidate power? I'm not saying that the book itself is entirely wrong or a tool, but to believe that there was no part or action deliberately done to eliminate competing Christian ideologies is just ignorant.

Even if you follow 99%, that last 1% would be enough to disqualify you.\n \n Granted, all this is according to the widely accepted, extremely popular and abundant Christian bible that we all know about.\n \n Christ taught the triune nature of God that he stated he was apart of.\n He taught on mercy, love and compassion as well as to seek forgiveness and to offer it.\n He taught on the power of faith.\n He taught of His sacrifice for sin.\n He taught to avoid many types of immorality and unethical behaviors.\n He taught many other things too.\n \n You can accept those beliefs and yet not practice them and be labled a Christian...but, probably not a good one or even one damned to hell...\n \n You can follow most of them yet not believe in them...you'd still not be a 'Christian'. Sounds odd but it isn't. You can believe in the power of faith, avoid immoral actions and practice charity, mercy, compassion and love and be an athiest or even a Muslim.\n \n This is almost how the thousands of permutations of the christian faith start. Someone (often a preacher) starts with the generic base and then adds on personal interpretations and revelations. Sometimes their own beliefs become popular and start a religious branch of their own named after them. \n For example, Calvinism (Monargism (sp)) is pretty common and is based mostly on the expanded teachings of John Calvin. They use many verses to support their beliefs and in the logic of faith, they sound plausible. But, when ever contradicting verses are pushed forward to counter these beliefs (Armeniaism (sp)) they'll dismiss them as not applicable to TRU believers. But, in the end, that branch is labled Calvinism...not Christianity even though they say they follow Christ, they do so through the interpretations of Calvin.\n \n I understand what Obvious is pushing. That conflicting beliefs on Christ existed in the distant past and that over time, those beliefs were removed. By violence, conversion or, simply faded into obscurity as their followers failed to breed. (Kinda like the quakers...or was it shakers...who don't believe in breeding. There's even the old Russian sect (Kopsiesomething-or-other(sp)) who practiced self mutilation of the genitalia including amputation...can't breed doing that...and can't get many converts either).\n One idea is that any TRU belief sponsored by God would be able to stand the test of time...because God would want it too. So, any competing belief that was slaughtered out...obviously didn't have the backing on the Lord. Can I get an amen here!?!",

Even if you follow 99%, that last 1% would be enough to disqualify you.\n \n Granted, all this is according to the widely accepted, extremely popular and abundant Christian bible that we all know about.\n\n \n Better question: Who gets to call someone else a Christian and not a Christian? \n \n \nChrist taught the triune nature of God that he stated he was apart of.\n He taught on mercy, love and compassion as well as to seek forgiveness and to offer it.\n He taught on the power of faith.\n He taught of His sacrifice for sin.\n He taught to avoid many types of immorality and unethical behaviors.\n He taught many other things too.\n \n You can accept those beliefs and yet not practice them and be labled a Christian...but, probably not a good one or even one damned to hell...\n\n \n I don't know about the Triune God part but the rest perhaps.\n \n \nYou can follow most of them yet not believe in them...you'd still not be a 'Christian'. Sounds odd but it isn't. You can believe in the power of faith, avoid immoral actions and practice charity, mercy, compassion and love and be an athiest or even a Muslim.\n\n \n Of course. my point is that if one does not accept Christ as a Triune God or God but follows the rest that they are less of a Christian then someone who does accept Christ but ignores the rest of his teachings. That may make them a bad Christian but more of a Christian then the noble, self sacrificing moral atheist. \n \n \nnot Christianity even though they say they follow Christ, they do so through the interpretations of Calvin.\n\n \n But what exactly is Christianity? Is today's even comparable to the Christianity of the 300 ADs? \n \n \nOne idea is that any TRU belief sponsored by God would be able to stand the test of time...because God would want it too. So, any competing belief that was slaughtered out...obviously didn't have the backing on the Lord. Can I get an amen here!?!\n\n \n So your argument is essentially might make right? Does that mean the Islamic Conquests had God on their side and that the conquered Jews and Christians didn't? This creates several problems. And if we go with the test of time, which is more or less a fallacy in that survival = true, then Animism is the true religion.\n \n IMO, the true belief is one that is inherent, that does not require teaching that can be obtained independently of any one else. If it was inherently true, why would you need to be taught to know it?",

   "What the Mormon Missionaries Won't Tell You\n \n Most of us have had a Mormon Missionary knock at our door. If you have ever invited them in and listened to a presentation of their beliefs, you probably found most but not all of what they said very similar to those beliefs held by Christians. However, while trying to convince you that your Church is wrong and the Mormon Church is right, there are several points they intentionally leave out. Below is a list of Mormon beliefs the missionaries will be reluctant to tell you about<b></b>:\n \n They will be reluctant to tell you that the God they worship was not always God.\n \"We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see.\" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pg. 345)\n \n They will be reluctant to tell you that they believe Jesus Christ is the spirit brother of Satan:\n \"The appointment of Jesus to be the Savior of the world was contested by one of the other sons of God. He was called Lucifer, son of the morning. Haughty, ambitious, and covetous of power and glory, this spirit-brother of Jesus desperately tried to become the Savior of mankind.\" (Milton R. Hunter, Gospel Through the Ages, pg.15)\n \n They will be reluctant to tell you that, according to Mormonism, Jesus Christ was a polygamist.\n \"I discover that some of the Eastern papers represent me as a great blasphemer, because I said, in my lecture on Marriage, at our last Conference, that Jesus Christ was married at Cana of Galilee, that Mary, Martha, and others were his wives, and that he begat children.\" (Orson Hyde, Journal of Discourses 2:210)\n \n The grand reason of the burst of public sentiment in anathemas upon Christ and his disciples, causing his crucifixion, was evidently based upon polygamy, according to the testimony of the philosophers who rose in that age. A belief in the doctrine of a plurality of wives caused the persecution of Jesus and his followers. We might almost think they were 'Mormons'\" (Jedediah M. Grant, Journal of Discourses, 1:346)\n \n They will be reluctant to tell you that for at least half a century church leaders were teaching that Adam was really God and the only God with whom we have to do.\n \"Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth, Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is Michael, the Archangel, the Ancient of Days! about whom holy men have written and spoken--He is our Father, and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.\" (Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 1:50)\n \n \"I have learned by experience that there is but one God that pertains to this people and he is the god that pertains to this earth--The first man. That first man sent his own son to redeem the world...\"(Heber C. Kimball, Journal of Discourses 4:1)\n \n They will be reluctant to tell you that Brigham Young, who held the office of President of the Mormon church longer than any other man, taught that men must practice polygamy in order to become Gods.\n \"The only men who become Gods, even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy.\" (Journal of Discourses 11:269)",

   "Is Mormon a form of Christianity or not. Why?\n\n \n The Mormons are polytheist, as Joseph Smith, the founder, said that he saw the Father in His own angelic body, standing next to the Son, who also stood in His own angelic body.\n \n It seems that the Lord has no problem using the words \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" to describe Himself, in that He doesn't force a monotheist view of Himself, but allows some people to still imagine more than one god.\n \n Even the \"orthodox trinitarians,\" who are somewhat proud that they worship \"one God in three persons,\" are entertaining a form of polytheist thought. How can one avoid this, if the Lord says \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit?\"\n \n So it is providence that the Lord draws in monotheists as well as people who are basicly polytheist, and all gets them to confess the Jesus Christ is Divine at once. Jesus Christ's name will fill the whole earth, but there will still be people who interpret \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" as one, and people who see that as somehow more than one. Indeed, there is pluralism in the Bible, mostly a plural of two or three, but the pluralism is of good and truth and the activity therefrom, not of persons in the godhead.\n \n As for \"marriage in heaven\" and the \"three heavens\" doctrines, it appears that Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons, stole that from Emanuel Swedenborg, the writer of doctrine for the New Church.",

Let me just add to the 3 in 1 understanding of who God is. First off, John 1:1 perfectly shows that  \n IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n Jhn 1:2 \n He was in the beginning with God.\n Jhn 1:3 \n All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.\n Jhn 1:4 \n In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\n Jhn 1:5 \n And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend[fn1] it. \n \n If Jesus was a separate person from God, verse 1 would say \"and the Word was A God.\" \n \n I liken it to man who was made in Gods image. We have bodies, spirits and souls, yet we are one being. A type of 3 in 1 just as God is with Jesus who took on the flesh, the Holy Spirit which indwells believers and the Father who is the soul and God head of the Trinity.\n \n Your breakdown of what Mormons believe is very accurate though and is a polygamous belief system at its roots and foundation.",
