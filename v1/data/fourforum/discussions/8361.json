   "The Steamboat Pilot\n Tensions run high in forest \n Forest Service abandons checkpoint after incident with Rainbow group \n \n By Matt Stensland \n \n Wednesday, June 21, 2006 \n \n CLARK - The Rainbow Family peace gathering turned hostile Tuesday when a group of attendees began hurling rocks and sticks at law enforcement officers, U.S. Forest Service officials said. \n \n http://media.steamboatpilot.com/drudge/37737.html\n \n Apparently it is ok for peace protestors to use force, but no one else. The people who always tell us that violence never solved anything turn to rock throwing at law enforcement officers the moment they are angered.",
