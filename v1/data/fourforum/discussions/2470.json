   "In order for you to understand why, I think it's important to look at who a believer is. A believer, in my opinion, must have some understanding of what they believe in. They have gone through some circumstance(s) during their life literally forcing them to recognize that there is something else out there than just the physical things. At first it may have not been much, just a flicker, a fleeting glimpse of the spiritual world &#8211; maybe a revelation (not the melodramatic, Hollywood variety) of some kind. Sometimes they change immediately, sometimes over a period of years, but change is inevitable. They may not want to see it, but it is so evident that they can&#8217;t dismiss it. That person comes to believe in the spiritual things of life; that there is more out there than just 70 or so years and you turn to dust.\n \n Personally, it was a fight. I refused to believe that if a person was not looking for God, then God just turned his back and that was it. That was about ten years ago. I didn&#8217;t need God, didn&#8217;t want Him, really. But, circumstances, problems, troubles, and despair seemed to just come upon me like a bad storm, and for no apparent reason. I wondered what was going on. Why all this junk at one time? To keep it short and to the point, God knew that the evil spirits were wanting me to turn my life completely over to them. They knew that if they got me, they could get my loved ones, or at least some of them. That&#8217;s when I let go of the natural things I knew of and prayed. God answered, led me through some very difficult times and began showing me what His intentions were. It became clear that there was a God.\n \n That change caused many friends to question my sanity. Even now they hesitate to drop by or even call. But, that&#8217;s the way it is, I guess. I&#8217;m not the only one.\n \n If you met me you&#8217;d never guess I am a Christian just by talking or working or hunting or having a good time. I have learned in this forum and others that I am forced into a bracket because of certain others that have proclaimed to be Christians and I hate it, but, again, I&#8217;ll have to live with it.\n \n The short of it is that I believe because what I have personally seen, spiritually, and through the changes that have came about due to that spiritual insight.",

I'm sure you have heard the saying that an infinite amount of monkeys typing for an infinite amount of time will eventually result in a Shakespeare being written. That same principle can go towards how life can evolve in the infinite universe. It would be almost inevitable. Also assuming the universe is never ending you could come to the conclusion that the very existence of something that large is impossible based on our knowledge and understanding of physics. That would go to show how little we really understand about physics at all and therefore make it difficult for us to really even begin to guess at how an infinitely large object came into being in the first place or even how time came into existence since there had to be a point where time didn't exist at all. God is an easy explanation because that covers our lack of understanding about the universe and how we came to be but it still leaves open the question as to how he came to be. That question is no less relevant than asking how time or the universe was formed as it deals with our lack of understanding of how such an event can happen.\n \n While this is a reason to believe that the formation of the universe without God is possible the real reason I do not believe in God is because humans have always made up Gods to believe in throughout time and we now dismiss them as being incorrect while for some reason ours is the one true God. Had Christianity and Judaism been created on some small island and never expanded beyond that point they would be considered irrelevant right now and we would all be praising some other God right now and all be just as sure as we are today that this is the one true God (or multiple Gods if polytheistic). So human nature and the strange way in which religion is passed from person to person is the reason I don't believe God exists. God would have created a better system than this.\n \n One reason I can find myself believing in God however is the fact that Israel is the chosen land of Gods people, the US helped form Israel and has protected it since that day, and as a result against all odds Israel still stands today and its protector is the strongest nation on Earth while its enemies the Arabs, Russia, and in some ways Europe (land of babel) have all failed. I'm sure there are logical reasons to explain this but I think it could be debated that divine intervention could have helped this along.\n \n As you can see I am on the fence as to whether I believe in God or not. I see many reasons for both sides of the argument but most of the evidence points to God not existing in my view. Still I will continue to look for new reasons to either support or debunk my current stance.\n \n \nA question I always wanted to ask. If you don't believe in God, how can you have any hope in life? When something bad happens, don't you feel completely alone? What do you look forward to?\n\n \n Why wouldn't you have hope in life? I have hope in life because I am able to live it. I don't tend to focus solely on what will happen after this life and therefore am able to be happy and hopeful right now. I doubt that as a believer you have hope in life for any different reason than I do as a non-believer. Hope in life really has little to do with whether the afterlife involves this God or that God at least in my view.\n \n When something bad happens it is natural to hold someone else responsible as well as look for a solution to the problem. God is there for both of those reasons in the case of death and many other bad things. So without God there is really no one to blame or ask for a solution to the problem therefore I can understand why it is hard to cope with bad events as a non-believer. It is part of human nature that causes this. This is still not a reason to believe in God in the long run although it is alright for a short term reason to believe in him or at least to want to believe in him.\n \n I look forward to tomorrow and the day after that. I don't really worry to much about how things will be after I die. Again, I can't see how anyone would live only thinking about the afterlife and just letting their present life slip away without noticing it. Perhaps some people do this but I cannot put myself in those shoes. I have no trouble living day to day and enjoying this life regardless as to how I came to be. I'm not really sure why one might view this has difficult or hard to understand. Even back when I did really believe in God I generally just lived my life as I wanted to and didn't think that my life had purpose simply because I believed in God. I believed my life had purpose just because I was alive the same way I do now.",

If you don't believe in God, how can you have any hope in life? When something bad happens, don't you feel completely alone? What do you look forward to?\n\n \n AMD4EVER did a nice job responding, but I'd like to add a couple things.\n \n The magnificence of the world as justification for God theory is one I have hard time with. It's a chicken and egg proposition. It implies too many constants. Was everything just right to get to where we are now, or did everything \"evolve\" simultaneously in order to maintain the most beneficial possible equilibrium for all things involved? Could all the struggles not be part of maintaining this natural equilibrium? \n \n I find it just as hard to believe that some being just \"snapped his fingers\" and everything was. It is completely illogical and counterintuitive, as unfathomable to me as my trust in the natural realm is to you. It's a leap in faith and logic I can't make. \n \n I find it interesting that both sides of this argument make the assertion that the other side is using belief/non-belief as a means to rid themselves of personal responsibility, or \"living right\". One side does it because they feel it's right, the other does it because God tells them too and to reach the carrot being dangled in front of them. Which is more virtuous?\n \n I don't really understand your final questions. \n \n Is God the only source of hope in your life? Is going to heaven your only source of hope? Is that what you live for?\n \n I have hope based on knowing that the sun will come up tomorrow and it'll be a new day, a day filled with nothing but hope. I have hope because I know I have friends and family all around me. I have hope because I believe in myself, and in my ability to always be better, and I believe in mankind, that we will always get better.\n \n Why would someone feel alone simply because they don't believe in God? Why only when something bad happens?\n \n Like I said, I'm surrounded by friends and family. People I can talk too, people that TALK BACK. People I can physically interact with. I'm far from alone. Good or bad, they are there. I also have myself, and I'm a firm believer in personal responsibility. In many cases, I AM alone in the responsibility for the good and bad in my life, I freely accept that. I don't feel the need to comiserate with a God.\n \n I look forward to living each new day of this life to its fullest. I don't need anything more than that to be happy. No offense, but I actually kinda pity people that require something beyond this life in order to be satisfied in it or to give it meaning.\n \n Waxy",
