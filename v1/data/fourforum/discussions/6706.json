Who was the President who freed the slaves? Yep! Abraham Lincoln, who was a REPUBLICAN!! And which party supported civil rights legislation? Yep, you guessed it! Republicans.\n\n The Democrats of the \"Solid South\" were hardly liberal. At the time the only path to an elected office was through the Democtratic Party and all aspiring politicians belonged to that party. As the Republican party's strength increased, many of those Democrats, including many who had supported segregation, switched parties and became Republicans.\n Robert Byrd was not the \"Grand Wizard of the KKK\".

By Kelly Snell:\n Lincoln's views on race were motivated and influenced greatly by his own political ambitions. Though Lincoln was a \"political\" abolitionist his personal views of the Negro question prevented him from adhering to the views of the moral abolitionists. The main influence driving Lincoln's desire to liberate the slaves was political and his fist priority was to preserve the \"great experiment.\" Lincoln's attempt to ban the expansion of slavery was for the benefit of the superior whites and was not a first step towards Negro liberation and suffrage. On the eve of the war of secession Lincoln viewed the slaves as a labor force that was essential to the southern resistance. \n Lincoln was not interested in direct intervention within the slave states, he saw slavery as a political hot potato and Lincoln was merely adhering to republican politics. He made the remark that if he could save the Union and not free slaves he would, he also stated that if he could save the union and free all slaves or even just a few he would (Hattaway & Jones, How, 270). When he did express a hatred of the expansion of the \"peculiar institution\" in the Lincoln Douglas debates he said nothing about the abolition of the south's beloved institution. By avoiding the issue of liberation he could secure the support of non abolitionists and not risk losing the anti-slavery vote. One of the foundations of the Republican Party was free soil and labor opportunities for whites; the prevention of the expansion of slavery was one of the methods to accomplish this. Lincoln took it as his duty to hold to the party principles.\n \n Dono",

The issue of slavery was not a conservative versus liberal issue in the sense of those terms today.
