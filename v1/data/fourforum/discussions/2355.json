Also I wonder if VP cheney still has any thing to do with Halloburton I'm sure he is still has his say in it.And getting the piece of the pie. The sad thing about it is I saw on TV this woman the next town over from me has a boyfriend who is working for a contractor has been missing ever since that ambush took place about a month ago nobody will give her any answers on his were abouts.",

   "I don't believe that military contractors have any business policing Iraq. That should be something that the military is in control of.\n I really haven't looked into why any private contractors were involved in the prison, unless it is the fact that they would be able to interview prisoners in a different manner than the military could, as they are private citizens.\n The military has it's own police force, so surely they wouldn't need outside help in this matter.\n I noticed Rumsfeld apoligized for the way this thing was handled. Apoligies are fine,but I don't think he was sincere. He also mentioned that he was responsible, as it happened under his watch.\n So if he is indeed responsible, what should be done about it? This is more than an isolated incident.\n Information on prisoner mistreatment has been circulating since the first of Janurary. I just can't imagine that he is just hearing about this. Surely someone said something about it to him.\n If he is indeed just learning about it, it seems we have a very secretive chain of command in place in Iraq.\n This incident seems to have more questions than answers at this point.\n Rumsfelds apology might not be enough to satisfy the the American public.",

   "America has been using mercenaries all over the world for years.

This is something the army has discussed publicly before, so I am not slinging any nasty here. TEh \"quality\" of recruit in the modern army is pretty low. A lot of them join up because hey can't get a decent job anywhere else. IF we actually paid them, we could maybe solve this problem, but for the most part, people who are worth a damn are not lining up for $1000 per month and a tract house in the middle of nowhere. I am not saying this is the case with all new recruits, but the Army in particular has been pretty vocal in the past about needing to raise the quality of their recruits.\n \n There is a problem with running a volunteer army, especially one like ours where they will take baout any non felon with a pulse. Not everybody is cut out to be a soldier. Some people who really like the idea of the thing are simply not good at it and never will be. I really like to draw, I absolutly suck at it. I have even taken art classes, and still suck. Generally, peple who go to work for PMC's are natural born soldiers. YOu do not make a soldier by teaching people to march in a straight line, or by teaching them to yell \"YES SIR\" really lound. THis is what you do instead of having natural born soldiers, you try to build dicipline in them so they will follow orders made by people who either ARE natural soldiers, oor by people who have studied them enough to be able to fake it. SOme people are just really good at it, they never loose their head, never give up, and naturally posess skills that are useful in combat situations.\n \n YOu also have a LOT of plausable deniability when using mercenaries. THe first rule of a captured mercenary is \"Thou shalt not point your finger and yell \"THE CIA IS PAYING FOR ALL THIS\". A professional soldier gets caught torturing somebody, or killing civilians, the US can shrug and say \"never heard of the guy\". It is a lot harder to do this with a guy in a US uniform.\n \n MOst of the guys currently in Iraq are not really involving themselves in combat situations that much, though they may want to consider using htem in some of the cities where there are uprisings (since any of the guys who have seen action in Africa or the middle east before have seen a LOT more urban combat than anybody in the US military). Realistically, theya re not being paid very well. In rawanda, $1000 per day was considered a pretty decent wage. In Sierra Leone, $800 was about average, but you had looting and pillaging privelage when it came to the enemy, and since the rebels were often being paid in diamonds, this was pretty lucrative.\n \n \n By comparison, $400 per day is about average for what they are bein offered in Iraq.
