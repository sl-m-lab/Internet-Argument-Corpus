   "Finally, a governor who makes good on his promises to cut welfare.\n =================================\n \n A new direction for Missouri\n The Kansas City Star ^ | May 29, 2005 | Kit Wagar\n \n From fewer patients on Medicaid to less regulation of your electricity bill, Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt is making good on his promise of a government that does less.\n \n In the legislative session that just ended, social services and mental health programs shrank, economic development funding was cut and higher-education spending dropped. Many programs, including education programs at three prisons and management of motor vehicle offices, will be taken over by private contractors or volunteers - or eliminated entirely.\n \n Power companies will be able to pass their fuel costs to customers without seeking approval from state regulators. And insurance companies will no longer have to worry that complaints about their underwriting practices or refusal to pay claims will be available to the public.\n \n For advocates of mental health programs and social services, the change in state government since Blunt took office in January has been stunning.\n \n \"The expectations have changed,\" said Kirsten Dunham, associate policy director for Paraquad Inc., a St. Louis group that lobbies for the disabled. \"It's become a triage approach. We have to determine what services really are life and death and try to preserve those.\"\n \n The health-care cuts are merely the most visible and emotional changes in a far-reaching new approach to government.\n \n Mark Rushefsky, a political scientist at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield, said the new policies represent a move away from the idea of shared action to deal with common concerns, whether for the poor and disabled or for consumers generally. They are steps toward what President Bush calls \"the ownership society.\"\n \n \"The ownership society means you're on your own,\" Rushefsky said. \"It is moving away from the idea of collective responsibility for health care or income maintenance. You see this in the private sector with the decline in private pensions.\"\n \n The result, he said, is an increase in the average person's risk as both public and private programs are unraveled.\n \n \"The future will be more uncertain as people rely more on their own resources,\" Rushefsky said. \"On Medicaid, Blunt is out there in front. But his overall policy reflects a reduction of the safety-net philosophy.\"\n \n Sen. Delbert Scott, a Lowry City Republican, said the new approach represented the biggest change in Missouri government in 20 years. New laws to limit lawsuits and cap damage awards, new restrictions on workers' compensation claims and the reductions in Medicaid will combine to encourage greater self-reliance, he said.\n \n Dependence on government has become so widespread, he said, that even suburban areas have large numbers of people on Medicaid, which is supposed to help the poor.\n \n \"The general public is outraged,\" Scott said, \"by able-bodied people taking advantage of Medicaid, especially when it's a multigenerational thing.\"\n \n Republicans in the legislature have been itching to make many of the changes for years, he said. But they backed off because former Gov. Bob Holden, a Democrat, would veto them.\n \n The 2004 election not only put a Republican in the governor's office for the first time in 12 years, but also increased the Republican majority in the House and Senate, giving the GOP control over all three power centers for the first time since 1922.\n \n Blunt responded with an aggressive agenda to downsize Missouri government.\n \n After expanding health-care programs for the poor, the disabled and moderate-income children from 1998 to 2001, Missouri trimmed services in recent years. But when lawmakers this year voted to eliminate health-care coverage for 90,604 low-income persons beginning July 1 and to raise out-of-pocket costs for 15,723 elderly and disabled persons, it was an abrupt change in direction.\n \n The effect on social service advocates was most apparent in the battle to preserve Medicaid coverage for the disabled. Under current law, disabled people qualify with income up to the federal poverty level, or $798 a month.\n \n House Republicans proposed dropping the maximum income to 74 percent of the poverty level, or $590 a month.\n \n The final budget set the limit at 85 percent of poverty, or $678 a month. Advocates rejoiced that several thousand people would retain medical coverage. But they recognized how low their expectations had become.\n \n \"Why are we being thankful for these little crumbs?\" asked Pam Schantz Rich of Citizens for Missouri's Children. \"We need to make things right with the health-care delivery system in this state. The system simply needs more revenue.\"\n \n Dunham, the Paraquad advocate, said those lowered expectations reflect the fact that Republicans will not support a tax increase.\n \n \"If we do have a responsibility to care for each other, paying taxes is an organized way to do that,\" Dunham said. \"But there is a lack of connection and a lack of appreciation that what happens to your neighbor does affect you. It may take these kinds of cuts before people become aware of that.\"\n \n Tennessee is the only other state this year that addressed the rising costs of health care by eliminating coverage for large numbers of people.\n \n Tennessee, which for years touted its TennCare program as a model for the nation, plans to end coverage for at least 225,000 people next year. Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen said his state could no longer afford an $8 billion program that covers 1.3 million people.\n \n Blunt used the same argument to justify reductions in Missouri's $5.8 billion program, which had grown to cover 1 million people.\n \n Laura Tobler, health policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said other states had taken steps to stretch their Medicaid dollars rather than reduce eligibility.\n \n They instituted small co-payments for Medicaid clients and froze fees to providers. They eliminated some optional services and capped the number of prescriptions or therapy sessions.\n \n In Kansas, no effort was made to reduce eligibility for Medicaid or to scale back programs for the disabled. The big debate was how to eliminate waiting lists for many Medicaid services.\n \n Former Missouri state Rep. Marsha Campbell of Kansas City, once the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, criticized Blunt's policies as a meat-ax approach to social services.\n \n Republicans, she said, have grossly underestimated the effect of their policies on hospitals, rural residents' access to health care and the long-term costs of moving people from home-based care to nursing homes.\n \n But others consider the changes more incremental than radical. According to Rick Hardy, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-Columbia and a former Republican candidate for Congress, the biggest difference is who has access to the governor.\n \n \"Government is not neutral,\" Hardy said. \"Outcomes represent the groups with access to government. Groups like the Farm Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce and small-business groups now have access. Groups like abortion-rights supporters, mental health advocates and social services don't have that effective access that they used to.\"\n \n Dunham, however, said Blunt could be blazing a path for conservatives in other states.\n \n \"Missouri is a laboratory,\" Dunham said. \"If Missouri gets away with these cuts, it will be a sign of what the public everywhere will accept.\"\n \n www.kcstar.com",

   "What happened in Missouri displayed some real idiocy, one of the primary functions of taxation is civil order and that doesn't mean throwing loonies out on the street or a wealthy society abandoning the disabled population. Look at California's sky high utility rates for an example of selective government intervention in commerce.\n \n I think Missouri's lame actions are symptomatic of declining tax bases in many states. Unlike commerce, which cuts operating overheads to maintain service/product on a declining revenue basis, government cuts services while generally retaining or increasing overheads. \n \n While part of declining state revenues can be attributed to federal reduction of social services to maintain and expand our bloated military expenditures, individual state tax bases and subsequently revenue are also experiencing the change from industrial to service economy accompanied by the fading dollar and inflation. \n \n My county received the results of a full audit by an outside, private firm and the operating disclosures are pointing right at disaster primarily due to civil service salary levels and benefits. Several prior members of the county commission were voted out in the last election because they favored cutting service levels while retaining existing staff levels and their overhead. Without going into specific numbers, the public here is becoming very upset because civil service is now about the best job around, has benefits far superior to any private industry in the state with a productivity level excepting the sheriffs department, according to the audit, rarely exceeding 50% of comparable job descriptions in private industry.\n \n I doubt Missouri's underlying problems are much different than ours, but the public flock of sheep there is still believing what their politicians tell them. And one thing about politicians anyone can always depend on is political interests being as far from public interests as anything can ever get. When the residential real estate bubble breaks, things will really get interesting at state, county and municipal tax levels.",

   "I don't live in Missouri any more having moved from there in 2001. I now live in Texas and the power rates are an issue. I'm debating over whether or not to move from TXU to Reliant. They promise a 10% reduction for a year and a $50 credit toward the first bill. My wife is reluctant to do so thinking back to all the aggravation of moving to a different long distance carrier. I keep thinking we should.\n \n Missouri's insurance rates are substantially less than in Texas. We are getting ripped off here. The real estate taxes are high but there is no state income tax. The total amount of taxes in Missouri and Texas are about the same after everything washes through the system. \n \n Missouri had a brain dead governor who was thrown out office in the last election; actually during the primaries. Ironically, his own brother used to be the contract attorney where I used to work. But the governor was a fool. This new governor is the son of Roy Blunt the U.S. House whip and is an up and comer. I sent this info on up to my friends in Missouri and I'll be interested in their take on these changes.\n \n I do know that medicaid costs have gotten completely out of hand, thanks to the Widow Carnahan who pushed through a lot of changes during her late husband's governorship. I said at the time that was insanity and have been proven correct. \n \n Mental health is an issue that will never go away. A significant number of people in any society are as crazy as a bedbug. But the larger problem is that they consume so much of societies resources to treat them and then they won't take their meds so they occupy an inordinately large amount of staff time, police time and hospital time when they inevitably are brought in for treatment. It is a merry go round and they never get off. When the liberals turned all of these nuts loose into regular society they created a monster; a bureaucratic nightmare, and a host of other problems and then they complain that the conservative politicans are being too stingy with tax money to support the lunacy that brought this about. But that's natural because liberals always believe that money grows on trees.",

I've heard this argument about a so-called \"living wage\" and have never been much impressed. A person can always change to a better job or move elsewhere if they have any gumption. During the Great Depression my father moved all over the United States and beyond to find employment. My uncle walked all the way from Madison, Wisconsin to Denver, Colorado to find work. My grandfather came to this country from Germany in the 1880s and only had the shirt on his back. He worked his way across the country to Wisconsin by working for others along the way. He, or any of his children (12 in all) never drew a dollar's worth of welfare in their lives. My father never even drew a day's worth of unemployment compensation although he was eligible for it. He said a person always should save in the good times to tide him over during the bad times. I've always felt a person is as poor as he believes he is. A person should always look to his own resources without running to the government for a handout.\n \n There are some things that could be done to find employment for the unemployed and the government could do it. We could have a nationwide database of available jobs and some kind of subsidy to provide temporary assistance for transportation and housing. The last thing we should do is to provide incentives for people to lay around at home seemingly helpless and dependent on government largesse.",
