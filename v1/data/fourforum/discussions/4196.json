   "Written in a frantic pace, to get all thoughts down, so excuse the grammar if you will\n \n THe mind is a cellar full of unlocked doors, musty and dark and gleaming with light, polished and new, and rusty and pocked. The trouble is finding where you belong, the spirit as an aimless wanderer inside the endless hallways, door upon door like an unlimited rubix cube, creating endless paths, looking for somewhere to settle down. When that path is finally found, the door opened, a new history created. Wandering inside itself like a bb in a 50 gallon barrel, endless in its blakcness, infinite in its light. Choose the side and switch at will. Emotions nothing but chemicals, thoughts nothing but electricity echoing its blue static spark in the endless halls of our brain, layer after layer of neaurons, made of atoms. We are nothing but machines of organic make, following pre-programed paths burned into our brain at the very beggining of its creation, the fire at tyhe end, waiting for new paths to burn, choosing at random, influenced by the world. Make your own paths, choose yourself. The ultimate being, can choose his own path. Even after death his soul lives on, creating endless worlds and bodies, never truly dying. All that we know is false, so why do we ytorture ourselves, simply because we cannot, somehow admit, that we control all. Change the impulses to your mind and anything is possible. COntrol emotions at will, control the world, gravity, speed, time itself. Chnage the physical 'reality' to your will. It is only a matter of time before i unlock this. The monks, frozen in the mountains, they achieved this. They are not dead, merely kliving on in their own world. Alone, yet surrounded by peoiple of their own making. This is life, nothing but spinning electromagnatism. Still a mystery, the incredible pull when electricity is induced to charged or uncharged ions, the destruction of the universe is held withing a single atom.",
