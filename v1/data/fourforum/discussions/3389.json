Jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil, and spent time, for the most part with the plebs.\n \n More specifically we have\n Acts 9:36\n In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas[ 9:36 Both Tabitha (Aramaic) and Dorcas (Greek) mean gazelle.] ), who was always doing good and helping the poor.\n Acts 10:31\n and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.\n 2 Corinthians 9:9\n As it is written: \"He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.\"[ 9:9 Psalm 112:9]\n \n Acts 8:9ff deals with someone who tried to buy the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and who was rejected.\n \n Acts 5:1ff deals with someone who tried to hog money, and who was struck down dead.\n \n Most telling for me was\n Acts 2:44 All the believers were together and had everything in common. 45 Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\n \n Common ownership of property is communism. Giving to those that need is very much alike \"From each, according to his ability; to each, according to his need.\"--Karl Marx\n \n The main difference with communism is the belief in it that man is by himself perfectible - that one day we'll attain some kind of man-made paradise here on earth. This idea, that we can do so without God is why I find no comfort with most commuist/socialist groups.",

   "God is neither a democrat or a republican, although I feel He frowns upon Liberal thought processes and morals..... One of many reasons that I will vote for Bush in this election.\n\n \n So God shares the same morality as you? What a surprise! If we took a world wide survey, I bet we'd find that most religious people believe the same thing, despite having widely different morals. To me, this just sounds like post-facto justification for what you've already decided. Not just you, of course, but most people who think that God thinks the same way they do.",

   "Which thought processes and morals are you talking about?\n\n Both Kerry and Edwards have a history of opposing judicial nominees over their religious convictions. That's funny because I heard Senator Kerry admit that he had some religious convictions of his own. When asked what his position on abortion is, Kerry responds that life begins at conception and that his personal beliefs should not keep him from serving as President because it does not influence his public policy record.\n However, both he and Senator Edwards have repeatedly refused to extend that same courtesy to countless judicial nominees who happen to be pro-life. For example, Leon Holmes, who was recently confirmed by the Senate, was attacked by Kerry and Edwards' Democratic colleagues because he holds private Christian beliefs -- and Kerry didn't do a thing to stand up for him. If Sen. Kerry is such a defender of the ability to harbor private beliefs without allowing them to impact public decisions, he sure has a funny way of showing it.\n Sen. Kerry's position on same-sex \"marriage\" has often been confusing and a bit non-committal when it came to civil unions versus same-sex \"marriage\" rights. But the blatant pro-homosexual rhetoric on his campaign website leaves no doubt that he not only opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment but that he'll do anything in his power to ensure that homosexuals receive protected class status above the rest of us -- even if it means destroying the institution of marriage. A line from Kerry's proclamation states: \"I am committed to using the power of the White House to advance equal rights for all Americans, including gay Americans.\"\n When asked, Kerry says he opposes same-sex \"marriage.\" I don't believe it. All you have to do is look at the people this presidential campaign has surrounded itself with to see what their administration will look like. When it comes to protecting marriage, a future with \"President Kerry\" looks pretty bleak.",

So if you don't go and lobby for all the homeless people, you have no right to try to fix this problem. You obviously don't care about poverty and homelessness. And you just said they were pro-life because of their Christian beliefs. That's different than having a religious belief but it not effecting your policies. Not only that, justices and judges shouldn't have strong opinions one way or the other. A president, senator, congressman should, that's the difference.\n \n \n\n Sen.

He said it should be for the states to decide, but didn't give his opinion. Of course neither did Cheany.\n \n But my question to you is why it is any threat to you whether gays get married or not? How will it effect you in any way shape or form if the gays are just living together or are \"married\". This won't effect me personally either but this is just one more example of the government denying rights to certain individuals because of tradition. It happened with blacks, and now with homosexuals.",
