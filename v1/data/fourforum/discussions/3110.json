   "http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_9604.shtml\n \n Here are a few of the important parts of the article.\n \n \"With just a week to go before the supposed \"transfer of power\" in Iraq, Washington has decided to unilaterally renew a decree granting its troops, as well as private American contractors, complete immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law.\"\n \n \"It is not an Iraqi entity, legitimate or not, that is going to grant US forces immunity, but rather Washington's colonial proconsul. Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) chief Paul Bremer is to renew Order 17, which the CPA promulgated a year ago. That order, placing all US military and civilian personnel beyond the reach of Iraq law, was written to apply only \"during the period of authority of the CPA,\" which is formally set to expire on June 30.\"\n \n \"The reimposition of a blanket immunity for the 138,000 US troops and the thousands of security contractors in Iraq constitutes a warning that even greater atrocities are to come in a counterinsurgency campaign that has already claimed the lives of thousands of civilians. At the same time, revelations of the torture and killing of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison and other US-run detention facilities in Iraq have given Washington grounds for concern that its personnel could face criminal prosecution under Iraqi statutes.\"\n \n \n \"Recently, when one of the contractors assigned to interrogations at the Abu Ghraib prison was charged with raping a teenage boy incarcerated there, the US occupation authority took the position that no legal action could be taken against him and referred the matter to his employer \"\n \n \"The possibility that US occupation troops could be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court is, in any event, remote, because neither the US nor Iraq are signatories to the treaty establishing the ICC. Iraq never signed it. Washington did so under the Clinton administration, but the Bush administration took the extraordinary step of renouncing the treaty, claiming that the body could be used to carry out \"politically motivated\" trials of US troops or government officials for war crimes.\"\n \n \n Why would the US government need to give its people immunity to war crimes unless they were planning on commiting them?",
