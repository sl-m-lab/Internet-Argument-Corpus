   "Sound the siren: Matt Drudge has lost a long-time advertiser in the wake of last week's groundless report alleging that Sen. John Kerry had an extramarital affair with a 27-year-old woman. \n \n AT&T Wireless has pulled all advertising from the Drudge Report in response to a complaint about its sponsorship of the site. \n \n \"We care about the places our on-line ads appear, and that site doesn't reflect the values of AT&T Wireless,\" e-mailed Jeremy Pemble, the company's vice president of public relations. \n \n Matt Drudge earns $1.2 million a year from advertising and his weekly radio show, selling a single banner ad for $4,400 a day, according to a September 2003 story in the Miami Herald. \n \n THE REST OF THE ARTICLE\n \n http://www.drudge.com/2004/20040219.htm\n \n Finally, someone takes a financial stand against this kind of journalism. Good going AT&T!",
