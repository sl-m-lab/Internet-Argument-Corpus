   "Oh I understand what you said, perhaps better than you do, unless you're being intentionally deceitful.\n \n You're wrong Montalban, you used reason, and I clearly showed how. You imply reason requires 100% certainty, it does not, so your argument is lost. I realize you WANT to make faith somehow useful and \"like science\", but alas.\n \n You you can even test this, I'm surprised you made a mistake in responding the way you did. I even tested this already for you, but I'll do it again since you obviously missed it or didn't understand it.\n \n ==============================\n Montalban: I used \"faith\" to make my decision to believe what my mother says.\n ==============================\n \n So, if your mother says \"Montalban, I saw godzilla last night for real (the 60ft fire breating monster that stomps japan for fun)\"\n \n You must believe her if you used faith.\n \n You could however, use reason, to determine that it's most likely that she did not see godzilla, and is either making a joke, or suffered some mental mishap.\n \n So which is it gonna be:\n Faith: \"Belief without evidence\", or \"Belief in a divine being\"\n OR\n Reason: (as shown above).\n \n Faith by definiton, is a belief without evidence, or a belief in a divine being (which can have no evidence).\n \n What exactly did you have faith in dear Montalban? You're mother is always correct? Obviously not, since I assume you think she didn't actually see Godzilla. So you didn't have faith after all.\n ==============================\n \n Now, if you say again you used both reason AND faith, and that this somehow saves you from making a mistake, well, it doesn't. Let's use your logic:\n \n - We are testing if these two [drugs] had an impact on the [health of the patient].\n We used two [drugs]\n 1. A placebo (not actually a drug per se)\n 2. A new chemical that we think can cure this infection.\n \n We tested the [patients] with both [drugs] at the same time. Our results showed strong evidence that the patient's infections were cured 85% by this combination of drugs.\n \n We conclude that a placebo, combined with this new chemical, cures infections, using Montalban's inadequate logic.\n \n You see, I could replace any mumbo jumbo made up stuff and replace the placebo with it. Then by your logic, we could prove anything has an effect on anything else IN COMBINATION with something that actually works (you know, logical AND) \n \n Nice try. I also like at the end how you try to change the subject too, talking about Nazi's and what not.... real class act there. Can we please stick to the topic at hand, your argument in this thread, for once????\n \n --------------------------------------\n Oh, lastly, since you like to try and label other arguments as circular reasoning, I want to show you what circular reasoning is, it's an even better example of why your argument is fallacy\n --------------------------------------\n \n If you use both faith AND reason to support your belief, you are using circular reasoning.\n \n 1. You have faith in someone's honesty (Requires no evidence, belief without evidence)\n 2. You see \"some evidence\" of their honesty.\n \n You are using both you claim, so by using #1, you argue for believing they are telling the truth based on the evidence of your belief that they they always tell the truth (and need no evidence).\n \n That's what circular reasoning is, care to come up with a new line of argument? You also have the option of dropping the \"and faith\", and just leave \"I used reason\" if you want to adopt my corrections to your logic. \n \n -Mach",

No, since we have no idea if we'll greet the morning, but it's the truth nonetheless.\n I have faith in my friends, my wife, my job, etc., but none of those are guaranteed.\n \n Have the faith of God Mark 11 : 22\n By whom also we have access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

There are typically exceptions. And this is no exception. Just because you drop a ball does not mean it will accelerate downward. There are many ways in which other forces could be acting on the ball. And gravity, apparently, isn't as straight-forward as it first seems. How about the mixture of acid and alkaline in an environment of various gases other than the usual...\n \n To be a little more precise, we could accurately say this: assuming constant factors in a controlled environment without unusual circumstances or changes, we can assume that a ball dropped will accelerate downward or that mixing acid and alkaline will produce a salt (because our experience tells us to expect this). However, if any of the parameters change, this may not happen.\n \n We can say something similar with the Superbowl example... Assuming constant factors without unusual circumstances, etc., we can assume the Superbowl will happen as planned.\n \n There remains the possibility in both cases for exceptions to the rule.\n \n The perspective from which you are debating this topic depends largely on semantics.

Can we please stick to the topic at hand, your argument in this thread, for once????\n\n Again, I apologise for using your words against you; I should have just made it up as you do, and argue against that, as you do.\n But seriously, you did argue for science and laughed that anyone would question it from a non-scientific stand-point (i.e. me believing in religion and creation instead of science and evolution) and yet we find an example of you doing exactly that; with respect to Nazi science which you condemn as detestable, based on philosophy rather than science. However, you see nothing wrong with that, and everything wrong with your perception of me doing the same to another form of science.

   "this i agree with. but while it sounds rational to provide for the slim chance that the superbowl wouldnt occur, we can reasonably ignore that possibility, and still plan our party, buy drinks and invite friends over. of course if for whatever reason the superbowl is cancelled/not showing, you figure the risk is not that great, and the chance of the superbowl airing as scheduled is in your favor. its a risk you can take, but faith is still involved\n \n with any event where a risk of the unexpected is involved, there is a measure of faith as well. for the 100% certain, no faith is needed. for the very uncertain, you need a lot more faith. there is no evidence that the unpredictable will certainly occur, yet everyday we believe that they will.\n\n \n Faith isn't involved. Have you ever heard of game theory?\n \n Suppose Bob reasons that there is a 90% chance that the superbowl wil occur.

   "Mach, one site does not an argument make. Unfortunately for you, you're arguing from a basis that is exceptionally narrow in it's knowledge, and tempered by a priori nonsesee such as the belief that all religious people are, by that 'sin' alone, irrational.\n \n \"A reasoned faith. Faith and Reason go together.\"\n http://www.wnking.com/mchristheology.htm\n \n \"As Augustine wandered from one philosophy to another (Manichaeanism, skepticism, and Neo-Platonism), he became personally aware of the limitations of human reason. Reason and faith need to cooperate intimately in the soul&#8217;s quest for God. Belief is natural and necessary for intellectual activity which assents to many opinions solely on another&#8217;s testimony. \"We believe the things which are not present to our senses, if the evidence offered for them seems sufficient,\"14 and the authority \"of who may be believed is being considered.\"15 Religious belief and understanding are complementary: \"Understand my word in order to believe, but believe God&#8217;s word in order to understand.\"16 Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith.On account of his close correlation of faith and reason, Augustine often made philosophical reflections in the course of theological inquiry and scriptural exegesis. Within this framework of philosophy and religion, Augustine&#8217;s Christian faith was open to whatever insights Greek and Roman thinkers had to offer.\"\n http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-9/chapter_i.htm\n \n Also consult\n Reasoned Faith: Essays in Philosophical Theology in Honor of Norman Kretzmann. Edited by Eleanore Stump. Cornell University Press.\n \"Reasoned Faith is a collection of fourteen essays offered in honor of Christian philosopher Norman Kretzmann that addresses Judeo- Christian themes in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The collection is divided into four sections, all addressing the rational assessment of religious faith: \"The Role of Reason in Faith,\" \"Reason and Revelation,\" \"Reason and the Nature of the God Faith,\" and \"Reason and Faith on the Relation Between God and Creatures.\" A large book of rigorous philosophizing is impossible to review exhaustively at other than book length, so instead of summarizing every essay I will focus on particular ones.\"\n http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9403/grooth.html\n \n There's a big big world out there of great thinkers which you've arrogantly dismissed without even knowing them.\n Go to http://www3.baylor.edu:80/~Scott_Moore/Phi_Rel_info.html for a start to see many of the great thinkers you believe to be irrational\n or, if you haven't the time, try reading \"From Blind Belief to Reasoned Faith\" http://www.teosofia.com/Mumbai/7307faith.html\n \n Hope this post wasn't too long :)",

   "Hello Dzeron:\n The problem with that argument is that the author accuses science of claiming that everything is random. That is not so, for science claims that the atoms operate according to the laws of physics, not random chance.\n \n How could random chance than produce order? This implies the existence of an orderly Creator who set the laws and particles into motion, would it not? The author is not talking about operation science, the science that involves observation, experiments and repeatability, but the belief of evolutionism that everything came into being over eons of years of change that eventually came from lifeless chemicals, that ultimately originated from the supposed big bang. Real science investigates problems using observation, experimental validation and repeatability, such as medical science, genetics, computer and space technology. Typically, no one observed those events (mentioned above) occuring, nor can they be repeated or experimentally validated. Thus, evolutionism cannot be proved by science, and as such, it must be taken by faith. Generally, evolutionism is the naturalistic (or atheistic) view about our origins.\n \n there is actually another version called \"punctuated equilibrium\" that means that the separation of species was occasionally caused by drastic mutations.\n \n Wow, I have never heared of this version.\n \n Like GreenMtnBoy, I hardly read anything after the author tried to throw out science.\n \n As explained above, he didn't try and through out the reputable operation or real science that involves observation, experiments, repeatability, he was targeting the theory (or belief) of evolutionism. This typically says that things came to be by accidents and natural processes (i.e. no intellgence involved).",

   "just a brief note: looking at both this thread and the \"out of china\" thread, in which bootfitter, monty and mach are debating, i am disturbed by the word \"silly\" next to \"montalban\". you 3 guys i respect in this forum for your articulate skill, knowledge and mature temperaments. please avoid the name-calling\n \n i think this is the key to settling a major part of the back-and-forth-ing.\n \n based on definitions 2 and 3 (which we can live with for the sake of this debate) r and f are mutually exclusive, in that you can back up your belief B with either r or f. however, r and f work hand in hand, as i pointed out in another thread. the sensory and logical evidence that back up B may not always be conclusive. in fact, most of the time we must leave some margin of error\n \n for example, we can observe the sound of a siren up the block. this is sensory evidence. our belief would be that there is a fire in the neighboorhood. however, the sensory evidence is not conclusive, so there is a possibility or \"risk\" that you could be wrong about your belief. being certain that there is a fire in the neighboorhood requires faith. if the sound of a siren means there is a 40% chance that there is a fire in the neighboorhood, then the other 60% is based on faith\n \n so here you have a case of f and r complementing each other to form a certainty of B. it is more logical to accept B with certainty when you have a much higher ratio of r to f. if r is overwhelming the f aspect, we call it a \"reasonable belief\". however, if more f than r is involved, then it is a \"faith-based belief\"\n \n most beliefs have an element of both f and r\n\n \n Glad to see you jumped into the ring on this one.\n \n Faith is belief without evidence. \n Reason: Belief based on some evidence, the amount matters not.\n \n If you believe in a \"fire\" based on faith, your evidence is faith. That's circular reasoning. Your premise is that fire exists without evidence, to say you \"reasoned\" that fire exists, based on faith, is circular.\n \n If you believe based on both reason AND faith, your reasoning is again circular.\n \n Logically if reasoning based exclusively on faith is circular reasoning, then using that AND [anything you want to put here], is also circular.\n \n ==================\n \n Reason does not imply conclusive proof or some absolute certainity. That's again, your mixing up definitions in some odd fashion. \n \n Bill watched TV all day, at 4:45 he drove around the block and his wife, coming home from work, reasoned he was at work all day, based on the evidence of his driving, the evidence of having seen him go to work before, and on the evidence that he probably wouldn't lie.\n \n She does not have conclusive proof, yet she still reasoned (and she's actually incorrect to boot). You somehow argue that she used faith, and reason, to which I say you're making faith synonymous with reason. They are mutually exclusive unless you re-define faith as \"reason\". Reason does not imply conclusive, absolute, right, or wrong. Get the dictionary if you like, whatever works for you to revise your definition.\n \n If you use a faith to back a claim, it's circular reasoning.\n \n -Mach",

   "lol\n \n very true. the game theory does not preclude faith. the game theory is just about odds.\n \n if there is a fire on your block, then the best action is to wet your house so that it wont get burnt easily. however, if you hear a siren down the block, the odds that this means a house on your block is burning is about 40%. (5 out of 10 times is a road accident, 1 out of ten is a domestic dispute/burglary/other). in this case it is not reasonable to start soaking your house down with a hose until you gather more evidence. if at this point (with only the siren as evidence) you start to pour water on your house, then you're acting unreasonably. you believe that there is a fire, without reasonable evidence, therefore you are acting in faith\n \n if you hear a siren and see firemen attaching a hose to the hydrant (but you dont see a fire) then you have a 99.5% reasonable certainty that there is a fire on the block. if you see the fire, then its 100%\n \n acting upon the certainty that a fire is on your block, it is reasonable to pour water on your house to protect it from spreading and burning your stuff\n \n with faith, there is the risk of soaking your house down for nothing and looking like a fool. then again, there is the chance that you were right all along. \n \n total faith is believing there is a fire with absolutley no clues that there is a fire on the block, and proceeding to pour water on your house based on nothing but this belief\n\n \n That's fine and dandy, but to say your reason for pouring water on your house was because of your belief that there was a fire, based on no evidence, then your reasoning is circular. No one is saying you can't use fallacy to argue, such as \"I am using a little faith and a lot of reason\". I just think it's counter-productive if your goal is to arrive at a rational conclusion.\n \n -Mach",

I then said that there's 2,000 years of Christian thinkers who agree with me on this. You then stated that there,'s 20,000 scientists who disagree with your argument; that I'm wrong to believe in reasoned faith.

But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith.

Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...

   "St.Augustine believed \" Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith\"\n http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-9/chapter_i.htm\n \n The Catholics state Christian faith is based on reasoned faith; this is in their Catechism\n 35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.\n http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm#II\n \n Christians rely on rezoned faith...\n \"Sometimes our answers seem somewhat lame, but in reality there is only so much one can say before one must acknowledge that, while there are certain things we simply cannot fully understand about this, reasoned faith, as defined in St James, becomes the only recourse\"\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/q-and-a_old/sinlessness-of-mary.html\n \n And in the understanding of the Bible...Matthew Henry's classic Bible commentary of the Book of James states...\n \"2. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes and another expressly requires: Knowing this, that the trial of your faith, v. 3; and then in v. 6, Let him ask in faith. There must be a sound believing of the great truths of Christianity, and a resolute cleaving to them, in times of trial. That faith which is spoken of here as tried by afflictions consists in a belief of the power, and word, and promise of God, and in fidelity and constancy to the Lord Jesus.\"\n http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comments/james/mh/james1.htm\n \n Further, in understanding the Christian faith, he adds...\n \"I. Let us consider the address to sinners\"\n http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comments/james/mh/james5.htm\n That is, he calls us to think/reason about what is being said....\n \"1. He foretels the judgments of God that should come upon them, v. 1-3. they should have miseries come upon them, and such dreadful miseries that the very apprehension of them was enough to make them weep and howl-misery that should arise from the very things in which they placed their happiness, and misery that should be completed by these things witnessing against them at the last, to their utter destruction; and they are now called to reason upon and thoroughly to weigh the matter, and to think how they will stand before God in judgment: Go to now, you rich men.\" (Ibid)\n \n Also, in judging whom we should be faithful/trusting of...we can use reason...\n \"When we read in Bouchet about miracles associated with the relics of Saint Hilary we can shrug it off: His right to be believed is not great enough to take away our freedom to challenge him. But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...

Phi is represented with the Greek letter phi, which is &#934;.\n \n It is seen in geometry, spirals of seashells, the human ear, face, and body proportions, DNA, the human heartbeat, and of course, mathematics.\n \n \n The sine of 666 degrees is 1/2 of anti-phi, or negative phi.\n \n \n-2(sin 666\u00b0) = &#934;\n -2(-0.8090169944) = &#934;\n 1.618033989 = &#934;\n\n \n 666 degrees is 54 degrees short of a complete 2 circles. If you divide the measure of a full circle by 54, you get 6.66666666.\n \n 2.5 cubits / 1.5 cubits = 1.66666666, which is close enough to phi that the difference proprtions of the ark of the covenant to &#934; won't be a difference noticed by the human eye.\n \n This exact same number can also be derived from the dimensions of the ark.\n \n The breadth / height, which is 50/40, equals 1.66666666, which is not that far off from our calculation of &#934;.\n &#934; is was also used by the Greeks and Egyptians in the building of their structures.\n \n You may think I'm psycho, but &#934; is yet another piece of evidence showing God's existance and that He created us. \n More information about the golden number\n\n \n Your math shows mathematic results, no more, no less.\n Your assumption that because [insert a bunch of meaningless mathematics] = there is a god and he created us, leaves a few things unanswered. Well, no, actually it leaves everything unanswered. \n \n Your entire line of reasoning is inconclusive at best.

That's circular reasoning. Your premise is that fire exists without evidence, to say you \"reasoned\" that fire exists, based on faith, is circular.\n \n If you believe based on both reason AND faith, your reasoning is again circular.\n \n Logically if reasoning based exclusively on faith is circular reasoning, then using that AND [anything you want to put here], is also circular.\n\n thats not how it works. evidence can be inconclusive. if you are certain that your conclusion is right based on inconclusive evidence, then your are filling up the \"certainty gap\" with faith.\n \n in the case of a siren sounding on the block, the possibility exists that there is a fire in the neighboorhood. but its obviously not conclusive. jumping to a conclusion without gathering all the facts is making a decision based on part-reason/part-faith\n \n \nReason does not imply conclusive proof or some absolute certainity. That's again, your mixing up definitions in some odd fashion. \n\n this i know. certainty is up to the observer/deducer. some people are prone to jump to conclusion. some are skeptical of everything. the mix of reason faith a person uses to be certain about something depends on thje person and the situation.\n \n \nBill watched TV all day, at 4:45 he drove around the block and his wife, coming home from work, reasoned he was at work all day, based on the evidence of his driving, the evidence of having seen him go to work before, and on the evidence that he probably wouldn't lie.\n \n She does not have conclusive proof, yet she still reasoned (and she's actually incorrect to boot). You somehow argue that she used faith, and reason, to which I say you're making faith synonymous with reason. They are mutually exclusive unless you re-define faith as \"reason\". Reason does not imply conclusive, absolute, right, or wrong. Get the dictionary if you like, whatever works for you to revise your definition.\n\n she used faith because there exists the possibility that her husband may lie, or that she could be wrong about her certainty. her conclusion may be deemed \"reasonable\" if there is a more likely chance that her reasoning is correct. similarly it may seem \"unreasonable\" for her to conclude that her husband never went to work but only just drove in to trick her. the fact is, she formed a certainty based on inconclusive evidence, but figured that the evidence she gathered (seeing her husband just drive in) would be sufficient to based her certainty upon. \n \n \nIf you use a faith to back a claim, it's circular reasoning.\n\n people do this all the time. vouch for someone's honesty. say you're going to meet someone at a certain time and place. lend someone money and expect to get it back. i could go on. we take it fir granted, but its there",

   "Don't get me wrong, you can use both faith and reason to base your beliefs, they will however be irrational beliefs.\n\n exactly. and my point is that we make irrational beliefs all the time. it is not always the best thing to wait until you gather all the necessary evidence before you make a decision. this is where judgement comes in. there are times when we must make a decision based on inconclusive evidence. call it irrational if you like (thats actually what it is, but dont tell the decision makers that), but its always part-faith/part-reason\n \n \nOK, since you aren't understanding that faith REQUIRES no evidence, else, if it accepts evidence, it's reason.\n\n i have repeatedly pointed out that faith requires no evidence. the definition of faith is certainty in something without evidence\n \n \n1. Show me how faith can be used reliably to show something as either true or false.\n\n it cannot. faith is used when sufficient evidence is absent. with faith-based certainties, there is always a risk that you may be wrong. the more faith employed, the higher the risk of being wrong\n \n \n2. Secondly, faith is simply not necessary for explaning something. It's by definition, not an explanation, but a dogma, \"THIS IS TRUE\". No evidence is needed. If you can show me some things that faith IS necessary for explaining, then again, we might get somewhere (you cannot unfortunately).\n\n faith is necessary for explaining that which needs an explanation but cannot be currently backed by evidence. for example, you must explain why you need to hire kim as an assistant. kim's resume and interview may be incoclusive evidence of her motives and competence, but you justify your decision based on what you have, and based on your belief that its true and that what you see with kim is what you get. obviously, the possibilty exists that you can be wrong about your decision, and its reasonable to admit that, since the decision was based largely on faith",

   "\"The Law of the Excluded Middle\" is a concept new to Mach, obvious so because of the novel application he uses.\n \n \"The Law of the Excluded Middle is that \"if a given proposition is not true then its denial must be true&#8221;. See also The Law of (Non-)Contradiction which says that \"if a given proposition is true then its denial cannot be true\". Whereas formal logic places an absolute ban on Contradiction, Intuitionism is a branch of Logic which holds that the Law of Excluded Middle is not valid.\n For dialectics, this law has only relative truth; due to the inherently mobile and interconnected nature of all concepts, it is frequently the case that neither a proposition nor its denial may be accepted as absolutely true.\n http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/x.htm\n \n It makes the assumption that two concepts are 'crisply defined as either [a] or [b].\n \n In this case Mach deems that \"reason\" [a] and \"faith\" [b] can not be the opposite, by arguing in favour of \"The Law of the Excluded Middle\"\n \n The idea is that [a] as defined can not be [b], and visa versa. However \"reasoned faith\" is neither [a] nor [b], but [c] and thus Mach makes one of the saddest mistakes of logic.

However, mixed together they create a new flavour [c]. [c] is neither [a] nor [b]. It is what I have been arguing, and what he has failed to grasp.\n \n And thus, continuing his analogy, adding instead of the ingredients, the concepts, we read his sentence as\n The concept of truth of faith might have some reason added to it, but it's still a concept of truth.\n \n Concrete thinking is to blame for someone seeing everything in black and white.\n \n Logicians also accept that paradoxes exist, and that these defy the \"Law of the Excluded Middle\", such as the The Epimenides Paradox.\n \n Scientists accept that there are degrees of truth, that things neither are [a] nor [b]. This is called \"Fuzzy logic\" and is \"widely accepted within the engineering and computer science communities, but generally rejected by mathematicians and statisticians.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic",

The instant you use reason to back your belief, faith is no more. It's not a graduated change. Why:\n \n 2. The law of the excluded middle: anythign is either A, or not A. A proposition can either be true, or false.\n 3. Law of contradiction - nothing can be both A, and not A. A proposition cannot be both true, and false.\n\n a belief does not care what it is based on. either faith or reason can be the basis of a belief.\n \n belief: fire makes things hot\n basis 1: my mom told me, so i believe\n basis 2: i've observed fire causing things to get hot\n \n regardless of the basis, the belief is the same. the basis doesnt change the belief itself. most of the things you are taught as a child you believe by faith. you take your parents'/teachers'/ books' word on what they say and believe it as true because mom/mr. charles/the encyclopedia said so. as you grow older, some of the things you believe by faith become based in reason, because you have observed with your senses and determined that they were true (backed up by evidence). the more evidence you have to back up your belief, the less you need to rely on faith\n \n you assume that the law of excluded middle applies, but it doesnt. a belief itself does not care about its basis, its just a belief that the statement is true. there is no rule that states a belief can only be determined by a single basis. \n \n \nFaith: Belief justified without evidence\n Reason: Belief justified by evidence.\n \n That might be a bit more clear. You can be incorrect in your justification, but it doesn't mean you didn't arrive at your belief through reason.\n \n However:\n You either USE evidence for your belief, or you don't. There is no middle, and it cannot be both. I think religious and common definitions of faith confuse the issue. Faith in your case is synonomous with a degree of certainty, unless it's entirely based without evidence, in which case it's faith.\n \n Either you use evidence, or you do not, there is no middle, it cannot be both. Fortunately for us, else we would be incapable of reason.\n\n i agree. however, you continue to ignore the fact that inconclusive evidence exist (and therefore partial reasoning). \n \n again, the senario: a guy hears a siren up the block and immediately rushes out and hoses down his house. \n \n would you consider his belief (that there is a fire on his block) reasonable? would you consider him reasonable to act on such a belief? (note that a siren sound is the evidence he is acting on)",

If you choose to use no evidence, and provide NO justification for your belief, than you are indeed using faith. It's an either or. There is no middle to requiring evidence.

Further, to undermine your credibility as a debitor, you simply re-work argument, and then present analogies that support my side, not yours.\n \n You should just admit you are wrong, in this instance. The difficulty for you lies in the fact you've actually hinged your world-faith on this false dichotomy. It is why you have the confidence to argue against religion; because you think it is devoid of reason. This is sailing close to a personal attack, but it is becoming frustrating that you should continually make claims, then not accept tests by the rules of testing you yourself espouse.\n \n I am eager to engage you in a debate on ideas, but this is difficult when you've debated me so far on something we're in agreement with (i.e.. 'faith'), you've demanded I provide evidence, which I've done and referred you to them repeatedly, yet conversely you provide none yourself. \n \n For your own benefit, and for anyone else suffering the same mistaken belief I repeat two of the many pieces of evidence...\n \"The Law of the Excluded Middle is that \"if a given proposition is not true then its denial must be true&#8221;. See also The Law of (Non-)Contradiction which says that \"if a given proposition is true then its denial cannot be true\". Whereas formal logic places an absolute ban on Contradiction, Intuitionism is a branch of Logic which holds that the Law of Excluded Middle is not valid.\n For dialectics, this law has only relative truth; due to the inherently mobile and interconnected nature of all concepts, it is frequently the case that neither a proposition nor its denial may be accepted as absolutely true.\n http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/x.htm\n \n and\n Scientists accept that there are degrees of truth, that things neither are [x] nor [y]. This is called \"Fuzzy logic\" and is \"widely accepted within the engineering and computer science communities, but generally rejected by mathematicians and statisticians.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic\n \n Your continual posturing based on an a priori belief that has no rationale behind it is underling your credibility.

It's an oxymoron.\n \n I would completely agree with 'reasoned belief', but faith implies that no reasoning is required.\n \n Here's my take on your ongoing debate(s) with Mach on this subject-\n \n I think that what you're driving at is reasoned belief. I haven't seen all of your reasons to believe, I'll just accept that you have them. Based on these reasons you believe God exists. That's fine, and I'm quite willing to accept that, but belief does not imply 100% certainty.\n \n The only way to convey 100% certainty is to say that you have faith in the fact God exists. Then, by definition, if you have faith, you don't require any evidence or reasons for your certainty.\n \n Further to that, IMHO, belief is rational, faith is irrational.\n \n Waxy",

If you can research a site, that agrees with your stance, that is based on philosophical study. But you don't. You can't. And that's saddeningly dishonest of you to not debate to the same level of research you continually get from, and expect from me.\n I put forward evidence in Posts #40, #46, and #66, and reminded you of this as late as post #79. It seems your spoiling tactic is to ignore an answer I give, and continue to ask questions about 'reasoned faith' when I've already given loads of supporting evidence on three separate occasions.\n I had hoped that you were a genuine debator, but you are not. You simply re-state your belief. I have asked for you to support your statement on every occasion, and you see fit not to do so, and then to ask me for support which has been given from philosophical and religious sites, including dictionaries of philosophy. This weight of evidence is something you continue to ignore.\n If you are a genunie debator, you will respond with evidence, not opinion. Find the research. I even suggested a philosopher who might agree with you. You are lowering the standard of debate by refusing to post anything but opinion - when you yourself demand 'evidence' from others.\n \n \n This is the challenge, open for everyone now to see.

If God is good then God would not be cruel. That is reasoned faith. I have faith in God, I use reason to conclude what God is like. But it goes deeper than that too, (but I'm sure you'll be quite selective in your re-wording of this statement), that God has revealed Himself to us. That is reason; proof by appearance. God has said \"I am a God of love\", we believe Him, that is faith. God made us to recognise Him; it is in our nature to return to Him. Faith and reason working hand in hand; reasoned faith.\n We are not wholly rational beings, and we are not wholly emotional beings. WE are a combination of both rational and emotional, and thus we come to know things with both head and heart.\n \n Here's an interesting site...\n Can we have both Evidence and Faith? \n The origin of the word faith comes from a Latin word meaning to trust. \n Usually we need to earn trust to receive it, but that is not always the case. \n Does God want us to have earned trust in him, or should we just trust?\n Hebrews 11:1,6 \n According to Hebrews 11 faith has substance, and evidence and can be diligently sought for. \n We have not seen have we seen the air, but we have faith that air exist because we have evidence, we have seen the trees sway in the wind, balloons fill, and even tornadoes tear houses away from thier foundation. \n The same can be said for God we have not seen God, but we have access evidence just as powerful as any tornado that he exist, but we have to diligently seek it. \n 1 Peter 3:15 \n God commands us to be ready to give an answer to everyone who ask \n for the hope that lies within you. \n If you have faith that requires no evidence you have something more precious than gold, but many people esspecailly in our modern day world need evidence to believe in God and the Bible requires us to have an answer for those people who are looking for evidence. So even if you do not personally need evidence for your faith, you need to be able to answer the questions about your faith that others have. \n Acts 1:3 \n Jesus produced many infallible proofs of his reserection. \n Mat 22:37 \n We are to love the Lord with all our mind as well as our heart and soul \n How can we love God with our mind without anilizing the evidence that God exist? \n Mark 9:24 \n Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. \n This verse sounds confusing until you read the entire chapter this man brought his demon possessed son to Jesus to be healed, and Jesus said I can fix him if you believe \n What I believe this man was saying was Lord I believe, but if you heal my son, you will have given me the evidence I need for my faith to grow. \n In Exodus 4:1-10 Moses tells God that his people won't believe that Moses has talked to him and God replies by giving him several signs to prove that he has spoken with God. And that is just the first of many times that God gives the Jews evidence that he reigns supreme. \n http://wzippler.tripod.com/Biblestudy/faith.htm",

This seems to add a further \"mystical\" dimension to the difficulty any reasonable person would have on the subject of Christ's resurrection - which is that even more spiritual \"merit\" is gained by believing something that you've been unable to submit to a verification procedure. \"Infallible proofs\" - what are they ?\n\n \n You call it 'perfectly reasonable'. The guy travelled around with Jesus for @ 3 yrs. Saw heaps of miracles, heard Jesus talk, etc. Then his fellow Apostles tell him that Jesus has come back, and his faith was so small that he didn't believe them.\n \n However, the important bit is that even he accepted Jesus had returned. The Apostles were all a mixed bag of people, and were quite fallible, but St. Thomas' faith was so strong after that he accepted martyrdom for his faith.\n \n His ministry to the world after seeing Jesus is infallible proof. He died for the truth of what he was witness to.

   "Yes, once again brave Mach posits his own opinion again. \n\n \nPersonal,\n\n It's factual. Evidence by the lack of citations that you make.\n \n you're talking to an audience not debating me, \n\n We are on a public forum, or did you imagine we two are the only ones reading this?\n \nyou make more claims, namely, that an argument is an opinion, irrelevant to the debate.\n\n Yes, you do continually re-state your opinion. You demand evidence, yet offer none. When I offer it, you say no amount of evidence will convince you, and then a few posts later, you'll demand that I post evidence.\n \nThe challenge was for him to actually connect it to some evidentiary research.\n\n \nWas this the challenge? I thought the challenge was to you\n\n Not quite. I posted numerous sites that show that the concept of reasoned faith is neither just my opinion, nor 'new' (something which you claimed; thus you have made counter-claims; which are false). You continually say that it doesn't exist. I have shown my case. You dismiss it with your re-statement of opinion. So, there is some burden for you to show why you think your opinion, constantly re-stated constitutes an argument greater then effectively saying \"no it isn't\" There is also some need for you to demonstrate why you hold a circular position.\n You demand evidence, and when it's posted, you say the amount of evidence I cite is irrelevant, even though it backs up my case; because you then argue that no amount of evidence will convince you. Next thing you do, is you demand I post evidence. :)\n \n, that is, you still have yet to tell us what reasoned faith is.\n\n Yes, you make such claims even though I've referred you to definitions of it. This is again your very lazy way of arguing; calling for an answer that's already been given.\n For you this is 'argument'. And the thing for my side is it shows how irrational your argument is. Even if people disagree with my case, your case is flawed by that lack of evidentiary argument.\n In fact, for instance, in Post 46 I gave you several citations, including from philosophical dictionaries/sites.\n Your retort was that the actual amount of evidence to my case was irrelevant. And that's been the story so far. So much for the rational mind, you have a belief, and regardless of what evidence is put forward, you maintain your belief is correct - based on (?) your belief that you are correct.\n I posted evidences at Posts #40, #46, and #66. You make a cry for me to provide evidence, even though I have, and even though I remind you that I have. SO, when I remind you of the fact that I've posted evidences such as in posts #73, #79 and again in post #113, you still make this totally dishonest tactic of saying \"Please show the evidence\", when also you say that no matter how much evidence I do cite, you've already convinced yourself you're right. In fact, I've had to post these references to where I've given you evidence, because you continually make the false claim that you're still waiting for a definition.\n So much for the rational mind! We now must travel through this cycle every few days as you seem to forget where you're up to; whether you're attacking me for not posting evidence - and demanding that I do, or attacking my evidence, by stating that no amount of it will convince you, then you're back to demanding I cite evidence, as if I haven't.\n Goldfish have a memory retention, it is said, of only a few seconds.\n However, for me, argument is a set of connected statements with (hopefully) references to evidence. For you, a re-stating of your opinion, and calling for me to provide evidence that I've already done, and then offering no evidence yourself constitutes debate. With, occasionally the re-insertion of argument against something we're agreed on, and then a reversion to indignantly demanding I do something I've already done.\n \nOh, you did say it was:\n Faith made stronger by reason.\n To which we all know means faith.\n\n You seem to mistake 'faith' as in I have a religious faith/belief/denomination to a particular belief, for 'faith' per se. My Orthodox faith is made stronger through reasoned faith.\n \nthen you claim:\n Faith combined with reason\n\n Yes, my Orthodox faith is one that combines faith with reason, or reasoned faith, a concept that you've tried to pretend I've just made up (despite citing evidence from Christian tradition), to stating that it's a made up word, to a made up phrase, to a 'new' word or phrase.\n \n To which I showed you quite easily that the logical combination of these two methods results in illogical nonsense.\n\n No, you mean you re-stated your belief, devoid of evidence, which for you is 'true'.\n \nNOW, you claim that I haven't shown evidence...of what? You were refuted in your claims, you need to come up with a new definition so we can continue the debate. Then I'll present more fundamental evidence why your statements just aren't rational. See how easy rational debate is?\n\n You and I have a different idea of evidence. For you, your opinion is evidence. And you've stated your opinion as if it's true, based on the belief what you say is true.\n \nA challenge that was laid down some weeks ago, and each and every post Mach shies away from this and simply re-states his opinion on it. He did attempt to bring in a philosophical term \"The Law of the Excluded Middle\" but he's now dropped that \n\n .\nWho are you talking to?\n\n Do you assume that we are the only two on this forum?\n \n Is this relevant to you being correct or incorrect?\n\n It is certainly relevant to you being incorrect. You tried to show that faith and reason, by being poles apart would have nothing in between. You used a concept that is not even widely accepted by scientists (re: my refutation from citing evidence about 'fuzzy' logic' etc).\n It was your best attempt at providing some evidence to your case, and it was evidence that did not support your case. Therefore your case still rests on your opinion.\n \n I most certainly have not \"dropped\" anything. I posted it here, you ignored it\n\n That is quite frankly a terrible howler to make. It goes to show the level of honesty between us is vast. It's very easy for you to make such a comment that I've ignored what you said. It's just as easy for me to reference the posts (#91, and to a lesser extent the one before it, and again at #104) where I showed that your concept of \"The Law of the Excluded Middle\" was misapplied. It's extraordinarily odd that you would diminish your own credibility by making such a patently false claim as that. That's starting to become a catalogue of false claims you now make, added to your demands that I provide a definition of what I believe in; which I can only assume you do because you make a mistake between not agreeing with something stated, and not seeing something stated... which is probably likely to your own self-belief that what you believe in is true, anyway.\n \n...what would you have me do...fly to Australia and force you at gunpoint to obey the laws of logic? No thanks, you being reasonable would only benefit you, not me.\n\n Odd for you to think of a tactic that an irrational person would use to convince others. If you had evidence, you'd post it.\n \nIt was his second half-hearted attempt at research, and both times he showed a total misunderstanding of what it is he was trying to say; because the cites didn't support his statements. \n\n \nDo you need to research 2+2=4? Maybe I should take off work to search for links to prove it?\n\n Well considering I was able to debate your two attempts at sourcing your ideas, it is very easy for you to give up on doing this.\n \nSo much for the 'rational' debate. Mach continues his 'just-so' statements. \n\n \nWhich is...what you did yourself with that statement? Nice, so very nice.\n\n Not at all the same. I have spelt out my case by citing evidence, showing you where that evidence was stated (after your numerous claims that I haven't done this). We are operating on totally different sets of principles.\n \nWhat are you crying about now? \n\n \nAh, rhetorical and insulting, you're the master and nonsense and personal attacks, no doubt about it.\n\n Please bear in mind your numerous false claims.\n \n What do you think reasoned faith is? Some posts you argue that its a word, others that it's a phrase, then you add in all sorts of un-supported claims; like it's 'new'. Where are you up to this time? \n\n \nOh no, it's up to you to define it,\n\n Here we go for your dishonest statement again. I've already defined it. I've already cited sites that define it. You just call on me to do it, when I've done it.\n \nsince I've already shown the combination is bogus,\n\n No, you've stated that it is.\n \nand your \"reasoned faith is faith [with other things added\", which reduces to \"faith\", as bogus. But I'll entertain your new definition any time.\n\n So are you now admitting that I have defined it? There you go, caught in your own trap. When people are dishonest they begin to lose track of what it is they are claiming.\n You've changed your claims at various times, re: whether it's a word/phrase/new/my invention etc.\n Now you've been caught out again.\n \n Reasoned faith is a combination of reason and faith. I have maintained a consistent claim.\n\n \nAnd it's been shown to still arrive at irrational claims through logical combination.\n\n So now you do admit I've defined it. That's a different thing from saying that you don't agree with it. You've made post after post of this bogus claim that I have not given you a definition.\n \nUnless you have a new definition that you can actually describe for us...so we can debate it too? I can't wait.\n\n Now we're back to seeing you claim that I haven't defined it. You ought to make up your mind.\n \nSomehow you, who change what it is you are arguing against daily, believe I am changing. That's very rich! \n\n \nIs it? \n\n Yes, it is. So far even within this post you've demeaned that I provide a definition, then admitted that I have, (even though you don't agree with it), and then gone back to demanding that I provide a definition, even though you've already attempted to refute my definition. This is, as I stated, further evidence that you switch day to day what it is you're arguing.\n \nYou've added so much in this post. I feel like Montalban as I type this, just posting nonsense and replying incredulously, this is easier than being correct...I should try this again some time.\n\n You already do just make claims about what I've said, and they are just your claims.\n \nI look forward to you just repeating the concept is illogical. \n\n \nIf you don't like the basic logic that shows it is, then show me something else, please do try.\n\n Ah, arrogance. Here you assume again that your opinion is 'logical'. Now you give your opinion about your opinion :)\n \nAnd laughably, if I cite any additional evidence (remember you have NONE) you dispute that on the basis of .... that any amount of evidence could be shown for either case (?). I'll recall that when we debate on evolution. The laughs keep coming thanks to Mach. \n\n \nQ. Does the volume of evidence matter if it all says the same thing?

Is this how you determine truth from false...by tallying the number of web sites someone references?

   "Then your rebuttal is based on an opinion based on how you consider men alone might act, because you would not factor into this the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which for you itself is probably an unproven entity based on the same said opinion. I see a circle forming..\n\n \nI express scepticism towards the testimony supposedly given over 2000 years ago (in a credulous age) on the subject of miracles and your answer\n is that I've failed to factor in \"the guidance of the Holy Spirit\". For many good reasons I shall never believe that all known physical laws could be suspended in order for a \"miracle\" to take place: you counter this by an appeal to the authority of a Spirit that doesn't and can't exist. You must see how ridiculous this is.\n\n Not at all. I fail to see how it is ridiculous not to include the power of the Holy Spirit.\n \nYour \"reasoned faith\" is an oxymoron : it has been pointed out too many times already that religious faith is, by definition, unreasoned and unreasonable.\n\n Yes a number of people have now voiced their opinion. You do the same. Good for you. I have entered a world where-by if enough people express their opinion, that adds weight to the argument, even if it's not actually based on anything except your own a priori beliefs about belief.\n \n Your idea of human thinking is separate from the truth. We are both rational, and feeling beings. We combine the two everyday in a process that is continually relying on both sources. In effect, you are saying we are full of oxymorons, everyone of us, for we draw upon both sides all the time... maybe you're from Vulcan.\n \n I think what you do is mistake 'faith' for 'a religious faith built on faith and reason (or reasoned faith)'. I think actually that's the crux of the many objections. 'A religious faith' is not just 'faith' alone, although you probably feel that people just sat around one day and started believing in something, with no reason what-so-ever, somehow a 'faith' just happened. And that these people just accepted what they felt, with no reason what-so-ever.\n \n I posted evidences at Posts #40, #46, and #66. See appendix, where I cite secular, Christian, Hindu and Moslem sources.\n Here's another faith's version\n \"It is maintained that the first precept to a follower of Jainism is that he should possess and cultivate an intelligent and reasoned faith in that religion\"\n http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/antiquity/ethcjain.htm\n Here's a Buddhist one..\n \"Accordingly, it is seen that while blind faith is totally rejected, reasoned faith is encouraged in the teachings of the Buddha. But faith is never considered as a means to salvation. However, it is said that faith could lead one to good destiny and it is accepted as a very helpful, initial factor that facilitates one&#8217;s spiritual journey till his ultimate freedom.\"\n http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/article1.htm\n \n Here's some more...\n \" As a church we see our purpose under God....To nurture the church to a mature and reasoned faith\"\n http://www.trinity-manningtree.org.uk/4955.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val*\n In a book-review..\n \"...

Faith and Reason go together.\"\n http://www.wnking.com/mchristheology.htm\n \n \"As Augustine wandered from one philosophy to another (Manichaeanism, skepticism, and Neo-Platonism), he became personally aware of the limitations of human reason. Reason and faith need to cooperate intimately in the soul&#8217;s quest for God. Belief is natural and necessary for intellectual activity which assents to many opinions solely on another&#8217;s testimony. \"We believe the things which are not present to our senses, if the evidence offered for them seems sufficient,\"14 and the authority \"of who may be believed is being considered.\"15 Religious belief and understanding are complementary: \"Understand my word in order to believe, but believe God&#8217;s word in order to understand.\"16 Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith. On account of his close correlation of faith and reason, Augustine often made philosophical reflections in the course of theological inquiry and scriptural exegesis. Within this framework of philosophy and religion, Augustine&#8217;s Christian faith was open to whatever insights Greek and Roman thinkers had to offer.\"\n http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-9/chapter_i.htm\n \n Also consult\n Reasoned Faith: Essays in Philosophical Theology in Honor of Norman Kretzmann. Edited by Eleanore Stump. Cornell University Press.\n \"Reasoned Faith is a collection of fourteen essays offered in honor of Christian philosopher Norman Kretzmann that addresses Judeo- Christian themes in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The collection is divided into four sections, all addressing the rational assessment of religious faith: \"The Role of Reason in Faith,\" \"Reason and Revelation,\" \"Reason and the Nature of the God Faith,\" and \"Reason and Faith on the Relation Between God and Creatures.\" A large book of rigorous philosophizing is impossible to review exhaustively at other than book length, so instead of summarizing every essay I will focus on particular ones.\"\n http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9403/grooth.html\n \n There's a big big world out there of great thinkers which you've arrogantly dismissed without even knowing them.\n Go to http://www3.baylor.edu:80/~Scott_Mo...i_Rel_info.html for a start to see many of the great thinkers you believe to be irrational\n or, if you haven't the time, try reading \"From Blind Belief to Reasoned Faith\" http://www.teosofia.com/Mumbai/7307faith.html\n \n Post 46\n The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy states there are three choices you can have...\n \"Religious faith is of two kinds: evidence-sensitive and evidence-insensitive. The former views faith as closely coordinated with demonstrable truths; the latter more strictly as an act of the will of the religious believer alone. The former includes evidence garnered from the testimony and works of other believers. It is, however, possible to hold a religious belief simply on the basis either of faith alone or of reason alone. Moreover, one can even lack faith in God or deny His existence, but still find solace in the practice of religion.\"\n http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/faith-re.htm\n Note you can have reason alone, or faith alone, but you can have faith and reason; reasoned faith. Your philosophy is stated as \"The incompatibilist model.\" It is the axiom by which you draw all other statements of belief from, even the one about science being rational. Because you believe that there's a gulf between faith and reason, and this is a philosophical stance, not a truth. I have a different philosophical stance, to be sure. However your stance is so far backed up by, well... your stance... and one obscure web-site reference. You should also check out your own site again, before re-stating it; it lists as 'reason' sensory perception, in other words, feelings.\n \"'Reason' refers to beliefs held on the basis of sensory and logical evidence.\"\n http://rous.redbarn.org/objectivism...z/answers2.html\n \n Perhaps you might want to pick-up the book featured at this article \"Author Helps Science-Minded Skeptics Discover Well-Reasoned Faith\"\n http://news.christiansunite.com/Rel...gion01045.shtml\n \n So, I've shown Christian and secular sites.\n Here's a Hindu one\n Reasoned Faith: Hindus declare that blind faith and dogma are the two most vicious sources of conflict in the world; only reasoned faith can ensure harmony in the world. \"I know that I myself owe it to thinking that I was able to retain my faith in religion...,\" writes Dr. Albert Schweitzer.17 One's deepest convic-tions must be vindicated by reason. Reason says that it is irreligious to perform religious actions which cause pain and discomfort to others. It is alright if an organized religion inspires its followers in the existence of God and prescribes a discipline to reach Him. At the same time, it is also important to recognize that God is above all religious systems, even though theologians may set limits to Him.\n http://www.hindubooks.org/authors/b...dharma/ch12.htm\n Here's a Moslem one..\n The Islamic tradition holds that the revelation granted to Muhammad had three principle elements: islam or submission to God, ihsan or moral and spiritual duties to the rest of humanity, and iman or faith. This word, faith, is a fairly poor rendering of iman ; one might better understand the word if it's translated as \"reasoned faith\" or \"conviction.\" \n http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/IMAN.HTM\n \n [b]Post 66[b]\n St.Augustine believed \" Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith\"\n http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-9/chapter_i.htm\n \n The Catholics state Christian faith is based on reasoned faith; this is in their Catechism\n 35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.\n http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm#II\n \n Christians rely on reasoned faith...\n \"Sometimes our answers seem somewhat lame, but in reality there is only so much one can say before one must acknowledge that, while there are certain things we simply cannot fully understand about this, reasoned faith, as defined in St James, becomes the only recourse\"\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/...ss-of-mary.html\n \n And in the understanding of the Bible...Matthew Henry's classic Bible commentary of the Book of James states...\n \"2. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes and another expressly requires: Knowing this, that the trial of your faith, v. 3; and then in v. 6, Let him ask in faith. There must be a sound believing of the great truths of Christianity, and a resolute cleaving to them, in times of trial. That faith which is spoken of here as tried by afflictions consists in a belief of the power, and word, and promise of God, and in fidelity and constancy to the Lord Jesus.\"\n http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comm...s/mh/james1.htm\n \n Further, in understanding the Christian faith, he adds...\n \"I. Let us consider the address to sinners\"\n http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comm...s/mh/james5.htm\n That is, he calls us to think/reason about what is being said....\n \"1. He foretels the judgments of God that should come upon them, v. 1-3. they should have miseries come upon them, and such dreadful miseries that the very apprehension of them was enough to make them weep and howl-misery that should arise from the very things in which they placed their happiness, and misery that should be completed by these things witnessing against them at the last, to their utter destruction; and they are now called to reason upon and thoroughly to weigh the matter, and to think how they will stand before God in judgment: Go to now, you rich men.\" (Ibid)",

   "making choices have a lot to do with belief. dont compare choosing a coin side to hiring an administrative assistant. both are very different. in hiring someone you have to consider the evidence you gather and act based on what you believe is true at the time\n \n\n \n They most certainly do not require a change of belief.\n \n Hiring someone is a decision. When using reason, a decision does not imply knowing truth or falsity.\n \n \" I think she will be sufficient for the job\", is reasoned. She may fail miserably, but you knew reasonably that you had no way to know, short of hiring her, to find that out. One does not need to form the belief that the person is perfect for the job in order to hire them, obviously. If you read a resume or interview the person, you're gathering evidence.\n \n If you randomly choose a name out of the phonebook and claim you know to be true that they are a good worker, you're relying on faith to make your claim that it is true that this person is a good worker.\n \n A gulf of difference seperates reason and faith.\n \n \nof course faith is not a reliable way to separate the truth from what is false. with faith comes the inherent risk that you may be wrong. with solid evidence to back up a belief, you dont have that problem. my point is that many times (probably most times) you dont have the conclusive evidence that can 100% back up your belief, so you must use your own judgements and subjective views to help support the belief. it is not a totally reliable way to separate the truth from what is false, but we necessarily employ it in our everyday lives anyway\n\n \n Judgements and subjective views add to the confusion.\n \n A judgement is a decision. See above.\n Subjective view merely describes a view that originates from an individual, that cannot readily  be observed by others. However, if I say someone is beautiful to me, I can certainly be making a true statement based on my objective view of the evidence that I feel pleasure when observing the person. \n \n Those two terms do nothing for the argument.\n \n \n Use these simple tests unker:\n \n 1. Did the belief/claim require evidence? Yes/No\n \n If it required evidence, it's reasoned. If it does not require evidence, it's faith.\n \n Recall, the absurdity of faith used as a basis for belief is best illustrated by not just requiring no evidence, but IN SPITE OF EVIDENCE.\n \n To say \"I know to be true that clouds are made of cotton\", and you're then flown up and allowed to observe clouds directly, if you maintain your belief based on faith, you still claim to be true that they are made of cotton.\n \n Big difference, easy to test, requires or does not require evidence.\n \n -Mach",

   "I think I made this point before.\n \n Reason usually says something is x% likely to be true, where x is between 0 and 100. Hence, rational people are said to think in shades of grey.\n \n Faith says that something is either 0% likely or 100% likely. Hence, faith-oriented people are said to think in black and white.\n \n To combine reason and faith would be to start thinking like this: If something is shown by reason to be 51% certain, you jump to the conclusion that it is 100% certain. That is not rational, so it leaves reason out of the question.\n \n If you want to know about reasoned faith, then ask the pothead who invented the winner-take-all voting system.",
