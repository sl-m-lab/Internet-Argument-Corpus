   "Circumcision was connected with the Mosaic Law. Those who were circumcised in Old Testament times were considered part of Israel: they could participate in the Passover (Ex 12:43-49) and were required to keep the Law (Gal 5:3). Jesus' death and resurrection fulfilled the obligations of the Law and thus freed people from its rituals and external regulations (Lk 22:20, Heb 8:6-13, 9:15), so circumcision is no longer required. Not only Paul, but Peter, James and the other apostles and leaders agreed to make this official doctrine (Acts 15). Their decision was not arbitrary, but was based on Peter's vision from God and observation that the Holy Spirit was given to the uncircumcised (Acts 10:1-11:18).",
