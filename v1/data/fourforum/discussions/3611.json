   "It seems that whenever the election comes down to 1 state, and a Republican ends up winning it, Democrats bring out the lawyers and fight that state with all their might.\n \n Why didn't Democrats challenege New Hampshire in 2000? Because it wouldn't give them enough votes to win. \n \n George Bush lost New Mexico by some 350 odd votes in 2000. Did he refuse to allow the state to go for Kerry? No, he had the character to admit defeat.\n \n Now, when all the Democrats can cling to is a 1/300 chance of eeking out a win in Ohio (assuming Kerry wins at least 85% of provisional and absentee ballots), they plan to inundate the state with lawyers. Boston Red Sox owners have already offered to fly Kerry's lawyer to Ohio for free on their team jet. Will we ever have an election without lawyers and the threat of recounts?\n \n If all provisional and absentee ballots are counted and Bush still holds a 100,000+ lead, will the Democrats finally give up or will they demand recounts like they did in 2000?\n \n I couldn't help but laugh at John Edwards' speech early this morning. He was introduced as \"the next Vice President of the United States\". His speech consisted of about 6o words and 2 minutes of holding his thumb up to the crowd. Can't Kerry and Edwards admit they had a good run, but it just wasn't good enough? No candidate in the last 30 years has received over 50% of the popular vote, that is until this year when Bush received 51%, over a 3.5 million vote lead.\n \n I can't wait to hear Democrats come up with their conspiracy theories about this election. I know I can count on Ted Kennedy, Michael Moore, and Tom Harkin.",
