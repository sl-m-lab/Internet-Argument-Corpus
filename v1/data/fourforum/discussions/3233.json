   "From:\n http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/19/hastert.remark/index.html\n \nWhen a reporter asked Hastert if he thought al Qaeda would operate with more comfort if Kerry were elected, the speaker said, \"That's my opinion, yes.\"\n\n \n So what do \"the terrorists\" have to say?\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,114489,00.html\n \nIn its statement, Abu Hafs al-Masri said it was calling a truce in Spain to give the socialist government that was elected Sunday, three days after the train attacks, time to carry out its pledge to withdraw troops from Iraq.\n \n The group appeared to boast it had the power to change governments.\n \n \"We change and destroy countries,\" the statement said. \"We even influence the international economy, and this is God's blessing to us.\"\n \n The statement tells American voters that Abu Hafs al-Masri supports the re-election campaign of President Bush: \"We are very keen that Bush does not lose the upcoming elections.\"\n \n The statement said Abu Hafs al-Masri needs what it called Bush's \"idiocy and religious fanaticism\" because they would \"wake up\" the Islamic world.\n\n Abu Hafs al-Masri is purported to be responsible for the Madrid Train bombings and at one point was second in command of al-Qaeda.\n http://www.specialoperations.com/Terrorism/Terrorist_Groups/Abu_Haf.htm\n http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Abu%20Hafs%20al-Masri\n http://www.emergency-management.net/abu_hafs_terror.htm\n \n So, we hear one side about what the terrorists want from Dennis Hastert and the other side from Abu Hafs al-Masri. Which one do you believe? Is there any reverse psychology at play?",

   "Look at this way, the US people currently feel that Bush is the man for getting rid of terrorists, correct? So which party does Hastert belong to? I bet republican. Now lets see the track record. AQ's top man is on the loose, Terrorist acts are up in the last 2 years, AQ recruitment is up, anti US sentiment is up in the ME. \n \n So it would seem one person is playing politics to get the person they want elected. The other is stating a strong opinion. You decide which.",
