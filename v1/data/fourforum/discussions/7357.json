   "EDITORIAL DESK \n \n Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and His Helpers \n Published: December 10, 2005\n The kind of lucky breaks President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela has been getting lately could tempt even a modest man -- and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez is no modest man -- to dream grandiose dreams. High oil prices, a terminally inept opposition and the Bush administration's scandalous neglect of its Western Hemisphere neighbors have left the field wide open for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to bully people at home, buy friends abroad and annoy Washington at every turn. \n Since first taking office in 1999, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has pushed through a new Constitution that lets him rule as a quasi dictator. He has marginalized Congress, undermined judicial independence and prosecuted political opponents. By tightening control of the national oil company, he has been able to use high world oil prices to increase funds for popular social programs for the poor, making him electorally unassailable. That dangerous concentration of power will most likely worsen after last Sunday's Congressional election, in which parties allied to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez won every one of the 167 seats. The opposition can blame only itself because it boycotted the polls even after its demands for stricter ballot secrecy were met. \n \n \n That petulant idiocy frustrated regional diplomats who had pressed the secrecy demand on the opposition's behalf, and it mystified and disenfranchised Venezuelan voters who had wanted a choice at the polls. Even without the boycott, pro-Ch\u00e1vez parties would have won a majority. But now not a single opposition voice will be heard in Congress, and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez is free to do whatever he likes. \n \n A month earlier, at the Summit of the Americas in Argentina, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez cavorted before crowds of anti-Washington protesters and networked with his fellow Latin American presidents. He is hoping that either Argentina or Brazil will sell him a nuclear reactor, a step that would be a very bad idea considering Venezuela's burgeoning friendship with Iran and the excessive indulgence Caracas has shown toward Iranian nuclear ambitions. \n \n Meanwhile, Washington's hemispheric influence continues to dwindle, partly because President Bush has not been attentive enough to Mexico on immigration, Brazil on agricultural subsidies and Argentina on debt restructuring. \n \n The United States should not further feed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's ego and give him more excuses for demagogy by treating him as clumsily as it has treated his hero and role model, Fidel Castro, for the past four and a half decades. Instead, Washington needs to compete more deftly and actively with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez for regional influence, and look for ways to work with the hemisphere's other democracies to revive the multiparty competitive democracy that has now just about ceased to exist in Venezuela.",

   "I like how this article manages to make it a bad thing that Chavez has massive popular support and is using oil wealth to help the poorest people, not just in his own country but throughout the region. The claim that the constitution gives him dictatorial powers is unsupported. The claim that all the parties in congress are Chavez supporters in likewise unfouded. It is true that they are all broadly in favour of the bolivarian revolutionary policies, but more than a few loathe Chavez with a passion.\n \n I find it odd that the US press has so much time to spend on digging up dirt on democratically elected South American socialists and so little to spend on the likes of Silvio Berlusconi, where corruption and abuse of power are far more blatant. But then Berlusconi is a US ally...",
