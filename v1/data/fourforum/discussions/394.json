   "As one of the 4 quotes (that generally exceed the length of his entire message) Debater lists one that he attributes to Thomas Jefferson without any further information as to the source.\n \nFor God's sake, let us freely hear both sides!\n\n But in the context of Debater's usual arguments on this board, one might presume that he is trying to imply that somehow a \"side\" that he favors is not being given a fair hearing. It seems to be an echo of the oft expressed creationist cry that it is only fair that if a scientific theory that they oppose on religious grounds is presented in science class, i.e., evolution, then their side should also be presented on a equal basis with science.\n \n I thought it might be of some interest to understand Jefferson's motivations behind the above quote.\n \n After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief. Apparently on some occasions, Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jefferson's agent for payment. Jefferson would then, from time to time, settle accounts with Mr. Dufief.\n \n That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled, Sur la Cr\u00e9ation du Monde, un Syst\u00eame d'Organisation Primitive. Jefferson had seen notice of the book's publication and presumed it to be \"...either a geological or astronomical work.\" He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment. Thus, Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen. Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson, as was his custom, and paid for the book.\n \n But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community. From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion. I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted. The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter. At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newton's Principia to his balance of $4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia.\n \n Here are Jefferson's comments on the case of Mr. Dufief from a letter of April 19, 1814.\n \nI am really mortified to be told that, in the United States of America, a fact like this can become a subject of inquiry, and of criminal inquiry too, as an offence against religion; that a question about the sale of a book can be carried before the civil magistrate. Is this then our freedom of religion? and are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold, and what we may buy? And who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens? Whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched? Is a priest to be our inquisitor, or shall a layman, simple as ourselves, set up his reason as the rule for what we are to read, and what we must believe? It is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational beings or not, and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand the test of truth and reason. If M. de Becourt's book be false in its facts, disprove them; if false in its reasoning, refute it. But, for God's sake, let us freely hear both sides, if we choose.\n\n Debater's quote is in bold. Notice that there is no explanation mark in Jefferson's letter. Neither are the omissions indicated with ellipses. Not a big deal, but I spent a lot of years in academia being very careful of things like that.\n \n But notice that Jefferson is not protesting that another side of an argument is not allowed to be presented. His objection is that he is being denied the opportunity to seek other views, if he should so desire, on religious grounds. Jefferson is objecting to censorship of scientific information by the imposition of religious dogma. Jefferson objects that the science was condemned and an attempt was made to censor it based on presumed ideas divined from the title alone. In other words, the science was condemned without a hearing.\n \n So the question is if every view should be presented in our schools just because there are some people who hold that view? Jefferson objected to religious dogma that attempted to prevent him from considering other views. Are creationists prevented from holding their views today? Are they brought into court because they teach these views in their homes and churches? In fact, creationist views did have a full hearing and were rejected between 150 to 200 years ago. Those scientists who began the rejection were Christians who believed in the Creation. But they found that an investigation of nature showed that the Bible is not a record of the events.\n \n Historically, creationists tried to prevent the teaching of current scientific theories in public schools and to replace it with their religious dogma. When they were unsuccessful, they argued that it is only fair that their religion be presented as a scientific theory; that both sides be presented, modern science and rejected mythology. When that didn't work, creationists fell back to a position of an unnamed designer that should be introduced as science.",

   "Letter to Peter Carr \n \n 4. Religion. Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object. In the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty & singularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather than that of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of error may be too serious. On the other hand, shake off all the fears & servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. You will naturally examine first, the religion of your own country. Read the Bible, then as you would read Livy or Tacitus. The facts which are within the ordinary course of nature, you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy & Tacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor, in one scale, and their not being against the laws of nature, does not weigh against them. But those facts in the Bible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so strong, as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change in the laws of nature, in the case he relates. For example, in the book of Joshua, we are told, the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should class it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, &c. But it is said, that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine, therefore, candidly, what evidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your inquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand, you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on its axis, as the earth does, should have stopped, should not, by that sudden stoppage, have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time gave resumed its revolution, & that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of the earth's motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the law of probabilities? You will next read the New Testament. It is the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the opposite pretensions: 1, of those who say he was begotten by God, born of a virgin, suspended & reversed the laws of nature at will, & ascended bodily into heaven; and 2, of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind, who set out without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them, and was punished capitally for sedition, by being gibbeted, according to the Roman law, which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping, & the second by exile, or death in fure\u00e2. See this law in the Digest Lib. 48. tit. 19. \u00a7. 28. 3. & Lipsius Lib 2. de cruce. cap. 2. These questions are examined in the books I have mentioned under the head of religion, & several others. They will assist you in your inquiries, but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading them all.",
