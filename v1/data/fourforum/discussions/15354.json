   "Here's a conundrumy question for you, what are \"conservatives\" all about these days? This might seem to be an unlikely question to devolve into a conundrum. After all, conservatives pride themselves on being down-to-earth realists who have no truck with an airy-fairy intellectualizing of the issues, or a postmodernist questioning of traditional beliefs. They claim to be guileless straight shooters, about everything but most especially about themselves. However, Glenn Beck and his ideological ilk are no modern-day Edmund Burkes, shall we say. No, there seems to be a good bit more to the mind-set that goes by the euphemistic sobriquet \"conservative\" than just a prudent adherence to the principle of conserving society's stability by conserving its social, cultural, and political tradition. \n \n Ours has been dubbed the Information Age, but it could just as aptly be called the Misinformation Age, for a great many things today are misrepresented to the \"information\" consuming public, even by their very names. Ours is an age direly in need of what Confucius called the \"rectification of names\"! Ambiguity of nomenclature, intellectual dishonesty, and euphemistic doublespeak reign. And in line with this culture of equivocation we find that the question \"What are conservatives all about\" can apparently be about as much of a puzzler as \"What is the matrix?\", or the Theban Sphinx's riddle to travelers, or Pilot's rhetorical question to Jesus (\"What is truth?\") - that is, if you naively take the word \"conservative\" too literally, let's critically think outside the literalistic box.\n \n Okeydokey then, so let's first of all take a look at what \"conservatives\" purport to be. Conservatives unctuously claim to be advocates and upholders of society's normative \"first principles\", i.e. of values - of core, moral, and family values. They seek to legislate our private behavior, and set public policy for us based upon their professed commitment to the soundness of old-fashioned morality. They hold themselves forth to us as the party of rectitude and righteousness, the rectitude & righteousness that a society's foundation needs to be made of if it wishes to stand. But if we empirically test the truth of this self-representation do we find that it holds up, at all?\n \n To answer that one these days you need only read the newspaper or tune into Entertainment Tonight. Iconic Republican Arnold The Governator Schwarzenegger and his sexual shenanigans serves as an emblematic cautionary tale of conservative hypocrisy. Emblematic in the sense that his fall from the grace his party claims a monopoly on is hardly an isolated incident. Rather, it links up with the right's pronounced pattern of public spiritedness belying corrupt politics, of principles belying the preachy patronizing of middle-class sensibilities, of righteousness belying self-righteousness, and of morality belying a penchant for moralizing. \n \n As we all know now, The Inseminator, as he might now be known, despite choosing to sign on with the party of conservative preachers and moralizers, was not exactly a paragon of family values in real life. Then again, perhaps he was. After all, he might argue that he believes in family so much that he created a second one, complete with a baby mama and offspring. Unfortunately though his second, illicit family was concurrent with his for-public-consumption family. This makes it rather hard to buy that the talk his party talks is anything he's genuinely committed to walking. \n \n Now then, conservatives might glibly retort that Herr ex-governor Schwarzenegger was a moderate Republican, not a card-carrying conservative, and that his sins should therefore not be used to question the truthfulness of the conservative camp's holier-than-thou hype. This is a somewhat lame cop-out however, as it's the case that Arnie was embraced by the right, if not the light. You can't adopt and ballyhoo him as your telegenic standard bearer and symbol today, and then just disown him when it comes out that his personal life is another nail in the ready-to-be-buried coffin of your party's sanctimonious self-advertising. \n \n At any rate, even if misbehav'n-on-the-sly Schwarzenegger isn't the best piece of ammo to shoot holes in conservative hypocrisy with, we have plenty of other examples, the currently outstanding one being ole serial adulterer Newton Leroy Gingrich, aka Newt. With congressman Newt we do in fact have a fire-breathing conservative whose repeated hypocrisy should make us critically question the authenticity of where his moralizing comes from.\n \n But if we can't take conservatives at the face value of their word about where their moral staunchness stems from then to what in the conservative psyche might it truly be traced back? I have a bit of personal speculation about this that I'll go out on a limb to share. \n \n I'll just give it to you straight-out. It's always struck me that folks on the right seem to have an underlying alpha male (and female) mentality that thinks in terms of strong and weak, superior and inferior. For instance, this comes through the thin veil of their ideology when a conservative speaks about welfare recipients and others not making it in our capitalist economy as if they're abject weak links; as if they're all weak in the character department, i.e. lacking a \"strong\" work ethic, initiative, and the right stuff to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. \n \n It really does seem to be the case that from the conservative's alpha perspective the poor look to be inferior drags on the economy, who should be shown no quarter with \"entitlement\" programs and a livable minimum wage. The winners of the system, the rich, on the other hand, are admired for being the sort of alpha dogs that we should all aspire to emulate in the ferally dog-eat-dog system of capitalism. Capitalism itself is the conservative's ideal system because it's one in which individuals can seek social alpha status through the attainment of economic dominance over their fellow man, none of that namby-pamby egalitarianism that's for the weaker-poorer members of society.\n \n Now as for the conservative's fondness for moralizing, well, moralizing is just another way of asserting your superiority over others, and of expressing your primitive alpha attitudes. The tendency of the moralist to interpret and cast everything in terms of right & wrong, good & bad, moral excellence and moral shame, really psychologically boils down to a black & white mind-set whose two basic categories are strong and weak. And every time the moralist puts his neighbor down for being morally weak he's tacitly touting his own moral strength and dominance. \n \n But since the real psychological imperative operating here, operating with moralistic conservatives, is merely to enjoy a sense of being stronger and better than others, not a sincere and morally-driven desire to be genuinely \"good\", surprise surprise, they frequently don't live the lives of more profoundly moral people. No, unlike an earnestly ethical individual, the Ten Commandments-thumping conservative tries have the cake of moral probity in public and furtively eat it too, with sexually available maids, and mistresses, and anonymous men in airport bathroom stalls. In other words, rather than being the real deal when it comes to ethicality, the conservative is engaged in efforts to push his morals on society as an unconscious means to the end of boosting his alpha male's ego, and of exercising social and cultural dominance.\n \n Staying with Newt and the unconscious, alpha mentality of the conservative, but moving on to another rotten plank in the right's political platform, I think that we find that what I've been saying also goes a long way in explaining why conservatives take the side of the economic elite against the working class, and support policies that benefit large corporations and Wall Street firms at the expense of the little guy. The conservative is passionately gung-ho to deregulate the power players of the economy not merely because he's been co-opted by their money, but because his alpha mentality admires their power-dominance and prefers to identify with predatory fat cats rather than their prey, the proletarian underdog.\n \n Oh sure, conservative politicians claim to be defenders of the workingperson against big government and high taxes, but as a matter of course and of perverse principle they sell out John and Jane Q. Taxpayer to big business by giving megacorporations and the superrich the juicy tax cuts and to the working poor goes all the pain. And these days conservatives also have retired working-class seniors targeted for some pain, making moves to abolish Medicare and leave millions of its elderly recipients without the health insurance they may need to stay alive. But then blue-collar old folks are more weak links that the alpha mentality has little use or consideration for. \n \n Alas then, it's not at all hyperbole to say that a conservative politico who bills himself as being pro-workingman while trying to dismantle the workingman's social safety net and destroy labor unions is certainly a fraud, and behind this fraudulence lurks the same dominance-oriented worldview that manifests as conservative moralism. \n \n Nope, it would not it be an over-the-top rhetorical analogy to say that a pimp who claims to be a feminist because he advocates a woman's right to offer her body for sexual exploitation has a certain hypocritical chutzpah in common with the conservative who claims to be a champion of the struggling-to-make-ends-meet masses because he advocates a worker's right to be exploited by his employer without the protection of labor unions, and to end up on the street without a welfare check when his job is outsourced to a Third World sweatshop. \n \n But then again, I suppose it's only technically hypocrisy if conservative officeholders are being on the level with themselves, and dishonest with their constituents. A part of being a morally superior conservative, however, is not admitting to yourself that you're just an individual with a Neanderthaloid alpha mentality who unpityingly looks down on the less fortunate and allies himself with the dominant members of society. That is, the intellectual catch-22 is that to some extent you have to make yourself believe the philosophical rhetoric you spout or you don't get to enjoy the superior feeling that's the emotional payoff of being an upright and uptight conservative. To put it in somewhat Freudian terms, your ego's alpha mentality has to pretty much work on the down-low with your superego; for should the game you're playing become a conscious one, then your conscience won't let you claim the prize of a conservative's sterling self-image.\n \n So, to recap and answer the question, \"What are conservatives all about?\", a \"conservative\" is someone whose take on morality, culture issues, politics, and economics originates from the dark side of the human mentality, a side still stuck in the darkness of the caves our prehistoric ancestors sheltered in, where strong equaled good and weak equaled bad. The conservative is someone who applies this troglodytic template in analyzing modern societal issues such as poverty and family, with the result that the homeless, unwed mothers on welfare, etc. are viewed as bums and losers deficient in strength of character. To the conservative mind such people merit no compassionate response from society, and so the Fox News-watching, Limbaugh-listening, Republican-voting conservative adamantly opposes all so-called \"entitlement\" programs and \"social engineering\", including Medicare and social security. In essence, the conservative is a throwback to the uncompassionate, Darwinian alpha male who saw no reason to care for the weaker members of the clan. \n \n The Stone-Age alpha male's only solution for every problem was to assert his dominance, often by violence, and eliminate any weak links or threats. Which by the way also explains something else about conservatives, i.e. their hawkishness, their inclination to use and support the military, as well as their preference for controlling their community's poor with police and prisons rather than trying to remedy the sociological causes of crime and the drug trade. Today's alpha male & female wields a cop's baton and a cruise missile rather than a caveman's club, but the fundamental approach and attitude of mind is the same. What the alpha conservative is really all about is dealing with the world from a position of crude strength rather than understanding and compassion. The conservative is a psychologically atavistic specimen who should be given tolerance, the same tolerance we're all due, but not the tiniest whit of validation or legitimacy. \n \n \n \n (Please pardon the unorthodox prolixity of my post. Thank you.)\n \n emoticon_smile",

   "By the way, if you're a conservative and you can make a convincing case that none of the above applies to you, you have my sincere apologies. However, I'd be quite interested to read and critique your case, as I've yet to read a conservative who's made a very convincing case for the intellectual legitimacy of the conservative mentalit\u00e9.\n \n emoticon_smile",
