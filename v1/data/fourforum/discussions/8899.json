   "Kirghizia opposition threatens to take people out to the streets again. And no one is trying to hide the fact of funding of the opposition movements by US sponsors. \n It was really surprising what our mp Becknazarov did. He made law enforcement structures subject to severe criticism. According to his opinion their fight for security of own nation and country is 'antigovernmental'! Becknazarov thinks that war to prevent acts of terrorism must be soft and fluffy! Bull ####, I think that this machinery have to work fast and effectively. The result of this work (calm living in my country) is main thing I think but not fulcrum.\n IMO he said this to please those who're interested in our weakness? In chaos in the south of the country and instability near borders of China? Russia and Iran. I think only USA may benefit from it greatly or some of her allies. Further I guess the man was paid huge money imo for this provocation.\n Becknazarov doesn't care about possibility of act of terrorism realized on the market. He has personal guard and I think that he doesn't walk there for a long time. Americans disburse one more revolution because of they need to get our territories for new military bases creation.",
