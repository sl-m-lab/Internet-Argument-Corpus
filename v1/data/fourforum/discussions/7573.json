   "no, of course you, as an individual, affect your soul development. just as your body is affected by what you eat and how you exercise, and develops accordingly, so your soul develops by the moral decisions you make, and your inner motivations to do either good or bad. you body mind and soul are all connected, but can develop totally independently. your muscular physique, for example, has absolutely no relation to your education or intellect. see how that works?\n However I don't see olympic atheletes sitting a written example, nor have I ever had to prepare for the physical portion of a maths test however I understand its very hard to get a decent analogy here, I'm struggling as well to think of one.\n Perhaps a spiritual report card? We ourselves do not write them, but our actions with regard to other things shift them to being good or bad, however there are still issues here, I'll see if they come up in the next bit.\n \n \n\n its like this. youre made up of three interconnected yet independent parts. body, mind and soul. the development or any does not affect the development of the other parts. in soul development, the more \"moral experience\" you have determines how \"mature\" your soul is. i put mature in quotes, because a mature soul is not the deciding factor with god, but a pure soul, which is a different dimension of devellopment altogether. a pure soul is one that is guided completely by its moral compass, or what is referred to as the holy spirit. communication between your soul and spirit is a different \"language\" if you will, in the way that speech is a different \"language\" from nervous impulses, which your body is fluent in but makes little sense to your mind. however, the meaning of what is communicated in your spirit can also be transferred to your mind and vice versa. that is why you can \"learn\" moral purity, by meditation, reading religious teachings, etc.\n Then how is judging people (the mind) by their actions and beleifs (soul) any different from judging it on its body? Sure, in some cicumstances you can draw some conclusions (i.e that a fat guy might be lazy) but then there are situations like Stephen Hawking and suchlike. Unless the Soul mirrors the mind exactly, there is little point punishing - the mind is dead by then and is neither detered by the threat or made to face the consquences. Does the soul take over from the mind upon death, and the body on reaching an afterlife? I can see how a mind can exist independantly of the other two (we don't really know if we have souls now, and transferring minds into computers, robot bodies, etc is a staple of scifi) but we consider the body to just be dumb matter and essentially just dispose of it once the mind has gone.\n How could my soul be comparable to an early fetus' soul in any way that we would recognise? I have memories and thoughts that it never developed the ability to have, and yet presumably we can communicate in heaven - clearly the soul is very different thing to what I consider 'me' to be and doesn't opperate in ways we can understand. The mind seems to be the only self aware part of me and it is not aware of the soul, even if the soul is self aware at some point, because its not the mind it isn't me, its just a vague record of how I acted or a completely different being. \n \n I'm a bit confused by the spirit as well as the soul being added in - is this the 'body' for the soul's 'mind'?\n \n\n its a lot to absorb, kinda thrown together, but ill try and elaborate on anything youd like to have clarified\n Thanks, its this aspects of religion that I find interesting, confusing and often a little bizarre, but certainly interesting.",

(\"lightness\" and \"darkness\" are just figurative, and nothing to do with the soul's color, since its invisible :))\n \n when you die, your soul's purity cannot change any more, and it permanently remains in the last state it was before you died. dark soul's are condemned and sent with other dark souls to hell for eternity, and light souls are sent to heaven\n \n there are basically 2 ways to reverse the effects of bad moral decisions, i.e., to make a \"dark\" soul become \"light\" again. the first method is attonement. this method requires doing good deeds and making good moral decisions to neutralize the bad moral decisions made in the past. as more good deeds are done, the overall alignment of the sould shifts from dark to light. think of it as paying back a loan through installments over a period of time. the second method is repentance through jesus christ. this is, of course, a christian trademark. this method requires you to confess the bad moral deeds, or \"sins\" you've done, and through faith ask god to forgive your sins. this immediately cleanses your soul. think of it as having a loan written off and your credit restored\n \n hopefully this explains the whole idea a bit better\n \n \nI'm a bit confused by the spirit as well as the soul being added in - is this the 'body' for the soul's 'mind'?\n Thanks, its this aspects of religion that I find interesting, confusing and often a little bizarre, but certainly interesting.\n\n good question. often the words \"spirit\" and \"soul\" are interchangeable. however, if a distinction is to be made, you said it best: a \"body\" for the soul's \"mind\". i personally feel iffy about how the spirit fits into the whole picture. apparently, spirits manifest themselves in the supernatural realm, walking around haunting houses or appearing in dreams or speaking thru psychics. belief in spirits and how they manifest themselves is the root of many superstitions and quite honestly, i dont think they have a lot to do with the philosophy of morality. sorry i cant elaborate more about that",

   "Just looked them up on google: the RSV makes the former \n 'Psa 58:3 The wicked go astray from the womb, they err from their birth, speaking lies.'\n \n Here 'from the womb' could mean 'from having been in the womb', as is shown by the confusion with your version (where the translations of 'from birth' and 'from the womb' seem to be reversed, so that you connect speaking lies with being in the womb, which is literally impossible)\n \n And the latter:\n 'Psa 51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.'\n \n Obviously both of these things could comment on the Psalmist's mother, not him. Either a sex taboo or personal failing: David was certainly descended from a Moabite (and thus should not have been let into the Temple, technically), on his father's side, I don't know about his mother\n \n\n \n Ok, good point. You actually might be right. But honestly, alot has happened in the Bible which is \"literally is impossible\", like, how about a donkey TALKING??! \n \n Doesn't explain this verse though: Jeremiah 1:5\n \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\"\n \n And to say, \"Oh, well that's because Jeremiah was special\" actually contradicts the Bible. God is not a respecter persons. Actually, when we get saved, we're all part of the body of Christ. \n \n You think God didn't know you when you were in the womb? God knows how many hairs are on our heads. He knows what we're going to say and do before we say and do those things. He knows our personalities before we're even alive. \n \n Galatians 1:15\n \"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace,\" (KJV)\n \n Paul was actually a guy who persecuted Christians. Obviously, he became a Christian. But for all the world knew, he was one of the worst sinners. You don't know the little guy who's inside of you. You don't have a clue what God has in store for him. \n \n God has great things in store for each and every one of His children. Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\" Also, God wants everyone to be saved: 1 Timothy 2:3&4, \"This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants ALL men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.\"  \n \n So since He wants everyone to be saved, He draws them: John 6:44, \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.\" \n \n So here's the point: everyone's life is important to God. You don't know what plans God has for that person.\n \n And how about this one: Psalm 139:16, \"Your eyes saw me when I was formless; all my days were written in Your book and planned before a single one of them began.\"\n \n Psalm 139:13, \"For it was You who created my inward parts; You knit me together in my mother's womb.\"\n \n Remember, God's not a respecter of persons.\n \n (Side point: kids sin all the time [disobeying/dishonoring their parents, stealing gum from the store] and yet the Bible says heaven belongs to them. So if someone is sinful in the womb, that doesn't mean they are going straight to hell.)",

I am no Bible scholar, but I can say this. The Bible is the revelation of God to us, in other words, what God wants us to know about Him and about the history of the world which is relevant to faith. And not only that, but it is what He wants us to know, in the form He wants us to know it. This is important. So, I think the Bible does more than merely tell us about the Word. A Theology textbook tells us about the Word, but the Bible is God's revelation to man of that Word, in the form, order and sense He wants to give it. Jesus is the Word incarnate, the message of God made into flesh, something much more powerful than what was passed down by God in the Old Testament. A renovation of that Word, if you will. The New Testament is the expression and projection of the Word as Christ as He himself passed it down to the Apostles, again, in the form, order and sense He willed.\n \n So yes, I think the Bible contains the Word of God, but it is a \"transcription\" of Jesus to paper, so that is why we need Holy Tradition to keep it meaningful, keep it touching us after so many years, in which the textual meaning of the words in the book may have changed.",

Original sin is NOT a sin, strictly speaking, as I said earlier, because it does not involve a free choice. It is like a mark, if you will, of what happened to humanity and is explained mtaphorically in the tale of Adam and Eve. That mark consists in that, after that original, first sin, we have been imprinted with the tendency to sin. This does not mean that we have become innately evil. It means that the freedom of action that God gave us (originally to make each good act perfect) was tainted, and people began to freely make bad choices, as you say. This tendency of our will, this \"opening of our eyes\" to evil is what we know as original sin. That original sin is cleansed by the sacrament of baptism, without which, rigorously, we cannot be saved. Baptism, obviously, does not free us from the tendency to make those bad choices, but it does wash out that first bad choice for which Adam and Eve were cast from Heaven by God.\n \n \nthis would mean that as we grow from a baby and become more knowledgable and intelligent, our tendancy to sin is unlocked, supposedly at what is known as the 'age of accountability'. then, we must suppress this tendancy to sin through the various religious rituals, such as salvation, repentance, baptism, meditation etc.\n \n i cant criticize your point because it makes sense. free will depends on decision making, and decision making depends on knowledge. however, this doesnt imply an original sin at all. for example, we could say that humans are born with a tendency to fall while walking. a fetus cannot fall while walking, for obvious reasons. however, as the individual develops, he must overcome the \"tendency\" to fall by learning to walk properly. after a while, walking without falling becames easier, because the individual has practiced and corrected himself enough times, and now knows how to overcome his falling tendencies\n\n \n What you say is true.

Why do you think the brain must be the seat of our soul? Is it because in the brain we find the functions of the mind (aka. intelligence and will)? Well, if this is our standard, then any brain incapable of developong intelligence or free will would make that person a soulless person (a concept which, following a coherent line of Christian thought, is contradictory). This means that, for example, 1 week old babies don't have souls and so it is religiously ethical to kill them, or that severely retarded people also fall into this category. \n \n This is of course ridiculous. The soul is not defined by science, it is a theological concept, and must therefore be defined through the canons and methods of that science, the science of the knowledge of God. I certainly don't care if it hasn't been proved scientifically that God exists, because God lies beyond the competence of science, and it doesn't affect my faith. The same goes for my belief that every person has a soul from conception.\n \n By the way, if the Bible says God made people in the womb, wouldn't that necessarily include a soul? How else does God create humans? Are we not something more to him than crude matter?\n \n \nI'd apreciate it if anyone could point me to any passages in the Bible where the act of forced miscarriage (e.g. abortion) is condemned. The lack of such a condemnation is surely significant.\n\n \n The Bible does not speak of abortion specifically (just like it doesn't mention cloning or gay marriage). But this does not mean Christianity has nothing to say on the subject. The Bible sets the base for the Christian doctrine of the absolute respect for the human person, and, being coherent with Christian thought, I doubt God would categorically differentiate feti from born humans for the sake of the comfort of an irresponsible girl or for the necessities of an overly individualistic society. \n \n [/QUOTE]Another question, out of curiousity and since Pejotif , you seem to have some thoughtful insight:\n \n \" this 'opening of our eyes' to evil is what we know as original sin\".\n \n Man being made in the image of God, did this 'opening of our eyes' make us more like God, or less like God?[/QUOTE]\n \n This is a very profound question. I'm afraid I don't know more theology than any other mildly faith-coherent Christian. However, it's important to remember that the tree from which Adam and Eve took the apple was called the Tree of Science (or at least in Spanish it is called \"\u00c1rbol de la Ciencia del Bien y del Mal\"), in orther words, the source of the knowledge needed to see good and evil. It is evident that before taking the fruit, Adam and Eve were more na\u00efve than we are, for they knew not of the existence of evil (of anything other than the will of God), and so, also, they were much happier. So, considering this, it makes us more like God to know evil, but it also makes us less than what we were because we are not as \"equipped\" as God to deal with that knowledge. This is why, knowing evil, we sin, while God, knowing it as well, obviously doesn't. This is original sin, that weakness before the knowledge of evil that makes us naturally capable to sin (to chose evil, even when we are seing it and know it for what it is).",

   "the aspiration to do \"good\", in terms of making the right decisions all the time, is common among everyone, religious or not. you could almost define joy itself as seeing all your decisions turn out to be right. even the act of helping others is based on a decision, and sometimes that act might not be the best decision, depending on the cost of helping that person, and the percieved returns\n\n \n Of course the act of helping is the result of a free decision, that is precisely the fact that makes acting like this so commendable. I'm sorry, but I cannot see how making a determination of the costs and percieved returns can be seen as a justified means of qualifying generosoty as a good or bad decision. Most generous acts are defined and make sense because they ignore this economic question entirely. Or would you say that a missionary's decision to live their entire life in a primitive jungle tribe to help people a bad choice because he made an incorrect assessment of how much we was spending and how much he would get in return? And I'm not just talking about money.\n \n \ni disagree. the bible fails miserably when it comes to being a guide on what is right and wrong. there are areas in the bible where the very things that god commanded against are the things god commanded people to do, such as killing and stealing. therefore, even in the bible there is no such thing as objective morality. if anything can be said about biblical objective morality, it is that whatever the person who claims to hear the instruction of god says is right, thats what is right at the time. if you like i can give you a bunch of examples where morality is consistently subjective to the whims of god, or more accurately to the whims of the jewish leader at the time that claimed to hear from god\n\n \n I agree with you, these incoherences are precisely the reason for why, in Catholicisim, the Bible is not the only source of doctrine, it must be coupled with Tradition (that is, correct interpretation). However, since we are taking such a Protestant stance on saying what defines Christian doctrine, please tell me, if the Bible isn't the place from where the definition of right and wrong comes from, where does it come from?",

   "Someone is going to post something from Exodus soon which will be inaccurate and have nothing to do with abortion. \n\n \n \"And if men strive [fight] together, and hurt a pregnant woman, so that her fruit [children] come out, and yet no harm follows; the one who hit her shall surely be fined, according as the woman's husband shall impose upon him; and he shall pay a fine as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth \" (Exodus 21:22-23)\n \n Given that the rate of successfully carrying a fetus from conception to term and then healthy birth in those days was probably less than 50%, it seems impossible to believe that a fetus driven out prematurely by a violent act could ever be thought to survive. A typical human pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, any child leaving it's mother during the first 37 of those 40 weeks requires special medical attention unavailable to the Hebrews wandering in the desert. So, at very least, 92% of the time (37 weeks out of 40) when a woman of that day were forced to labor prematurely, the birth would be stillborn. A significant portion of the remaining 8% could be assumed to likewise be stillborn or die soon after birth.\n \n Because of this fact, I read a presumption in this passage from Exodus, that any \"fruit\" forced out of it's mother prior to term (especially caused by a violent) act would be assumed to be stillborn or die soon after birth. If it did survive and there was no harm caused to the child, what would be the basis for ANY fine? The act resulted in a healthy birth! Matzeltov! \n \n The subject of harm in the statemtn \"if any harm follows\", appears to be ambiguos, but it needn't be. From the perspective of the writers of Exodus there is only one person involved being harmed: the woman, and thus no need to be more specific - it requires assuming ambiguity in the text to interpret it as meaning that a child is also invovled. The simplest and most straight forwards way of reading this is: because it's imposible to impose \"eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" justice against a man who connot be pregnant, that man must be made to pay a fine for this harm he casued, but in addition to that fine you are still subject to retribution in the form of \"eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" for other harms done. \n \n The fact that other laws from other cultures of the region at the time of Exodus were similar to my above reading, strengthens my argument that my reading is indeed what the Hebrews meant when they articulatd this law.\n \n Other laws that the Hebrews would have been aware of at the time of Exodus:\n \n \"If a seignior struck a[nother] seignior's daughter and has caused her to have a miscarriage [literally, caused her to drop that of her womb], he shall pay ten shekels of silver for her fetus. If that woman had died, they shall put his daughter to death.\" (Code of Hammurabi (209, 210)) \n \"If anyone causes a free woman to miscarry [literally, drives out the embryo]-if (it is) the 10th month, he shall give 10 shekels of silver, if (it is) the 5th month, he shall give 5 shekels of silver...\" (Hittite Laws, (1.17)) \n \n \n ---",

   " Why do you think the brain must be the seat of our soul? Is it because in the brain we find the functions of the mind (aka. intelligence and will)? \n\n \n Yes in part, but also because no where else in life do we call life a person when the brain is no longer functioning (the debate over abortion being the exception).\n \n \n Well, if this is our standard, then any brain incapable of developong intelligence or free will would make that person a soulless person \n\n \n You added \"intelligence\" and \"free will\" as requisites. I don't.\n \n A body with a functioning brain (indicated by the presence of brain waves) could be in a coma (no intelligence and no free will) and this body still supports a soul.\n \n \n The soul is not defined by science, it is a theological concept, and must therefore be defined through the canons and methods of that science, the science of the knowledge of God. \n\n \n \"the knowledge of God\" does not qualify as a science unless there are claims that you can make that are testable and results that are measurable. This direction in argument sounds like it would lead to an \"appeal to authority\" type of reasoning. \n \n I agree however that having a definition for what the \"soul\" is, would be helpful to clarify a debate.\n \n I define the soul as the \"energy\" that exists when the brain is functioning. I realize that this definition begs-the-question, but I can't think of a better definition to describe what is a admittedly faith-based concept.\n \n \n \n I certainly don't care if it hasn't been proved scientifically that God exists, because God lies beyond the competence of science, and it doesn't affect my faith. The same goes for my belief that every person has a soul from conception.\n\n \n That's justifiable. It's also a reason why government can not pass constitutionally defensible laws that rely on the idea that a zygote is a person, because this idea is faith-based and controversial. Laws made emerging from the idea that a collection of stem cells can satisfy the legal definition of \"person\", would be capricious and inevitably degrade to an \"I know life when I see it\" rule of law. \n \n \n By the way, if the Bible says God made people in the womb, wouldn't that necessarily include a soul? \n\n \n Yes, of course. After weeks of development in the womb, the life that God has been forming eventually gets to the point where it has tissues and systems, a nevous system and an endocrine system, and a brain eventually that brain becomes capable of supporting a soul, and at that time in the womb, with a spark of electricity, the soul and the flesh become united. \n \n \n \n So, considering this, it makes us more like God to know evil, but it also makes us less than what we were because we are not as \"equipped\" as God to deal with that knowledge. This is why, knowing evil, we sin, while God, knowing it as well, obviously doesn't. This is original sin, that weakness before the knowledge of evil that makes us naturally capable to sin (to chose evil, even when we are seing it and know it for what it is).\n\n \n Thank you. This is a very satisfying and well thought out answer.\n \n It makes me wonder about the nature of evil and objective morals if it's the awareness of evil that counts.\n \n Animals can do evil things; a cat for instance will play with its living prey before eventually killing it, but we do not judge the cat since it is not aware of good and evil. If both Adam and Eve were likewise unaware of evil and good, might they have commited many evil acts while in the garden of eden, and similarly been held exempt from judgement.\n \n \n ---",

A person who is genomically XY, might be hormonally XX, or vice vera. Puberty is hard enough to go through without this added stress. Such people going through correctional operations, really deserve our support, not more humiliation. Imagine how much pain there would be involved in removing your genitals and replacing them with new ones? Openning up a vagina, where there wasn't one before? Amazing. People do not volunteer to go through these operations and subsequent drug therapies without serious reasons.\n \n Another more dramatic example of sexual ambiguity, is a condition called chimerism. It's very rare in humans, but occassionally during a pregnancy, if there are more than one zygote in the womb, such as is the case where there are twins, it's possible for the zygotes to become fused together during development. This results in a single person at birth with two distinct genomes. If one of those genomes is XX and the other XY, the result is one person who is biologically both male and female at the same time.\n \n So it's completely understandable that sex changes are needed.",

   "Well, let's just see what the Honorable Pastor Harry Hardwick has to say about God's view on Abortion.\n \n \nIt is true that the Bible contains no verses prohibiting voluntary abortion. That, in and of itself, shows that it is a sin. The only references to abortion in the Bible are to coerced abortion as a punishment for nonbelievers, sinners and those who fail to recognize God's chosen people. In Second Kings, we learn that Menahem, leader of the Israelites, smote all the people who refused to follow him \"and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up\" (2 Kings 15:16). Later, in Hosea, we learn that because the land of Samaria rejected God, \"Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up\" (Hosea 13:16). Hosea decided to carry out God's vengeance on the people by killing the unborn babies carried by the heathen women. He promised to \"slay even the beloved fruit of their womb\" (Hosea 9:16). <snip<\n\n \n http://www.landoverbaptist.org/sermons/abortion.html",

   "Yes in part, but also because no where else in life do we call life a person when the brain is no longer functioning (the debate over abortion being the exception).\n \n You added \"intelligence\" and \"free will\" as requisites. I don't.\n \n A body with a functioning brain (indicated by the presence of brain waves) could be in a coma (no intelligence and no free will) and this body still supports a soul.\n\n \n Your theory about the brain being the seat of the soul is quite interesting, and is very difficult to argue with. However, I think that the fault of this theory is that it is mixing different categories being. One is the physicial, (the body, including the brain) and the other is the metaphysical (the soul). To attempt a complete defintion of either using categories inherent to the knowledge of the other is an error of method. It is contradictory to the concept of soul to attempt to give it a localised, punctual \"seat\" in the body, because the soul, by definition, trascends the physicial (similar to the way God trascends the world). This does not mean that the body and the soul do not form, together, a unity, but that unity is a unity of physical and spiritual, meaning that the categories of the sciences of the physical world are inadequate for a complete understanding of the human person.\n \n \n\"the knowledge of God\" does not qualify as a science unless there are claims that you can make that are testable and results that are measurable. This direction in argument sounds like it would lead to an \"appeal to authority\" type of reasoning. \n\n \n Well, theology is a science, if we are working with a complete definition of Science. This is that science is the entirety and the methods of human knowledge. Thus, theology, law, economics. history or philosophy are also science. They are areas of human knowledge, each with their own methods of acquiring that knowledge. Then, we make a distinction between the empirical or physical sciences (those whose method is of experimentation and measuring), and the social or humanistic sciences, whose methods are different because they deal with unmeasurable factors (human freedom). \n \n \nI define the soul as the \"energy\" that exists when the brain is functioning. I realize that this definition begs-the-question, but I can't think of a better definition to describe what is a admittedly faith-based concept.\n\n \n Again, you make an error of method. The soul is a metaphysical entity, it is beyond the competence of the sicences and canons that study the physical world. You have admitted it is a faith-based concept, therefore a complete understanding of what a soul is is unattainable without faith (this is an instance in which we say faith and reason combine to give us knowledge).\n \n \nThat's justifiable. It's also a reason why government can not pass constitutionally defensible laws that rely on the idea that a zygote is a person, because this idea is faith-based and controversial. Laws made emerging from the idea that a collection of stem cells can satisfy the legal definition of \"person\", would be capricious and inevitably degrade to an \"I know life when I see it\" rule of law. \n\n \n However, my faith se aside, I think I prefer a law that makes what in law we call a legal fiction (something very common in law), and assumes that the fetus is a human being, so that we can protect them from harm (despite the scientific debate on its nature). It is preferrable for me a legal system that puts the debate aside and makes a legal assumption that the fetus is a person, and thus has rights. Why not take this step to protect them? Why do we prefer to leave them unprotected, when we know that they are necessarily human beings, that we were once feti, and that from those feti will come fully developed persons?\n \n \nYes, of course. After weeks of development in the womb, the life that God has been forming eventually gets to the point where it has tissues and systems, a nevous system and an endocrine system, and a brain eventually that brain becomes capable of supporting a soul, and at that time in the womb, with a spark of electricity, the soul and the flesh become united. \n\n \n Once again you make an error of method. I think you should not make statements claiming to understand the ways of God if you are not going to use the appropriate categories and methods to make such statements. THe ways of God are beyond physicis, medicine, etc., they are studied by a science called theology, that uses other canons. Theologically (the only science with enougth authority to make statements in this area), what you say is wrong, a fetus is created in the womb by God, and from its creation it is a son or daughter of God, and thus is relevant to God more than other soulless beings. Why would the Bible speak of creation in the womb if these creaturses are not already considered sons and daughters of God from conception? Why mention them if, as you say, they don't have souls and so are like a dog or a plant? They are mentioned because they are different, they have souls.\n \n \nIt makes me wonder about the nature of evil and objective morals if it's the awareness of evil that counts.\n\n \n It is not awareness of evil that counts, it is weakness before evil that counts. Evil is outside us, in the form of de the devil and the rebellion against God, which is also outside us. The reference for good is God, which is not subjective, He exists as a personal being outside and beyond us. The devil also, although of an inferior category. If we were not aware of evil that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but when we see it for what it is, original sin is that weakness before it.\n \n \nAnimals can do evil things; a cat for instance will play with its living prey before eventually killing it, but we do not judge the cat since it is not aware of good and evil. If both Adam and Eve were likewise unaware of evil and good, might they have commited many evil acts while in the garden of eden, and similarly been held exempt from judgement.\n\n \n No, they committed no evil in Eden because their action was not tainted by the knowledge of anything that wasn't God. They could not do any evil because, basically, they didn't know how. When they are faced with the knowledge of something contrary to God (the snake's proposition), their will was diminished, and they acted knowingly against God for the first time, and so they were cast from paradise, leaving us with that mark.",

   "it goes to show that good and bad are relative. if a burglar is fleeing the scene of a crime and stumbles over the fence as he runs, and you, being the helpful neighbor stops to help him, making sure he's alright and that all the goods that fell out of the sack he was carrying is gathered up and given back to him, then sends him on his way, is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n \n Helping a burglar is, overall, a bad thing, because you are helping a wrongdoer further his purposes. However, in the face of ignorance, there can be no absolute freedom to act, becuase you don't know all the factors at hand. In this way, you act out of a desire to do good, but you in fact to bad (see, it's not relative: you objectively do bad, depsite what you think).\n \n \nbut even tradition is not an objective standard, nor is it absolute. the official doctrine of the catholic church has revised significantly, for instance with the impact of evolution, and now with the gay rights issue.\n\n \n The official doctrine of the Catholic Church has never turned away from its primary canons, never. The fact that evolution or gay rights are happening now and have never happened before doens't mean that we must revise Catholic doctrine, it means that we must test those theories and claims against our faith, and what we must determine is if and how they agree with it. In this way, the Catholic Church accepts evolution with some restraints (the restraints that derive from a constant doctrine of faith), and it does not accept gay rights because they go against that doctrine. There is no revising here.\n \n \ncould it be that there is no such thing as absolute right and wrong, and that it is all relative? have you thought about that? why should we think that absolute morality even exists?\n\n \n I have thought about relativism, but it does not make any sense to me. If there is no absolute right or wrong, then how can we claim to say what is legal or ilegal, what is the basis of law? The mere whim of lawmakers? Or is there a common, suprerior desire for something which we all recognise as positive and worthwhile? I think there are objective standards for morality, because if not then we cannot tell anyone they are wrong without sounding like a tyrant, and this is unacceptable. Not everything that can be done should be done. This is true and evident.",

   " I agree! \n \n at some point during every pregnancy, probably after about 25 or 27 weeks, the meaningful qualities of what makes us people have been established in a living fetus and laws balancing the legal rights of the person in the womb and the person owning the womb are fully justifiable.\n\n from your definitin earlier, this would imply that an unborn baby has a soul, since you said that electrical activity in the brain is evidence that a soul resides there...\n \n \nMost of these things you list fall into general categories of behavior, and as such fundamental principals for good behavior laid out by God are applicable. \n \n But there are no fundamental principals in the Bible which answer the question: \"is the fetus a person\"?\n \n Moreover, all (or almost all) of the subjects that you mention above involve technolgies that did not exist at the time the Bible was written. \n \n This is not so in the case of abortion. \n \n Miscarriages happened then as they do now, and there's every reason to believe that women on occassion would voluntarily force themselves to have miscarriages. IN FACT - the subject of penalty against a man who causes a woman's involuntary miscarriage is handled in Exodus. Given this, I see no other plausible explanation for why God did not also address the very closely related issue of penalizing a woman who voluntarily forces her own miscarriage, other than there is no penalty for such an act. \n \n --\n\n so you are saying that genetic engineering and cloning fall somewhere under the fundamental prinicples of good behavior, but abortion does not? this makes no sense. on the grounds that the bible is indifferent to abortion based on not mentioning it, then how can the bible have an opinion about stem cell research, based on not mentioning it. dont you see an obvious contradiction here?",

There is no revising here.\n\n what re these canons? im not that familiar with catholic core doctrine. from what i understand, the catholic church was one of the earliest source of the idea that the genesis creation story, as well as some other sections of the bible, should not be taken literally since they were written as allegories. not only does this not make sense, but it leaves a gaping hole in the foundation of the religion itself. the genesis story established the ideas that god is all powerful and that man has fallen short and needs redemption. without these, any form of christianity is invalidated. however, this view was taken up in response to the amount of evidence for evolution reaching critical mass.\n \n also, in light of gay rights and the so-called \"scientific studies\" that give people the idea that homosexuality is genetic, the catholic church has succumbed to the social pressure to be \"tolerant and accepting\", rather than stand by what is in the bible\n \n of course, me not being deeply familiar with the details of catholic canons, might be wrong, so correct me if i am\n \n \nI have thought about relativism, but it does not make any sense to me.

This is true and evident.\n\n i dont know if youve noticed this, but legality and morality have NO RELATION WHATSOEVER. there are many legal things, such as divorce and fornication, are spoken against by jesus himself in the bible. whereas, illegal things like driving without a seatbelt on have absolutely nothing to do with morality. laws are created based on what the head of state at the time in question deems ok, in order to keep himself in power and maintain the status quo. this is how law works. its how law worked in the days of biblical times as well. when the powers that be wants the population to act a certain way, they make laws, with associated punishments and rewards. of course, the powers that be dont want people to kill each other, or steal from each other, or make more money than they can tax, etc, so these things are laws. morality has nothing to do with it",
