And I answer:\n \n If gay people were not made to feel inferior, oppressed and punished, beaten, laughed at, discriminated against, and labeled as deviants, this would not be needed. It is people who practice hate-mongering against gays who have created what you now perceive to be a problem. Don't blame the gays, blame the anti-gay community (or yourself as appropriate).",
