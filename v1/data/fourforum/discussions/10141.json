That is why I am convinced that the six day creation description comes from poetic license..if you will..wherein the story is understandable in these terms and not so easily grasped if the timelines were technically correct.\n \n God created all this in six easy steps..called 'days' in the Bible..each being a lot longer than what we call a day today. As a matter of fact, I think the first 'day' came before the separation of nighttime from daylight hours so when He was doing the first 'day's work', our current concept of one day did not exist.\n\n \n 'Day' is more of a concept in biblical language. It's not a literal day as most try to make it out.\n \n In the beginning was darkness and then He said let there be light.\n He then seperated light from dark and called it a day. (No sun yet)\n Then he made the earth and seas.\n Later he made things on the earth and the stars in the heaven.\n \n It's simplistic logic (Not the Popes artifice) to think that if the earth were created prior to the Sun, and it's important as the home of mankind, then it would stand to reason that it's the center of things.\n \n Along the lines of 'your home is the center point of your life, not the decorations that go inside nor the shrubbery on the outside.\n \n Of course, it was known that this notion wasn't true...but, if you witness Arch, anyone who contradicts is a satanic heretic. And why believe the beliefs of pagans and heretics?\n \n Also, if Humanity on earth weren't the center of God's made up universe...then that means We might not be as important as the bible leads us to believe.\n And if we're not at the center of things (inc. Gods love) then maybe someone else is...on another planet.\n Man, can you imagine the jealousy that could cause?\n \n \n Anyway, in all likelihood, someone lived that started this all.*\n If he is then as he's believed to be now...\n But, last I know, Elvis and Hitler still are discussed with details of their documented lives being fought over.\n \n *Did you know that there have been documented cases of 'war heroes' who are noted for their um...heroism.\n Yet, in truth they never existed.\n Simple propaganda. Done at the hands of those who had a decent level of control.\n Communist did this.\n \n Is it a streatch of the imagination to think that a totalitarianish theocracy that engaged in such bloodshed as the Catholic Church did would be above such things?\n At times, their criteria for miracles stretches the imagination.",

   "http://www.grantjeffrey.com/article/historicalev.htm\n \n Here is irrefutable evidence for the exisyence of Jesus Christ.\n \n Also Jesus is simply an english translation of the Greek.\n\n \n An excellent link Benjamin, thanks for posting it. Here's a relevant excerpt from the site. \n \n Cornelius Tacitus - Governor of Asia\n \n Cornelius Tacitus was a Roman historian and governor of Asia [Turkey] in A.D. 112. He was a personal friend of the historian Pliny the Younger. In his Annals, written after AD 64, he referred to Emperor Nero's persecution of the Christians. This attack was caused by Nero's false accusation that the Christians had burned the city of Rome. This monstrous lie was intended to cover the truth that the evil emperor himself had ordered the capital set on fire. Tacitus wrote:\n \n To suppress therefore the common rumour, Nero procured others to be accused, and inflicted exquisite punishments upon those people, who were in abhorrence for their crimes, and were commonly known as Christians. They had their denomination from Christus [Christ], who in the reign of Tiberius was put to death as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate. This pernicious superstition, though checked for a while, broke out again, and spread, not only over Judea, the source of this evil, but reached the city [Rome] also. (Annals of Imperial Rome, XV 44).\n \n Tacitus, as a Roman government official and historian with access to the government archives of Rome, confirmed many of the historical details in the Gospels, as well as the books of Acts and Romans. He confirmed that Jesus was executed as a criminal under the authority of Pontius Pilate (who ruled Judea under the reign of Emperor Tiberius). He also declared that the Christians, who began in Judea and were now spreading throughout the empire, derived their worship and religion from the person known as Christ. He verified the explosive growth of this new religion within 32 years of Jesus' crucifixion despite the fact that its founder suffered the death penalty as a criminal. Additionally, Tacitus confirms that the Christians were despised, hated, and falsely accused of crimes, yet they rapidly grew to become a \"vast multitude\" in Rome itself (Annals XV 44). The reason Tacitus and many other Romans hated the Christians is because of the Christians refusal to worship the pagan gods, and Emperor Nero himself.\n \n Suetonius - Roman Historian\n \n Caius Suetonius was the official historian of Rome during the reign of both Emperor Trajan and Adrian. He was also a friend of Pliny the Younger, and was referred to in several of Pliny's letters. Suetonius wrote a book on the Lives of the First Twelve Caesars. In the section on the Emperor Claudius (who ruled from AD 41 to 54) Suetonius referred to the Christians causing disturbances in Rome which led to their being banished from the city. Suetonius wrote about Claudius: \"He banished the Jews from Rome, who were continually making disturbances, Chrestus being their leader.\" He identified the sect of Jewish Christians as being derived from \"the instigation of Chrestus\" which was his curious spelling of the name Christ (Life of Claudius 25.4, written in A.D. 125). This statement provides powerful evidence that there were a significant number of Christians living in Rome before A.D. 54, only two decades after Jesus. This passage confirms the statement of Luke (in the Book of Acts) about the exiling of the Jews from Rome during the reign of Claudius. The Apostle Paul found, \"a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them\" (Acts 18:2).\n \n Suetonius also wrote about the persecution of Christians during the reign of Nero. \"The Christians were punished; a sort of men of a new and magical superstition.\" His criticism of the early Church affirms that this was a \"new\" religion that had recently appeared (in confirmation of the Gospels and the book of Acts). Furthermore, his reference to \"magical superstition\" confirms that the Christians were known to produce miracles and healing. The new faith of Christianity was based on the resurrection of their Messiah Jesus of Nazareth which would certainly qualify as a \"magical superstition\" to a pagan Roman historian.\n \n Pliny the Younger\n \n Caius Plinius Secundus, known as Pliny the Younger, was born near Milan, Italy in A.D. 62. The historian Pliny, a close friend of Tacitus, served as a consul during the reign of emperor Trajan and was later appointed governor of the Roman provinces of Pontus and Bithynia [Turkey] in the period A.D. 101 to 110. He wrote to the emperor to request specific instructions about the interrogation of the Christians whom he was persecuting. In his Epistles X 96, he states that these Christian believers would not worship Emperor Trajan and would not curse their leader, Jesus Christ, even under extreme torture. Pliny wrote that the Christians were:\n \n in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verse a hymn to Christ as to a god, and bound themselves to a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft, adultery, never to falsify their word, not to deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up.\n \n Zardoz, NOTE THE BOLDED BELOW...\n \n Pliny described the Christians as people who loved the truth at any cost. It is difficult to believe that these people would willingly die for Jesus Christ if they knew and believed it was a lie. The martyrdom of thousands of these Christians was based on the fact that they knew the truth of the statements in the Gospels about Jesus and were willing to die as martyrs rather than deny their faith in Jesus as the Son of God.",

This was back in 2000 and they were harping on the end times (the congregation being taken over by end time fundamentalism and the times of tribulation when you'd receive the mark of the beast for denying your God). I stated that the bible gave the impression that such things happen and are forgivable, especially if you're under duress to do so.\n They were outraged and stated that the bible ddin't say such.\n \n They obviously didn't read of how Peter was fortold to deny knowing the Christ 3 times on the night he was taken away from the Garden even though he made many boasts that he'd be there along His side for any event.\n The very same Peter who went on to greater things later.",

Your name seems quite apropriate by the way because you're off on a few counts regarding this post. First of all, I'm not saying who will go to heaven but am saying what the bible says about who will go to heaven. God is the judge over all of us in the end though. Secondly, neither does Peter determine in any way who is saved. He isn't really sitting at the Pearly Gates ya know, checking a list to see who enters Heaven. And you said, \"If you actually think that one needs to be a Saint to enter heaven that's fine, but don't place that upon other people.\" It just so happens that you have accidentally hit upon a spiritual reality that according to God, all born again believers who are indwelled by His Holy Spirit are Saints in His sight and only Saints WILL go to heaven, although that is the very first time I have made that distinction on this forum. So thanks for bringing it up. :)",

   "Hello everyone, first off I'd like to say I'm an evangelical Christian, so of course I believe in Jesus' existence, just as I believe the Word is the infallible Word of God.\n \n I have heard lately of people who actually argue that Jesus did not exist.\n \n I decided to start this thread to see what everyone thinks.\n \n Do you think Jesus existed? Do you think he existed as described in the bible (Son of God, etc.)? If not, why not?\n \n \n Here is my view - the Bible tells me that Jesus existed, and is the Son of God, as well as my Lord and Savior, and that is really all I need to know.\n \n Discuss.\n\n \n I had to post the original question, because I'm not reading a bunch of writing in between the first post to here.\n \n I would think it takes more than knowing that Jesus existed to be saved. The quotes from Matt. 7 are good. Not everyone who calls on the Lord will be saved.\n \n The \"reborn heart\" in the Bible is the same as the \"circumcised heart\" or the \"heart of stone replaced with the heart of flesh\" (my parphrases).\n \n Knowing a name is not the same as having an idea of the quality of that name. Jesus Christ led a 30 year life of total peace and healing. The gospel writers said that there was so much said and done that it could fill volumes. Think of all the completely good works that Jesus Christ did.\n \n That life example is one to contemplate and follow. Remember the statements about getting a heart of flesh or circumcision of the heart.\n \n May the peace of the Lord God Jesus Christ be with you.",

Plenty of people will put their lives on the line for what amounts to propaganda.\n \n The quoted article may indeed refer to secular historians and their annals with reference to Christ. But the context always seems to be the disruptive influence of the new religion and its effects, NOT that the founder of that religion was in any way divine, only perceived yet unprovenly so by the crowds.\n \n Even if the man Jesus did live and had an earnest following, many others throughout history have been no different. Many rulers have been - and still are - seen as deities. You have no trouble seeing what nonsense it is. You see religions worshipping other gods, and can easily see the folly, because you can detach yourself.\n \n Had you been born in Japan, China, India, Natal Zulu, the Philippines, near Ayres Rock, or the middle of the Amazon, what would be the chances of your being 'Christian'? Would you have gone looking for 'the truth', or would you more than likely have accepted the established religion of your forebears? I think we can guess the answer.\n \n Every religion thinks it's correct because it can't and won't detach itself and look at the matter objectively. It's the comfort zone, and it's fear of retribution from the deities.\n \n The article you referenced from a religious site is no different. This quote from the article sums up the clutching at straws, as if secular pagan historians were confirming the divinity of Jesus:\n \nIt is fascinating to note that the writer considered that Jesus was in some sense immortal because His teachings \"lived on\" after His death.\n\n Yes, but don't leave out the likes of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, Gandhi and the Dalai Lama, or even the poet Browning.\n \n Thanks for it anyway.

And this is precisely what secular Roman Historians of the day did. If you actually read the link from the perspective of an objective historian, you might see that. Here is an excerpt from the link that clearly shows how miracles were attributed to Jesus as referenced as magic, and how christians were willing to die for their beliefs. But both historical accounts by each historian say much about His divinity as more than just a cult figure who was crucified and remained dead. \n Suetonius - Roman Historian\n \n Caius Suetonius was the official historian of Rome during the reign of both Emperor Trajan and Adrian. He was also a friend of Pliny the Younger, and was referred to in several of Pliny's letters. Suetonius wrote a book on the Lives of the First Twelve Caesars. In the section on the Emperor Claudius (who ruled from AD 41 to 54) Suetonius referred to the Christians causing disturbances in Rome which led to their being banished from the city. Suetonius wrote about Claudius: \"He banished the Jews from Rome, who were continually making disturbances, Chrestus being their leader.\" He identified the sect of Jewish Christians as being derived from \"the instigation of Chrestus\" which was his curious spelling of the name Christ (Life of Claudius 25.4, written in A.D. 125). This statement provides powerful evidence that there were a significant number of Christians living in Rome before A.D. 54, only two decades after Jesus. This passage confirms the statement of Luke (in the Book of Acts) about the exiling of the Jews from Rome during the reign of Claudius. The Apostle Paul found, \"a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them\" (Acts 18:2).\n \n Suetonius also wrote about the persecution of Christians during the reign of Nero. \"The Christians were punished; a sort of men of a new and magical superstition.\" His criticism of the early Church affirms that this was a \"new\" religion that had recently appeared (in confirmation of the Gospels and the book of Acts). Furthermore, his reference to \"magical superstition\" confirms that the Christians were known to produce miracles and healing. The new faith of Christianity was based on the resurrection of their Messiah Jesus of Nazareth which would certainly qualify as a \"magical superstition\" to a pagan Roman historian.\n \n Pliny the Younger\n \n Caius Plinius Secundus, known as Pliny the Younger, was born near Milan, Italy in A.D. 62. The historian Pliny, a close friend of Tacitus, served as a consul during the reign of emperor Trajan and was later appointed governor of the Roman provinces of Pontus and Bithynia [Turkey] in the period A.D. 101 to 110. He wrote to the emperor to request specific instructions about the interrogation of the Christians whom he was persecuting. In his Epistles X 96, he states that these Christian believers would not worship Emperor Trajan and would not curse their leader, Jesus Christ, even under extreme torture. Pliny wrote that the Christians were:\n \n in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verse a hymn to Christ as to a god, and bound themselves to a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft, adultery, never to falsify their word, not to deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up.\n \n Pliny described the Christians as people who loved the truth at any cost. It is difficult to believe that these people would willingly die for Jesus Christ if they knew and believed it was a lie. The martyrdom of thousands of these Christians was based on the fact that they knew the truth of the statements in the Gospels about Jesus and were willing to die as martyrs rather than deny their faith in Jesus as the Son of God.",

   "I'm glad you're finally admitting that American Capitalist Christianity has nothing to do with Christ's teachings and everything to do with perpetuating the status quo of exploitation and hateful discrimination. Christians are a disruptive influence to this status quo, as we have seen at successive meetings of the G8, where Christians have stood up in their thousands to challenge the exploitation of the poor across the world. These are Christians who are taking Christ's radical message forward. He came to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim the release of captives, and to raise up the downtrodden. I'm also pleased that you agree with the early church that God can call anyone, including women, to be leaders in the church.\n\n \n I didn't say that at all Jo. But I'm tired of constantly re-explaining what I mean so I'll just let my original post stand. I mean, how you got your post from this is beyond me.\n \n \nThose Christians were as stubborn as I am about not compromising Jesus standards with the World they lived in either. And they didn't fit into the value system of their day any better than todays believers do. The World has changed by becoming more modern, and we christians are modern too. But regarding our beliefs, values and morals, we are as devoted to the principles Jesus gave us as the first century believers were. At least the true believers are.

   "Archie:\n \nCaius Suetonius was the official historian of Rome during the reign of both Emperor Trajan and Adrian. He was also a friend of Pliny the Younger, and was referred to in several of Pliny's letters. Suetonius wrote a book on the Lives of the First Twelve Caesars. In the section on the Emperor Claudius (who ruled from AD 41 to 54) Suetonius referred to the Christians causing disturbances in Rome which led to their being banished from the city. Suetonius wrote about Claudius: \"He banished the Jews from Rome, who were continually making disturbances, Chrestus being their leader.\" He identified the sect of Jewish Christians as being derived from \"the instigation of Chrestus\" which was his curious spelling of the name Christ (Life of Claudius 25.4, written in A.D. 125). This statement provides powerful evidence that there were a significant number of Christians living in Rome before A.D. 54, only two decades after Jesus. This passage confirms the statement of Luke (in the Book of Acts) about the exiling of the Jews from Rome during the reign of Claudius. The Apostle Paul found, \"a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them\" (Acts 18:2).\n\n This tends to show that, like many others in history, a particular individual had a following. Secondly, there is nothing in the above to show that 'Chrestus' had any divine qualities.\n \n \n Suetonius also wrote about the persecution of Christians during the reign of Nero. \"The Christians were punished; a sort of men of a new and magical superstition.\" His criticism of the early Church affirms that this was a \"new\" religion that had recently appeared (in confirmation of the Gospels and the book of Acts). Furthermore, his reference to \"magical superstition\" confirms that the Christians were known to produce miracles and healing. The new faith of Christianity was based on the resurrection of their Messiah Jesus of Nazareth which would certainly qualify as a \"magical superstition\" to a pagan Roman historian.\n\n It would seem that the author(s) of the article use the phrase 'magical superstition' as evidence of miracles and healing. Is that an independent objective assessment? The phrase used:\n \n...a sort of men of a new and magical superstition...\n indicates a new breed of superstitious people, not that their leader was the Messiah or divine.\n \n\n ...Pliny described the Christians as people who loved the truth at any cost. It is difficult to believe that these people would willingly die for Jesus Christ if they knew and believed it was a lie.\n\n Axiomatic.\n \n \nThe martyrdom of thousands of these Christians was based on the fact that they knew the truth of the statements in the Gospels about Jesus and were willing to die as martyrs rather than deny their faith in Jesus as the Son of God.\n\n Well attested. Many do die for their beliefs, erroneous or not. But the only evidence for Christ's divinity is the man himself and the new congregations. The authors of the article have used the words of secular historians to augment their own line of thinking. If they want readers to accept what pagan secular historians write about early Christianity, shouldn't they at least warn the reader that the same pagan secular historians don't produce any direct evidence that Christ was divine? That information is conspicuous by its absence.",

The separation of many evangelical congregations from the wider body of the church provides a dangerous opening for the likes of the Mr. Copeland mentioned in that piece. Throughout Christian history there have been ministers who have used the authority of the church for their own material benefit, and it has driven many people away from God. That the lady who wrote the linked article managed to maintain her faith is very impressive. I am thankful that in recent years the mainstream church in this country has been largely devoid of these exploitative ministries (with some unfortunate exceptions), one of the benefits of being strapped for cash is that any parish with surplus funds is likely to find a very polite archdeacon paying a visit wondering whether they might consider enlarging their parish share a little, or sponsoring some mission work in Papua New Guinea.",

   "Why do you need a mission to Russia? Isn't Russia mostly Christian already, or does Eastern Orthodox not count if you're a fundie?\n\n \n Yep.\n \n Most alleged 'non-denominational' churches would be more accuratly to be described as the denomination of 'pastor X'. \n I've heard a couple of pastors openly state \"We're a ____ church, we're nondenominational.\" :xbanghead \n \n Anyway, it's often true (not always) that many believe that unless you believe exactly just like them you're not saved. The more extreme the sect (think goofy, abnormal or crazy) the more they tend to believe this.\n Logically, if they didn't, many believers would probably not be as extreme...as you can still get into heaven without jumping on one foot and rubbing your tummy and patting your own back...so why jump through all those hoops?\n \n So, yes, Russia (and many former communist nation) had the doors blown open for these movements as it was pushed that commies were godless and needed saving. For too lonmg, they've gone without proper godly worship.\n The pimps come in with something new, an emotional based show where they counterfeit any listed miracle and make any promise imaginable and then fly out with as much money as possible.\n I've heard convoluted thinking on where you should go to host a mission.\n Don't go anywhere you're not 'honored'.\n Of course, they then narrowly define honor as 'in the bible, it means getting financial gifts.'\n So if the preachers can't turn a profit, they seldom go or stay for long...and rarely return.\n \n I remember reciting a stat on Portent about the number of 'Christians' who actually read the bible. Nearly 80 percent don't. It might have been in a Charisma magazine or something similar (it was in a generic Christian church I read it, wish I had a link or hard copy) but, I've also heard similar quoted by others and from my personal experience, it sounds about right.\n Most people don't know what the bible says. Some fewer have any inkling of what it means.\n So, it doesn't seem too hard to manipulate it to get what you want out of it and still have professed believers accepting everything you say as true.\n \n Just this week I was listening to one pastor comment on what Paul stated a pastor needed to possess as credentials.\n 1 Timothy 3\n \"The husband of one wife...\"\n He then when on to state that this meant 'One wife at a time.' So as to justify divorce. But, in context of what the bible states (red words of Jesus here even), the only justification for divorce AND remarriage would be due to adultery. You could divorce but not be allowed to remarry unless there was adultry involved.\n But, this pastors sect has many divorcees and remarriages. You can't teach the truth without upsetting many people. \n \n I've also seen a couple of pastors use a strongs or youngs concordance right along side their bible while preaching. And every other passage is reinterpreted with 'new definitions' for key words taken from the concordance.\n You really get a lot of new meanings to things when you do this.\n Ironically, it seems they support what ever the pastors agenda is at the time.\n \n One of the minor ones on this is the 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' commandment we see occasionally debated.\n It may very well mean 'murder' over other forms of slaying. But, after a while of this sort of thing, you feel like you're in the novel Animal Farm by Orwell and there's tweeking constantly done to the rules on the side of the barn. Convienant rules to support the pastor...who may happen to carry a gun...or have an 'armor bearer' who does.\n There was a couple of clips on Youtube with similar preachers packing heat. \n \n So, no Jo. Orthodoxy doesn't count.\n Once in a while, these types will even state \"Many consider us Heretics...but, we just worship differently, actually the proper way.\"\n \n I don't know if you're familiar with this term used by many protestants and evangelicals \"Christian and Catholic.\"\n It implies that Catholics aren't Christians even if there are some simularities.\n So, if they don't consider Catholics to be true Christians (Jack T. Chick thinks they're into witchery), you definatly won't consider any other religion associated or similar to them to be true Christians either.",

   "Who are these \"pimps\" you're talking about?\n\n \n A pulpit pimp is anyone who preaches excessively on tithes and offerings.\n Who's personal wealth is derived from their followers, they live in luxury far and above the average congregant. \n Anyone who preaches the health-wealth message and takes biblical verse out of context to push that loyal followers should be wealthy IF they are faithful because that's what God wants. Overlooking ALL other passages to the contrary as well as the passages that call the faithful to seek contentment.\n \n Word of Faither are the predominate practioners of this. They represent the vast majority of Evangelicals, their message has seeped into nearly all other sects to some degree also.\n Walk into a 'Christian' book store and you'll see about 80% of the books there writen by a WofF. Walk into a secular store like Wal Mart and about 90%+ of all Christian books are by WofFers.\n Pentecostalism, Charismatics are particularly succeptable. But, even Catholicism is being influenced in the US, mostly with prdominatly Hispanic congregations.\n \n Being succeptable doesn't neccessarily mean that you've been influenced.\n \n Well known WofFers would be Benny Hinn, Anyone on TBN, T.D. Jakes, Joel Olsteen, David Yonggi Cho (largest church in S.Korea), Ted Haggard (the gay hypocrit from the largest church in CO.), Joyce Meyers, Marilyn Hicky...the list goes on.\n And one of the more interesting aspects is their diverse practices. Some are oness Pentacostal, some practice tongues/babbling...others don't. Some preach the Jesus Died Spiritually message. They are more aptly called a movement than an actual sect.\n \n The unifying issues is the Word (which isn't the one of God...but your own) and Faith (which is a 'magical force') Basically, if you have unchallenged faith free from doubt and fear and you SAY you want something, God has to provide it. Health and Wealth are ususally the temporal aspects focused on. Sickness and poverty are often viewed as a product of sin. \n An expample of extremes of proving faith is to sow seed (financial gifts) into th minisgtry to prove you have faith. This seed is allegedly to be returned to you in an earthly harvest 100 fold. It's formulaic. You must also deny any doubt and exist in blind, unquestioning faith.\n The pastors set themselves up as examples of piety since they are typically wealthy and healthy and all followers can be just like them if they simply follow the same rituals of denying sickness and living in perfect faith.\n What the pastors don't mention is that they typically are living off of the donations (seed) of the followers and have hardly sown anything themselves. Health issues see many deny (living on faith) that they are sick to begin with. Some preachers in the past couple of decades have moved away from the health aspects as their fake/ faith healings don't work with any credibility and they themselves deal with undeniable sickness (I believe Joyce Myers or the Hickey suffer from cancer ATM).\n \n Your own Assembly of God faith could have congregations dominated by these types OR be free from their influence as the pastor preaches and fights against them.\n But, in all likelihood, you'd be hard to find those free from pimpery as AoG believes in a few erronious issues such as Tongues having to be a sign of being baptised of the holy spirit which simply is not supported in the bible. \n \n So, what is a pimp?\n A pimp is one who takes the money from his whores and lives in a better style of life than they do. Using gimmicks like addiction to keep his ho's in line.\n A pulpit pimp does the same. Takes excessive monies from his congregation to live in a better life style than they do. Pushing out countless promisses of a better life right around the corner for them once they reap the harvest on their seed. \n Malachi 3 is a favorite. If you don't tithe...you're stealing from God. \n \n Founders of the movement stem from P. Quimby (a practioner of messmerism)to E.W. Kenyon to Kenneth Hagin (who plagerized Kenyon).\n \n PulpitPimps.org may offer more information on this. They're a Christian site but do have a strong Calvanistic belief (which I also believe is not fully biblically supported).",

If not, why not?\n \n \n Here is my view - the Bible tells me that Jesus existed, and is the Son of God, as well as my Lord and Savior, and that is really all I need to know.\n \n Discuss.\n\n WE know more about Jesus Christ than Abraham LIncoln !\n \n Of course he existed.Athiests are stupid if they think this will work,Every wishful fool and his step mother think that all that they have to do is pronounce their opinions to the masses and ipso facto,it's a fact !\n \n Why not doubt the existance of Robert E Lee or Nicolaus Copernicus,we know less of those two than Jesus The Christ yet they are accepted without dabate ?Their,the athiests, motive is highly suspect when any simple comparison is made and their responses to them are examined.\n \n There must be a lot of very stupid or very confused people in this world to even listen to these XXXXXX.Their motives must ones of either anger over some slight they have felt from a particular demomination,usually Catholic, religeous or a misguided pseudo-intellect demanding evidence at every turn.\n \n The convient interllectual dishonesty of some authors has poisoned the intellect of most professors teaching today in American and European centers of higher education.\n \n Darwin's theories are taken as fact and argued over every other with a totally closed mind.The more prestigeous the school the greater the degree of closed minds to the obvious truths of GOD.

This doesn't compare to people who love life and harm nobody in their lives and willingly give up that life they love for a righteous principle because of the violence of others. These Christians refused to even lift a hand and fight the Government authorities who unfairly persecuted and killed them because they refused to worship pagan Gods. There is no comparison or rationality for comparing murderers with martyrs in this context. Especially since the suicide bombers are promoting the death of innocent victims and the christian martyrs are the innocent victims who are created by those who killed in total ignorance and hatred for what is good and right.\n\n \n As usual, we see Archie start to rant in an attempt to avoid the question.\n \n Thelmoose very clearly said he wasn't comparing the two in any way.\n \n The question asked of you was: if your statement that \"people will die for a cause, they won't die willingly for a lie\" (paraphrased) is true, this would be applicable not only to Christian martyrs, but also people like the 9/11 hijackers and suicide bombers.

The essentials such as the trinitarian view of God is are all matters that are very clear in scripture. If a group goes against God as Father, Son, and HS (the trinity) then they are clearly going against scripture. It's not like we're talking about scriptural matters that are vague. It is clear the resurrection is in scripture. It is clear that God is demonstrated as Father, Son, and HS in scripture. That's the 1000-lb-elephant problem with your view on the essentials (which are basically laid out in the creeds): they are clear and obvious in scripture. If we were talking about doctrinal issues that were not really in scripture or that was a stretch, or even vague, you might have something here, but we aren't. We're talking about things like God as Father, the importance of the church, and that Jesus resurrected. Those are there and are very basic. If a group is going against fundamental things that are so obvious in scripture, then they aren't a Christian group after all. The only claim they have to say so is that they self-profess to be, but if they are rejecting very clear and obvious things about God in the scriptures, then I don't see how you can call them \"Christian\" with a straight face.\n \n And by the way, they aren't just \"my\" essentials, but those of Christendom from the get-go. You only need to read the earliest church fathers to see that. These essentials were put into the Nicene creed in the early 300s, but the apostle's creed existed way earlier.\n \n \nSo how do you know YOUR god is the correct version?

   " For instance, you'd probably be pretty darn hard-pressed to find a Christian who was against the doctrine of the trinity \n\n Huh. Funny, I wasn't that hard-pressed.\n \n Just the simplest search from even a source like Wiki turned this up: \nIn the early centuries of Christian history adoptionists, Arians, Ebionites, Gnostics, Marcionites, and others held nontrinitarian beliefs. The Nicene Creed raised the issue of the relationship between Jesus' divine and human natures. Monophysitism (\"one nature\") and monothelitism (\"one will\") were heretical attempts to explain this relationship. During more than a thousand years of Trinitarian orthodoxy, formal nontrinitarianism, i.e., a doctrine held by a church, group, or movement, was rare, but it did appear. For example, among the Cathars of the 13th century. The Protestant Reformation of the 1500s also brought tradition into question. At first, nontrinitarians were executed (such as Servetus), or forced to keep their beliefs secret (such as Isaac Newton). The eventual establishment of religious freedom, however, allowed nontrinitarians to more easily preach their beliefs, and the 19th century saw the establishment of several nontrinitarian groups in North America and elsewhere. These include Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Unitarians. Twentieth-century nontrinitarian movements include Iglesia ni Cristo and the Unification Church. Nontrinitarian groups differ from one another in their views of Jesus Christ, depicting him variously as a divine being second only to God the Father (e.g., Jehovah's Witnesses), Yahweh of the Old Testament in human form, God (but not eternally God), Son of God but inferior to the Father (versus co-equal), prophet, or simply a holy man.\n \n Of notable exception are Oneness Pentecostals, who affirm that God came to Earth as man (i.e., manifested Himself) in the man Jesus Christ. Oneness Pentecostals fully affirm, like Trinitarians, that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. One can understand Oneness Pentecostals by replacing the Trinitarian term 'person' with the term 'mode' or 'manifestation' when discussing the Christian Godhead. Many Oneness Pentecostals can recite the first Nicene Creed, as it rejects Arianism, yet preserves the oneness of God and divinity of Jesus Christ.\n \n \n",
