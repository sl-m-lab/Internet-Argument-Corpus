I know you have good reasons for respecting the flag brother, and I don't want to make light of that. However, when you strive to make something illegal you'll in effect telling your neighbor what he can and can't do. In cases where your neighbor is aggressing against you, this is a good thing - laws against murder, theft, fraud etc are good. However, flag burning is a victimless crime. It may raise your ire (like modern art and the people talking about \"post modernism\" does with me) but we can't go making these things illegal just because they are disgusting and disrespectful to what you feel the flag represents. \n \n In closing, I'd to say that I dislike the flag burners too. Not because the flag has some sort of intrinsic value in of itself to me, but because they are quitters, and have absolutely no sense of humor. In a land of FREE SPEECH they resort to burning FLAGS?! All the media outlets and ways of resolving problems we have developed over countless years and civil strife and they start burning things like a bunch of cave men. They're quitters, and they're pathetic but that doesn't mean we should make laws against flag burning.",

   "Something in TANS' posts brought to mind an incident in my life. I can't find it now, but my thoughts go to the idea of a comrade in arms, whatever service.\n \n It was a different time. I was on in the Salt Lake City airport with an overlay of several hours. To pass the time, I began walking around the terminal. As I rounded one end where there was little traffic I saw 4 civilians who had an airman backed into a corner. I walked quickly around the corner and then ran to the first uniform that I saw. I shouted \"GI in trouble\", and pointed to another uniform and said, \"Get him.\" I ran towards another uniform. But by that time, the uniforms were coming to us. There were 6 of us from 4 services who went back around the end of the terminal. No one said anything. The first sign these guys knew that they had a problem was when they realized that the airman was looking past them and smiling. They may have taken an elbow or two as they slinked past us.\n \n As I said, it was a different time when it was acceptable to spit on uniformed military. It was also OK to burn the flag. TANSTAAFL'07 seems to echo that time. Although it seems that he really doesn't know what he believes. He backed down at the first opposition - is he really a Marine?",

   "Pandion:\n \n \n \nTo pass the time, I began walking around the terminal. As I rounded one end where there was little traffic I saw 4 civilians who had an airman backed into a corner.\n\n \n \n Yep sounds typical. Airmen find themselves in that position a lot. All you gotta do is go to okinawa and look up \"The Banyion Tree\". Its a bar from which Marines are permantly, explictly barred from entering because we love puttin' the hurt on those spoon fed wussy airmen. Now, civilians beating up on an airman is a different story I guess. Yeah, I probably would have helped out-- grudgingly. I will tell you that guys in the airforce are some of the most professional people I've ever met. They are very good at what they do, and take their jobs seriously. They lack alot of the drinking/driving problems that we do. Kind of a different culture. A lot of us see them as outsiders, like the coast gaurd. They perform a vital function to our mission, but I think a lot of marines see them as civilians in a uniform basically.\n \n \n \nSo you think that it was disrespectful for the picketers outside of military bases to spit on me, my brothers, and our brothers in arms?\n\n \n \n I said it was ok to burn the flag as long as its theirs and they're using their matches - not that it was ok to spit on any of you soilders! H*LL YES I think its disrespectful for picketers to spit on you! Where is this going on? Why are they not nursing spiral fractures yet?! They're actually getting away with this in TEXAS?\n \n \n \nHe backed down at the first opposition - is he really a Marine?\n\n \n On the question of being a marine: Yes. Or rather I was. I got out in April of this year, 11 days ago. And I will gladly back down from Archangel anytime. The guys on this site give him a hard time because he's a christian and he's rational and level headed. I realized after he posted his response that I was being a jerk. I try to treat the good guys who are actually trying to say something, different than some of the other guys who are just here to rant about how their gay rights are being stepped on or some such other nonsense. \n \n And be careful, there's a zero on here who calls himself \"Daewoo.\" Supposedly, he was some sort of Army Infantry special forces commander. Loves to look down his nose at enlisted guys. You know the type, been to college know it alls. \n \n BTW, If you REALLY want to confirm that I was a marine IM me and Ill tell you my name, my unit, and my EAS date. Might be able to email you some pics if you want. I did 3 tours. Last one was a joke though. \n \n \nI was proud to salute it whenever it was required. But I wasn't a Marine. In fact, I have known lots of Marines who were as proud to salute the flag as I was. I'm wondering why you had a problem.\n \n\n \n Uh, I don't know what branch of service you were in or where you served(i assume the army) but the pride wore off about the 1000th time I had to stop what I was doing, when that little stupid trumphet call went out to let you know to stand by for evening or morning colors. It was a pain in the a** after a while to be quite frank! Now, one of my LTs took it very seriously. If he saw guys ducking into their rooms even at the 5 minute warning for colors he would stop what he was doing and run over there and get in their a**es. I never saw the point. The snipers were always out on the cat walks in the barracks or outside thrashing their boots and making them build those godawful gilli suits and it was a pain for them to have to stop what they were doing for some blarringly bad rendition of evening colors. We all had things to do (I wasn't a sniper thank god, but thats just an example) It only lasts for 40 seconds so it doesn't seem like something someone would complain about, but it when it happens EVERYDAY (and they always played the 2 minute long lineup on Fridays and sundays: Anchors Aweigh, Marine Corps Hymn, and National Anthem, and on okinawa they played the Japanese National Anthem as well! The Japanese National Anthem is one of the most depressing peices of garbage I have ever heard by the way!) for 4 YEARS (actually 2 and a half since I was deployed to Iraq for a total of 1 and a half years) it tends to get on your nerves. You gotta know how it feels coming back from a combat zone and then seeing garrison life again. You just wanna get OFF BASE and away from all the shovel heads. People think it's like a big deal or something when we salute our flag. Its not for me anymore, although like you said, you knew some guys who worshipped it. Not a problem. I don't necessarily understand it, but I've got buddies who feel the same way too. I've learned that the flag is just a peice of cloth. The only flag that matters to me is the one that I OWN. Somebody burns that, and theres going to be trouble. But if someone wants to be stupid and act like a child, as long as he does it with his own private property, it should be his right to exercise his choice about what he does with his own possessions. Sorry I'm rambling.\n \n \nWhatever point your commanding officer was trying to make, apparently you weren't able to understand.\n\n \n emoticon_angry :xbanghead BULLRUSH?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! How come all you army guys are such marionets?! Officers are JERKS most of the time! They assume they know everything and they're told to make quick decisions even if they don't know what the *F* they're doing! You know what I do when I don't know what the *F* I'm doing? I ASK. These jerks are TRAINED to \"think quick.\" Which is a Marine Corps way of saying \"Wing it, but act like you know what you're doing!\" Don't know land nav? Wing it. Don't know your own marines? Wing it, pretend like you were joking! \"You're an officer after all! No one will ever question your authority! Seriously, they need to scrap the officer corps.\" Commissions should be based on BILLET not on some ancient, outmoded form of ellitism. If you occupy a command Billet of platoon commander and you're a sergeant, you get to be Sgt. X, Lt., 1st Platoon, D Company for example. Having this dicotomy between officers and enlisted is sick and downright old world european. Anyways, Im ranting again. Sufficed to say, there was no point, we sat around for hours , waiting for the \"word,\" EVERYNIGHT. It was absurd and totally unnecessary and if you were there you would have been mad as he** just like the rest of us were. Incidentally, NOT ONE OF MY PEERS RE-UPED!:xbanghead Not even Cpl G. and he was totally moto. ANYWAYS...\n \n \n \n \nIn reality the flag is just a way for Americans to feel attached to something most of them never had the guts to do themselves.\n\n \n Sounds cruel, but its true, and I wasn't out to hurt anybody's feelings. Thats just the way it is. Most guys (and girls nowadays) come up with a good reason not to join and yet they practically worship this flag. So many of these guys are the sort to talk about americas military this, or our nuclear arsenal that. Stupid stupid STUPID! I'm getting out right now, and I have NOTHING. That is my own fault, but if I could trade places with one of these entrepreneurs I see who inexplicably worships the flag and wishes he would have joined up, I would trade places in a HEARTBEAT. Quit worrying about what you dont have, wean yourselves off the flag addiction and start realizing that YOU are america! The guy who owns the liquor store down the road and looks so depressed even though he owns his own business - YOU ARE AMERICA! Theres no shame in it! In many muslim nations, alcohol is illegal! To the guy who manages the Walmart - Hey, drop the flag fetish! You're a middle manager! You run your own store! You are the MAN! And it goes on and on. Believe me, and you military guys know this, military service, especially right now, is NOT like you see on hollywood. So what im saying is, I wish civilians would stop bsing themselves whenever I hear them tell me they wished they would have joined. I want to tell them: SHUT THE *F* UP! IT SUCKS AND I DID IT SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO. XXXXX.:xbanghead \n \n \nI see. A bit of projection here?\n \n\n \n Yeah, except I was stupid and impulsive enough to actually join on.",

TANSTAAFL'07 seems to be what command staff knew as a whiner.\n \n My son expresses similar complaints about his unit, except that my son is a SGT and has the ear of his commander. While the First Sergeant is his superior in the command structure, my son is the section chief of which the First Sergeant is a member, along with at least one SFC, along with one or more SSGTs. My son resolves complaints by addressing the appropriate party, and failing that, going over his head.\n \n It seems that Pvt TANSTAAFL'07 had some regrets about enlisting in the Marines. Even though I have known a lot of Marines, I have never met one who regretted enlisting. But the Marines that I have known actually went into combat following their NCOs and officers.

Proving your identity. Are you googlable by your real name? Do you have a myspace page I could verify your identity by?\n \n 2. Assasinating your identity. Most officers are jerks and outsiders. Are you different? Doubt it.\n \n 3. Most enlisted guys are hard working who get rode hard and put away wet. The american public's conception of enlisted men is downright...racist for lack of a better word.\n \n 4. Last and most importantly, we should disband the officer corps, dissolve the army and the airforce, and bolster the Marines Corps and the Navy. Paygrades of 01-010 should be based on BILLET and not if you've been to college or not. Higher level billets in MOS's should require mandatory schooling and once a marine has chosen that path way, he becomes a permanent E7 with a command billet rating. If he chooses that path and signs his name, he locks himself into a 8 year contract. Also, if you possess a command billet you do NOT rate any extra pay beyond anyone else who possess your same rank. \n \n 5. Get rid of Camp Pendleton and all bases on the coasts, ESPECIALLY if they are close to a town of ANY form. If you join up, you can expect to serve the vast majority of your active duty time hiking up mountains and being in the field constantly. This 9 to 5 BS should be done away with. Sell pendleton and 29 stumps, buy land in Montana or Colorado and start TRAINING. No more having infantry guys waiting around \"for the word\" for 10 hours not doing anything. American tax payers should get what they pay for. Marines, Rangers, Airborne, and the rest of the salvagable infantry outfits from the various branches of service are elite and should be held to standards which reflect their status, befitting the severity of their mission, wherever it may be next.\n \n 6. Did I mention getting rid of the officer corps?",

Even officers complain about superiors, honest. But how would a PVT who can't quite measure up to standards know that? So what?\n\n \n Im not a private you ape, I'm a Lance Corporal. What did I expect when I joined the Marines? I expected it to be the hardest thing I had ever done. As it turns out, we sat around most of the time between deployments not doing anything, waiting around for the word because our company office was full of tools who refused to let squad leaders take their squads out on range runs, classes, and feild excercises which are so vital for squad cohesion and training. Company runs on fridays and PFTS every two years just dont cut it. \n \n \n \nBut if you know the system and how to work the system, then whining isn't necessary.

The only time I ever saw an NCO get busted down and drummed out was when it involved stealing. Otherwise you keep your mouth shut while you're in. Are you serious? He actually DOCUMENTED violations and something happened? He's got more luck/brains than any of us ever had. You gotta understand, for those of you tiny minority on this forum who haven't apparently served, that they have total control over you. You dont squeal on them and then, poof, they disappear and everything gets better a la hollywood. Theres usually an investigation done by a Commanding officer from another company and usually nothing ever happens, except now you're labeled as a trouble maker. They usually nurse their brusied egos by taking it out on the company that \"disgraced\" the battalion. (Punishments often include: Field days 7 days a week; Company 1st Sgt off leash; lame knife hand sessions from lifers who've just got off the Drill Field and don't even have a CAR (Combat Action Ribbon) yet; generally harassing bewildered junior and senior marines alike who have committed no offense and have no idea why they are being treated like human waste; More Specific punishments include: Denying a distinguished senior marine who won a bronze star for almost singlehandely saving a squad in 3rd platoon in Fallujah from going home to see his wife who suffered from a broken back - he stayed by the way, much to his credit, until we were released at 2:00 in the morning. The list goes on. My point is that a lot of these higher ups are abusive, scared little boys who have way too much to lose by dying in Iraq. If you only knew some of the disgraceful things your precious little officers and SNCOs got away with over there. There were a lot of good ones, especially the Staff Sergeants and 2nd and 1st Lieutenants. But when you start going up in rank it seems like you start bleeding out IQ points. So many 1st Sgts and Captains were downright corrupt over there, especially when it came to signing themselves up for medals which they had no business wearing on their chests. Totally disgraceful. Why is it that beating your chest and holding junior Enlisted and officers to standards is considered being a good marine, but holding higher ups to the same standards is considered \"whining?\" Lifers...emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \nI suspect that there weren't any violations of military law in the case of our whiner. From what he has posted, he just doesn't measure up to the many Marines that I have known. The Marines I have known were some tough hombres.\n\n \n Absolutely 100% true. Most of the Marines I served with were twice the men I will ever be, and my seniors were gods. Every last one of them. Except for one. Even he got better. In fact he really proved himself in Ramadi, so yeah, I'm proud and consider myself lucky to serve with the guys that I did. Some of the boots I saw in different platoons were a different story, but my peers and seniors were incredible.\n \n \nSemper Fi, to all of you jar heads. I salute you. As an artilleryman, I was always willing to pump out however many rounds of high explosive were requested. Didn't matter if we were in support of Army or Marine.\n\n \n *Sigh* No offense sir but just in case you ever run across another marine:\n \n \n Unless you're a suck *dk* lifer, pog, officer loving, E6 (or above, excluding the occasional good gunnys and warrant officers), DI you should NEVER SAY:\n \n 1. Semper Fi. Seriously no one says it except the lifers.\n 2. Jar Head. No one says Jar Head anymore' they say Devil Dog, and they usually use it in a pejorative sense.\n \n AND\n \n 3. DONT SALUTE US AND EXPECT US TO SALUTE YOU DOG FACES BACK! Marines DON'T salute: Non-officers; in doors (unless under arms); outdoors in a feild enviornment or combat zone; with kevlar (helmet) on. That basically means that you never salute unless you're in garrison and its an officer. Enlisted marines do NOT salute Enlisted Marines. This is not the russian army, infact this is not the army PERIOD, and We are not marionettes.\n \n And just so the record's straight I did get hit with the UCMJ (military law), twice infact (two page 11 entrys and a 6105) and it was my fault. I may be a \"whiner\" but I have enough of a sense of personal responsiblity to know whats my fault and whats not. I was not a model marine but I was good enough not to get killed or get any of my buddies killed throughout 3 combat tours. If thats not doesn't count for something I don't know what does.",
