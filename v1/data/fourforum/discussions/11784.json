   "Sinjin is confused and chester is an , well you know. Both of them think if Obama is elected, that Obama is going to walk on water and feed the masses with three fish and a loaf of bread. I really got caught up in the fear of Obama taking my guns if he is elected, but then I got to thinking, if the economy is suffering now, how much of an impact would a gun and ammo ban make. If guns and ammo get banned then the manufacturers lay people off, and the economy takes two big hits right off of the bat, the loss of sales revenue and people without jobs cant spend money, so as I said, two big hits. Next, the economy would suffer a really huge blow, as all the money sportsmen and hunters spend annually would be lost now, I dont know the figures, but I would guess hundreds of millions of dollars, and thats not even counting plain old shooters. Then buisinesses such as cabellas, pro bas shops, academy, and thousands of others would have to lay off, and possibly shut down. Then there is the loss of revenue that goes to programs such as wildlife management, which will make the wildlife suffer greatly. And finally, the loss of revenue collected by the states who have carry concealed licsenses. I am sure that more than I posted would suffer, but it is all that comes to mind at the moment. Point is Obama can try to ban guns, but with such an economic loss from it, I doubt that congress would ever approve it.",

Plus most gun owners arent going to give up their guns in the first place, not peacefully anyhow, I wont. I do how ever still fear the 500 percent excise tax increase on guns and ammo, but if guns and ammo are priced out of reach for us, it will have the same affect on the economy, and although our economy is badly beaten right now, we do still have one.",
