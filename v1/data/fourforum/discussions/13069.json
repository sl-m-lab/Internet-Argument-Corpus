Where do you think he gets that money from?\" Or call social services and say \"My kid has a classmate who comes to school with bruises all the time, and he says he falls down the stairs.

They are insulted that we aren't just lying down and accepting their forcing of this legislation down our throats and are attacking the Right for organizing communities against them when this president is himself a community organizer and has called for those on the left to come together and get in our faces and shout us down if we continue to oppose what he is attempting to force on us. \n \n And he is attempting to force this on us. If he is truly representing all of the people with such an important and expensive issue, he should care about what we want and care about creating an equitable system which wont bankrupt this and the generations to come for the foreseeable future. This hell-plan will complete his agenda to create a true class system in this country of the haves and the have nots. It will place everyone, minus only the super rich, on the public dole and create the largest welfare state imaginable. And the largest class of americans, the middle class will be decimated by this legislation, and as the middle class goes, so goes the american economy.\n \n And as for the heavy handed tactics, just read the bill. Read the fines and penalties that will be incurred for those businesses and private citizens who buck this system once it is enacted. He says we wont be forced to give up our current coverage, but if our current carrier makes even the slightest change in our contract, that change allows the government to step in and force us into their program.
