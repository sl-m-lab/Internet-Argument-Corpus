   "I agree with JP.\n \n I've used the 'rope method' for lack of a better name.\n \n Basically, a child starts out with limited freedom and options. A 'short rope' if you will. As they grow older, become more independent and knowledgeable, or have proven themselves, their rope (freedom) get's longer. \n Until on day, they have enough rope to...go hang themselves. But, hopefully, you've helped them learn how not to do so and the rope is an asset they have.\n \n This with the Willy Wonka approach to warnings (original movie where Willy would simply stand aside and quietly re-warn them that their course of action is not acceptable and could be harmful) is often good to get them to listen and heed occasionally obscure advice and warnings. \n You shouldn't have to be in their face with flashing lights and a bull horn to get their attention.\n \n This has worked perfectly for me for over a dozen years where I've had numerous compliments on my children's behavior and wasn't until the wife decided to leave me for a cult that most of the behavior of the oldest 3 has become undone. In effect, the wife has prematurely given them a long rope and pre-tied it into a noose for them. I fear for their outcome but, am currently playing the judicial game and 'winning' this battle and just hope it's resolved before permanent damage is done.\n As said in another thread, I have custody of the youngest son, 9 and other than having to deal with the wife engaging in reprisals against him, he's doing very well. \n Reprisals meaning stealing his clothing when he visits her and actively trying to cause problems for him in school so he runs a risk of failing. \n While I dealt with the teachers daily with his homework and school issues (he's special needs child) his mother ignored his academics and simply concentrated on the school principal (a friend of hers). \n It came to the point where the wife abducted him a couple of times with assistance from the school admin and used the time she kept him out of school whilst I sought legal remedy to add to his absenteism which could lead to an automatic flunking. She's told him several times that he was going to be held back by the principal and it didn't matter how well he's doing in school, there's no point as he's just going to fail.\n My conversations with the teachers has them stating that while he does have problems, he's in no danger of failing.\n Today was the last day of school. I don't speak to the admin. and was banned from the school after the wife assaulted me a few month back. While 'banned' I had a legal proxy act on my behalf for dealing with his school work and communicating with his teachers and class/ school activities so that method there of theirs didn't work. They tried to get around that by attempting to deny passing on any information to the proxy initially. But, after a day (I assume they contacted a lawyer) the principal complied.\n I'm currently biting my tongue but, may very well file a lawsuit once this is over.\n \n But, /end side tangent.\n \n I will restate, what JP sais is spot on.",

   "[QUOTE=Zardoz]I agree with JP.......\n QUOTE]\n \n Wow! Your situation sounds very similar to my brother's. He spent 4 years and <$10,000 trying to get custody of his 4 kids after his wife decided she wanted to run around. His youngest son went from failing grades to straight \"A's\" in ONE marking period after my brother got custody (not court ordered, however). When the kids realized that Dad was stricter than Mom, they drifted back to living with her and the grades dropped yet again. \n \n I wish you luck. It's a tough row to hoe but hang in there. It's worth it, IMO. emoticon_xgood",

   "The coiled spring metaphor sounds good, but lacks deeper descriptions.\n I have four children, the eldest being almost sixteen. My wife and myself are very protective over our children. some people may condemn this, but reflecting our children against other children of the same ages it seems as if our actions are right, of course only time will tell. But the way we see it is we have a job/duty to bring our children from newborn to adulthood in a manner which will assist them throughout their lives. Instead of allowing them to get too much involved in the enviroment which surrounds us, we discribe scenarios in great detail, until we know they understand the dangers.\n The time is approaching fast when they will be doing their own things, and to release them into the world with the knowledge of potential dangers is better than to release them to learn the hard way. We are not exceptionally strict, but on the other hand they know what they will and will not get away with. We are gradually releasing them as in the coiled spring metaphor.",

My son is surrounded by avid readers/writers. He has been read to, bought books and encouraged to read since the day he left the womb. Yet he remains not the world's strongest reader and has no love for reading. (Is this Martian child really mine? :p) He would rather be running, drawing or creating math problems for himself (he figured out multiplication by the time he was five).",
