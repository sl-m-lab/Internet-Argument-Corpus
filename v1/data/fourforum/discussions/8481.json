That position has no basis in fact. (Indeed, the rigid belief systems appears to be at odds sometimes with loving thy neighbor.)\n\n \n \n \n \n I understand why you made this statement, but may I share a life experience I had regarding your point here ? This is a old post of mine I made on here back in 2004. It may be a help to the readers here, and made be jibberish to them :)\n \n \n I had a religous experience 25 years ago right after my divorce, at age 27. I was at the bottom of the barrel of my life so to speak waking up everyday downtrodden with depression, and sometimes even had a notion of ending it all. One day, a guy I worked with started spouting off about how the \"end was near\" and all the signs of the Book of Revelations were upon us, on and on. I just listened to him and thought to myself well, maybe he had just drank some bad beer the night before. That night I went to bed tired, and had not thought any more about his spewings of the scriptures....\n \n Sometime during that night I had a dream, a powerful one that I can still explain every detail of now , 25 years later. In my dream I was at my sisters farm, at the huge cookout that her and my bro-in-law held for our family every summer. I was standing beside the big hay wagon, that had all the food on it, and felt a \"push\" to go around beside the big tobacco barn. Why, I did not know. But, in my dream it was dark already at the cookout and it was a nice star lit night. As I walked around to the back corner of the barn, another \"sensation \" hit me, moving me to look up to the dark, but starlit sky. Just as I did that, ( both of my arms are full of goosebumps now as I am typing this) ALL of the stars in that portion of the night sky that I was looking at, had pulled from their position in the universe, and formed a HUGE star lit CROSS. Then, suddenly I just awoke from the dream, but then I went back to sleep. ... \n \n \n I went to work that coming morning , not really thinking much about the dream I had that previous night. It just seemed to me like another odd dream, and I had always held dreams as just illogical firing sequences of the brain while in a resting state, with sporatic images of the subconcious merging togther to form a mini-movie. But, for whatever ever reason, that evening when I got back to my apt, I had a urge to pull the dusty old family Bible off of the bookshelf, a book I had not read since I was 13 years old. I read the scripture in the red print, because it seemed to have a bit more kick, being said to be the words of Christ and all. But, that night, the words didnt make much sense to me such as thou, upon, liken, etc, pure jibberish it seemed . The next night, for whatever reason, I felt pulled to get out the big book again. I still had plenty of Playboy mags around, but for some reason, they had lost their attraction for once in my young life. I read the scriptures again , that night though, I felt a \"sense\" of understanding of the words, that give me a \"fuzzy\" inside.....\n \n I found myself pulled to the Book each night , hungering to read the scriptures in the New Testament. I found my eyes tearing up as I read the \"Sermon on the Mount. \" For five nights in a row , I was reading and could feel myself pulling up out of the depths of depression I had grown accustomed to, every since that day I had caught my new bride of only a year cheating on me. Alas, the scriptures NOW made sense to me, and somehow , I was changing on the inside of me, and I didnt really know why....\n \n \n I was working construction at that time, living that rough and tumble life daily, one that had a lot of cussing, telling onnery jokes, looking at Hustler mags on my lunch break, going to topless bars whenever we got rained out from working. But, for some reason, all of a sudden I just quit swearing, it didnt \"feel\" right, I couldnt go in to a bar, because as soon as I tried to step in the door, it felt as if someone had thrown a wet blanket on me...\n \n The guys at work start making fun of me, calling me a \"holy roller\" when I told them I enjoyed reading the Bible , and didnt want their Hustler mags anymore. Whenever my nephew that I worked with, started tearing in to me about this \"religion\" stuff, and questioned me on why I believed in GOD and all that hokey bible stuff, I was amazed the answers I had for him. Knowledge poured out of me to counter him, or answer any question he fired at me about it. I lost my ability to get mad at people, something I was always good at, prior to my reading of the Book. I felt in me, a inner peace and joy I could not explain, along with a knowledge of the unknown , that I KNEW I did not have UNTIL the Book reading sessions....\n \n I struggled at being a baby Christian as the clergy called me, and it was a daily endeavor. I went from church to church, trying to find the \"right\" one, one that suited my expectations. All the time, I was losing friends, because my old friends felt uncomfortable around me, they wanted to go kill animals for fun, got to bars, get drunk, etc, and they knew I did not want to do those things anymore. I had not got the jest of being a christian, did not know it was a lifetime of leading a different life, a life of doing God's will. Because of my apparent \"change\" in the way I acted, and felt about those things I used to do, I was getting ready to lose my best friend I had met when we were just 7 years old. So, I wasnt strong enough to hold on to my faith, because I was \"losing\" too many friends. I was weak and I fell back in to my old ways, and I lost those \"fruits of the Spirit\" that I had enjoyed for a short time...\n \n \n \n My dream was referred to as a \"calling\" , at least that was what a few of the clergy said when I told them of my dream. In the Bible it says Christ may call upon those thirsting for or needing his blessings, yet some of the hard core clergy say those \"callings\" are meant only for those being called to minister, they are not for ordinary people. I say hogwash, they have there opinion, I have mine...\n \n While I was on my \"thirst\" for divine knowledge, I did a lot of reading on religion, the afterlife, some of the books I read were a 120 years old. It was interesting the way all the religions and faiths around the world had so many different ways of believing in basically the same message. And once again, this was just my personal experience, some may mock it, some can debate it to death, but none the less, I KNOW it happened to me. ...\n \n So , that was a life experience to me, and one I will base my opinions on whenever a topic about life after death, hell, being \"saved\" any of those issues come up. I refrain from quoting scripture and pounding the Bible, because to truly understand the Bible as it is written, and to get the \"inspired\" script from it, one has to be in \"spirit\". I am NOT a churchgoer , scripture quoter, and \"public\" Christian. But, I do believe in the power and saving grace of Christ, BECAUSE of my life experience, not because a clergy or a poster on a BBS , told me it is that way....\n \n Now, Lady---, this long post may have meant nothing to you, but if one sentence made sense , then maybe I helped, or I may have made it more muddled for you, I dont know. I know this, if you are beating yourself up because of your sexual orientation , and this quest for the proven knowledge of hell is the motivating factor, rest easy. Stop and think about something and I will just make a REAL broad what IF, here. What IF, Jeffrey Dahmer , while getting the last bit of life beat out of him, in his heart he gave his last minute of life over to Jesus, asked HIM for his saving grace and TRULY believed in HIM. Does that not fill the criteria sheet for the soul saving salvation, as the BIble states ?? ...\n \n That is where I could never get it settled in my mind or heart, about this saving grace criteria. Throughout all of my research I found one common thread whenever the theory of the hereafter was discussed by the entity scholars. That is, they believe the soul will live on as it has lived on earth. That being, if a person has loved without restraint, cared and helped those needing it and in general lived a good life here on earth , then the herafter will be liken to it. Live the opposite, the soul's hereafter will repeats itself, so on. What about all the souls that has never heard of Christ ? What of the people that denied Christ, although He grew up and testified in their own country ? To make a assumption that only ONE way is the only right way, is being a bit naive I think. I know people that are the most loving , honest, giving, family cherishing humans that there is, but they do not go the way of the Billy Grahams. Are they doomed to burn ? It is hard to rationalize that a omnipotent loving God, as having that kind of agenda...\n \n I know, the Holy Bible KJV, says believe in HIM and surrender your life to HIM, and ask HIM to forgive your sins and you will be granted eternal life. And that is TRUE , I believe that, but can ALL souls fit in to that category, we ask ? (Remainder of post snipped)",

No the truth is without the Good news that Jesus Is Christ, the Son of God... not one human being can even try to live like a christian because he will reject one part of Christs teaching and accept another, its hard enough to live a Christian life with belief it is impossible to live it without.\n\n \n \n Except for the sex and contraception and homosex (all of which I am strongly in favor of) the other attributes of selflessness and kindness are simply the right things to do if we are to live in harmony with one another in a civilized society. What has Jesus got to do with it?\n \n I would question the morality and character of a person who is loving to his neighbors ONLY because Christ commanded him thus.

   "\n \n Now you see you condemn Christianity for opposing homosexuality, premaritial sex and contraception, because you yourself are in favour of these things, yet you would oppose pedophiles, rapists and murderers even if they were in favour of these things, but what actually is it that makes you oppose these things, one has to ask the question why is rape wrong if Christ is not lord?\n \n \n \n Pedophiles, rapists, and murders all have one thing in common. They leave victims behind. That is why it is wrong. It has nothing to do with Christ at all. Japan is basically Jesus-free and they are also in opposition to pedophiles, rapists, and murderers.\n \n \n \n Why should human beings be respected if Christ is not lord.\n \n \n \n Because I have found that most people appreciate being respected. What does Christ have to do respect? I have known many Christians who do not know anything about respect, or compassion, or empathy, etc. I have also known many that do. The same goes for non-believers, there are good ones and not so good ones. That shows me, it is the person who is good, not the god he associates himself with.\n \n \n \n You are probably conditioned by a society that is heavely influenced by Christianity into believing you should act one way rather than another, think this is wrong rather than right or vice versa thats probably why you think kindness and selfisness to be good things.... but by what reason do they become good?\n \n \n \n \n Common sense. Why do people love their babies, hugging and kissing them, or consoling them when they cry, or feeding them when they are hungry? \n \n \n \n \n If a man derives much more pleasure from being nasty and selfish, why should he act otherwise if Jesus is not God?\n \n \n \n \n To save himself from getting hit over the head in a dark alley one night. and that has happenned to many people who force others to dislike them.\n \n \n \n \n If a mans only hope is in this world and this his alotted time, why suffer in order to help others?\n \n \n \n \n I don't know about you, but I see that as part of life. I do not consider it suffering to help others. I consider it my responsibility if I have the resources to do so.\n \n and by civilized society you must understand that civilized is a concept entirely based on mans own idea of what civilized constitutes, therefore it is entirely possible for one man to think it is civilized to not engage in pre maritial sex, homosexul sex or use contraception, while at the same time another man to believe to act in these ways is civilized and yet another to believe rape, pedophillia and murder to be civilized.\n \n \n \n It comes down to common sense again. Pedophilia, rape and murder are forces upon another person, who as a result of such behaviors bcomes a victim. In the case of murder, a dead victim. Yes I suppose someone could call that civilized, but hopefully they would be using that terminology from a jail cell or a state mental facility.\n \n \n \n No you miss the point entirely.....\n \n \n \n \n I can only hope to love my neighbour as myself because of the fact that Christ Commanded me to and will help me to through his grace in the sacraments, that is all. \n \n for any man to love his neighbour as himself without Christ..... is quite frankly an impossiblility.\n \n \n \n That is where your belief clashes with the life experience of others. You speak of your relationship with Christ. All it has done for you, etc. You would like people to believe what you are saying, because you are telling them what you know to be the truth. You cross over a line here with this statement, \"for any man to love his neighbour as himself without Christ..... is quite frankly an impossiblility.\" Who are you to claim such a thing, when you have no way of really knowing if that statement is true? I know that statement to be false. Which makes me uncomfortable when you discuss the lord Jesus Christ as your reason for aspiring to such high levels of mortal behavior. What you haven't learned from Jesus your lord is how to respect and accept the beliefs or non-beliefs of others. Once again I use this statement as an example, \"for any man to love his neighbour as himself without Christ..... is quite frankly an impossiblility. Since I know that to be an untrue statement, you have lied. That one statement contains both ignorance and arrogance at the same time.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n If a man killed my family, I may murder him if I didnt believe in God, but I may fear the retrebution of the law enforcement agenices.\n \n \n \n \n I had a man and a womann kill my grandfather in cold blood with a kitchen knife. He was left to die and was found a day later. The only thing I wanted was to have him back and wish it had never happenned. Of course that was never going to happen. I can honestly say I never wished harm or death upon his killer. What would it solve? How could I do the same to this girl, and hurt those who love her. No matter what she did, I am sure somebody, somewhere loves her. A mother, or grandmother, brother, sister, etc. Murdering her would be inflicting the same pain to her loved ones, as she did upon myself and my loved ones. They do not deserve that. Neither did my family. Retribution brings satisfaction to alot of people. I do not understand it, and I do not like it.\n \n \n \n \n But as I believe in God, I would forgive that man and hope to help him by showing my love for him through the grace of Christ because this man is my neighbour who I love as myself because God loves him.\n \n \n \n Out of curiosity, is this common practice for Christians when someone they love is murdered?\n \n \n \n \n \n That is what Christianity is about, self sacrafice, Jesus Gave his last pound on the cross for us.\n \n \n \n That's all fine, but what Christianity can't seem to sacrifice is it's pride. It's insistence on it's own greatness, and the greatness of it's leader Jesus Christ. The insistence of it's own truth, which of course renders everyone elses belief false. The judgement calls on the lives of those who could care less what your God thinks.\n \n \n \n It is if you understand what i mean, If God exists and if God is Good then all that is Good is from God, but if there is no God....what is Good and what is evil?\n \n \n \n \n The same things are good and evil with or without God. A smile and a hello are good, and somebody with a gun to your head is evil.\n \n \n \n \n and who gets to decied?\n \n \n \n \n \n Those who prefer a smile and a hello, over getting shot in the head.\n \n \n \n \n \n of course but can you get your head around that ethics is based ones own idea of what is ethical, therefore a man who believes pedophilia to be ethical would be leading an ethical life in having sex with kids.\n \n \n \n It is not ethical to victimize others. \n \n The church is awash with sinners, homosexuals, pedophiles, rapists, murderers, adulterers so on and so forth, there is a man with every possible sin in the church, but he is being crucified to himself and rising to a new life in Christ, these men and women have choosen something outside of themselves, it would be easier for many of them to leave the church homosexuality, adultery fornication ect are accepted parts of todays society but they conform themselves to Christ...why?\n \n \n It gives many a sense of security and stability. It gives them hope and a sense of belonging to this world that God himself made. Also fear of eternal damnation helps bring up enrollment numbers, along with heavenly rewards for doing what the book tells you to. And in this country it's really popular.\n \n \n \n \n \n As far as I am concerned I know it is impossible to lead a good Christian life with mere ethics... one needs Christs grace..... it is when I am weak then I am strong.\n \n \n \n Try not to make assumptions about people and their lives which you know nothing of.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Your moral ablitiy maybe better than mine, but your whole morallity hangs by a thread because nothing preserves your morality, today your morality tells you homosexuality is fine, tomorrow it may tell you pedophillia is ok, there is no solid morality for you, it is subject to personal preferences and social manufacturing.\n\n \n \n \n \n Your arrogance astounds me. Now we find that your morality is slated for preservation, like a national park. At some point your belief in Jesus allowed you to think you know what others need in their lives. How can you talk about solid morality when you speak of homosexuality and pedophillia as similar things. Pedophilia leaves victims behind. Homosexuality, at least the kind that I know about is consensual sex between two adults. \n \n \n \n \n there is no solid morality for you, \n \n \n Are you aware of what how condescending you are by the matter of fact attitude of your statements? How do you find your morality any more solid then the nexy guy. Please help me out with your mindset. You believe that the bible is the word of the one true god, who late in life had a son, with a human virgin female. It was an immaculate conception at that. You had to be informed of this through a very old book, translated from various ancient tongues. Portions of which have never been translated.

   "gaetano replied, \" I read your posts and am glad you have found Jesus. The only thing that sets odd with me, is that you feel that people cannot induce these feelings into themselves. You can if that is the way you are brought up. Children tend to emulate what they are shown. \".\n \n \n I said EOT for me , but seeing you have taken the time to read my posts I will show you due respect by attempting to explain my posts better. Yes I found Jesus, but could not walk His path long. I really wish I could have though, the inner strength given from His Spirit is awesome...\n \n As to emulating my childhood environment? hmmmm... Lets see...\n \n \n I was brought up by two alcoholic parents that did not shadow a church door when I knew them. My mother ( a good soul she is ) made me go to church from age 8 to 13 but I did not learn a whole lot about christianity in that little southern baptist church . Mostly just the fabled bible stories such as Jonah, Noahs Ark etc.. There was summer revival times, oh yeah, fun times... country road wagon hayrides in the moonlight being pulled by a old farmall tractor, snuggled up with the girlfiend in the hay, campfire hot dogs , homemade cookies and Kool Aid . Yeah, I can emulate those times :), they were nice for me....\n \n \n \n As a kid my most memorable times were things unlike most children have, thankfully . When I was 10 years old I stared in horror as my drunken father laid his 4 inch knife blade across my mothers throat, and was starting to pull on it just as my older brother grabbed him and stopped it. I watched him break 10 inch dinner plates over my Mom's head just because she took the last drink out of the pint of whiskey. So no, I dont think emulation is my story.... \n \n I realize the \"spiritual\" events I posted are beyond logical thinking or credible to ones own powers of critical thinking . To the non - believer, my posts here will come across as testimonials of lunacy. There is simply NO way I can convince anyone or PROVE to anyone on here, any validity to what I posted of those two experiences I had. Why not we think ?? Simple, the readers were not there with me.....\n \n \n I am not one of formal education, so my typing and interpretational skills are poor, but I have been around a few blocks in life . So I will plod on here to hammer out a explanation as to where I am coming from....\n \n \n This is why I posted the \"walk in to the door\" experiment to Trebor. One can read millions of sentences on this forum from very intelligent and credible people. But as one reads these posts and the absolute \"truths\" that people post about what they believe and why, the reader never really knows what is true, accurate , or just supposition and opinion...\n \n \n Words are just type set to make a sentence. We can derive from them what our minds percieves of those words as we read them, but our minds will jade our interpretations of those words because of the beliefs we already hold dear to us. ...\n \n Now, a person trying to walk through a closed door will experience a physical reality. No opinions, suppositions, no deductive reasonings about it, just a \"whack\" against the nose when it hits the wood door. I experienced two realities that physically happened to me. Just like walking in to a wood door that is latched closed. I felt them, sensed them, acknowledged them for what they were. ...\n \n \n I was at one of my \"low\" life cycles when I had the bible reading , \"Christ Spirit moved me and lifted me\" , experience. This is the point I am trying to make if the reader may pull the jaded blinders off just for a moment. ..\n \n I did not pick up the bible back then with any intentions or forethoughts of CHANGING my emotional state of mind. I did not start reading it thinking it would bring me out of my low cycle. I just started reading it with no preconceived notions about anything. ..\n \n What happened to me as a result of that open minded/heart bible reading , is in my original post so I will not repeat it. A change came over me that was evident to others around me. It was not just \"in my mind\". I did not, or could not have made those changes in my inner being back then. For one thing I did not have those feelings in me or the rationale in me at that time, to make myself be lifted up. Nothing in my physical world at that time happened to give me any relief from what I was enduring. Alas, but reading the WORD and the Spirit of Christ did though .. Thats my story and I am sticking to it....\n \n Hope this helps answer your question.",

   "I suggested earlier that you look up 'inclusive fitness'.\n\n \n But why should a man accept inclusive fitness why should he not as so many people today do.... embrace personal fitness...for what reason?\n \n \nSocieties, not individuals, decide what is 'civilised' behaviour. I know of no society in history that has regarded rape, pedophillia and murder in that light. You've created a very crude straw man here.\n\n \n so when did society get this privalage and why should anyone be bothered to conform themselves to the accepted norm of a group of people, the state of germany decided that killing jews was a cilivlized behaviour back in the 1940's but was it?\n \n To give society the ability to decided what constitutes acceptable behaviour is stupid at best and insaine at worst.\n \n The straw man I think you will find is built by men like hittler who want to be able to decide for themselves what constitutes acceptable behaviour....\n \n I dont think you have thought out exactly what your saying entails when you say \"it is societies what decided what is civilized behaviour and not God?\n \n but how can you trust \"God\"? Is it not just a idea made up by the catholic church to control people?\n \n you could say it could be, but you also have to look at the messages of God to his people through the jewish temple and now through the catholic church and ask yourself do you want to be a part of brining that message...... and for me I want to be apart of bringing that message of true self sacraficing love to the world even if I often fail to live it myself because I believe in it so deeply that I am willing to try to conform myself to it and I firmly believe I will do it by the help of God, he is my strengh and my hope.\n \n Now you may say its a empty hope, but I believe because what else is there?\n \n Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n \n Often people say that Christianity is a crutch for poor people, but who among us can deny that we are poor in one sense or another?\n \n For us our only hope is in christ in so many ways, if we are poor in spirit we can become with the help of Christ strong in spirit.\n \n There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends, even for his enemies\n \n I wish that I could convay the true beuty of that passage to you all, for in reading that sentance and to feel the truth, the power and the most wonderful love in that sentance is to feel god himself...\n \n it is by far and away the most radical message to this world in which we live and it has been for over 2000 years, these words are eternal words that speak out not across societies but time..., these words speak to mankind in their most individual sense and call us as human beings to that love that we find so abundantly in that message...was Jesus Christ God, you better believe he was there is no mere mortal who could say such a increadably deep and true sentance, to many of you that what I just said may seem absurd you may say I could easily think of myself saying that and I am not a christian but have you ever thought of what it would entail if you said it and meant it?\n \n To live it...... and jesus did\n \n He was God, the words he spokes is and was the truth and he is and was true to his word.\n \n he meant it, he understood the words he was saying and he lived it, this man was God.\n \n These words have become part of our society but we have forgot what it truely means perhaps as a society we never understood them in the first place and so this is proof that the message of christ is just as important as ever... \n \n as society turns way from Christ...(to be continued)\n \n \n \n i believe society turning away from christ is a evil that God is turning into a much greater good, because even if the church numbers fall or persecution comes, people will be called by christ to submit and conform ourselves to that love , that true god..we find in those words and so as the world turns away from that love we may find that many numbers may leave the church and many more desert christian values, but the church itself, those who do believe.... will be people who truely worship that love\n \n My sheep know my voice and they follow me.\n \n and if you dont hear christ speak to you in that passage perhaps you never will, perhaps you will never know the true beuty of that love we find in those words but I sincearly hope that you will.\n \n \n \n \n .... continued\n \n every man will be questioned by that love, the great judge, even now\n \n Some say God is dead, We christians are living proof that he lives.\n \n No man has greater love than this to lay down his life for his friends even for his enemies, what you do unto the least among you....you do unto me\n \n Abortion.... does it contradict the love in these passages\n \n Yes it does, it really does so can anyone really blame the catholic church in opposing it so vehemenantly, its just one example of how by the catholic churches steadfast example Christ is calling all mankind to the love we find in those passages\n \n The catholic church has for 2000 years been a becon for Christ to the world.\n \n \n just as Christ prophesied \"a city on a hill top can not be hidden\"\n \n \n \n \nThis why I consider the moral atheist as a superior being.

Slavery is now regarded in most societies as self-evidently evil; at one time it was regarded as self-evidently necessary and good. Many countries (not yours, I think) now regard capital punishment as barbaric; but only a few generations ago it was seen as fine and just, and eminently acceptable as a public spectacle. In some societies burning widows on their husbands' funeral pyres was at one time seen as morally correct; few would now agree. Concepts of good and evil change over time and geography.\n \n So, where does that leave the Holocaust? If I accept that it was a grossly evil act, does that not mean I also accept the existence of absolutes of good and evil? No. Genocide at any time and place must be at the farthest possible extreme on the spectrum of moral acceptability, such that it will be condemned as abhorrent by virtually everyone, everywhere. But that spectrum is what exists in the real world - not a neat pair of boxes marked 'good' and 'evil' with nothing between them.",

   "\n THAT IS BULLSHAT\n \n In the uk less than 50 years ago pedophillia was reletivly unheard of, our kids could walk the streets safely and we could leave our doors unlocked.... its only since the sexual reveloution and the feminist movement embracing it, that such horrid perverstions have become more abundant, I am not saying the problem wasnt there before only that the problem has become much more preverlant.\nPedophilia existed 50 years ago, behind closed doors, it simply was not acknowledged and discussed. People tried to pretend that it didn't exist. Children were taught little about sexuality and they had no idea that it was inappropriate for adults to use children sexually. They knew that it hurt them physically and psychically but they were never told that it was wrong, they were threatened by their abusers to keep silent, if they told other adults, often the adults refused to believe them because they did not believe that pedophilia existed.\n \nThe amount of pedophile priests in proportion to pedophiles in secular society is much lower percentage, the only thing that makes the issue of pedophile priests such a scandle is that Christianity has taught since its conception that pedophillia is wrong and to say it was the feminist movement that unearthed the problem, no it wasnt it was members of the catholic layity themselves who had suffered this abuse who came forward.\nDo you have solid evidence that the incidence of pedophilia is lower in the priesthood than in the general public? \n \n Where has Christianity historically spoken about pedophilia and condemned it as wrong?\n \n The Catholic laity came forth to acknowledge what they had suffered because feminists had raised their consciousness and they were finally ready to challenge the rule of authority.\n \n. . . .
