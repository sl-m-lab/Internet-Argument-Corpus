Take a look at my signature. \n\n \n If we did, then man wouldn't have free will, would he?\n \n \n \nb) The bible may not change, but human society does. \n\n \n Human society does, but human nature does not. \n \n \n \n \nI would be more likely to believe the bible if it didn't make claims of (scientifically) impossible things, like a worldwide flood or an omnipotent god.\n\n \n That's because you're putting the human endeavor of science on the same plane as Holy Scripture, which says this;\n \n ...Do not think of yourselves more highly than you ought... (Romans 12:3) and\n \n ...Lean not on your own understanding.... (Proverbs 3:5)\n \n When humans have shown the ability to get their houses in order concerning money managment, helping others, avoiding drunkeness, and countless other things that the Bible teaches, maybe some consideration could be given to the scientific questioning of the Book of Genesis.

   "Actually, the word evolution never means atheism except when used by creationists who want to pretend that science is anti-christian. \n\n \n Never? Not even when used by Richard Dawkins? Talkorigins? American Atheists? \n \n \n \nNot historical documents but mythology. Genesis isn't historical. To believe that it is takes a certain intentional ignorance of the universe. \n\n \n That's the atheist worldview.

You did get the second part correct about creationism. That is why some Christians are not creationists. \n\n \n Do you have Kenneth Miller's book? :) \n \n \n \nOnly those ignorant of science and evolution think that \"evolution\" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance. \n\n \n Those who represent science think it is capable of debunking the Bible, when those who represent science are atheists. They shouldn't be establishing themselves in schools. Violates the first amendment.\n \n \n \nIndeed. Cobb County Georgia. And the sticker was found unconstitutional in Federal Court. The problem was that it was religiously motivated, was placed only in biology texts, didn't say anything true that the teachers weren't already teaching, and actually was not accurate. The sticker was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the second prong of the Lemon Test. I suspect that you don't know what that is. Anyway, the 11th Circuit reversed. \n\n \n Yes, the ACLU has lots of money to spread this BS, (some of it is taxpayer money - violates the first amendment)\n \n \n \nParanoia is so ugly. It's not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact? \n\n \n To teach them to look at each side and decide for themselves is not paranoia. Blocking one side, not by the will of the people but by the courts, is actually paranoia. \n \n \n \nNo. Not in matters of science.\n\n \n Not in matters of atheism.

   "Depends on your definition of smart. Currently, I would say that IQ is one of the best objective tests of intelligence, and whether or not someone is a scientist is irrelevant.\n The best answer is probably no. However, you are missing the point: because we know more about our universe, we tend to think more logically, and the average person's IQ is higher. I personally would point to the school systems rather than science, but I came to the same conclusion.\n\n It is important to stress the difference between someone who is intelligent and someone who is smart / knowledgable. In the useage of the terms, as I have most often seen them, someone who is smart is someone who has amassed a lot of knowledge either on a specific subject or on a wide range of subjects and can recite that knowledge at will. That says nothing about the way he analyzes and interprets that knowledge. The later lies more in the realm of intelligence, which I interpret as being skilled in the analysis of the knowledge one has at hand - including mainly the skills of logic, intellectual creativity, inventiveness, etc. \n \n I would say that, as a culture in general, we have become smarter - i.e. more knowledgable - but not necessarily more intelligent. Science has answered many of the questions posed by man which previously had been automatically assumed to have religious answers - ex. how did humans come into being, where does lightning come from, why is there night and day, etc. That does not mean that the men who held their beliefs prior to the advent of science were less intelligent, they simply did not have access to that scientific knowledge so they based their logical analysis on the assumed knowledge of the day, which was largely religious. \n \n Nowadays, there are many strongly religious people who are quite smart and knowledgeable - they have amassed a lot of knowledge about the beliefs and history of their religion. However, it is much harder nowadays for those who are intelligent to be strongly religious since so much Scientific evidence exists now which does challenge those beliefs. They either tend to simply ignore that evidence, or misrepresent it in order to hold on to those beliefs. I have respect for those religious leaders who at least try to judge the evidence objectively without having to massively distort it, such as the late Pope John Paul II who accepted the theory of evolution as explaining the developement of the human body. \n \nI don't see much evidence that we're thinking more logically. If we were, wouldn't there be less conflict, more stability in society? I also believe just about every study indicates that our school systems are going downhill.\n\n Unfortunately, we humans have a balance of intelligence and emotions and though this mixture is often used for good, it is far too often used for bad ends. I would claim that it is our control over our emotions that isn't too much better now than it was centuries ago. When people act with anger, they tend not to react in the restrained fashion which their intelligence would recommend, were they to be thinking calmly and clearly. I have heard people who otherwise seem intelligent advocate \"nuking\" the Middle East into submission. That is their fear and anger talking, not their intelligence. \n \n As for our school systems, I think there are a few things going on. First, we have acquired more knowledge over the last century or two - more scientific knowledge, more knowledge about various cultures around the world, a more systematic understanding of history, etc. However, there are many distractions in our culture - TV, internet, etc.. Couple that with a generally anti-intellectual climate and you have generations that make much less effort at educating themselves compared to the very well-read generations which existed at around the time of our country's founding. A good education takes not only good books but people interested in reading them. \n \nWe've improved in some ways, and gone downhill in others. I'm not encouraged by the balance. I don't think \"civilization\" is neutral - religion / non religion is always present, and both are equally not neutral.\n\n It seems to me that, a lot of the time, people decide on their actions first and find justifications afterwards - be they based on religious or non-religious arguements. There have been horrendous things done in the name of religion both historically and in the present day. Similarly, horrid things have been done in the name of \"the people\" in atheist communist systems. Also, in the name of world peace, we, the US, have dropped nuclear bombs and firebombed or carpetbombed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Japan and Germany with the goal of \"softening\" the enemy. Evils that humans do have a lot of sources - greed, ignorant knee-jerk anger, vengeance or perceived vengeance, over-reaction in fear, etc. Mostly, it is due to a lack of control over human emotions (or, often, an exploitation of them by their leaders). I don't see much of a difference in emotional control of those who are religious vs those who are atheists. \n \n I heard an interesting interview on NPR the other day, with Marc Hauser who wrote \"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong\" (which I hope to soon buy and read). He claimed that surveys of atheists vs strongly religous Christians show that, on a very wide range of moral questions, atheists and far-right Christians share very similar views. Essentially, there are many aspects of human morality which seem to be independent of whether or not a person is religious or which religion he/she believes in.",

If we didnt come out of a religious coma, then we never would've made advances in sceince! \n\n \n \n \n \nCreationists apparently have a hard time understanding many things; why do you expect a different result for natural selection?\n \n \n Say you have a wooden floor composed of slats with gaps between the slats. Some objects fall between the slats. There was no purpose to those objects falling or others not falling, nor was there purpose for constructing the floor in such a way that certain objects would fall and others wouldn't. The floor simply exists, and the objects simply exist. Viola, selection without purpose. \n\n \n The way objects do or do not fall through your floor is a \"random event\". Which is more accurate, \"selection without purpose\" or \"random event\"? The words \"random event\" don't sound as convincing to open minds, so they aren't used in evolution. It was one of Darwin's greatest discoveries - word games - and evolution today would be far weaker without it. \n \n \n \nGee, marc, seems I've kept repeating that proofs are for maths and alcohol, not for science, and you keep saying that I'm claiming that science proves anything I want. \n\n \n Now why would I say that - maybe when you make statements like this above? LOL\n \n \nParts of the Bible have been indisputably disproven. \n\n \n As always, thank you for posting!\n \n \n \n \n Now you are claiming that mathematics disproves something. Show me the mathematical proofs (i.e. disproofs) for you claim, marc. Go right ahead. \n\n \n It's called \"impossible odds\", largely testable, repeatable, and observable. (ever bought a powerball ticket? - I never bother to, myself) \n \n \n \nWait, you're saying that a world with God could not have produced a fossil record? \n\n \n No I didn't say that at all. The Christian worldview interprets the fossil record differently. It doesn't have billions in taxpayer money to influence it. \n \n \n \n[mock]I seem to agitate you, marc. If you were so sure of yourself, why would you be so agitated?[/mock]\n\n \n If I was agitated, I would respond to all your posts. If you haven't noticed, I don't. Wait, you have noticed - post 32;\n \n \nThe reader will note that you proceeded to ignore my posts everywhere on this site for quite some time afterward. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere's also a difference between being shown to be wrong and being attacked/persecuted.\n \n \n \n No; this is what you get for believing that those creationist websites are the slightest bit credible. Big Bang cosmology didn't catch on until the mid-1900s. Darwin came first. Even if your God popped the universe into existence, evolution could (did) still happen.\n \n \n No no, marc; if you want to discuss morals, you head back to my thread in the philosophy forum. You know, the one you encouraged me to start for you before you scampered away like a scared little baby? (And yes, you're damned right I'll keep bringing it up until you follow through on your invitation.)\n\n \n Oh, I believe you'll keep bringing it up. It's a symptom of \"sputtering with rage\", an Ann Coulter term. The two clearest indications of it are name calling, and bad language. By the way, I've finished Kenneth Miller's book. I should be able to start a new thread on it in the next couple of days. Should I wait a little longer, to give you a cooling off period?",

   "However, it is much harder nowadays for those who are intelligent to be strongly religious since so much Scientific evidence exists now which does challenge those beliefs. \n\n \n It challanges them, from a human perspective. It's possible to be intelligent, and question those human challanges. The Bible says something about \"thinking too highly of ourselves\", and \"leaning not on our own understanding\". \n \n \nThey either tend to simply ignore that evidence, or misrepresent it in order to hold on to those beliefs. I have respect for those religious leaders who at least try to judge the evidence objectively without having to massively distort it, such as the late Pope John Paul II who accepted the theory of evolution as explaining the developement of the human body. \n\n \n A lot of these religious leaders are being political - I don't think Pope John Paul II clearly said that he now doesn't believe that Adam was the first, fully formed man, or that now he's changed his mind about original sin. He's trying to keep the Catholic Church out of political battles that it can't financially afford.\n \n \n \nUnfortunately, we humans have a balance of intelligence and emotions and though this mixture is often used for good, it is far too often used for bad ends. I would claim that it is our control over our emotions that isn't too much better now than it was centuries ago. When people act with anger, they tend not to react in the restrained fashion which their intelligence would recommend, were they to be thinking calmly and clearly. I have heard people who otherwise seem intelligent advocate \"nuking\" the Middle East into submission. That is their fear and anger talking, not their intelligence. \n\n \n Fear and anger are alive and well in atheism, too. \n \n \nAs for our school systems, I think there are a few things going on. First, we have acquired more knowledge over the last century or two - more scientific knowledge, more knowledge about various cultures around the world, a more systematic understanding of history, etc. However, there are many distractions in our culture - TV, internet, etc.. Couple that with a generally anti-intellectual climate and you have generations that make much less effort at educating themselves compared to the very well-read generations which existed at around the time of our country's founding. A good education takes not only good books but people interested in reading them. \n\n \n \"Distractions in our culture\" - the end draws nearer, the Bible predicts it. \n \n \nIt seems to me that, a lot of the time, people decide on their actions first and find justifications afterwards - be they based on religious or non-religious arguements. There have been horrendous things done in the name of religion both historically and in the present day. Similarly, horrid things have been done in the name of \"the people\" in atheist communist systems. Also, in the name of world peace, we, the US, have dropped nuclear bombs and firebombed or carpetbombed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Japan and Germany with the goal of \"softening\" the enemy. Evils that humans do have a lot of sources - greed, ignorant knee-jerk anger, vengeance or perceived vengeance, over-reaction in fear, etc. Mostly, it is due to a lack of control over human emotions (or, often, an exploitation of them by their leaders). I don't see much of a difference in emotional control of those who are religious vs those who are atheists. \n\n \n I agree, we are all humans, and equal in almost every way. \n \n \nI heard an interesting interview on NPR the other day, with Marc Hauser who wrote \"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong\" (which I hope to soon buy and read). He claimed that surveys of atheists vs strongly religous Christians show that, on a very wide range of moral questions, atheists and far-right Christians share very similar views. Essentially, there are many aspects of human morality which seem to be independent of whether or not a person is religious or which religion he/she believes in.\n\n \n They are shaped largely by the society those people live in. Morality is deteriorating in the U.S. overall, and it is deteriorating among Christians.",

   "And, of course, the rest of it is just ad hoc invention because \"it can't be wrong!\" \n\n \n Like much of Darwinism, yes - it's based on faith. \n \n \n \nThen perhaps it would be a good idea for creationists to educate themselves about evolutionary theory so that they might understand evolutionary terms. \n\n \n That's been done, when the word \"selection\" is compared to the word \"random\", atheists get very angry. Education complete! \n \n \nIt's actually not all that complicated. You see, the term is \"natural selection.\" That's a pretty good indication that the selector is nature, i.e., the environment in which an organism lives. That didn't occur to you? \n\n \n Not when we have the word \"random\" in our vocabulary. Why not use the word that actually fits? \"Selection\" involves an intelligent selector. Random does not. \n \n \nWhy does it need purpose?\n Oh! I see your problem. You are assuming that there must be some sort of intelligence behind it. You are personifying nature. Apparently you just can't get over the idea that there must be some sort of intelligence guiding how every drop of rain falls. You seem think that natural selection is some sort of inviolate mind that always, without exception, guides the favored individuals to survive while it ruthlessly eliminates the disfavored. Not like that. The words \"natural selection\" are just the words that Darwin chose to call his theory, a short hand for a complex process. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. It is the statistical tendency for organisms that possess more beneficial genetic characteristics to leave more offspring. It is, of course, the fit to the environment that determines how beneficial a characteristic is. \n\n \n Yes yes, I've seen it all before. Natural processes, guided by God, can be twisted into evidence that no God is needed. Darwin needed nature to do some impressive things, and an unimpressive word like \"random\" wasn't cutting it. \n \n \n \nAbsolutely correct. But evolution has been going on for a few hundred million years. \n\n \n Yet all the different kinds of animals, including man, evolved over the same time period to end up here all at the same time? The starting times were the same, or the starting times were different with different evolving times, all dropping us here at exactly the same time? \n \n \n \nTry to keep yourself informed. Piltdown man was a forgery.\n\n \n That was my point. Piltdown man was a forgery long before there was anywhere near the political money involved to encourage science to forge things, like there is today. You're absolutely sure there are no forgeries today? You have as much faith in science as I do in the Bible.",

The poor kids were flunking out, but at least they had voc ed and football. The middle-class kids in the AP classes had barely learned a thing, but they were going to graduate and go on to college. The system \"worked\" by its own minimal standards, and so reacted to challenges with righteous indignation. \n \n The plight of Pasadena High School reminds us, first, that national prosperity has blinded us to widespread academic failure, and second, that we have two quite distinct species of failure - the problem of illiteracy and high dropout rates which plagues inner-city children, and the problem of mass mediocrity which applies largely to the middle-class. The twin problems are inscribed in test scores. According the most recent NAEP, the average reading score of fourth graders poor enough to qualify for a free or reduced lunch was well below the level considered \"basic.\" Non-poor students averaged above \"basic\" but below \"proficient.\" A grand total of seven percent of fourth-graders read at an \"advanced\" level.\n \n What explains the crisis of illiteracy and failure? In no other industrialized nation do the schools have to contend with the varieties of suffering and disability that little children in Bed-Stuy or East L.A. bring with them to school. We ask the schools to fill the void created by the collapse of every other institution; that is too much to expect. The schools throw up their hands, and make do with \"business math\" and the machine shop. Or they content themselves with tiny achievements. I recently visited a school in Memphis where the teachers were delighted when the children wrote a sentence or two; then, after instituting a new reading and writing program, they were amazed to find that the kids could be pushed to write a paragraph.\n\n \n http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=110&subid=136&contentid=1205\n \n And this one;\n \n \nIs There a Problem?\n Most people agree that public schools are a bundle of problems.

   "Methodological naturalism is capable of existing with or without atheism. It depends on how it's applied. If it's working with material, harnessing electricity, inventing microchips etc, then it's not atheist, if it's doing things like staring into outer space and coming to predetermined conclusions, or analyzing the fossil record, making it comply with a predetermined conclusion, then it can very well be atheistic.\n\n Oh, yes. An argument often used against creation. The catch is, Darwin's theory overcame a widespread belief in god and is now the most accepted view on how life came to this point. Why didn't people who were reluctant to accept it notice that it came to \"predetermined conclusions\"?\n Not only that, but it is based on common sense: organisms that are better adapted to their environment survive more. Organisms that survive more reproduce more. Organisms that reproduce more become more prevalent. The trait that allowed them to reproduce more also becomes more prevalent. If this happens enough, organisms change.\n \nIt's a difference in worldviews. Some have a hard time believing that intelligent things can happen with no intelligence present.\n\n That's an argument from personal incredulity (logical fallacy).\n \nThat's the atheist worldview, yes. If a system evolves into something that is irreducibly complex, it was dysfunctional until it was complete. If it was dysfunctional for enough time to evolve, it was dysfunctional for enough time to deteriorate millions of times over. I'm sure atheism has danced it's way out of that, but I'm no more interested in hearing it than you are about what the Bible actually says.\n\n Well, you will hear it. Talk.Origins has some pretty good refutations of irreducible complexity.\n \nIt was implied in post #43, by another poster. Perhaps you'd like to take it up with him?\n\n That would be me. What I am saying (and shooterandproud doesn't have to agree) is that we believe that the earth exists, but there could be a force field holding everything away from a central point. This could be covered by a hologram and set up to be indistinguishable from a planet. However, that is no reason to believe that the earth doesn't exist (see occam's razor).\n \nParts of Darwinism have been indisputably disproven. (Complexities of the simplest forms of life, for example) But some people have decided Darwinism is true because they want it to be. Ring a bell?\n\n Another topic that has been \"indisputably disproven\" (to quote another poster) by talk.origins.\n \nMy point was that it's hard to tell the difference in who is posting, you all post exactly alike. Not true with me, and the other creationists here. We all have different styles - make different points, without falling all over each other saying exactly the same thing. Makes one wonder about the application of the term \"freethought\", doesn't it?\n\n Free thought (and free will) are all very nice, and it is interesting that you attempt to get me into an argument with shooterandproud and then claim that we all say the same things.\n However, because we say the same things, it might be a valid conclusion to say that evolution is self-consistant. Unlike the bible, which has a warlike god and a peaceful god in one.\n \nThat's because you're trying to change the subject, it is a fallacy ya know.\n\n Please find it on Wikipedia's list of fallacies. In the meantime, just try to keep the debate on track.\n \nAt least I'm not preoccupied with \"asses\". But really it is, since one of your helpers said so;\n\n We don't have to agree on everything (you and supersport appear to have different views). Personally, I don't agree with shooterandproud on this. Science can proceed with or without religion.\n \nThe way objects do or do not fall through your floor is a \"random event\". Which is more accurate, \"selection without purpose\" or \"random event\"? The words \"random event\" don't sound as convincing to open minds, so they aren't used in evolution. It was one of Darwin's greatest discoveries - word games - and evolution today would be far weaker without it.\n\n Actually, as I have stated before, evolution is self-consistant, and \"random event\" does not describe the process detailed above. If you think it does, say so (it won't help your case, but you are free to say so anyway).\n \nNow why would I say that - maybe when you make statements like this above? LOL\n\n Maybe you shouldn't say it. Science doesn't prove anything it wants- it points to the logical conclusions of the evidence. By the way, the bible contains few logical conclusions about earth's history.\n \nAs always, thank you for posting!\n\n No rebuttal?\n Oh, wait, that's right, there's no rebuttal.\n \nIt's called \"impossible odds\", largely testable, repeatable, and observable. (ever bought a powerball ticket? - I never bother to, myself)\n\n Impossible odds of what? Evolution producing what we have today?\n \nNo I didn't say that at all. The Christian worldview interprets the fossil record differently. It doesn't have billions in taxpayer money to influence it.\n\n Appeal to tradition. By the way, if Christianity is right, how did \"evolutionism\" get billions of taxpayer dollars?\n Isn't the US in control of taxpayer dollars, and isn't the president religious?\n \nIf I was agitated, I would respond to all your posts. If you haven't noticed, I don't. Wait, you have noticed - post 32;\n\n Ok, but if you aren't agitated, why do you keep arguing about evolution? Won't it just go away if ignored?\n Also, I personally respond to supersport's posts because they present such a big target (and it is fun to keep knocking him down from his self-important perch).\n \nOh, I believe you'll keep bringing it up. It's a symptom of \"sputtering with rage\", an Ann Coulter term. The two clearest indications of it are name calling, and bad language. By the way, I've finished Kenneth Miller's book. I should be able to start a new thread on it in the next couple of days. Should I wait a little longer, to give you a cooling off period?\n\n I should start counting how many logical fallacies are used... This one is because you correlate one \"symptom\" with \"sputtering with rage.\"\n He could just want everyone to know that you don't always follow through.\n \nThank you, U.S. history and politics is most relevant to these conversations I think. I apologize if you're not from the U.S., but your profile doesn't say. If I knew you were from a foriegn country, I would respect that.\n\n Does it make a difference where I'm from? If I told you that I lived in a \"foriegn\" country (I don't), would that change your opinion of me?\n \nMaybe I'm not exactly like all creationists. If it's not a political subject, I'm not all that interested in discussing it.\n\n Well, it does contradict the 6000 year old universe hypothesis, but it can't be classified under \"evolution.\"\n \nJesus didn't like that idea much either. Read Mark, Chapter 2, 23-28.\n\n That is a difference from the philosophy of the old testament. I don't want to insult any Jewish people; I just want to point out a major inconsistency in the bible.",

   "It challanges them, from a human perspective. It's possible to be intelligent, and question those human challanges. The Bible says something about \"thinking too highly of ourselves\", and \"leaning not on our own understanding\".\n\n Interesting second quote. If you don't like the interpretation of it saying that we shouldn't believe what we understand, clarify it.\n \nA lot of these religious leaders are being political - I don't think Pope John Paul II clearly said that he now doesn't believe that Adam was the first, fully formed man, or that now he's changed his mind about original sin. He's trying to keep the Catholic Church out of political battles that it can't financially afford.\n\n It used to be so powerful, too... How did it lose that power that allowed it to force Galileo to repent? Or could it be that Darwin had too much evidence for the church to interfere in any way? It's true- look it up.\n \nFear and anger are alive and well in atheism, too.\n\n Directed at creationists? Not the fear bit.\n \n\"Distractions in our culture\" - the end draws nearer, the Bible predicts it.\n\n Oh, and I thought that you wanted to convince people that the bible is accurate. Now you talk of the end of the world? It doesn't sound scientific in the least (unless armegeddon has been updated).\n \nI agree, we are all humans, and equal in almost every way.\n\n Yep. As predicted by the ToE. Does the bible predict that, too?\n \nThey are shaped largely by the society those people live in. Morality is deteriorating in the U.S. overall, and it is deteriorating among Christians.\n\n Again, equal. Should we believe in god because you say that morals are getting worse?\n \nLike much of Darwinism, yes - it's based on faith.\n\n \"Darwinism\" is a misleading (and, I suppose, simpler) term for the belief that the theory of evolution is accurate. It attempts to trick people into believing that the ToE has no actual scientific evidence. Of course, the only \"faith\" involved in science is faith in facts. This is the scientific definition of facts, by the way.\n \nThat's been done, when the word \"selection\" is compared to the word \"random\", atheists get very angry. Education complete!\n\n This is also an inaccurate comparison. Do not attempt to claim that natural selection is random. You will fail.\n Another course in natural selection: Some organisms are better adapted to surviving in an environment. Natural selection selects for these organisms. It is not a random lottery; it is a process based on characteristics of an organism.\n \nNot when we have the word \"random\" in our vocabulary. Why not use the word that actually fits? \"Selection\" involves an intelligent selector. Random does not.\n\n Selection does not require intelligence. Another example involving a wooden floor with planks missing: this system selects for large items which are too big to fit through the gaps. While small ones fall through, large ones never do.\n Now: where is the intelligent selector?\n \nYes yes, I've seen it all before. Natural processes, guided by God, can be twisted into evidence that no God is needed. Darwin needed nature to do some impressive things, and an unimpressive word like \"random\" wasn't cutting it.\n\n In the previous example, is a god necessary to keep large objects above the floor?\n \nYet all the different kinds of animals, including man, evolved over the same time period to end up here all at the same time? The starting times were the same, or the starting times were different with different evolving times, all dropping us here at exactly the same time?\n\n A very common misinterpretation. There is nothing at all that is special about now. Life is continuing to evolve, and the current forms of animals, plants, and other organisms will continue to change.\n \nThat was my point. Piltdown man was a forgery long before there was anywhere near the political money involved to encourage science to forge things, like there is today. You're absolutely sure there are no forgeries today? You have as much faith in science as I do in the Bible.\n\n This has been pointed out before, and it will be pointed out again: if the scientific community were only interested in being right, it would not have exposed the hoax.\n \nHere's one from the Democrats!! emoticon_xdonno :) \n \n \n \n http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=110&subid=136&contentid=1205\n\n I read a few paragraphs, and it quoted a few visits to schools and one study on fourth graders. Could you find an actual study with more tests and actual facts that apply to the country?\n Actually, if you think that that is the standard set by science, it is understandable for you to think of evolution as unproven and even untested.\n \nAnd this one;\n \n \n \n http://www.schoolandstate.org/parentrights.htm\n\n Propaganda.

   "Methodological naturalism is capable of existing with or without atheism.\n\n Right, and it's the basis of science. So you're saying that science is not atheistic. But for months, you've been saying that science is atheistic because it is based on methodological naturalism. Now, do you need to be taken to the hospital for that gunshot wound in your foot, or can you deal with it yourself?\n \n \nIf it's working with material, harnessing electricity, inventing microchips etc, then it's not atheist, if it's doing things like staring into outer space and coming to predetermined conclusions, or analyzing the fossil record, making it comply with a predetermined conclusion, then it can very well be atheistic.\n\n The good news is that there aren't predetermined conclusions. Did Darwin have a predetermined conclusion? No. Did Kepler have a predetermined conclusion? No. Have you forgotten that Big Bang cosmology replaced steady-state cosmology? If cosmologists stuck to predetermined conclusions, we'd still use steady-state cosmology.\n So, did this one hit the same foot, or will you need a wheelchair now?\n \n \nIt's a difference in worldviews. Some have a hard time believing that intelligent things can happen with no intelligence present.\n\n I'd guess that said people haven't found a claimed instance of this using a reasonable definition of \"intelligence.\"\n \n \nThat's the atheist worldview, yes.\n\n Hey, you're the one who claims to be reading Miller's book. Are you still saying that Miller is an atheist?\n In other words: no, it's not. You just want it to be.\n \n \nIf a system evolves into something that is irreducibly complex, it was dysfunctional until it was complete. If it was dysfunctional for enough time to evolve, it was dysfunctional for enough time to deteriorate millions of times over. \n\n Wait, I thought you said you were reading Miller's book? Evidently you haven't read the parts where he deals with this misconception. Do you need to see McDonald's mousetrap illustration again?\n \n \nI'm sure atheism has danced it's way out of that, but I'm no more interested in hearing it than you are about what the Bible actually says.\n\n Not atheism, but biology. You should review the first half of Miller's book, apparently. Oh, but you've already decided to ignore it. Willful ignorance...\n \n \nIt was implied in post #43, by another poster. Perhaps you'd like to take it up with him?\n\n No, it wasn't. Not technically proving a thing is not the same as suggesting the opposite. I'd think you'd like this fact, considering you can't prove that God exists, but spreading the word that He doesn't exist would be blasphemous in your views. Or maybe this is more special pleading? Or just gross ignorance of logic and science? Seriously, take your pick.\n \n \nParts of Darwinism have been indisputably disproven. (Complexities of the simplest forms of life, for example)\n\n How does complexity disprove Darwinism? More importantly, though, how does complexity (or anything else) disprove major parts of modern evolutionary theory?\n \n \nBut some people have decided Darwinism is true because they want it to be. Ring a bell?\n\n Sure, marc; they're the people who are too stupid to realize that the Modern Synthesis better explains our observations. Go ahead, find me five modern scientists who adhere to 19th century \"Darwinism\" and reject neoDarwinistic explanations. (Or, you know, I could point out that Gould made his splash by (claiming to) contradicting Darwin, and now punk-eek is mainstream.)\n \n \nMy point was that it's hard to tell the difference in who is posting, you all post exactly alike.\n\n Well that's not true, marc, by your own admission. You regard me with a special level of disdain. Remember? I was flattered you put me first on your list.\n \n \nNot true with me, and the other creationists here.\n\n Right you are: I laugh extra hard at your responses, and have even more fun writing another myself.\n \n \nWe all have different styles - make different points, without falling all over each other saying exactly the same thing.\n\n Of course they don't say the same things you do; hardly anyone believes precisely the rubbish you continually parrot.\n \n \nMakes one wonder about the application of the term \"freethought\", doesn't it?\n\n Oh, good, we've gotten to our token potshot at freethought. Of course, one wonders how marc can think that people who hold the same opinions can't be freethinkers, but since when have marc's beliefs had anything to do with reality? \n \n \nThat's because you're trying to change the subject, it is a fallacy ya know.\n\n You talked about inconsistencies, and how you think inconsistencies are only misunderstandings. I asked about two examples of inconsistency in an invitation for you to clarify any misunderstandings. How is that changing the subject?\n \n \nAt least I'm not preoccupied with \"asses\".\n\n Hmm...\n 1. At least I'm not \"riding\" them.\n 2. At least I don't like them so much that I need two at once.\n 3. Read the Bible. It talks about asses way more than I do.\n \n \nBut really it is, since one of your helpers said so;\n\n You're not familiar with the history of science? Imagine my shock. Here's the short version: As soon as people started trying to understand the universe as the universe instead of as the playing grounds for deities, science made great leaps and bounds. Do you think this is a bad thing? (Have you ever taken medicine instead of only praying to be healed? Have you ever used a vehicle instead of praying for miracle transportation?)\n \n \nThe way objects do or do not fall through your floor is a \"random event\".\n\n No, it's quite clearly not: Objects larger than the gaps in the direction of the gaps will not fall through; objects smaller will.\n \n \nNow why would I say that - maybe when you make statements like this above? LOL\n\n Disproof is not the same as proof. You should know.\n \n \nNow you are claiming that mathematics disproves something. Show me the mathematical proofs (i.e. disproofs) for you claim, marc. Go right ahead.\n\n It's called \"impossible odds\", largely testable, repeatable, and observable. (ever bought a powerball ticket? - I never bother to, myself)\n\n Telling me that there are \"impossible odds\" is not a proof. More importantly, your own example belies your assertion: Because it is so improbable than a chosen person can win the lottery, nobody can win the lottery. But people have won the lottery.\n It appears you're out of unwounded feet.\n \n \nThe Christian worldview interprets the fossil record differently.\n\n Kenneth Miller interprets the fossil record differently?\n But of course, the existence of an interpretation is not what matters; the credibility of that interpretation is what matters. YEC interpretations are incredible, to say the least.\n \n \nIt doesn't have billions in taxpayer money to influence it.\n\n Oh, good, we got our little barb at the BSCS too. Glad to get that out of the way, too, as if the billions upon billions donated to tax-free churchers is insignificant.\n \n \nIf I was agitated, I would respond to all your posts.\n\n I'll keep this simple: I don't believe you. I suspect you're breaking a commandment with this statement. But I guess it gives you an excuse (however lame) to ignore those really painful points I make.\n \n \nOh, I believe you'll keep bringing it up. It's a symptom of \"sputtering with rage\", an Ann Coulter term.\n\n With rage?! Surely you're kidding; how could I possibly be upset that you've given me such ammo?\n \n \nBy the way, I've finished Kenneth Miller's book.\n\n It doesn't show. Maybe you should try again.\n \n \nI should be able to start a new thread on it in the next couple of days.\n\n Good, I'll be ready to point you to the parts you've conveniently ignored.\n \n \nShould I wait a little longer, to give you a cooling off period?\n\n What's wrong, you don't like the roasting?\n You do whatever you want, marc. I'm ready for entertainment anytime.\n \n \nThat's been done, when the word \"selection\" is compared to the word \"random\", atheists get very angry.\n\n If you had to explain a few thousand times that Jesus wasn't a homosexual, but people kept insisting that he was anyway, wouldn't you be aggravated at their persistent ignorance?\n \n \n\"Selection\" involves an intelligent selector.\n\n How long are you going to keep lying about this? Be sure to see above where I explained why your objection is lacking.\n \n \nDarwin needed nature to do some impressive things\n\n Why did he need that? He was a theist when he started compiling information.\n \n \nYet all the different kinds of animals, including man, evolved over the same time period to end up here all at the same time?\n\n Yes. Does this seem unbelievable to you?\n \n \nThe starting times were the same, or the starting times were different with different evolving times, all dropping us here at exactly the same time?\n\n Different lineages started at different times and evolved at different \"rates,\" although there was likely a single common ancestor.\n \n \nPiltdown man was a forgery ...\n\n ... that was exposed by scientists, not creationists.\n \n \n... long before there was anywhere near the political money involved to encourage science to forge things, like there is today.\n\n Are you kidding? Do you know how much more money there would be in exposing a forgery than there would be in discovering a new fossil? Fossils are discovered all the time. Exposing forgeries would be huge news.\n Do you have evidence than any specimens are forgeries, marc? You should come forward with it, if you do; you could be rich. What's that? You don't want to be rich? You'd rather just make your assertions without evidence? Oh, that's right: you would rather just make your assertions without evidence...",

   "Like much of Darwinism, yes - it's based on faith.\nWhat a stunning display of willful ignorance! It would be faith if evolutionary theory were based on the mythology of nomadic herdsmen.\n \nperhaps it would be a good idea for creationists to educate themselves about evolutionary theory so that they might understand evolutionary terms.\nThat's been done, when the word \"selection\" is compared to the word \"random\", atheists get very angry. Education complete!\nThe clumsy punctuation makes that very hard to understand. The first part, patently not true in your case, has no relevance to the last. Moreover, it doesn't make sense? Why would comparison of a non-random process to a random process make anyone angry?\n \nNot when we have the word \"random\" in our vocabulary. Why not use the word that actually fits? \"Selection\" involves an intelligent selector. Random does not.\nWhy not educate yourself before you speak. It would be a simple matter to find out what Darwin meant when he used the word \"selection.\" It's quite clear in his book and the subsequent evolutionary literature.\n \nYes yes, I've seen it all before. Natural processes, guided by God, can be twisted into evidence that no God is needed. Darwin needed nature to do some impressive things, and an unimpressive word like \"random\" wasn't cutting it.\nEvidence of natural processes guided by your mythological god, please. Darwin observed that adaptation to the environment was what happened in nature and needed a term for his theory that explained it. Since it was certainly not random, he used natural selection.\n \nYet all the different kinds of animals, including man, evolved over the same time period to end up here all at the same time? The starting times were the same, or the starting times were different with different evolving times, all dropping us here at exactly the same time?\nSo you think that elephants, for example, exist in a different time warp even though we can see them here today? Your statement is pure scatterbrained hogwash. You just continue to cling to the mythology of nomadic herdsmen as real.\n \nThat was my point. Piltdown man was a forgery long before there was anywhere near the political money involved to encourage science to forge things, like there is today. You're absolutely sure there are no forgeries today? You have as much faith in science as I do in the Bible.\nThat was your point? Since Piltdown isn't used as evidence for evolution, how can that have been your point? I didn't claim that there are no forgeries. But there are no forgeries in major museums of major fossils. Perhaps an 8th grader somewhere has faked one for some creationist friends, but there isn't any need to forge fossils for scientific reasons. The forgeries today are usually done for money, and like Archaeoraptor, they usually don't make it to publication. Since you seem so sure, please tell me about all of these forgeries. To make such a claim without evidence would be a subtle indication that one isn't confident in his own position. And don't bother mentioning debunked frauds or errors (Piltdown man, Nebraska man, Archaeoraptor). One sad thing about Archaeoraptor is that it was made from two previously unknown species - one a toothed bird, the other a feathered theropod.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "It challanges them, from a human perspective. It's possible to be intelligent, and question those human challanges. The Bible says something about \"thinking too highly of ourselves\", and \"leaning not on our own understanding\". \n\n I think that this represents a major difference between secular and religious thinking. In secular thinking, it is our human capabilities of reason and analysis in which we put our trust. That has been and continues to be the path to our discoveries about the world. In religious thinking, there is the assumption of an authority that knows best - the authority of one's own established religion. I am a waivering Christian myself - wavering between agnosticism and some version of Christianity. I need evidence or, at least, logical reasons and analysis to be able to trust in a particular claimed truth or, in the moral sphere, in a particular moral code. I do not automatically put trust in the religion I grew up with (Catholicism) or in any religion since the only source of information which I have ever received is from men (who are very clearly falible), not from God. So, unless the unthinkeable happens and God actually does come down to pass on a message directly, my choice is between trusting the claims of mere men of religion vs. trusting a method of logical analysis and reasoned arguement (in which Science is a large part of that method). Given that choice, I trust the later.\n \nA lot of these religious leaders are being political - I don't think Pope John Paul II clearly said that he now doesn't believe that Adam was the first, fully formed man, or that now he's changed his mind about original sin. He's trying to keep the Catholic Church out of political battles that it can't financially afford.\n\n Looking through the Pope's address in which he outlined his views on Evolution - http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm - it seemed to be an honest attempt at trying to reconcile the spiritual vs scientific views - an attempt which I can respect. Why do you think that the Catholic church would lose out substancially financially if it continued to oppose Evolution?\n \nFear and anger are alive and well in atheism, too. \n\n I agree. That comment was made about people in general - not just about those who are religious.\n \nThey are shaped largely by the society those people live in. Morality is deteriorating in the U.S. overall, and it is deteriorating among Christians.\n\n Which specific aspects of morality do you claim have deteriorated in the last century or so? If you are referring to sexual morality, then I would simply say that a lot of sexual indiscretions are simply much more open than they used to be, and more evenly distributed between the sexes. Prostitution was very alive and well in the 19th century and mistresses were commonplace. There seemed to be a double standard that expected women to behave morally but was very forgiving for men's immorality. In what way do you think men are behaving more immorally now than in the past?",

   "Oh, yes. An argument often used against creation. The catch is, Darwin's theory overcame a widespread belief in god and is now the most accepted view on how life came to this point. Why didn't people who were reluctant to accept it notice that it came to \"predetermined conclusions\"? \n\n \n People were reluctant to accept a new, not-yet-popular belief. It's snowballed, like many things in society. As far as predetermined conclusions go, new atheist converts today are too exhilarated to care. From Kenneth Miller's book, quoting a student of Stephen Jay Gould;\n \n \nTo conclude, as Gould does, that man is \"a wildly improbable event,\" \"a detail, not a purpose,\" and \"a cosmic accident\" is disconcerting to some, but not to Gould. To him, release from any purpose is \"exhilarating\" as it also releases any responsibility to any other, offering us maximum freedom to thrive, or to fail, in our chosen way. If ever evolutionary theory has been elaborated to the point of complete incompatibility with a Christian worldview, it is by the pen of Stepen Jay Gould in this, his most recent tome. \n\n \n The Bible states that the path to destruction is wide. Belief that no God is necessary comes easily. \n \n \n \nThat's an argument from personal incredulity (logical fallacy). \n\n \n Some people have a hard time believing God exists. That \"logical fallacy\" goes both ways exactly the same. \n \n \n \nWell, you will hear it. Talk.Origins has some pretty good refutations of irreducible complexity. \n\n \n It sure does! It says this, about a mousetrap;\n \n \nBEHE) Suppose you challenge me to show that a standard mousetrap is not irreducibly complex. You hand me all of the parts listed above. I am to set up a functional mousetrap which at least mostly resembles the standard one, except I hand you back one piece. Can it be done? \n \n T.O. Yep. The wooden base can be discarded. Where do you put a mousetrap? On the floor. What if I assemble the mousetrap by pounding the staples into the floor? Would I have a fully functional mousetrap? \n\n \n The floor? Since when are floors presupposed? They substituted a magic floor, and made it the base, then claimed a base wasn't needed!!!! This is a crystal clear example of how evolutionists hit the panic button, and desperately try to belittle legitimate questioning of their beloved theory. And so many people, in their atheist exhilaration, fall for it. Are all \"scientific refutations\" that good? \n \n \n \nThat would be me. What I am saying (and shooterandproud doesn't have to agree) is that we believe that the earth exists, but there could be a force field holding everything away from a central point. This could be covered by a hologram and set up to be indistinguishable from a planet. However, that is no reason to believe that the earth doesn't exist (see occam's razor). \n\n \n Shooterandproud may not have to agree, but what about electrolyte - he's the one that question was directed to. Why are you answering for him? I have a hard time sorting out all my many opponents, and I'm almost out of time tonight. (that's the idea, isn't it?) Is answering for another poster a \"fallacy\"?\n \n \nAnother topic that has been \"indisputably disproven\" (to quote another poster) by talk.origins.\n\n \n Atheism would be lost without talkorigins, wouldn't it? I find it as useless as you do answersingenesis. That's why I seldom bother linking answersingenesis. I try to use my own words. \n \n \nFree thought (and free will) are all very nice, and it is interesting that you attempt to get me into an argument with shooterandproud and then claim that we all say the same things. \n\n \n See how the multiple answering works? Electrolyte asks a question, I respond to it, you attempt to answer my response, then accuse me of trying to get you into an argument with shooterandproud. Now I'm confused. \n \n \nHowever, because we say the same things, it might be a valid conclusion to say that evolution is self-consistant. Unlike the bible, which has a warlike god and a peaceful god in one. \n\n \n You'd be shocked at how consistant the Bible is, if you'd check it out. So would Kenneth Miller. \n \n \nPlease find it on Wikipedia's list of fallacies. In the meantime, just try to keep the debate on track. \n\n \n Who authorized Wikipedia as the only source of fallacies? \n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#digression\n \n Keep the debate on track? It would be simpler if you wouldn't answer questions directed at others, if others wouldn't answer questions directed at you, if you wouldn't run to the fallacy list and talkorigins every time you're stumped, etc. \n \n \n \nActually, as I have stated before, evolution is self-consistant, and \"random event\" does not describe the process detailed above. If you think it does, say so (it won't help your case, but you are free to say so anyway). \n\n \n No time for word definition lessons tonight. \n \n \nMaybe you shouldn't say it. Science doesn't prove anything it wants- it points to the logical conclusions of the evidence. By the way, the bible contains few logical conclusions about earth's history. \n\n \n All I did was show how he says science doesn't prove anything, then showed how he says science does prove something. A complete 180 in only a few paragraphs. \n \n \nNo rebuttal?\n Oh, wait, that's right, there's no rebuttal. \n\n \n The rebuttal was his 180, that I showed in black and white. Read it again. \n \n \nImpossible odds of what? Evolution producing what we have today? \n\n \n Yes. Many new discoveries make the odds even more improbable. \n \n \nAppeal to tradition. By the way, if Christianity is right, how did \"evolutionism\" get billions of taxpayer dollars?\n Isn't the US in control of taxpayer dollars, and isn't the president religious? \n\n \n The courts are in control of many taxpayer dollars. The ACLU helps shape laws that involve funding of legal proceedings. \n \n \nOk, but if you aren't agitated, why do you keep arguing about evolution? Won't it just go away if ignored? \n\n \n No, it will become established in U.S. government if ignored. I'm agitated that so many Christians are sleeping. Atheism does a good job of lulling them to sleep.\n \n \nAlso, I personally respond to supersport's posts because they present such a big target (and it is fun to keep knocking him down from his self-important perch). \n\n \n I, (and I'm sure supersport too) enjoy watching atheists swarm around our posts in a panic too. I can't get to it all tonight - if five more angry posts appear through the night, I'll probably have to let it go, but I don't mind. \n \n \nI should start counting how many logical fallacies are used... This one is because you correlate one \"symptom\" with \"sputtering with rage.\" \n\n \n Sputtering with rage is actually a combination of three - \"needling\", \"emotive language\" and \"ad hominem\". When multiple posters sputter with rage, it really multiplies, doesn't it?\n \n \nHe could just want everyone to know that you don't always follow through. \n\n \n Or hide the fact that his entire opening post was riddled with fallacies, which he exempts himself from. Or hide the fact that theistic evolutionists quickly vacate a discussion with me. \n \n \nDoes it make a difference where I'm from? If I told you that I lived in a \"foriegn\" country (I don't), would that change your opinion of me? \n\n \n Not at all, but I would suspect that you didn't have as much interest in U.S. politics as a U.S. poster, and would avoid referring to them as much. Here is a post of mine to a non U.S. resident, back in June;\n \n \nMy passion is U.S. politics, but I do appreciate views from those of you across the pond. You have a somewhat more neutral view of the U.S. than the U.S. citizens here, and I'll try to adjust my tone when addressing your knowledge of our politics. \n\n \n \n \nWell, it does contradict the 6000 year old universe hypothesis, but it can't be classified under \"evolution.\" \n\n \n Why not? Isn't it considered a starting point for evolution? \n \n \nThat is a difference from the philosophy of the old testament. I don't want to insult any Jewish people; I just want to point out a major inconsistency in the bible.\n\n \n Again, if you'd check it out, you'd find out differently. You'd find some real harmony in the New Testament, and many of the Psalms, for one example. Not just in suggestions for living, or the characteristics of God, but in historical events. Psalm 22, and Isaiah 53 come to mind.",

Isn't it considered a starting point for evolution? \n\n More like science's main explanation for the origin of the universe. However, having nothing to do with life or natural selection, it is not very related to evolution.\n \nAgain, if you'd check it out, you'd find out differently. You'd find some real harmony in the New Testament, and many of the Psalms, for one example. Not just in suggestions for living, or the characteristics of God, but in historical events. Psalm 22, and Isaiah 53 come to mind.\n\n So is the Old Testament effectively gone? I noticed some differences between the two...\n As for historical events, it is not entirely accurate, according to science.",

   "People were reluctant to accept a new, not-yet-popular belief. It's snowballed, like many things in society. As far as predetermined conclusions go, new atheist converts today are too exhilarated to care. From Kenneth Miller's book, quoting a student of Stephen Jay Gould .... The Bible states that the path to destruction is wide. Belief that no God is necessary comes easily.\n\n Okay, so there are words here, but what they have to do with Hi_Its_Me's response is a mystery. In fact, they totally ignore Hi_Its_Me's point.\n \n \nSome people have a hard time believing God exists. That \"logical fallacy\" goes both ways exactly the same.\n\n Yes, that indeed would be a logical fallacy, but the \"hard time believing\" bit is not the basis for disbelief. There are plenty of non-fallacious reasons for not positively believing in a deity.\n \n \nThe floor? Since when are floors presupposed?\n\n Jeez, this is worse than willful ignorance: We already covered this precise topic. marc thinks that the surface of the earth either doesn't exist or is unuseable.\n More importantly, though, he's still ignoring the fact that even if a given system is \"irreducibly complex,\" its evolution cannot be concluded to be impossible with this information alone. Here's McDonald's updated scenario for the conceptual evolution of the mousetrap.\n \n \nAre all \"scientific refutations\" that good?\n\n Can you come up with logical objections to McDonald's updated scenario linked above?\n \n \nShooterandproud may not have to agree, but what about electrolyte - he's the one that question was directed to.\n\n I answered it already. You ignored my answer. Imagine my shock.\n \n \nIs answering for another poster a \"fallacy\"?\n\n I've already answered this question, too: It's not.\n \n \nAtheism would be lost without talkorigins, wouldn't it?\n\n Lost? So there were no atheists before the talkorigins archive was launched? Go ahead, marc, keep making these breathtakingly stupid assertions.\n \n \nIt would be simpler if you wouldn't answer questions directed at others, if others wouldn't answer questions directed at you, if you wouldn't run to the fallacy list and talkorigins every time you're stumped, etc.\n\n Ironically, none of these are digression. Laughably, none of us are stumped. Incredibly, you think you're right.\n \n \nNo time for word definition lessons tonight.\n\n Evidently, marc opts out of important lessons quite often.\n \n \nAll I did was show how he says science doesn't prove anything, then showed how he says science does prove something. A complete 180 in only a few paragraphs.\n\n No you didn't. You showed where I said that science never proves but science can disprove. If you were so sure about this claim of yours, why did you not respond directly to me about it?\n \n \nYes. Many new discoveries make the odds even more improbable.\n\n Yawn. Argument from probability. Impossibility does not follow from improbability.\n \n \nI, (and I'm sure supersport too) enjoy watching atheists swarm around our posts in a panic too.\n\n \"In a panic\"? You're the one who can't come up with replies to my responses. Do you really think I'd be having so much fun if I were in a panic?\n \n \nif five more angry posts appear through the night, I'll probably have to let it go, but I don't mind.\n\n marc has no problem bailing, but we are the ones panicking. Riiight...\n \n \nSputtering with rage is actually a combination of three - \"needling\", \"emotive language\" and \"ad hominem\". When multiple posters sputter with rage, it really multiplies, doesn't it?\n\n Oh, \"sputtering with rage\" now, we are. So when I say that two plus two is four, that I'm really upset, and that mixing the colors yellow and blue make green, we can conclude that two plus two is not four and that mixing yellow and blue does not make green, because I'm angry.\n Jeez marc, you can't even get the fallacies right. I guess that explains why you use so many.\n \n \nOr hide the fact that his entire opening post was riddled with fallacies, which he exempts himself from.\n\n Funny that this statement of yours comes immediately after I explain how your understanding of fallacies is, shall we say, severely insufficient. As I have said repeatedly, I invite anyone to view the thread and judge for themselves. And I'll once again point out that, just for you, I boiled everything down to a single question, and you ran.\n \n \nOr hide the fact that theistic evolutionists quickly vacate a discussion with me.\n\n Who could blame them? It takes a very special kind of patience to enjoy your willful ignorance. Maybe you could find out if Kenneth Miller is doing any talks near you?\n \n \nWhy not? Isn't it considered a starting point for evolution?\n\n No. Evolution by the current definition started as soon as life existed.\n The Big Bang could have been \"a starting point\" for any natural process. By your logic, that would make the Big Bang part of germ theory of disease, or of electromagnetic wave propagation, or your existence. If the Big Bang didn't happen, does that mean you don't exist? Obviously, your logic is... no, not full of holes, I'm going to go with completely nonexistent.\n \n \nYou seem to only come out of the woodwork when Collin or electrolyte need help.\n\n \"Need help\"... That's a good one. Got any more?\n \n \nThis was your first post since August.\n\n So you don't have time for definitions, but you have time to make long responses to Hi_Its_Me and search T.Q's posting history?\n \n Keep 'em coming, marc!",

But I doubt they're annual budget has risen from $14 million to a number that rivals that of the Catholic Church (which is in the billions).\n \n According to this site: http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-12-10-aclu-usat_x.htm\n \n the ACLU membership is up to about 330, 000 (2002).

The student was Kurt Wise, who was a young earth creationist when he entered college, and therefore long before he ever began his PhD studies at Harvard (where Gould was his advisor).

   "Why didn't people who were reluctant to accept it notice that it came to \"predetermined conclusions\"? \n\n \n You first used the phrase \"reluctant to accept it\" in post #62. Where is the evidence that anyone accepted it who were reluctant to accept it? Maybe everyone who accepted it weren't so reluctant, but instead were searching for exhilaration?\n \n \n \nAnswer the question. You said \"it's [sic] snowballed.\" That is no explanation for how the ToE (still incomplete), managed to overcome all that resistance. Wouldn't they have pointed out the \"predetermined conclusions\" and nipped it in the bud? \n\n \n Who's \"they\"? Christians in the U.S society in the late 1800's / early 1900's? How would they have nipped it in the bud, by forcefully establishing a religion? \n \n \n \n\"The bible states...\"\n If I don't accept the bible, how is your post supposed to convince me? \n\n \n The best way I can convince you to think about what the Bible says is by pointing out something it states, and then letting you see how - thousands of years later - it may be coming true. \n \n If I don't accept atheist scientific theories, how are atheist posts pointing to them supposed to convince me?\n \n \nLogic not based on an argument from personal incredulity is availible, too.\n For example, please explain how a benevolent, omnipotent god can exist in this universe.\n\n \n I can't explain it, anymore than atheism can explain how life spontaneously arose from nothing.\n \n \nIt was a perfectly good answer to the question. When asked to remove a piece, a piece was removed and the environment was assumed. Can you think of an organism that does not rely on its surroundings? Neither can I.\n\n \n Substituting simple environmental factors such as air, or the ground, can't make up for a complex part that it has to wait for millions of years to evolve, without natural laws of decay destroying the other necessary, but unused other parts. Earlier when I said something similar, electrolyte politely encouraged me :p to read Millers book again. So here's a relevant paragraph of Millers book;\n \n \nThe crux of the design theory is the idea that by themselves, the individual parts or structures of a complex organ are useless. The evolutionist says no, that's not true. Those individual parts can indeed be useful, and it's by working on those \"imperfect and simple\" structures that natural selection eventually produces complex organs. How does the argument end? Well, it hasn't completely ended (which is one of the reasons I have written this chapter!) but within the scientific community Darwin has won. \n\n (page 135-136 pandion, don't panic)\n \n HASN'T COMPLETELY ENDED? Are school children being taught that it hasn't completely ended? Would a reader here reading all these sophisticated evolutionist's posts dream that it hasn't completely ended? Miller had to write a whole chapter of dancing about it, and I don't have time to re-read it all tonight, but I don't remember him saying a word about what the second law of thermodynamics just might do to an \"imperfect and simple\" structure as it waits around defenseless for a few million years. \n \n \"Within the scientific community, Darwin has won.\" What a surprise, and they won government grants to study it further, too.\n \n \nYou are right. When I said shooterandproud, I meant electrolyte.\n \n The question directly involved me, and it was fairly clear that it was my post that needed an explanation. \n\n \n It is no big deal. emoticon_xangel \n \n \nActually, I was running out of time, too. Answering all posts in one day is really unnecessary, though. \n\n \n You ought to try it from my position. As you can see, I left 4 posts unanswered last night, saying that if 5 more appeared tonight it had a chance of doing me in because of time constraints. As you may notice, there were 6. I have time for this one, and maybe one more. That leaves 8 for tomorrow. emoticon_wow So you know I will do my best to do it, so electrolyte doesn't needle me about it right? :p \n \n Seriously, I do have a very full time job, and don't need to be tired while doing it. \n \n \nNo, as long as information and not opinion was requested, and opinion is fine if the other poster agrees (my opinion). \n\n \n You don't think it's remotely possible, in this setting, for a gang to try to destroy someone's time constraints? I'm not really crying, as I've said before, it's just another challange that I enjoy as an underdog. I will have to be on my toes when I try to keep up with my upcoming ~ Ken Miller's book thread ~ however. I'll be prepared. \n \n \n \n \nNot the way it has been translated. In the King James version, Noah enters the ark twice (7:7 and 7:13). I am not impressed by the self-consistancy yet. \n\n \n You're letting small details get in the way of more noteworthy things. I suspect you're not taking your own advise;\n \n \nIn the meantime, just try to keep the debate on track. \n\n \n \n \nOk, if you want, I can answer my own questions and correct any obvious mistakes you make (I can't and won't resist). Of course, this won't change much.\n As for linking, I can write my own rebuttals, but I will link to articles if a subject has been rebutted many times already. I suppose that this will make a change.\n However, when I link, I do so because the page I link to has a good point or evidence. Please answer those posts anyway.\n\n \n Tonight? emoticon_cry \n \n \nLink? Examples?I didn't think so...\n\n \n I think so, I've given them before, a few threads back. Let's see if I can remember it, it was a Dembski example, only I'm applying it differently, but it gets the point across. Darwin's understanding of the complexity of life could be compared to a 3 number safe, a left-right-left combination, 1-40. A 64,000 to 1 chance it could be randomly opened on the first try. The amazing complexity of life that we see today could be correspondingly compared to a 5 number safe, a left-right-left-right-left, combination. Only 2 more directions, and 1-100 number dial. Only 60 more numbers. Yet the odds of randomly opening it on the first try are no longer 1-64,000, they're now 1-10 billion. What's 10 billion right - evolutionists have no problem tossing around big numbers that they cannot comprehend.\n \n \nSo if the bible is right and the US is a democracy, why don't religious agendas get more attention? \n\n \n Slight, successive modifications, of corruption. The courts.\n \n \nDoes the government care how life got here? \n\n \n When it's deciding what it allows the medical profession to do, it needs to enter into the equation.\n \n \nWill arguing this make a difference?\n Do you think 4forums will get the attention of the government? \n\n \n It takes a lotta little stones to make a load of gravel. There are at least a few young people who read here and don't post, who are interested in what a few common people have to say. \n \n \nAlternatively, do you enjoy the debates?\n\n \n I've been in three formal ones here, what do you think? I didn't impress atheist judges in two of them, but I made my points and had a blast. I hope to do it again. The thread I'm about to start on Kenneth Miller very well could spark another one. The question is, who will make me the first to fall to three loses? \n \n \n \nPanic? More like laughing at supersport's posts (seriously, have you seen his latest?)\n\n \n \nIn the meantime, just try to keep the debate on track. \n\n \n \n \nGoogle, wikipedia, and answers.com failed to turn up a relevant definition of \"needling.\"\n I have seen some of the others, mostly one case of emotive language. Ad hominem is not really present, as most replies to your posts adequately adress the points made. \n\n \n \nNeedling: \n simply attempting to make the other person angry, without trying to address the argument at hand. Sometimes this is a delaying tactic. \n\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#needling\n \n Do you think electrolyte ever attempts to make me angry?

I guess you're going to have a lot of trouble convincing him, then...\n \n \nIf I don't accept atheist scientific theories, how are atheist posts pointing to them supposed to convince me?\n\n If you ignore us when we tell you that there are plenty of reasons outside of science to doubt the existence of God and that science is not atheistic, how can you expect not to be called ignorant?\n I know I don't expect to convince you; I just like making you look even more foolish.\n \n \nI can't explain it, anymore than atheism can explain how life spontaneously arose from nothing.\n\n You can't really explain much, especially when your beliefs are questioned, can you?\n Atheism doesn't explain abiogenesis, but science can (and does) do better.\n \n \nSubstituting simple environmental factors such as air, or the ground, can't make up for a complex part that it has to wait for millions of years to evolve, without natural laws of decay destroying the other necessary, but unused other parts.\n\n Yeah, you could go back to the discussion of the second law of thermodynamics that you ran away from like a scared little kid, or I could just remind you that assuming that the ground existed isn't much of an assumption at all. Instead, though, if you have a problem with implementing the ground, how would an irreducibly complex mousetrap catch a mouse without using the ground? (Hint: How does the mouse get to the trap? On what does the trap rest? I mean, damn, marc, you're making this hilariously easy. But I suspect you might ignore this anyway.) \n \n \n... HASN'T COMPLETELY ENDED?\n\n Right. Evolution continues now.\n \n \nAre school children being taught that it hasn't completely ended?\n\n You betcha. Heck, that's half of your soapbox. How are we supposed to tell when you're feigning ignorance and when you're not feigning at all?\n \n \nWould a reader here reading all these sophisticated evolutionist's posts dream that it hasn't completely ended?\n\n Do you have a point here, or are you just spouting off angry words again?\n \n \nMiller had to write a whole chapter of dancing about it, and I don't have time to re-read it all tonight,\n\n That's okay, because you won't understand it tonight either.\n \n \nbut I don't remember him saying a word about what the second law of thermodynamics just might do to an \"imperfect and simple\" structure as it waits around defenseless for a few million years.\n\n You don't remember what I told you about it either, so what does it matter?\n \n \nYou ought to try it from my position. As you can see, I left 4 posts unanswered last night, saying that if 5 more appeared tonight it had a chance of doing me in because of time constraints. As you may notice, there were 6. ...\n\n Perhaps if you didn't make posts that were so fun to respond to, you wouldn't have the problem. Maybe try not being full of horse manure? (But don't stop on my account.)\n \n \nI think so, I've given them before, a few threads back. Let's see if I can remember it, it was a Dembski example, only I'm applying it differently, but it gets the point across.\n\n Talk about ignorance. You completely ignored my response to that piece of rubbish when you posted it earlier.The probability of \"natural selection\" opening it would be one in 64,000.\n\n As I have explained before, evolution is not random, it is selective. A random example is not representative of natural selection.\n Furthermore, biological systems are not all of the \"only one of many possible arrangements will work\" variety, so not even the analogy is valid.\n \n \nRather than a 1 in 64,000 chance for evolution to work, it's now 1 in 10 billion.\n\n Same problems.\n \n \nThere is probably a greater difference in Darwin's knowledge and what we know today about cell complexity than there is in the two safe mechanisms - chances for evolution is probably even less than the difference between 64,000 and 10 billion.\n\n Non-sequitur, because our knowledge has nothing to do with whether evolution occurs. In fact, the probability that evolution occurs is not very small; the probability that evolution occurs is one, because it does.\n\n \nSlight, successive modifications, of corruption. The courts.\n\n The same evil, atheistic courts who put a fundie in the Oval Office?\n \n \nThe question is, who will make me the first to fall to three loses?\n\n I'd offer, but I don't think marc wants to \"put up\" with me.\n \n \nDo you think electrolyte ever attempts to make me angry? He usually fails.\n\n I can't fail at what I don't try. I'm just having fun, and if it happens to be at your expense, all the better.\n \n \nBut really, there is much disagreement over just what fallacies are, and who uses them.\n\n Some of us use standard philosophy and logic textbooks, and one of us uses a list from the internet.\n \n \nHe hides in the invisible mode, he practically lives here!\n\n I make my presence known by my posts, not my online status. It's interesting to know, however, that you've paid attention to said online status.\n \n \nYou think I don't have better things to do than amuse him?\n\n I can only wonder; you keep coming back.\n \n \nDo you ever notice differences in what two atheist scientists may say about the same subject? Do you have double standards?\n\n Do you ever notice the differences between what some scientists say regardless of religion (or lack thereof)? Why don't I just point at Miller and pick a \"scientist\" like Humphreys or Wells and say the same thing about Christians? Your point looks foolish either way.\n \n \nScience is diversifying into the subject of history - there's money in it.\n\n I'd like marc to provide me with basic financial information of the top 10 scientists-who-happen-to-be-atheists (just for marc's satisfaction) and the top 10 televangelists for comparison purposes. We'll all (except marc, of course) have a big laugh.",

   "I love that attack, that the money in science corrupts it. It's quite true, and quite telling how ignorant the user of the argument is. \n \n The money that corrupts science is largely in the food and drug industries. Mosarnt (sp?) paid off several FDA scientists to write off that its cow hormones, BMST I think it's called, (banned in canada and europe) were not harmful inspite of the mountains of data to the contrary.\n \n Marc would have a seriously hard time finding a scientist studying evolution who was paid to produce intended results. \n \n But willful ignorance is the best defense eh?\n \n If you're not a fundementalist, literal muslims, christian or jew, you're a atheist according to marc!",
