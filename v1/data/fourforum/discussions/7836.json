   "It's midnight in the White House. Usually in bed by 9.30., President Bush is working late on his plans to make the world a safer place for all humanity.\n \n Wearing antique spectacles, a starched collar, pin-stripe suit, and a top hat, an ethereal figure quietly appears in the Oval Office. It's the ghost of Woodrow Wilson.\n \n After exchanging puzzled greetings, the following curious dialogue takes place between the two presidents.\n \n Mr Bush: Welcome to my office. Please state your business and depart without alarming Laura who is due here any minute with my bedtime Ovaltine.\n \n Mr Wilson: I'm here to ask you what you think you're doing in Iraq.\n \n Mr Bush: I'm spreading democracy and bringing freedom and happiness to the poor huddled masses who inhabit that crazy country.\n \n Mr Wilson. Who authorised this impudent scheme? \n \n Mr Bush: Well, I guess Don Rumsfeld thought it was a good idea..............\n \n Mr Wilson: This is not a satisfactory answer. Please explain your idea of democracy.\n \n Mr Bush: Erm.......I know ! It's a form of popular government we Americans adopted way back. Everyone in the world wants it, and we aim to give it to them.\n \n Mr Wilson: Have you read what de Tocqueville has to say about democracy in America?\n \n Mr Bush: I guess not........... but I believe there was a guy who played for the Texas Rangers who..............\n (voice falters into silence)\n \n Mr Wilson: I am appalled by your frivolous levity. You need a few lessons on the theory of democracy. I shall return tomorrow night at the same hour with my History of the American People for the purpose of instructing you. Good Night, George W.\n \n Mr Bush: Good Night, Mr President. \n \n \n (To be continued.............)",

   "wow, this is really lame.\n \n What authority is Wilson anyway emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Well, Steve, it ain't Eugene O'Neill and that's for sure.\n \n I wanted to create an imaginary conversation between Bush and Wilson in which the nature of American democracy might be discussed. Has it mutated, as some would have us believe, into just a 'dictatorship of the majority'? Are the principles of the founding fathers more honoured in the breach than in the observance? Is it transferable, by force if necessary, all over the globe?\n \n I chose Woodrow Wilson not only because of his intellectual 'authority' but because he seems to be the antithesis of Bush. He lacked Bush's sense of humour for one thing. But he had a firm grasp of 'classical' political ideas and a historian's perspective. He is also relatively obscure and easy to caricature.\n \n Both Bush and Wilson fought wars to either 'save' or 'spread' democracy in the world outside America. The contrast in their justifications might be interesting.\n \n Maybe you should reserve judgment until the 'performance' is over. It might even pass muster, but I wouldn't count on it.",

   "We definately missed the part where Wilson preached segregation in government offices. Also he glossed over his April 1914 authorization of the occupation of Veracruz, Mexico, to avenge an insult to some American sailors and to pressure the Mexican dictator into resigning. Sort of two faced there eh Woody? Then of course there were his invasions of Haiti in 1914 and the Dominican Republic in 1915. Then of course there was the Espionage act of 1917 which he had amended in 1918 to become the Sedition Act. Under which good old Woody imprisoned quite a few chaps. Yea good old Woody could have schooled W. on how to abuse power.",

Woody was a racist in that he had segragation in government! Insult aside, trying reading the black part.",
