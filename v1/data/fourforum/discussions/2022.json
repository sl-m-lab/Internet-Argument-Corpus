   "Gay Rights Without Borders\n By JOANNE MARINER \n ---- \n Monday, Feb. 16, 2004\n \n Twenty-two years after the European Court of Human Rights overturned Northern Ireland's ban on gay sodomy, the U.S. Supreme Court finally caught up. Not only did the Court strike down a state law that criminalized consensual homosexual activity, it even acknowledged the European precedents that had reached the same outcome first.\n \n In what Justice Scalia, writing in dissent, condemned as \"dangerous dicta,\" the Supreme Court's 2003 opinion in Lawrence v. Texas made explicit reference to the rulings of courts outside the United States. Finding precedential support in a string of European cases, the Court noted that \"other nations, too, have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct.\"\n \n While correct in identifying the international trend, the Court, if anything, understated the extent of gay rights advances. As Yale Law School professor and human rights expert Harold Koh told a reporter for Legal Times, the European Court of Human Rights is \"eight cases beyond Lawrence\" in its gay rights jurisprudence. And it is not only Europe that is making legal progress in protecting gays and lesbians from societal discrimination. In a variety of international fora - from U.N. human rights bodies to South African courts - new ground is being broken on gay rights issues.\n \n A brief review of the most important of these rulings illustrates the broad scope of this international trend.\n \n Sex, the Military, Adoption, Marriage and Pensions: International/Foreign Decisions\n \n European Court of Human Rights, Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, 1981.\n \n In this groundbreaking case, the first major international ruling to protect the rights of lesbian and gays, the European Court found that a criminal prohibition on gay sexual activity - \"buggery\" and \"gross indecency\" under the terms of the law -- violated the right to privacy. The Court noted that \"members of the public who regard homosexuality as immoral may be shocked, offended or disturbed by the commission by others of private homosexual acts,\" but such moral outrage does not justify criminalizing consensual sexual behavior.\n \n European Court of Human Rights, Smith and Grady v. United Kingdom, 1999, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. United Kingdom, 1999\n \n In two separate cases, the European Court ruled that the United Kingdom's ban on gays in the military violated the right to privacy.\n \n Constitutional Court of South Africa, Du Toit v. Minister for Welfare and Population Development, 2002\n \n In a case involving two lesbians who wanted to adopt children jointly, the Constitutional Court struck down a law that allowed only married couples to do so. The Court found that the law discriminated on the grounds both of sexual orientation and of marital status. Criticizing the law's failure to recognize the \"value and worth\" of the parents' relationship to the children, it ordered that the statutes be amended to allow same-sex couples to adopt children on an equal basis with heterosexual couples.\n \n Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Canada), Barbeau v. British Columbia, 2003 \n Court of Appeal for Ontario (Canada), Halpern v. Attorney General of Canada, 2003.\n \n In two landmark cases, the highest courts of two Canadian provinces concluded that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the equality provisions of the national Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As a remedy for the violation, the courts ordered that gays and lesbians be given the right to marry. \n \n (The British Columbia court initially stayed its ruling for one year, to allow the federal and provincial legislatures to reformulate their definition of marriage. But two months later, when the Ontario court ordered marriage licenses immediately issued in that province, the British Columbia court reversed itself and ordered the ruling implemented immediately.) \n \n The rulings only apply in the two provinces. Yet the national government has indicated that it will not appeal the decisions to the country's Supreme Court, and instead will draft a law to legalize same-sex unions across Canada. It is still unclear whether this will fully legitimate equality in marriage, or offer a parallel but distinct status of \"civil unions\" for same-sex partners.\n \n U.N. Human Rights Committee, Young v. Australia, 2003 \n In its first decision affirming the partnership rights of same-sex couples, the Human Rights Committee ruled that Australia, in denying pension benefits to the surviving same-sex partner of a war veteran, violated anti-discrimination principles codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n \n U.S. Courts: Wise To Draw on Foreign and International Precedents\n \n Gays in the military, same-sex marriage, gay adoption -- regional, international and foreign tribunals have addressed all of these questions and more. While Justice Scalia may blindly reject \"foreign moods, fads, or fashions,\" less xenophobic jurists would be well advised to consider the logic and reasoning of these rulings when facing gay rights issues in their own courts.",

   "Now, the three largest provinces(Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec), together representing 71% of Canada's population, have legal marriage for same-sex partners...\n \n http://canadaeast.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040401/CPN/19004022\n French kisses, ovations abound at Quebec's first gay marriage\n \n Michael Hendricks, left, and Rene Leboeuf kiss after getting married in a Montreal courtroom on Thursday. (CP/Paul Chiasson) \n \n BRIAN DALY\n \n MONTREAL (CP) - Longtime same-sex partners Michael Hendricks and Rene Leboeuf sealed Quebec's first gay marriage Thursday with a long French kiss.\n \n The tuxedo-clad couple exchanged wedding vows, rings and several passionate kisses at the courthouse ceremony as gay activists, friends and a throng of journalists looked on. The marriage consummated a 31-year relationship and ended a nearly six-year battle by the couple for the right to tie the knot like heterosexual couples.\n \n \"It's marvellous,\" Hendricks said after the ceremony, which was presided over by a deputy clerk of the Quebec Superior Court.\n \n \"We just had our big moment. Everything changes. We're now recognized as a couple - socially and even to ourselves.\n \n \"It's a commitment that's unbreakable.\"\n \n Hendricks, 62, and Leboeuf, 48, were married exactly three years to the day the first same-sex couples were wed in the Netherlands.\n \n The couple, who have been together for 31 years, realized their dream of marriage after the Quebec Court of Appeal paved the way for gay marriages in the province with a ruling that dismissed an appeal of a lower-court ruling by religious groups.\n \n The lower court had ruled that the traditional definition of marriage is discriminatory and unjustified.\n \n The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, one of the religious groups that launched the appeal, said Thursday they would seek intervener status when the Supreme Court looks at the constitutionality of gay marriage later this year.\n \n \"We, of course, remain disappointed that the Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed our appeal,\" said Rev. Brian Wilkie, an official with the evangelical group.\n \n \"We continue to see support for the traditional definition of marriage, for its historical and cultural resonances.\"\n \n Wilkie added churches should have a say in the gay-marriage issue.\n \n \"We have an obligation and a responsibility to play our part in the civil discourse,\" said Wilkie, whose association represents nearly 40 evangelical Christian denominations across Canada.\n \n Same-sex marriages have already been declared legal in Ontario and British Columbia. Lawyers allied with Hendricks and Leboeuf said other provinces will be forced to fall in line.\n \n \"If the Court of Appeal renders a ruling and the federal government does not appeal this decision, it automatically applies everywhere in Canada,\" said Ann Robinson, a law professor and gay activist who attended the ceremony.\n \n \"The provinces have to provide homosexuals with access to marriages.\"\n \n Prime Minister Paul Martin has promised to introduce a bill to legalize gay marriage.\n \n Hendricks said he didn't expect same-sex partners to rush to Quebec courthouses to tie the knot, explaining that common-law status is popular among gay and straight couples in Quebec.\n \n \"Marriage is not the most popular thing in the world in Quebec, but we'll see as many (marriages) in our community as there are in the heterosexual community, for sure,\" he said.\n \n In Toronto, from June 19, 2003, until Feb. 13 of this year, there were 1,143 same-sex marriage licences issued by city hall. The total number of marriage licences issued by the city during that period was 12,046.",

I should stop going to school, because going there will not make me reproduce so therefore it is not natural. Isn't it funny how animals keep going against nature like that?

If everyone was gay, there would be no natural births, only births that use artificial insemination. The population of the world would go down, and there would be enough food for everyone. There would be less people, so it would be easier to avoid war, because there would be enough land, oil and food for everyone. There would be no accidents when it came to childbirth, because every birth would be planned, and more children in this world would be loved, because their parents knew that they wanted a child. Hate crimes would decrease, because one of the main groups of people hate crimes are done against is homosexuals. The UN wants this, and why not? It seems like a good idea to me. And hey, would you rather gain these things by a large number of people dying or by people loving each other? Me, I'd go with love.\n \n Now, I doubt the human population would really be cut down 20% by the acceptance of gays, after all, just because you are allowed to be gay doesn't mean you want to. Tell me, why would a population decrease that doesn't involve killing anybody or taking away anybody's rights be a bad thing?",

   "Gay Marriage Legal In Spain Next Month\n by Malcolm Thornberry\n 365Gay.com Newscenter\n European Bureau Chief\n Posted: September 19, 2004 4:03 pm ET \n \n (Madrid) The Spanish parliament will vote next month on a bill to legalize same-sex marriage making the country the third in Europe to allow gays and lesbians to marry. \n The proposed legislation will be approved by the cabinet of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on October 1 and then go to parliament.\n \n It is expected to win passage and be in place by the end of the year said Jose Blanco, a leading member of the Zapatero's Socialist party.\n \n \"The cabinet...is going to approve the change to the civil code so that people of the same sex can marry. Why are we doing this? Because people have to be in charge of their own destiny,\" Blanco told a rally on Sunday.\n \n Recent polls show that almost 70 percent of the population supports same-sex marriage. But, the measure is being fought by the Catholic Church.\n \n In June Zapatero was summoned to the Vatican for a severe tongue lashing from Pope John Paul. (story) The Papal denouncement of gay marriage came two weeks after the Prime Minister first announced his government would bring in the bill. (story) \n \n Both Holland and Belgium allow gay marriage. Seven other European Union countries give limited status to same-sex couples. A bill is currently before the British House of Commons to establish a domestic partner registry.\n \n The only area in the United States to permit gay marriage is Massachusetts. Four Canadian provinces and the Yukon territory also allow gays to marry. \n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2004",

   "Press Release\n September 16, 2004\n Court Extends Equal Marriage to Manitoba\n Historic Cooperation of Province and Feds Paves Way\n Winnipeg-Today Mr. Justice Douglas Yard of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench ordered that the definition of marriage in Manitoba include same-sex couples. Both the province of Manitoba and the federal government had consented as to the form of the order at a case conference held on Tuesday, and had agreed to an expedited hearing.\n \n One of the plaintiff couples is Chris Vogel and Rich North. They were the first couple in Canada to bring a legal challenge to the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage. They tied the knot on February 11, 1974 in the Unitarian Church. Without recourse to the Charter, a Manitoba court declared their marriage invalid. The other couples are Stefphany Cholakis and Michelle Ritchot, who will soon celebrate thirteen years together, and Laura Fouhse and Jordan Cantwell, who have been together for four years and are raising a six-year-old daughter.\n \n \"We are so happy that we, and all other Manitobans, can now celebrate marriage,\" said Stefphany Cholakis. \"Now we're off to the marriage commissioner's office!\" Stefy and Michelle are co-chairs of the Canadians for Equal Marriage chapter in Manitoba. They were married in the United Church five years ago, after publishing banns, and will now re-marry in order to make it legal.\n \n \"This sends a strong message that our love, our commitment and our family are seen as whole, valid and worthy of recognition,\" said Jordan Cantwell, who will be getting married to her partner Laura Fouhse this Saturday in their local United Church. \"Words cannot express how much this means to us as a family. Now our daughter will grow up knowing that her family is recognized and valued like those of her friends.\" Hope, their six-year-old daughter, said \"I'm pretty excited because I really want my moms to be able to get married.\"\n \n \"The judge found that it is unconstitutional to exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage and changed the definition of marriage to include them,\" said Patricia Lane of Winnipeg law firm Taylor McCaffrey, who represents the couples. \"He said that he found the legal precedents overwhelming and agreed with their conclusion.\"\n \n \"Because of the precedent set in Manitoba in 1974 when the Court refused to recognize the marriage of Chris and Rich, the Manitoba government believed it was necessary to obtain a court order,\" said Karen Busby, a law professor at the University of Manitoba and a member of Egale's Board of Directors. \"However, there is no reason for other provinces to refuse to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. In fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that they have a legal obligation to do so.\"\n \n \"While it would have been preferable for the government of Manitoba to simply have issued marriage licences, Egale applauds them for facilitating the court order,\" said Laurie Arron, Director of Advocacy of Egale. \"We're also pleased that the federal government supported a speedy resolution, a welcome change from their request for an adjournment in the Yukon.\"\n \n \"This bodes well for us in Nova Scotia,\" said Sean Foreman, counsel for three same-sex couples who filed an equal marriage challenge similar to the one in Manitoba. \"Here too, the federal and provincial governments are being very cooperative. We're hopeful that we'll have a court appearance very soon.\"\n \n \"79% of Canada's population now enjoys full marriage equality,\" said Gilles Marchildon, Executive Director of Egale Canada. \"Nova Scotia would bring us up to 82%. Canada is being strengthened by the inclusion of these loving, committed couples. I'm especially happy that Chris and Rich will finally be able to legally marry. They have fought so long and hard to see this day.\"\n \n \"We look forward to the day when all Canadians have the equal right to marry, when Parliament finally passes legislation to make that a reality,\" said Cicely McWilliam of Canadians for Equal Marriage. \"Until then, we call on all the remaining provinces to accept equal marriage and begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples.\"\n \n A survey released July 1 by the Centre for Research and Information on Canada and Environics found that the number of Canadians agreeing that gays and lesbians should be allowed to get married has increased. Currently, 57% agree, the highest level since CRIC first asked the question two years ago. The number disagreeing currently stands at 38%.

   "The winds of change continue to move across Canada, with now over 80% of Canada's population enjoying equality....\n \n Nova Scotia legalizes same-sex marriages\n Last Updated Fri, 24 Sep 2004 12:24:09 EDT \n HALIFAX - Same-sex marriages will be allowed in Nova Scotia following a ruling Friday morning that said banning them is unconstitutional. \n \n \n INDEPTH: Same-sex Rights\n \n Applause broke out in the Halifax courtroom as the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruling made the province the sixth jurisdiction in Canada to allow same-sex couples to marry. \n \n Earlier this month, a court in Manitoba made a similar ruling. Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec and the Yukon all allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. \n \n Nova Scotia is the first Atlantic province to allow the marriages. \n \n Justice Heather Robertson's ruling effectively changes the definition of marriage in Nova Scotia to \"the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.\" \n \n The couples who launched the court challenge are: \n \n Brian Mombourquette and Ross Boutilier. \n Kim Vance and Samantha Meehan, who were married in Toronto when Ontario legalized same-sex unions in 2003 and wanted to have their marriage recognized at home. \n Ron and Brian Garnett-Doucette, who want to marry after being together for nearly 20 years. \n After the ruling was delivered on Friday, the Garnett-Doucettes walked into a provincial office to file for a marriage licence. Confident the ruling would go in their favour, the couple had picked up wedding bands on Thursday. \n \n \"I can't express how excited I am,\" said Ron Garnett-Doucette, who's ready to plan his wedding. \n \n To his partner Brian, the ruling means more than \"just having what everyone else has and not having to fight for your rights all the time ... We are equal now.\" \n \n Neither the federal nor Nova Scotia government opposed the challenge. \n \n \"We certainly did not want to waste taxpayers' money,\" said Nova Scotia Justice Minister Michael Baker. \n \n The federal government tried to convince courts in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec in 2003 not to change the definition of marriage, which Ottawa has jurisdiction over. It failed in all three cases. \n \n In the Yukon case heard in July, the government didn't oppose the constitutional challenge, but asked for the challenge to be adjourned pending a Supreme Court of Canada review of draft legislation that would change the definition of marriage. \n \n The court rejected that request, and ordered the federal and territorial governments to pay the plaintiffs' legal costs. \n \n Nova Scotia has given gay and lesbian couples some marital rights since 2001 through a domestic partnership registry. \n \n Premier John Hamm said on Thursday he would abide by the court's decision, but wouldn't say whether he supports same-sex marriages. \n \n In New Brunswick, meanwhile, Attorney General Brad Green says his province won't recognize any marriage other than those between a man and a woman until the federal law is changed. \n \n Written by CBC News Online staff\n \n Copyright \u00a92004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - All Rights Reserved\n http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/09/24/samesex_ns040924.html",

   "It is unatural. Can gays have children with each other? I already know the answer. Gay marriage is the ultimate thing that will bring this world under. If everyone was gay there would be no kids reproduced. The population of world would go down. \n \n This would go with what the UN wants. THe UN wants the world's population to be cut down to about 20% of what it is now today. I guess the UN accepts gays becasue they are doing the \"dirty work\" of cutting the population.\n\n \n \n Pardon my ignorance here, but what exactly is the problem with the world population going down? Aren't there over SIX BILLION mouths which need feeding, brains which need educating, bodies which need clothing and lets not mention the TWELVE BILLION feet needing to be shod! \n \n Dang Pro your logic leaves a lot to be desired.\n \n Also, since it's \"Unnatural\" for two humans who are unable to reproduce to be allowed to LEGALLY wed, by your logic all Heterosexual couples who either CHOOSE to not have children or who are UNABLE to have children are also UNNATURAL. Guess their marraiges would be null and void in your eyes. \n HYPOCRIT!",

   "More great news from Spain....\n \n http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1150672004\n \n Gay marriages poised for a New Year go-ahead in Spain \n \n TONY JEFFERIES \n \n \n HOMOSEXUALS throughout Spain were last night celebrating a \"human rights victory\" after the government approved legislation allowing same-sex marriage. \n \n Thousands gathered in Madrid's Plaza Chueca to toast prime minister Jose Zapatero's initiative, which has enraged the Roman Catholic church. \n \n A church spokesman said earlier this week that the move was like \"imposing a virus on society\". \n \n But gay-rights activist Beatriz Gimeno claimed yesterday: \"This interventionist tendency by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated. This is a victory for basic human rights.\" \n \n The legislation met with near-unanimous approval from Mr Zapatero's cabinet and will now go before the Spanish parliament. Mr Zapatero's socialist party, PSOE, which swept to power in March, holds no overall majority but support from two minor parties means the bill is as good as cleared and the first marriages are expected to take place early next year. \n \n Mr Zapatero pledged a series of social reforms, including streamlined divorce and harsher penalties for domestic violence against women. But in a traditionally Catholic country, this legislation was always going to be contentious. \n \n Under the new legislation, homosexuals will also receive a dead partner's pension and inheritances, and will be able to divorce and adopt children. \n \n The Spanish justice minister Juan Lopez Aguilar told RNE state radio: \"Our constitution guarantees the right to marriage. \n \n \"We're going to extend that right to people who historically have been discriminated against - homosexuals.\"",

   "This isn't international news to me, as I am Canadian. Canada continues to extend marriage equality to gay and lesbian couples. The 7th jurisdiction(six provinces, and the Yukon territory), Saskatchewan, approved same-sex marriage this morning. This means that over 85% of the Canadian population now enjoys marriage equality.... \n \n Sask. court approves same-sex marriage\n Last Updated Fri, 05 Nov 2004 13:07:07 EST \n SASKATOON - A judge in Saskatoon has ruled that refusing to grant same-sex couples a marriage licence violates their charter rights under the Constitution. \n \n \n INDEPTH: Same-sex Rights\n \n \n \n Supporters of same-sex marriage outside the courthouse in Saskatoon. \n With Friday's ruling, Saskatchewan becomes the seventh jurisdiction in Canada to allow gays and lesbians to legally marry. \n \n In a five-page ruling, Justice Donna Wilson decided that the traditional definition of marriage discriminates against gay couples. \n \n \"The common-law definition of marriage for civil purposes is declared to be 'the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others,'' \" Wilson wrote. \n \n She made the decision after hearing from five gay and lesbian couples who were denied marriage licences in the province. \n \n Neither the provincial nor the federal government contested their application to have the definition changed. \n \n \"This really is about recognition. It's about legitimacy. And it's about being on an equal footing and an equal playing field in our society,\" said Erin Scriven, a Saskatoon woman who along with her partner, Lisa Stumborg, will legally tie the knot Saturday. \n \n Similar legal challenges have succeeded in other provinces. Same-sex couples can marry in Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba, the Yukon and Nova Scotia. \n \n RELATED \n * Coverage from CBC Saskatchewan \n Two gay couples in Newfoundland said on Thursday that they are launching a similar court challenge in their province. \n \n \n Supreme Court rejected bid to stop gay marriages\n \n In early October, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected a bid by religious and family groups to stop same-sex marriage. \n \n FROM OCT. 9, 2004: Top court rejects bid to appeal same-sex ruling \n \n \n \n A couple celebrated the ruling outside the courthouse in Saskatoon. \n The top court upheld a ruling by an Ontario court that found the traditional definition of marriage to be unconstitutional. \n \n The Association for Marriage and the Family in Ontario and the Interfaith Coalition on Marriage and Family had hoped to appeal the ruling after the federal government refused to do so. \n \n The Liberals have drafted legislation to allow same-sex marriage and referred it to the Supreme Court for an opinion. \n \n If the Supreme Court decides that the draft legislation is constitutional, it will be put to a free vote in the House of Commons - meaning members of Parliament would not have to vote along party lines. \n \n If the bill passes, Canada would become the third country to allow same-sex marriage. \n \n \n Written by CBC News Online staff\n \n Copyright \u00a92004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - All Rights Reserved\n http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/11/05/same-sex_marriage_041105.html",

   "Those who hold Canada up as some example to be followed would do well to look at the whole situation there.\n \n April 9, 2002 Oshawa, Canada .... [Jonathan Gallagher/ANN]\n \n Christians in Canada say their freedom to express beliefs about morality and faith is under assault. The outcry comes after a recent decision by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council that Christians are not permitted to make on-air moral statements on sexual behavior--in this case homosexuality. \n \n A station broadcasting a program from the U.S.-based \"Focus on the Family\" was ordered to issue an apology for identifying homosexual practice as unacceptable from the standpoint of Christian morality. In earlier decisions, the CBSC has made similar determinations relative to homosexuality. \n \n According to Canada's Anglican Archbishop, Michael Peers, many Canadians in public office now believe that values such as pluralism and secularism require that no reference to religion be made at any public event. He referred to the national service of mourning after September 11, which contained no religious references, and to warnings to Christian participants at the service to mark the Swissair crash off the coast of Nova Scotia not to quote scripture, not to pray Christian prayers, and not to mention Jesus. \n \n \"Such attitudes are truly alarming in a self-declared democratic country,\" comments Dan Jackson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Canada. \"Despite Canada's commitment to religious liberty and freedom of speech, it increasingly appears that what is guaranteed is 'politically correct' speech and freedom as defined by some--not universal freedoms at all. More and more Christians are being targeted as 'intolerant,' and any moral stand is viewed with hostility. We simply want to be faithful to the standards upheld by the Bible, and remain true to the message of Jesus who said, 'neither do I condemn you,' but also 'go and sin no more.'\" \n \n \"Attitudes in Canada with regard to this issue and other religious perspectives, have taken such a shift against freedom of speech for religion,\" adds Gerry Karst, a vice-president of the Adventist world church and a Canadian national. \"It is legitimate to criticize, humiliate, and poke fun at religion, but unacceptable for Christians to address moral ills within society. Canada prides itself in being a very tolerant society. But that toleration seems only to apply to aberrant moral and secular values. Such tolerance quickly becomes very intolerant when religion, the Bible, or Jesus is brought into the picture.\" \n \n \n 2002 Adventist News Network .  \n \n Let us hope the U.S. doesn't follow Canada's examples, where freedom of speech is only allowed as long as it isn't religious speech.",

The outcry comes after a recent decision by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council that Christians are not permitted to make on-air moral statements on sexual behavior--in this case homosexuality. \n \n A station broadcasting a program from the U.S.-based \"Focus on the Family\" was ordered to issue an apology for identifying homosexual practice as unacceptable from the standpoint of Christian morality. In earlier decisions, the CBSC has made similar determinations relative to homosexuality.\n\n \n This is incorrect. One must go much further than to simply refer to being gay, or gay \"practice\" as unacceptable or sinful from the perspective of their religious beliefs.\n \n From the Canadian Broadcast Standard Council's website...\n \n \"The Panel found that\n \n While Focus in the Family is free to describe the homosexual lifestyle as sinful, as did Life Today with James Robison, the program under consideration here has gone much further. It has treated support for the movement as \"flimsy\" and has disparaged that support (see, for example, the dismissal of a study authored by a gay activist with the general statement that \"like all gay science, it really has very flimsy foundations\"). Moreover, it has attributed to the gay movement a malevolent, insidious and conspiratorial purpose, a so-called \"agenda\" [...].\n \n In Vision TV re an episode of Power Today (CBSC Decision 01/02-0617, September 13, 2002), the National Specialty Services Panel dealt with a religious program hosted by evangelist R.W. Schambach. The topic of the day's sermon was \"demon possession\" and Schambach referred to homosexuals as \"devils\" and \"demon possessed\". The Panel elaborated on the CBSC's position with respect to religious programing in the following terms:\n \n [T]he purpose of the religious broadcast \"to be that of promoting the spiritual harmony and understanding of humanity.\" In other words, whatever recognition is provided for religious programming in Canada, there is an underlying expectation that principles of tolerance and harmony will prevail. Moreover, the Code provides no special dispensations from the need for such programming to respect the right of identifiable groups to be free from abusive or unduly discriminatory comment \"which is based on matters of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, [sexual orientation], marital status or physical or mental handicap.\"\n \n [...]\n \n The Panel considers that intolerant comment can find no salvation by wrapping itself in religious garb. Broadcasters of religious programming must be as vigilant with respect to the other societal values (such as the human rights of identifiable groups) as broadcasters of all other types of programming.\n \n The Panel extended the clause to include other protected groups rather than just \"race and religion\" as mentioned in the provision:\n \n \n It should be noted that the Panel does not consider that the concluding words in the Clause, namely, \"another race or religion\", should be read as limitative. The point of the provision is a positive one relating to ensuring the presence of religious messages in local communities. The final words, \"shall not be used to convey attacks upon another race or religion\" are clearly intended to suggest that even such positive messages should not used to abuse other groups. The examples given of race and religion are only examples; the Panel considers it unlikely, if not inconceivable, that broadcasters would intend that attacks on persons on the basis of their nationality, gender, skin colour or other personal characteristics would be tolerable. The Panel assumes that it is reasonable to interpret that provision in such a way that all of the identifiable groups envisaged in Clause 2 will be understood as being included here.\n \n The Panel concluded that the particular comments about gays and lesbians in this program were abusively and unduly discriminatory:\n \n In the case at hand, many of the host's comments are hostile and vitriolic in comparison. He refers to \"homosexual devils\", a \"demon spirit\"; in the context of the episode, he isolates and vilifies homosexuals. Moreover, in his evangelical style, he whips up the sentiments of his studio audience against gays and lesbians. The intolerance and bitterness that drip from his lips are extreme; they constitute abusive and unduly discriminatory comment; they have no place on Canadian airwaves, much less in the generally positive and tolerant broadcast environment of the multi-faith and multicultural Vision TV. In any event, the program was broadcast and Vision TV has, in consequence, breached the provisions of Clauses 2 and 14 of the CAB Code of Ethics.\n \n http://www.cbsc.ca/english/codes/cabethics/clause8.htm\n \n \nLet us hope the U.S. doesn't follow Canada's examples, where freedom of speech is only allowed as long as it isn't religious speech.\n\n \n Religious groups as well as gays and lesbians are protected from willful, virulent hate propaganda in Canada.",
