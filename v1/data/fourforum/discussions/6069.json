I'm not sure. I recall after Abu Ghraib broke there were several disclosures of images from within the prison, some of which were made by the Pentagon.\n \n Off course it is entirely within reason that not all material that would have been unearthed by internal investigations was released, and from the description in the linked article it is easy to see why it could have been suppressed. I mean if you release several hundred photos depicting acts that everyone is appalled by anyway, and make sympathetic/apologetic supporting statements people are less likely to then immediately say \"well is this everything or was there more?\" and accept what has been presented to them.\n \n Then the media and political interest moves on, the pressure to disclose passes and the most damaging material never sees the light of day. If you were a cynic you might say that the Administration had to limit the loss of public support for the ongoing war.",

   "This is new. There were thousands of images, videos, and recordings from Abu Ghraib. We have seen just a handfull of them, and they were kids stuff compared to the rest...at lest according to those who have seen them. \n \n Some groups are still trying to get the rest released. I have seen a couple of different arguments as to why they are not being released. the first is that they implicate not he 30 or so Americans currently being charged or investigated, but literally hundreds of American soldiers (which makes since when tyou are talking thousands of pictures and videos). the second is that they fear that the images will further drive public opinion, both here at home and int he US, against the war and our tactics. I can buy this one as well...who is possibly going to argue that the US military should be trusted in places like Gitmo without full transparency if there are thousands of contemporary pictures floating around of htem abusing, raping, and murdering people in a prisons.\n \n In the end, they will likely ocme out, barring some magnificent legal maneuvering by the Bush administration. Thus far the case for their release has been heard in 2 different courts, and both have ruled that they must be released, and that there is no legal argument for keeping them under wraps. The argument that they may cause the US embaressment or casue public unrest are rediculous. The entire point of the FOIA is to make it easier for citizens to dig up the dirt so to speak on the government, making the governemtn more transparent. The pentagon lawyers were sharply chasitised in on hearing for arguing along thos elines (specifically for arguing that the FOIA should not include documents that would almost certianly be embarrasing to the governement...the judge literally cut them off mid argument and said \"The FOIA is specifically desinged to help air documents embarassing to the governement, if this is the argument you wish to use, produce the materials in question now because we are all wasting time with a hearing\").\n \n \n \nThen the media and political interest moves on, the pressure to disclose passes and the most damaging material never sees the light of day. If you were a cynic you might say that the Administration had to limit the loss of public support for the ongoing war.\n\n \n If you were a cynic? How about \"if you are a realist\". Poll numbers for support of the war are pathetic in this country, and abysmal in others. Now that the general public has finally caught on to the fact that the WMDs were BS from the beginning, as was the claim that an elected governement in Iraq would necessarily be pro-american, and the \"helping the iraqi people\" line has fallen apart in the face of huge civilian death tolls and torture scandal, the last thing the Bush administration needs is thousands of pictures floating around of Iraqi prisoners ebing sodomised by german shepards with chemical light sticks. That would be disaterous, especially considering that Rumsfeld had seen these pictures when he claimed that nothign going on in Abu Ghraib was any worse than a fraternity prank. Makes you wonder what fraternity he belonged to.",

By \"best\", I have in mind both the welfare of the Iraqi people and the reputation of the American hegemony.\n\n \n Current US administration has painted themselves (and the public) into a corner. Iraq, with US support, seems destined to separate itself into federalist states with Shia and Kurd majorities concentrating on oil reserves as borders with few options for the Sunni population. That circumstance alone will drive US occupation through end of term for current administration. \n \n Of equal consideration is the amount of US resources now devoted to military (including Afghanistan and Iraq) and home security. Any substantial reduction in those expenditures would affect our internal transaction driven GDP in a negative manner, not being replaceable due to our enormous negative trade balance. Current administration is locked into driving GDP with debt, around $600B last year, or 5.5% of a $11T GDP. With a publicized GDP growth rate of 3.4%, a number that keeps public confidence afloat, break-even or negative numbers would collapse our shaky economy.\n \n As to our reputation in the world community, we've attained an undesirable image as a bully through our own stupidity. Israel's position becomes more dependent on US financial and military aid in direct relation to our ME aggressiveness. The UK, in spite of Mr. Blair's denials, is now a target of Islamic extremists due to UK participation in Iraq. China, Japan and the rest of Asia (and increasingly India) support our aggressive actions by facilitating our debt solely to maintain their US markets until Asian per-capita income rises to a point of absorbing that production capacity.\n \n Given those circumstances, I'd think war expansion is about the only option current administration has to keep all the economic balls in the air. The obvious alternative is to withdraw from the ME and spend that money for domestic development, but that's not a politically desirable option for an administration reelected on a platform of keeping America safe with a war on terror. We're in a bad position.",

Are we almost at the point of saying peace would bring poverty ?\n\n \n Even a $100B annual reduction for Iraq expenses would reduce basic GDP by 1%, without flow-through transactions (producing a bullet costing say one dollar means that dollar is counted as a transaction by the federal spending of $1, again as costs [wages, operating overhead] and again and again as being spent down the economic chain). With a current publicized GDP growth rate of 3.4% and constantly expanding trade deficits (which lower GDP), there's not a lot of wiggle room. \n \n Poverty? Good question. I haven't followed current US economic flow-through multipliers (Eddie or Daewoo would probably know that one). To cripple the US economy, about all that's required is dropping publicized growth rate to a negative number which would shatter consumer confidence. Since US GDP is around 85% volume from government and consumer spending based in good part on debt with national wealth (imports/exports) leaving the country, it wouldn't take much to tip the scale. Having frightened consumers not spending money is not in the game plan. Bin Laden's stated mission included financially breaking the US through government military spending and loss of consumer confidence. US fear is heavily promoted by current administration to expand military and home defense spending to maintain GDP for what I consider obvious reasons.",

   "To show how concerned the US government maybe, it may have pressured for changes to leading economic indicators especially the yeild spread on US government bonds/notes\n \n http://www.conference-board.org/eco...m?press_ID=2680\n \n \nThe LEI has ten components and the monthly contribution calculation is based on monthly changes in each component. With the revision, the contribution of the yield spread will be calculated from the value of the yield spread in a given month instead of its change over the previous month. Currently, the yield spread contributes negatively - i.e., reduces the growth rate of the index - to the LEI whenever the spread is declining and this happens before recessions, but at many other times as well. The new measure will contribute negatively to the LEI only when the spread inverts; that is, when the long rate is less than the short rate. The cumulative measure of the yield spread provides a less \"noisy\" leading indicator, one that better reflects the effect of the yield spread on future economic activity. \n \n\n \n I believe the concern about a possible slowdown in the US economy is growing among top policy makers and that they are doing whatever possible to ensure that consumer confidence remains at an acceptable level. Any real slowdown in the housing activity is going to be dramatic for the US economy. That and retail sales in the coming months should be dissappointing due to the huge increase in auto sales from Employee Discount Pricing.",

Housing starts will remain at current levels (in reality a decrease without expansion) and eventually shrink as interest rates climb to market treasury issues. You're correct regarding currently promoted vehicle sales displacing future normal replacement sales, a big retail number with new models due to appear in the coming months. \n \n It'll be interesting as to how administration beats the war drum in the next few months regarding Iran.
