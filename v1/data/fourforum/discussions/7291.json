   "I'm wondering what are some of your pet peeves. I would like for it to avoid anything considering traffic. Why that? Because I have a feeling that this thread would be full of posts about traffic. (My understanding of pet peeves is that a pet peeve about traffic is like students in a high school. Not everyone there is a student, there are also teachers, administrators, lunch ladies, S.R.O. officers, but you would prodominately think of students.) I would also like for them to be non political with the idea here that the thread could go awry and could start being a Liberal VS Concervative thing when it wasn't intended to go that direction at all.\n \n Now you can post as many generic pet peeves as you have when they come to you. I just want to avoid political and traffic related pet peeves. It would be nice to read something new as opposed to what would be expected from some of you but pretty much any generic thing goes.\n \n To start off, a pet peeve of mine is when people confuse Boston with Chicago. The bands, not the cities. I use to tell people that I like the band Boston and they would be like \"Do you like Chicago.\" And then I would say \"No, Boston.\"\n Anyway, that's my starting pet peeve.",

   "I have a few peeves that are somewhat related and boil down to the same thing -- being treated as criminal rather than as a valued customer at businesses.\n \n 1. I absolutely refuse to pay before pumping gas into a vehicle. I will drive 20 miles and pay twice as much if I have to. As soon as that speaker crackles \"pump number eight, you must pay before pumping\", I screw the gas cap back on, flip them the bird and drive away. And, you can be damn sure I will never stop at that station ever again. If there comes a time when there is no gas station left in America where I cannot walk in and pay for my gas AFTER filling the tank - I will walk or ride my bicycle.\n \n In that case I would take the bus but they want payment before service as well. emoticon_angry \n \n I'll add some others later....after I calm down!",

   "Amen snakespit!! How about putting anything empty back into the cabinet or refrig. Ugh!!!!! drives me nuts. And I don't like it when folks talk during a movie or tv show, can't you do that during the commercials?\n\n You know, back in very early July, I went and saw War Of The Worlds and during a scene when the alien camera devise was going around in the celler looking for them, someone's cell phone went off. It would have been fine if they just stopped it and shut it off, but they just let it ring. I almost expected Tom Cruise to turn around and start jumping all around and being like \"Turn that thing off! Are you crazy!\" He didn't, but it would have been really funny though. Especially because there was an ad similar to that idea before the movie began. So that leads me to my next pet peeve:\n When people let there cell phones go off during movies or some kind of stage production.",
