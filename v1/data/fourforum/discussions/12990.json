   "In a blow to the notion of meritocratic government, applicants to the Justice Department's internships and Honors Program were widely rejected if their resumes included the names of liberal groups on a departmental blacklist, the Washington Blade reports.\n \n According to an internal Justice Department report from 2008, while the policy was in place from 2006 to 2007, \"candidates to the Honors Program whose applications indicated liberal affiliations were rejected at a high rate, around 55 percent, as opposed to candidates who had conservative affiliations, who were rejected at a rate of about 18 percent,\" the Blade states.\n \n Eighty-two percent of applicants who had \"liberal affiliations\" were rejected for summer internships, while only 13 percent with conservative affiliations were rejected for the same programs.\n \n \"We found that in 2006 the screening committee inappropriately used political and ideological considerations to deselect many candidates,\" the Blade quotes the report as saying. \"We determined that a disproportionate number of the deselected [or rejected] Honors Program and [summer intern program] candidates had liberal affiliations as compared to the candidates with conservative affiliations.\"\n \n About one-quarter of the blacklisted groups were immigration advocacy groups, and several gay and lesbian advocacy groups -- including Gay Men's Health Crisis and Immigration Equality, which deals with LGBT immigration issues -- were also included.\n \n Evidently, the blacklist went into effect in 2006 and was discontinued in 2007 when department employees began to lodge complaints. The Justice Department has a policy of not discriminating on the basis of political affiliation.\n\n The Raw Story Report: Bush admin &#8216;blacklisted liberal groups&#8217;\n \n And I heard some Republican congressman talking the other day about how they would be happy to put Roberto \"I don't recall anything\" Gonzalez on the bench...\n emoticon_rolleyes",
