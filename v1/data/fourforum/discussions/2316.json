I think New York City practically has a ban on handguns. No state has banned handguns. No city has banned all guns that I know of. Canada (and I believe Australia) have passed laws to eliminate handgun ownership but long guns are still allowed. I think there is some allowance for long guns in Britain as well.",

Property ownership is a right in the USA. The confiscation of guns and property violates two rights at the same time. The confiscation of any legal property is government approved stealing. Has any state, city, or county confiscated guns? The answer is no. There is a form of government stealing called eminant domain. It is such a repulsive and politically dangerous act that authorities exercise it at very grave risk to their jobs, election, and health. People have been know to wait with loaded shotguns at thier front door as authorities come to serve eminant domain papers on property owners. Judges, civic leaders, and authorties have been threatened with death by property owners when eminant domain has been exercised.\n \n BTW when eminant domain is exercised, fair market value is given for the confiscated property. There is an old thread around here regarding the cost of fair market value for all the guns in the USA. The cost is going to astronomical.",
