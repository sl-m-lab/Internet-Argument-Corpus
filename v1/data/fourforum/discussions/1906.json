   "It came from nowhere definate\n\n No. That's wrong. It came from SIV, two times in fact. HIV-1 and HIV-2 represent to distantly related strains of SIV that made the species jump from simian to human. Would you like to learn about it? Where did AIDS come from ?\n \nwith a insatiable appetitte;exhibiting a real zeal for life; A survivalist? Suceeding whereas \"thinking\" humans have failed?\n\n That's just plain silly. HIV like other viruses replicates when the conditions are right. HIV is an RNA retrovirus. That means that besides the short sequence of RNA that caries the genome, it also contains the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This enzyme produces the reverse transcription of the corresponding DNA sequence that then becomes the template for the production of more HIV. It depends on how you define life whether any virus is alive. By most definitions a virus is a replicating molecule but not strictly alive. At any rate, there is no appetite, no zeal.\n \n And I thought humans were doing a pretty good job of reproducing. What have HIV viruses succeeded to do that humans haven't been able to do? Maybe you think that HIV is capable of instellar travel.\n \nEvolution without thought defys logic-\n\n That statement is without thought. Perhaps you could point out an example of thought in an evolutionary process. I think that maybe you have no idea what you are talking about.",

   "Answer me this, to help me better understand, When the life force of a infected host has left the vessel, Will the virius cease to exist?\n\n why the babble? Do you mean when the host has died will the virus cease to exist? No. It will continue to reproduce until the cells it infects break down. Then it will probably remain dormant for quite some time. Blood and blood products from HIV infected people is dangerous for a long time. Tissue samples from the early days of the AIDS outbreak were analyzed many years later and the HIV was still found to be present. In fact, the sequencing of these old tissue samples enabled a history of the spread of the disease.\n \nOr can it evolve without\" sucking\" a mammel like The Energizer bunny?\n\n It doesn't suck anything. There is no 'energy' that it takes from the victims. HIV infects certain cells that are involved in the immume system and causes them to stop functioning. Thus, someone who is infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) will eventually develop Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). By the way, HIV does not kill the patient. HIV weakens the immune system to the extent that other diseases take hold and kill the patient. Pneumonia is very common as well as various cancers.\n \nSex, drugs, and rock & roll? American Pie?\n\n Not really. Medical personnel who treat AIDS patients are at high risk and must be very careful. An accidental puncture with a used needle can transmit the disease. Any contact with infected blood can cause infection through minute cuts. Many people were infected through blood transfusions before a method for screening was developed.\n \nLike a game of strategy.. AIDS ability to swifly metamorph \"physiologically\" and develop defense mechanism that counteract \"our\" wits\n\n AIDS doesn't have any such ability. The reason why AIDS is so difficult to fight is not because of any intelligence but because of what it infects and how it reproduces. It isn't intelligence that causes it to change but just random mutations. Since HIV uses the processes of the cell to reproduce, medications must be so specific to the HIV that if it changes just a little, the medication no longer works. That is why the treatment of choice has been a \"drug cocktail.\" These attack the virus at several stages in the cycle. But to claim that it is intelligent doesn't show much thought on your part.\n \nI Got a life you know, Just get it off your chest, and tell me why it is impossible for AIDS to be intelligent/ or to develop intelligence?\n\n Because short strands of RNA do not have intelligence nor do they have the capability to develop intelligence.
