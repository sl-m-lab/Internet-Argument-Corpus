   "Even the most rational people behave in irrational ways and supernatural beliefs are part of the same continuum, Professor Hood [Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol] told the British Association Festival of Science in Norwich yesterday.\n \n To demonstrate his theory he asked members of the audience if they were prepared to put on an old-fashioned blue cardigan in return for a \u00a310 reward. He had no shortage of volunteers. He then told the volunteers that the cardigan used to belong to Fred West, the mass murderer.\n \n \"Most hands went down,\" he said.\n\n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2342599,00.html\n \n Prof. Hood, like others including myself, regards a belief in the supernatural as an evolved trait, arising from an innate drive to seek causal explanations for phenomena. He notes also that there can be adaptive value in superstition - e.g. in providing the illusion of control in hazardous situations where in reality there is none. Certainly superstitious practices rise in times of danger: WWII bomber crews could reportedly become positively obsessive about the 'lucky mascots' they took with them on missions; there are, famously, said to be 'no atheists in foxholes'.\n \n Hood makes it plain that in his view superstition and religion are two points on the same continuum - the brain's impulse to fill in supernatural causes where no natural ones can be discerned, in each case giving the believer an illusion of having some control over his fate. He sees no prospect for humankind abandoning superstition or religion, because they are so ingrained. The cardigan shtick I've quoted would seem to support this, bearing in mind it was done with an audience of highly rational academics: there was no rational reason not to put on the cardigan and earn an easy \u00a310 ($18), but most of the audience behaved as though the 'evil' of the garment's supposed former owner (Hood had made this up) was somehow still associated with it - pure superstition.\n \n My elementary education in anthropology held that superstition (essentially belief in magic) and religion are different in that the latter posits a personal relationship with supernatural entities, whilst the former merely taps into them, as impersonally as someone plugging an electrical appliance into the mains. This seems to me to be simplistically dichotomous: animistic beliefs, for example, would seem to lie somewhere between those poles. I agree with Hood: religion differs from superstition only in degree, not in kind.\n \n Can religious posters, then, demonstrate that their beliefs are indeed qualitatively distinct, as opposed to occupying one end of a continuum whose other end is base superstition?",

On a less lethal level, look at the lucky mascots on exam candidates' desks. (Moving along the continuum to religion, some years ago I used to mark Biology exams from overseas centres, and it was common for candidates in certain countries to preface their answers with a prayer: there tended to be a negative correlation between the length and fervour of the prayer and the final mark awarded.)",
