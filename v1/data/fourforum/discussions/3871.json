This does not violate anyone's freedoms any more than an objectionable TV show does. If you have a problem with the status quo, don't partake (sp?) in that activity.\n\n \n This is an entirely seperate issue than \"my right to swing my fist ends at your nose\". If you really wanted such an example to work, it would have to be \"You have no right to swing your fist because you might hit somebody in the nose, and we are going to handcuff you to ensure that you DONT swing that fist\".\n \n The argument for limitations on constitutionally protected rights has always been that your rights are absolute so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. This has been twisted around into \"your rights are absolute except where suspending them may be good for the population at large\".\n \n The former is certainly reasonable, and is what you were illustrating with your fist-nose example. The latter is a way of thinking dangerous to individual liberty because once you go down that road, you can justify anything. We recently saw our presidents representatives argue in his behalf in front of the supreme court that the executive rbanch of our government should be allowed to hold American citizens, on American soil, without benifit of legal representation, trila or charges, and that they should be able to do this secretly. The argument they used for suspension of habeus corpus was basically the same one being used to defend searches at airports without probable cause.",

   "can anyone explane to me how wanting to fly is probable cause?\n\n \n \n There is no probable cause. This falls under a different part of the Constitution. It is the right to own and do what ever you want with your own private property.\n \n The airplane is not public property or space. It is private owned property. Just like your home, the owner can make any hurdle for you if you want to enter thier private property. \n \n In my home I can demand that you strip naked and give a DNA sample if you want to come inside. Don't want to come in my home and strip naked? Then don't cross my property line. That is what you do when you enter an airplane. You agree to let the property owner disregard your 4th Amendment.\n \n Don't want to be searched? Don't fly that airline. There are other airlines that will let you board with no bag searches, no body searches, and no check points. You can drive right up in your limo walk 5 steps and get aboard. Of course that is not the airline you were thinking of. The cheaper airlines do not owe it to you to sell you a ticket to go aboard thier private property. Then again there are other airlines that will let you come aboard no questions asked. Don't have the money to fly these airlines? That is not the airlines problem and they don't owe it to you to let you aboard.",

   "The framers left it up to present day lawmakers and judges to determine what constitutes \"unreasonable\" search and seizure. \n \n To me, this seems unreasonable:\n \n One time, while driving through Jackson, MS, after a concert let out, I was pulled over by a cop and told to pull into an abandoned gas station where there were 2 more cop cars and about a dozen cops. I guess they were watching cars leave the concert. They pulled me over for absolutely no reason, then after searching my car without any justification, patted me down, looked down my pants, and wouldn't stop asking \"Where's the dope, boy?\" When they couldn't find any \"dope\" and realized that I didn't have any, they let me go, telling me to never come back to Jackson because \"we don't like dope in this town.\" I never got any kind of ticket for anything and I wasn't doing anything anyway, and I never had any \"dope\" whatsoever. That's pretty unreasonable.\n \n Anyway, getting searched at the airport seems pretty reasonable to me.",
