   "hey thx for the reply, but i need advantages. my team is going to fight the against team on sunday. Can someone type something really contructional. \n \n Heres what i got now( for my part of the team)\n \n two party system is good because\n \n - efficient actions can be made just by going through two parties. And both parties are similar in direction, therefore actions can be made fast and accurate.\n \n - transparent - there is only two parties so, every citizen in american have a deep understanding of both parties. Poeple does not need a lot of time to understand two main direction of the two parties.\n \n experiences - since the beginning of the two party system, it havent failed USA. USA became the most dominant economically and politically in the world. If the two party have any negative effects on USA, im sry I cannot see it.\n \n knowlegable - the two party system in the states have very long history. The two main parties have many years of knowledge of how to run a country smoothly. We see here the strongest and the wealthiest country in the world. We can prove the two parties knows what they are doing.\n \n Watching each other - Because we have two big dominate parties, the losing party can watch over the leading party. This creates a equilibrium effects where the two parties can compliment on each other or spotting each other's errors. As a result creating a better idea.",

That's why we are in the mess we are in.\" \n There is little if any substance to these kinds of debates.\n \n\n \n That is one side of it. The other side is that you avoid situations where the voters have actually know who decided what. You should see what mess we have with some of our issues...\n \n \nThen, when it's obvious that one party really screwed up, you only7 have one option to turn to. What if you don't agree with that option either? You are screwed.\n \n\n \n But this can also happen in a multiparty system. Most often there are stable coalitions between the communists, social-democrats and enviromentalists on one side and liberals, conservatives and sometimes, fascists on the other. While these coalitions are pretty stable, some issues are negotiated above the coalition borders. For example, the Social-democrats negotiated with one conservative party and enviromentalists to deconstruct the nuclear power plants in Sweden. This negotiation cannot be changed through vote. The communists will never rise into power alone (or with the conservatives for ideoogical reasons). And the rigth wing alliance will never achieve majority without the one conservative party that engaged in negotiations with the Socialdemocrats. The voters have no power over this issue.\n \n \nThis is based on a failure-based political philosophy. It implies that there is one right and one wrong way to govern. If one party did it \"wrong\" (at least in some people's eyes) then the other party must be \"right.\" \n\n \n Isnt that how most voters view it?\n \n \nWhy would political parties have to negotiate and placate each other?\n\n \n They always do in multi-party systems. No single political party can achieve majority on its own and must either form a government with other parties to gain their support or one of the parties can form a government and hope they will be supported by their closest political allies. In both cases, the government rellies on the parliament that have the actual legislative power. And unlike in the US, in the european multi-party system government who proposes a bill that is rejected by the parliament is in a deep crisis and is expected to resign. Negotiations is the only way to ensure you have enough support from your political rivals to actually pass laws.\n \n \nYeah, and when the system is in serious need of \"disruption\" it's almost impossible to change anything significant.\n\n \n This is true. A two-party system is quite conservative (in its original meaning).\n \n \n\n Again, this is not an advantage, but a disadvantage. Simply polarizing the debate doesn't make anything more transparent. Two parties simply have their polarized positions and neither need to be transparent about it. As long as one side can muddy the debate so that the other side doesn't have a clear win, then that's all their constituents need to hear. \n \n\n \n But the position are clear and defined. And the parties are constantly challanged over the issues by their opponents. Not like in Sweden where 6 parties can have wildly differing views about a certain issue, but since they would be forced to join coalition with at three of the others to achieve majority, they don`t address the issue at all. The issue is buried and is dealt with behind closed doors.",

I really need your help ahhh.. \n \n thxthx\n\n \n Two party system is not what America has, it's a consequence of the way things work.\n \n how:\n \n In a free country, once \"power\" has had time to find roots, a two party system is almost inevitable, unless prevented by law.\n \n Think of the country as a big, semi-random system, where humans are striving for power (money, ego-boost, etc.) To achive those ends they often work together to gain an advantage. Naturally, a second party allows opposition to differentiate themselves from the party in power, and become an attractive alternative. Many issues are EITHER/OR. \n \n For war.\n Against a war.\n \n For welfare\n Against welfar\n \n For tax cuts\n against tax cuts\n \n This naturally allows two positions, i.e. two parties, each supporting opposing positions.\n \n A third party would generally agree with part of one, and part of another, not differentiated sufficiently to be very attractive.\n \n A third party poses another more important problem however. The 1st and 2nd party have no use for a third party, it reduces their odds of winning/gaining power.\n \n At two parties each power base has a 50% chance, all other things equal, of gaining power. \n Party A: 50%\n Party B: 50%\n Chance of gaining power.\n \n A three party system makes 2 losers, reduced from 50% to 33%, and one winner, who goes from 0% chance to 33% chance.\n \n Party A: 33% < reduction in power, not good\n Party B: 33% < reduction in power not good\n Party C: 33% < increase in power\n \n That's 2 against 1.\n The 2 parties will take out the third party at any opportunity as a team, it's in their best interest to maintain their 50/50 chance of winning.\n \n That's the #1 reason a multi-party system doesnt' last in a country like America.\n \n It's not about advantage, it's a natural result of our freedom.\n \n -Mach",
