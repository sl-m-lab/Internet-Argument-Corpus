Bush declared, \"It makes no sense for assault weapons to be around our society.\"\n\n \nThe White House claims Bush supports extending the ban and would sign a bill renewing the law if Congress sends him one. But earlier this year, Bush helped defeat a gun bill that included the ban on assault weapons. The president also has done nothing to encourage Congress to act on the issue in the dwindling days of this session.\n\n \n \nWhile several studies show a marked decline since 1994 in assault weapons traced to crime, we'll concede that the federal ban has not been a fully effective defense against these guns. The law grandfathered existing assault weapons in 1994, and manufacturers have exploited loopholes in the law by producing copycat weapons with only cosmetic differences.\n \n A responsible Congress, and one not in the thrall of the National Rifle Association, would tighten the law, fix the loopholes and make the ban on these weapons permanent. If that's too much to ask, we'd settle for the president to keep his word on this issue and demand that Congress renew the existing ban on assault weapons. \n\n \n \nEvery major law enforcement organization in the nation backs the ban on assault weapons, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Every police agency understands the dangers of these weapons in the hands of drug traffickers, gangs and terrorists.\n\n \n I don't think that these organizations are anti-2nd ammendment.",

If you want a RPG you can buy one, pay the $200 tax stamp, and also have to go through all the paper work, and $200 tax stamp if you want any ammo. \n with the right paper work you can get one.\n I have no problem if someone wants the one registered Mk19 (automatic grenade launcher), after paying the $500,000 for it, if they ever want to fire it they will be very careful not to have it taken away from them.\n \n \nI just don't see why anyone needs an assault rifle.\n \n How about it is a comfortable rifle to fire, low recoil, and easy to maintain.

That means that Joe Average crack dealer won't be able to buy one (sure he won't have a Class 3 permit, but the price on the black market is always higher than at the store.)\n\n \n Unfortunately, with guns that's not the case. A majority of weapons sold in the underground society are considered 'throwaways', discarded after one usage. That's because they're generally obtained in thefts and robberies and the criminal doesn't want to be associated with it for the original crime or one he/she commits using it. As an example, a handgun that retails in the legal market for $600 will typically sell for $2-300. The same is true with assault and full auto pieces. Those folks aren't collectors. \n \n The average dealer in hard drugs normally has far better cash flow than most citizens, so cost isn't actually an issue to anyone but legitimate individuals.\n \n Has the NRA been a significant factor in gun control? Since the ban originally passed with the NRA strongly against it, I'd say no. At this point, the current administration is looking for every possible vote and keeps Gore's big loss of votes for being adamantly anti-gun in the front of their minds.",

If there were no grandfather clause and it banned the manufacture, sale, and possession of all AWs then over time there would be a real reduction in the numbers of these guns in the country.

   "\n Now, that gun is plenty. If something like that happens again I will \"feel\" like I have some power over the situation. I do not need an AK-47 to defend my home.\n\n \n There is an old saying: Never bring a handgun to a gun fight. Police have their own \"assault rifles\" and shotguns they use when they know they are going into trouble. The only purpose a sidearm serves is portability. I would personally tell you to at least pick up a short 12 gauge shotgun. A 9mm is borderline for effectivness when it comes to stopping an opponent. If you want to protect yourself, please apply the maximum force necessary.\n \n \nActually I couldn't tell you what a ban would do because I don't know how many crimes lately have been committed using AWs.

Most crimes (80%+) are committed with cheap handguns in the .25acp or .380acp chambering. Usually Lorcins, Brycos and Jennings. Criminals want small, affordable, concealable weapons.\n \n \nOk, so I must concede.\n (Actually I don't know why, except that I started arguing about something that wasn't in my first post.)\n It's difficult to perceive what an actual ban on actual AWs would do because we've never had it (and I don't think we currently have a problem with AWs).

Held at Camp Perry no less.\n \n Yep, one of the guys who helped write the law stated that himself. Another said they didn't know what the guns were or how dangerous they were, but they looked \"ominous.\" You can't make this stuff up.\n \n AWs, per AWB definition, were used in 2-3% of crimes in pre-'94. 3% would be a maximum estimate.

   "So the ban on assualt weapons (which Bush promised he would uphold in 2000) is about to expire. Even the kits that convert them to fully automatic will be will be legal again. Some say it's because of the political clout of the NRA. Apparently police chiefs across the country are speaking out to keep the ban.\n\n \n Don't get caught converting a semi to full auto. Serious jail time. \n \n \nDoes the NRA really want assault weapons to be available to everyone? If so, why? Don't they preach responsible gun ownership? Can we trust everyone to be responsible with an SKS or an M-16?\n\n \n It is obvious you do not know what an assault weapon is. Beyond that, I'll use my own case as an example. I own one of those (gasp) Bushmaster AR-15s. It doesn't have a bayonet lug nor a flash suppressor. It may be similar to an M-16, but it only fires in the semi automatic, selfloading mode, requiring a pull of the trigger for each round fired. \n \n I also own an SKS, firing a 7.62X39 round. Like the AR-15, it only fires one round per trigger pull. It is a semi automatic weapon like the AR.\n \n With the AR, I can put 10 rounds in 70 seconds ( actually more ) down range at 200 yards and kill a black and white target. I did this yesterday. Admittedly, my killing of those paper targets was not as efficient as some of the other guys I was shooting with. The point being, inspite of all the rhetoric and total BS involved in the gun control debate, my weapons are legal and shall remain so. I certainly do not have the money to blow on a fully auto rifle, and don't know that I would if I had the money. \n \n Questions?\n \n BTW, my friend, if you can't trust those like me to own a, cough, cough, 'assault weapon', I doubt if you would trust anyone with any type of weapon.",
