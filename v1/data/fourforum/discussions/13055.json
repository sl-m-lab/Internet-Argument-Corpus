   "The Associated Press: Wis. jury: Father guilty in prayer death case\n \n WAUSAU, Wis. &#8212; A central Wisconsin man accused of killing his 11-year-old daughter by praying instead of seeking medical care was found guilty Saturday of second-degree reckless homicide.\n \n Dale Neumann, 47, was convicted in the March 23, 2008, death of his daughter, Madeline, from undiagnosed diabetes. Prosecutors contended he should have rushed the girl to a hospital because she couldn't walk, talk, eat or drink. Instead, Madeline died on the floor of the family's rural Weston home as people surrounded her and prayed. Someone called 911 when she stopped breathing.\n \n Their case is believed to be the first in Wisconsin involving faith healing in which someone died and another person was charged with a homicide.\n \n - First, the ruling is correct. When it's all said and done, the girl was not given medical care when obviously it was needed. From the legal standpoint, the presence of religion in this case is irrelevant; such neglect should be a conviction no matter what the reasons, religious or otherwise. \n \n - In my experience, from the religion of many Christians, this would be a very UN-Christian thing to do. Having the power to help someone and yet not doing so is a clear violation of doing the benevolent thing and 'doing unto others .....' It's the same concept as a person with a key to the front door refusing to let people out of a locked burning house.\n \n - Finally, I think it's particularly telling that this kind of thing (letting someone die instead of seeking medical treatment) is obviously pretty rare--that says that for many (if not most) religious people, using one's God-given ability or opportunity to do something is the RIGHT thing to do. Anti-theists will, no doubt, try to use this incident against religion, as if religion in general holds to this kind of extremist way of thinking that refuses God-given medical opportunities, when clearly it doesn't.",
