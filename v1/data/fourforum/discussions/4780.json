   "... John Paul II was a pacifist, ...\nI believe there were conditions under which he would have taken up arms. ICBM, but when Russia was poised on the Polish border ready to invade, Pope John Paul II indicated he would be willing to resign the Papacy and fight with his countrymen. (I believe that's what I heard on a TV special about him the other night.)\n \n Nonetheless, whether he stated that or not, he did form an alliance with Ronald Reagan and the Russians pulled back.\n \n http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1377421/posts\n \n He was a great man among great men. His history is extremely interesting and his character was unwavering.",
