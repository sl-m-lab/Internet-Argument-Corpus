   "Hallo! Ich bin aus Deutschland. In the Subject is what I want to talk about with you .\n Las week Russia and Germany signed an agreement to built a gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Poland. Alles ist gut, aber Polish President Kwasniewski started to criticize this decision. He said 'it was unfortunate that Germany had decided to \"go over the heads of Poland and the EU\" and makes its own decision'. Baa......\n Do not he think he undertake too much? his interference into our Deutschland-Russia economic agreements is annoying. Thsi is not that Herr Putin want to punish Poland or other transit countries but it is simply improfittable for Russia to transit gas throuh Ukraine because they simply appropriate part of it for free (however they are duly paied for transit). Und Poland, too, as it is plain hostile to Russia.\n That is interesting, but the gas pipeline will also bypass Byelorussia and no one care about this. Thanks to the new EU members like Poland - whose uppish and sometimes distinctly instigating policy towards every Russian innovation - Deutschland will have no Russian gas and oil after all. IF it goes on like this, Russia will soon hung a U-turn of its energy flows to the East - China, for examply, will be glad to byu all the gas and oil currently sold to Europe.",
