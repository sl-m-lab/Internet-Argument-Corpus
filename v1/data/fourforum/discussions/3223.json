Any argument you have must be for both! \n \n Most doctors would disagree with you. \n \n American medical Association for instance here is their official policy:\n \n Our AMA: (1) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation and behavior enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness... With the help of the gay and lesbian community and through a cooperative effort between physician and the homosexual patient effective progress can be made in treating the medical needs of this particular segment of the population; (2) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (a) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of homosexuality and the need to take an adequate sexual history; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (b) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of their homosexual patients; (c) encouraging the development of educational programs for homosexuals to acquaint them with the diseases for which they are at risk; (d) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of gay men and lesbians so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of this population; and (e) working with the gay and lesbian community to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of homosexual and bisexual patients; and (3) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy that is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her homosexual orientation.\n \n \n and more....\n \n In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers and National Education Association jointly issued a document titled: \"Just the facts about sexual orientation.\" 3 They: expressed concern about harassment of gay and lesbian youth. \n condemned reparative therapy as potentially harmful and of little or no effectiveness \n describe transformational ministries as representing only one part of Christianity -- those faith groups which view homosexuality as outside God's will, and incompatible with Christianity. They cite other denominations as supporting equal rights, and protection against discrimination, for gays and lesbians. \n \n \n You should really research your statements before making them Jaaman!",

And completely ignorant. Marraige is a pagan idea, a religion that did not worship the orthodox Gods of today, and was stolen, refined and formatted to suit Judaism, Christanity and Islam. There is no divine act of creation nor ordination of marriage. Also, many anti-homosexuals often call for a return to the basic meaning of marriage while attack Paganism as a \"evil,\" without realizing the severe contriction they have just stated. Please learn your history before making another dumb comment. \n \n \n\n What is 'sick' is this behavior that you want everyone to think is normal.\n\n \n 450 other species do it. Forenisce evidence is slowly oncovering that our ancestors were bisexual. Homosexual relations occur in places that know nothing of religion, and have occured since the dawn of pagan history. Seems pretty normal to me. \n \n \nOne thing I can assure you, no doctor on earth would tell his clients that homosexuality is safe and healthy behavior due to the malpractice claims his advice would incur, and due to the fact that he could probably lose his license for wrongfully advising people about the dangers to their health.\n\n \n One thing I can assure you, no doctor on earth would tell his clients that heterosexuality is safe and healthy behavior due to the malpractice claims his advice would incur, and due to the fact that he could probably lose his license for wrongfully advising people about the dangers to their health.
