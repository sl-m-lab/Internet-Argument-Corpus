   "Oh my god look at this,\n \n http://www.politicalstrikes.com/thesaurus.html\n \n Even the Thesaurus agrees with me that being Liberal is better than being Conservative.\n \n back on topic-\n \n \n Liberals are all about<b></b>: \n \n -Civil Rights: \n Like freedom of speach for example \n \n -Shrinking Economic gap between rich and the poor: \n The gap between the rich and the poor is currently huge! Some people are so rich they have more money \n than the know what to do with and some people are so poor their lives are a living hell. Some even have to sell illeagle drugs just to make a living. Shrinking that gap is a good idea, the filthy rich(look at Bill Gates) can afford to pay a little extra money. \n \n -Protecting the Environment: \n The environment is being destroyed every breath you take. Most people don't care. Such destruction can lead to the end of man-kind. It is important to research cleaner fuels so we don't all die by global warming. The forests are another issue. Trees absorb CO2 and emit Oxygen, which we use to breath. As forests are being chopped down, our sources for Oxygen are shrinking and the amount of CO2 being deminished is decreasing. \n \n -Anti-Death penalty: \n If you look at when Bush was Gov. of Texas, you would relize that he totally abused the Death Penalty. \n \n -Tolerance: \n We are tolerant of other people's views as long as you are tolerant of ours. \n \n -Equal Rights: \n We want equal rights for all racis:blacks hispanics whites. We don't like the fact that blacks get punished more than whites that commit the same crimes. There is still a lot of racism around, and we don't like it! \n \n -Good foreign relations: \n Other countries loved Clinton. Diplomatic solutions are what Liberals believe in. \n \n Here is what Conservatives think we are about<b></b>: \n \n -\"Pro Saddam\": Looking back before the Gulf War, America and Briton were supporting Saddam because he kept the Moslems under control. The US did not want the Moslems to run their country. Liberals want the Moslems(who are the majority) to be able to decide their form of government. Bush sr. fought with the help of Saddam against Iran. Saddam Hussein was considered our hero. Liberals however hated Saddam because he was a thug and a torturer. After the first gulf war, bush sr. could have gotten rid of Saddam but he didn't, huge mistake!. Now we are fighting a war to get rid of Saddam. Many Liberals are against it why? \n 1.United the world against us \n 2.Kills more than Saddam \n 3.Its not worth having your house get bombed to hell \n 4.I could go on \n \n -\"Dumbasses\": Most Conservatives think all Liberals are dumbasses. This is so not true! I have been to UCSD which is in a Conservative area, and it is very Liberal. People with PHDs are considerably more Liberal than those with just College Degrees. Most Scientists are Liberal too. \n \n -\"un-American\": \n Um we live in this country too so we are American. \n \n -\"Anti-American\": \n What a stereo type. Some Liberals love this country. The reason many don't like it is because our Foreign policy sucks. The people are arrogant and blindly patriotic. Our Capitolist form of government leads to lots of poverty and crime. \n \n -\"Hipees\": \n Most Hipees are Liberal, but most Liberals are not Hipees. What the Hell is wrong with Hipees anyway? Most Americans don't know what the hell they stand for. \n \n -\"Don't whatch the news\": \n Yes we do. We whatch the presidential debates too. Why don't you whatch them for a change? \n \n I could go on....",

I wanted the war primarily to get rid of Saddam, because he really is a murderous bastard.\n \n What annoys me more than anything is, as has already been said, when people make the same tired generalizations of \"the other side.\" It's so easy to call liberals tree-hugging free-love hippies and just as easy to call conservatives money-hungry racist rednecks. That's utterly ridiculous.\n \n Politics isn't a damn football game, but that's about how it's treated in public debate.

   "Morfos if you search in the desert for sand, you're liable to find what you're looking for. emoticon_rolleyes Let me go through your very thoroughly one sided list, which by the way I got some great laughs from, so let me say thanks for that at least. \n -Civil Rights: \n Like freedom of speach for example \n Yes, Lord knows every conservative is really looking to shut free speech right down. (by the way yes, that is sarcasm) Can't we even TRY to be a little realistic here?\n \n -Shrinking Economic gap between rich and the poor: \n So what you're saying is that a doctor SHOULD make as much as a janitor then? That would be much more fair. Yes, a person who spends half their life learning how to save yours shouldn't benefit from that at all. That would actually make sense. \n \n Protecting the Environment: \n Conservatives are for conservation not preservation. Why? What a horrible thing! Really, let me give you a fine example of conservation vs. preservation. Think back about a year ago. A section of Arizona was titled into preservation lands by a liberal group. As a result no logging was allowed at all. Keep in mind this forest was to be left as it was 100%. So it was. When the fires blew through, the land in front of it which was conservation land was mostly saved because roads existed and logging was done so that the trees within were spread further apart and the fire was easier to contain. Once it hit the preservation land it riipped through and there was nothing they could do but watch it burn, and burn it did, all of it. There were no roads to get into it, there was plenty of downed and dying trees to feed the fire and it all burned. If people don't clean the forst areas, the Earth takes care of it herself by starting with a clean slate. \n \n Anti-Death penalty: \n If you look at when Bush was Gov. of Texas, you would relize that he totally abused the Death Penalty. \n \n How do you abuse what was sentenced? Did GWB somehow become a judge? Did HE sentence these people?? Because he didn't stay execution after execution this is abuse? Let's be realistic shall we?\n \n Tolerance: \n We are tolerant of other people's views as long as you are tolerant of ours.\n \n This gave me the best laugh yet. You are no more tolerant of conservative views than you are of anyone having any opinon differing from yours. You honestly believe you are not only 100% right all the time, but anyone who may prove you are wrong is an idiot, despite the evidence at hand. Remember you are the one who states that you're for free speech, what you mean to say is you are for free speech when they agree with you. \n \n Equal Rights:\n \n Conservatives want equal rights for all as well, we just DON'T want equal to mean some are MORE equal than others. If equal rights is what you want, you already have it, if you want SPECIAL rights, that I have an issue with. \n \n -Good foreign relations: \n Other countries loved Clinton. Diplomatic solutions are what Liberals believe in. \n \n emoticon_rolleyes Did you happen to forget about the fact it was REAGAN that ended the Cold War?? You know, Berlin Wall, that whole thing? By the way Reagan was a Republican. What exactly did Clinton do for foreign relations while in office, aside from selling China state secrets Congress (liberal Congress mind you) told him he could not sell to them?? \n \n As for your Conservative ideas, this is going to be most enjoyable.\n -\"Pro Saddam\": \n After the first gulf war, bush sr. could have gotten rid of Saddam but he didn't, huge mistake!.\n You may not recall the time, it was liberals who were SCREAMING to get the troops out of Iraq. Not Conservatives, it wa the libs. Don't throw that one on us, it's all yours, you just have a convenient memory.\n \n -\"Dumbasses\": \n I don't judge on a sweeping basis, much like you, I decide on a case by case basis. You get my vote.\n \n -\"un-American\": \n Um we live in this country too so we are American. \n Living in a country makes you American in name only. When people call you un-American it is because of your actions, not because of your location. Your intent as you descibe is not for the betterment of the country, but only personal benefit, as you've already stated it'd be easier to leave the US and move to Canada. There are people here who would fight and die to protect this country, you are obviously not one of them. Which convictions would you fight and die for? \n \n -\"Anti-American\": \n What a stereo type. Some Liberals love this country. The people are arrogant and blindly patriotic. Our Capitolist form of government leads to lots of poverty and crime.\n \n Obviously you do not love this country. So arrogance is a conservative trait alone. Let me stop laughing long enough to continue to type. Firstly if you believe your diatribe isn't arrogant, how you got your degree is beyond me. So patriotism is a crime? Believing your country is worth fighting for is wrong? Again let me ask Which convictions would you fight and die for?

   "Yes, Lord knows every conservative is really looking to shut free speech right down. (by the way yes, that is sarcasm) Can't we even TRY to be a little realistic here?\n\n \n May I say John Ashcroft?\n \n \n \nSo what you're saying is that a doctor SHOULD make as much as a janitor then? That would be much more fair. Yes, a person who spends half their life learning how to save yours shouldn't benefit from that at all. That would actually make sense.\n\n \n Shrinking means to make smaller, not get rid of. A doctor should be paid more than a janitor! Doctors aren't rich anyway, you should of compared a doctor who saves live to a selfish buisnessman. Anyway, its only to shorten the gap, not to get rid of it.\n \n \n \nConservatives are for conservation not preservation. Why? What a horrible thing! Really, let me give you a fine example of conservation vs. preservation. Think back about a year ago. A section of Arizona was titled into preservation lands by a liberal group. As a result no logging was allowed at all. Keep in mind this forest was to be left as it was 100%. So it was. When the fires blew through, the land in front of it which was conservation land was mostly saved because roads existed and logging was done so that the trees within were spread further apart and the fire was easier to contain. Once it hit the preservation land it riipped through and there was nothing they could do but watch it burn, and burn it did, all of it. There were no roads to get into it, there was plenty of downed and dying trees to feed the fire and it all burned. If people don't clean the forst areas, the Earth takes care of it herself by starting with a clean slate.\n\n \n Lets save the forests by chopping them all down! Brilliant! Conservatives want to allow forests to be clear cutted. They speak out of bad faith, they say its to stop fires, even though the brush is what catches on fire. Conservatives really want the wealthy buisnesses to be able to clear cut all of the forests to make more money that they don't even need anyway.\n \n \nDid you happen to forget about the fact it was REAGAN that ended the Cold War??\n\n \n \"Wars do not make one great\"-Yoda\n \n \n \n \nYou may not recall the time, it was liberals who were SCREAMING to get the troops out of Iraq. Not Conservatives, it wa the libs. Don't throw that one on us, it's all yours, you just have a convenient memory.\n\n \n That was Gulf War2 they were screaming. There is a difference between ONE and TWO!\n \n \n \nWe do, however we seem to be the only ones who know the entire story.\n\n \n Umm, its not opposite day. You conservatives only listen to your point of view and not the view of the others. Same with the media. The media is owned by corporations which are owned by conservatives. The media(especiall Fox and the radio) only show the view of that of the Conservatives. The media near never shows the Liberal's point of view. All they feel like doing is bitching about how stupid Liberals are. CNN fortunately has been recently showing Liberals' point of views. However, Conservatives started bitching about it and calling it an \"axis of evil\" for expressing the view of people with views different to yours.",

   "FYI, the \"clear cutting\" you toss about as if you knew what you were speaking of, is done as the land lays fallow, which means it rests for a year, the nutrients enter the ground, make it fertile and then the loggers plant new trees. You may bother to check into the fact that currently in the US there are 1.5 billion more trees than there were 100 years ago, and those trees by the way mostly planted by the evil logging companies. If they clear cut everything, they have no future, so they are darn sure to go and once the land has recovered plant new trees they can harvest. They put back more than they cut down to cover loss from disease and the like. \n The evil businessman you despise made the tv you watch, the computer you sit in front of and the chair you sit on. These people should of course be destitute because what contribution to the world is a chair, computer, tv, or the frame on your picture? The inside of your microwave? Made by the guy who invented a covering for the space shuttle to further space exploration, but he's evil because he made money off of it. Or is it a case of only the people you approve of are worthy of being rich? Should we consult you before we buy anything to make sure that the item is on your list of people who are allowed to profit from the hard work? Did you happen to know that most businesses take at least 3 years of 60 hours a week to get started before they ever make a dime? Yes, a dime. So when they finally turn a profit, lets punish them for finally being able to feed their families. While we're at it, since those same evil businesses employ the nation, lets all sit around and do nothing since you want them to be poor, and out of business. Now we'd be lucky to get a job as a cashier, since the evil businessman is out of business, there isn't anything to sell! So lets give it all away. Who gets the food first? The people on your list? Maybe you should make this list so we should see who we have the right to come after. For someone who screams about equality, you only want equality for some, and anyone who profits in any way from their own sweat in creating something successful should be punished for being the scoundrel they are. \n \"Wars do not make one great\"-Yoda emoticon_confused The Cold War, since you apparently don't know, was the stand off between the US and Russia that started after WWII. The \"Cold War\" was the ever growing tensions between the countries. Reagan ended the \"war\" without a shot, the Berlin Wall came down, and while an entire generation grew up thinking \"IF I get to grow up I'll be...\" the next one didn't. It was a war of technology. \n \n \"That was Gulf War2 they were screaming. There is a difference between ONE and TWO!\"\n Yes, there is. When Bush Sr. was in Iraq, and had not yet gotten Saddam the libs decided that he was going to try to take the country over, when in fact he was sending guys out to quench fires and find and eliminate Saddam. They screamed and cried to bring our boys home. They threw such a hissie fit, and the guys came home, minus Saddam which was the reason we were there. \n \n \"CNN fortunately has been recently showing Liberals' point of views.\" emoticon_confused\n FYI, the liberal media bias in this country has been recognized for the last 10 years! You're just so far left into Communism you think it's right slanted. Some of the largest media players have admitted that the media is grossly slanted left. Fox is conservative, but that's the only one. New York Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post, all grossly left. You can't even find the opposite point of view in most areas anymore. 30 years ago every area had 2 newspapers, one left, one right, and now since the major companies (the same evil businessmen you despise who provide you with your news) own all the local papers, and so they shut the other ones down, reducing the conservative papers by 80%! There is indeed a media slant, and maybe if you weren't leftist in the extreme you'd see they were liberal, and not conservative.",

(although society by large still seems to swallow everything the media throws at them)\n 2. over-regulation the private sector is a recipe for a stagnant industry. \n 3. environmental resources simply wont last forever\n \n there's more either way, but thats off the top of my head. to me the trend is usually liberals converting to conservatism, and hardly vice versa. I hate stereotyping/profiling, but from what Ive encountered, most liberals seem to be uninformed/blissfully unaware of whats really going on. the liberal view is on the decline because (ironically) freedom to information has got people more aware of facts and motives of world leaders, as well how society is affected by certian liberal views",

   "I've been a democrat my whole life. I always vote, and I never voted for a Republican even once. I was hopping mad when Bush won. \n \n Now I'm glad he won. The right thing to do was to get rid of the tyrant Saddam Hussein, and I think it took real courage to do that, and I have nothing but contempt for the democrats dissing Bush for fighting the war, or for not doing it the right way without giving him credit for anything. And of course for a good while I have been vehemently against the Democrats on sodomy issues. I still tend to more agree with the Democrats on environmental and economic issues, so I'm rather split now what to think.\n \n I tend to agree with Christopher Hitchens that it is not that he became a conservative by supporting Bush in deciding the essentially fascist Iraqi regime should be forcibly removed, but that the democrats opted to become Chamberlainesque conservatives--to opt to do nothing to save others from tyranny. Insofar as it affects my opinion about Bush, I am not at all concerned whether he honestly thought there were WMD's in Iraq. If Bush knowingly stretched the truth about there being WMDs in Iraq, the likely reason was that he knew that even though he'd suffer politically in the long run before the next election, in the short term this would be a more politcally viable justification. In other words, he took a political risk mainly (I don't buy the cynical \"he did it for Haliburton\" slant) for the benefit of a repressed people. Hurrah!\n \n People talk about how dangerous Ashcroft is, and how he wants to censor everybody, etc. Well, I don't particularly like him either. But it's the anti-sodomy viewpoint that really is getting censored to hell nowadays. I wonder how many children get suspended or expelled nowadays for trying to help screwed-up kids by telling them that they ought to reform and be ashamed of themselves, under the guise of violating the sensitivities of gay people? (Not that teachers are allowed to do this, either.) If not many now, it won't be long the way things are going. I know that most of the major internet forums (but not this one, at least not yet) do not allow intelligent discussion of the evil of sodomy. After a while, I usually get censored, banned, or start having my anti-sodomy posts moved to the trash folders. This in forums full of all manners of nonsense and explicit talk.\n \n People ought to recall that Abraham Lincoln got nominated because of the strength of his position against judicial innovation--go read his Cooper Union speech, about how it's judicial innovation that leads to Dred Scott. Nowadays, the liberal members of the Supreme Court feel they can just eliminate by fiat laws like the Texas anti-sodomy law notwithstanding formerly all the states had such laws and obviously they were not considered unconstitutional by the framers of the Constitution or its Amendments. This is just plain dangerous and scary.\n \n It used to be that depravity was so universally derided, disgusting types more often had recourse to violence to addict others to their depravities. Nowadays, the sodomites have so beguiled the mass of the population it is more convenient for them to belittle just wars as being analogous to rescuing people from depravity than for them to glorify stupid wars as being analogous to rapacious violence. The Democratic foreign policy positions are screwed-up.\n \n Anyway, I don't know what to call myself anymore. An equal mix of far-left, far-right, and middle-of-the-road positions.",
