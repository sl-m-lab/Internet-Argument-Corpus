   "Howdy,\n \n I'd like to see if there is a correlation between being a supporter of George W. Bush and liking at least some country music. Actually, when I say \"country\" music I'd like to exclude all types of classic country, such as bluegrass, Hank Williams, and Patsy Cline type stuff. What I really mean is contemporary country music. Last night we tried to go to a restaurant but traffic was backed up because of a Kenny Chesney concert (who knew he had so many fans). \n \n So please vote, if you like at least some (more than one or two songs) contemporary country music and also happen to support Bush vote for he first choice. All the way down to hating Bush and country at the same time.",

You do realize how the votes are done right? Votes are cast in precints, and then totalled. From there the winning candidate gets the state's electoral vote.
