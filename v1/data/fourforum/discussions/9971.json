   "When Poland and Czechia gave the green light to deployment of elements of US missile defense system on their territory, they clearly indicated that they don't give a damn for the rest of Europe, especially old Europe that happens to be bone of European Union! I hope you agree with me that Poland and Czechia must not get away with it! As Western European politicians turned out to be absolutely incapable of exerting influence on these two black sheep, we - common Europeans - must take the initiative! So I call to all European sportsmen to boycott all sporting events that are about to take place in Poland and Czechia!

   "This might be a very good news for all european football fans! Now you don't have to go to a totally backward country (which is Ukraine sure enough) to enjoy matches played by national teams. Instead of Ukraine, part of the matches will be played in Germany, bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/sport-news/football/2008/07/22/platini/germany-to-take-euro-2012-from-hosts.html, other matches to be played in Poland. \n \n I say Ukraine deserved that! Indeed, what else could we expect from a country where nonpro politicians swept to power, totally disreputable and in consequence of a controversial takeover. These people prove unequal to their task! They just don't govern the country but accrue benefits of being in power and line their pockets with the funds from abroad. These people themselves are the origin of all problems of Ukraine. We just should not have expected them to make Ukraine ready for Euro-2012. No way! And I think that Brussels did the right thing when declined Ukraine's membership. This is a serious organization, not a recourse for loser countries!",

   "Damn it, it was clear from the very start that Ukraine would fail this mission! Who on earth could commit the Euro 2012 to Ukraine's trust? This is ridiculous! Such event like Euro 2012 needs serous arrangement. Can Ukraine provide it? I seriously doubt this! Look, they even fail to bring their own country to rights, so what can they do for Euro 2012? It has long been known that Ukraine is a country of catastrophic mismanagements and government corruption! I got to say this is so natural of \"orange\" government being in power! By the way Ukrainian media accuse prime-minister Yulia Timoshenko of the failure who was among the leaders of the \"orange\" revolution. I say it is just what we should have expected! We heard lots of disgraceful facts about Timoshenko's miry business, didn't we? Generally speaking, I think that was the right thing of Platini to replace Ukraine with Germany as a co-host. I say we better keep Ukraine out or it got to be at a sacrifice. I only wish we could get back all those millions of euros given to Ukraine for Euro 2012. There could be better use for it. \n \n Read more,\n bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/sport-news/football/2008/07/22/platini/germany-to-take-euro-2012-from-hosts.html]Germany may replace Ukraine as co-host",
