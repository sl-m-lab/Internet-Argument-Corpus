   "By John Thavis\n Catholic News Service\n \n VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- The Vatican expressed strong support for an international treaty to regulate the sale of conventional weapons, saying light arms and small-caliber weapons have been used to harm millions of people in recent decades.\n \n Conventional weapons are an element in every civil conflict and constitute \"one of the most common instruments in most violations of human rights and disrespect for international law,\" said a Vatican statement \n \n The statement, issued by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, came as the United Nations was debating a proposal by seven countries to take steps toward a legally binding agreement on the import, export and exchange of conventional weapons.\n \n In October, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the Vatican's U.N. nuncio, told the U.N. General Assembly that the Vatican supported controls on the small-weapons trade.\n \n The new Vatican statement expanded on that position, saying it was time for the international community to regulate the trade of conventional weapons of every type, as well as the know-how and technology for their production.\n \n It said that while the United Nations has taken a number of steps to deal with nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction proposals for general disarmament have not advanced.\n \n As a result, local and regional conflicts have continued to cause many millions of victims, weaken social institutions and damage development in many countries, it said.\n \n \"Indiscriminate sale or transfer of conventional weapons is an inseparable part of problems connected with international terrorism, illegal trafficking of precious or strategic resources, and the most abject manifestations of organized crime such as trafficking of human beings or drugs,\" it said.\n \n The Vatican statement argued that weapons cannot be considered as just another commodity to be bought and sold on global markets.\n \n \"Their possession, production and trade have deep ethical and social implications, and they must be regulated by paying due attention to specific principles of the moral and legal order,\" it said.\n \n Among them is the \"principle of sufficiency,\" which allows states to possess only the means necessary to guarantee the legitimate protection of their people, it said, citing the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n \n \"Therefore, the adoption of instruments and legally binding measures on trade control of conventional weapons on the global, regional and national level is essential and urgent,\" it said.\n \n Such a step would be a sign of a \"definite political will for peace and justice in the world,\" it said.\n \n An estimated 640 million conventional weapons exist in the world today. The small-arms trade is estimated to be a $4 billion business annually.\n \n In July, seven countries -- Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica, Finland, Japan, Kenya and the United Kingdom -- proposed that the United Nations establish a group of governmental experts to study the feasibility of a binding agreement on the conventional weapons trade. In October, the proposal was being discussed by a committee of the U.N. General Assembly.\n \n The United States so far has not supported the treaty, said Taylor Thompson, spokeswoman for the Control Arms Campaign, a joint effort by Oxfam, Amnesty International and the International Action Network on Small Arms.\n \n Thompson said a simple majority of U.N. member nations is all that is needed for the process to draft a treaty to proceed. She said supporters are optimistic that there are enough votes to cross that hurdle, but added that the backing of the United States and other major countries will be important as an example to others.\n \n \"There are already enough bullets in the world to shoot every person on the planet twice,\" Thompson said. \"It's important to have U.S. backing.\"",

It is saying that human life is worth defending. Immobilizing an attacker is completely moral. It's saying that parents shouldn't let thugs rape and kill their daughters. If i were a parent, i would put up a huge fight. It is not contradictory at all, because even though I am pro-choice, guns protect lives, and 800,000 crimes a year are deterred through firearm use.

I know many people who have been killed by seatbelts. There have many seatbelt related deaths. Yet we still wear them. They are always good to have around, and still can save your life.\n \n \n \nFACT: A gun in the home increases the risk of homicide of a household member by 3 times and the risk of suicide by 5 times compared to homes where no gun is present. \n\n \n That is a problem that can be fixed through education. Every gun owner should be trained in the arts of self defense and gun safety, and that statistic will decrease rapidly.

How can you counter that?\n \n (*Please note that these 1998 numbers account only for HOMICIDES, and do not include suicides, which comprise and even greater number of gun deaths, or unintentional shootings).\n \n FACT: Among 26 industrialized nations, 86% of gun deaths among children under age 15 occurred in the United States.\n \n Exactly. We lack education. I think the swiss are on to something, every adult male is required to own a firearm, and is trained in the use of it. Look how good its going over there. But, eliminating guns is only a band aid fix, it puts a small bandage on a huge wound, something that gun restriction advocates fail to see.\n \n \n \n- Provided by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n\n \n HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \n \nFACT: Every two years more Americans die from firearm injuries than the total number of American soldiers killed during the 8-year Vietnam War.\n\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1440764.stm\n \n Notice that the poster provides only gun related statistics, and attempts to dance aroudn the REAL crime statistics.\n \n \n \nIt seems to me, Guns dont defend life they end it!\n\n \n Quite the contrary actually. Guns deterr crime. Every time a state passes a shall-issue concealed carry bill, crime plummets. Every time we loosen gun control, crime takes a dive. The UK is having horrible crime problems with murders high. Austrailia's domestic violence and murder is through the roof since gun control. Switzerland has low crime, yet everyone owns a machine gun. How do you explain that? All of your statistics lack the real murder rates instead of just the gun murder. People kill people, not guns. I can leave a loaded Glock on the table and I'll bet it wont kill anyone.\n \n \nIn The UK where guns are Ilegal except for those who go through rigourous proceedigs and are licence holders or members of a Gun Club where All Guns are Kept and are locked only 54 people were murdered from firearms compaired to 11,789 in the usa..that is plain evidence that if Guns are not easily Available it saves lives\n\n \n How can you explain more lives being ended ever since gun control.

(2)\n \n * In the United States during 1997, there were approximately 7,927,000 violent crimes. Of these, 691,000 were committed with firearms. (12)\n \n * As of 1992, for every 14 violent crimes (murder, rape, etc...) committed in the United States, one person is sentenced to prison. (62)\n \n http://www.justfacts.com/gun_control.htm\n \n RIGHT-TO-CARRY LAWS\n \n * Right-to-carry laws require law enforcement agencies to issue handgun permits to all qualified applicants. Qualifications include criteria such as age, a clean criminal record, and completing a firearm safety course. (13)\n \n * In 1986, nine states had right-to-carry laws. (14)\n \n * As of 1998, 31 states have right-to-carry laws, and about half the U.S. population lives in these states. (3)\n * Florida adopted a right-to-carry law in 1987. At the time the law was passed, critics predicted increases in violence. The founder of the National Organization of Women, Betty Friedan stated:\n \"lethal violence, even in self defense, only engenders more violence.\" (13)\n * When the law went into effect, the Dade County Police began a program to record all arrest and non arrest incidents involving concealed carry licensees. Between September of 1987 and August of 1992, Dade County recorded 4 crimes committed by licensees with firearms. None of these crimes resulted in an injury. The record keeping program was abandoned in 1992 because there were not enough incidents to justify tracking them. (13)(15)\n \n * Florida adopted a right-to-carry law in 1987. Between 1987 and 1996, these changes occurred: \n Florida United States\n homicide rate -36% -0.4%\n firearm homicide rate -37% +15%\n handgun homicide rate -41% +24%\n (3) \n \n \n tatistics and \"Gun Control\"*\n \n Compiled by Richard W. Stevens\n \n The Bill of Rights Sentinel (formerly The Firearms Sentinel) aims to give its readers intellectual ammunition to fight the battle against \"gun control.\" Part of the \"gun control\" war is fought with statistics. The gun prohibitionists frequently cite statistics in the media. It is often hard to question the figures without having the facts.\n \n The now-famous 1995 Tennessee Law Review article entitled \"Guns and Public Health: Epidemic of Violence or Pandemic of Propaganda?\", written by Don B. Kates, Henry E. Schaffer, John K. Lattimer, George B. Murray, and Edwin H. Cassem, powerfully discredits the myth that \"gun violence\" is an epidemic that only \"gun control\" can cure. This 1995 article shows how much of the statistical evidence the gun prohibitionists use is skewed, falsified, or massaged. When all of the statistics are accounted, however, they tend to show that the public health argument is a sham.\n \n The Bill of Rights Sentinel is pleased to provide some of the important logical points and counter statistics for gun rights advocates to use. This important information follows in the handy table format below. The information comes from the 1995 article by Kates, et. al.\n \n Gun Prohibitionists' Argument The Data Required To Support Their Argument What The Data Actually Show\n Widespread firearm ownership has for decades been a major factor in crime. Many scholarly articles and studies in the literature. No studies in the 1960's; Research started in the 1970's.1\n Criminologists agree that firearm ownership presents a high risk of violence, and that gun control laws work. Many scholarly studies by criminologists supporting \"gun control;\" few opposing \"gun control.\" Large number of scholarly studies by criminologist showing firearms ownership does not increase risks of violence, and that \"gun control\" does not work.2\n The Second Amendment does not guarantee a personal right to own firearms. Largely unanimous opinion of legal scholars and judges, reflected in published articles and opinions. Over thirty law review articles and several books argue that \"gun control\" laws are not constitutional.3\n The Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to the States, not to individual citizens. Several Supreme Court cases affirming this position, followed by lower court decisions. Several Supreme Court decisions note that the term \"the people\" mentioned in the Second Amendment refers only to individual citizens; no Supreme Court decision to the contrary.4\n It is safer to submit to a felonious attack than to resist with a firearm. Statistics showing that persons who submit are injured less often than those who resist with a firearm. Study data show that a victim with a firearm is 50% less likely to be injured than one who submits.5\n It is safer to use weapons other than firearms for self-protection from felonious attack. Statistics showing a lower injury rate for victims who used weapons other than firearms for defense. Study data show that victims who use firearms for self-defense are 67% less likely to be injured than those using other kinds of weapons.6\n Screaming and running away are safer than using a firearm to resist a rapist. Statistics showing a lower injury rate for victims who screamed and ran away. Study data shows that screaming and running away is far more dangerous to the victim than using a firearm to resist a rapist.7\n Scientists have discredited all studies purporting to show the effectiveness of using firearms for self-defense. Many scholarly articles debunking such studies; the authors receiving no professional recognition for such studies. Gary Kleck's book Point Blank received the American Society of Criminology's highest award in 1993 as the single most important contribution to criminology in several years; even \"gun control\" advocates praised it; only a few articles criticized the book's studies and conclusions.8\n All the \"pro-gun\" literature comes from firearm manufacturers, the NRA, and \"gun nuts.\" No articles, favorable to the civil right to be armed, authored by anyone outside of the \"gun lobby.\" Gary Kleck is not a firearm owner, and is a political liberal and ACLU member; other scholars who have published study results not favorable to \"gun control\" are likewise political liberals and non- firearm owners.9\n Other countries' severe limits on firearms ownership have reduced murder, suicide, and crime rates. Statistical data showing definite and uniform correlation between restrictive \"gun control\" laws and lower murder, suicide, and crime rates. Studies by David Kopel and others of foreign \"gun control\" laws show no consistent correlation between \"gun control\" laws or gun ownership rates, and the rates of murder, suicide, and crime.10\n Other countries' experience shows that more restrictions on firearms ownership decreased homicides and suicides in those countries; the more available firearms are, the higher a country's incidence of violence. Statistical data showing that homicide and suicide rates in Europe dropped when very restrictive \"gun control\" laws took effect. The incidence of violence in European countries was low long before restrictive \"gun control\" laws were enacted. European suicide rates are much higher than U.S. suicide rates. If homicide and suicide rates are combined, the U.S. is still below the median of 18 major nations.11 \n Israel has a policy of encouraging widespread firearm possession also has the lowest homicide + rate.12\n Very restrictive licensing requirements in Switzerland result in very low incidence of \"handgun deaths.\" Statistics showing that: the Swiss cannot easily get handguns and thus own few handguns; handguns are not generally available to the Swiss. Swiss law requires licensing of all handguns. Swiss government routinely lends handguns to millions of civilians, however. Swiss law allows widespread carrying of handguns. Handguns are widely available.13\n Restrictive handgun licensing laws in Israel result in very low incidence of \"handgun deaths.\" Statistics showing that: Israelis cannot easily get handguns and thus own few handguns; handguns are not generally available to Israelis. Israeli government routinely lends handguns from its armories to civilians; Israeli law promotes the carrying of concealed handguns to maximize the likelihood that citizens in public places will be armed.14\n Fully-automatic weapons are so dangerous that enlightened governments entirely ban private possession of them. Statistics showing that no \"civilized\" nation permits its citizens to possess fully-automatic weapons. Any law-abiding, responsible, and trained Israelis may draw a sub- machine gun out of a government armory.15\n When nations enact restrictive \"gun control\" laws, homicide rates fall to low levels. Statistics showing that in most nations, the stronger are the \"gun control\" laws, the lower is the homicide rate. Taiwan's murder rate is higher than the U.S. rate -- although possession of a firearm in Taiwan is a capital offense. South Africa has very restrictive \"gun control\" laws, yet its homicide rate is double the U.S. rate.16\n The greater the availability of handguns, the higher will be the rates of fatal \"gun accidents.\" Statistics showing that as the number of handguns increased in the U.S., the higher was the rate of fatal \"gun accidents.\" From 1967 to 1986, the number of handguns owned in the U.S. increased by 173%; the per capita rate of fatal \"gun accidents\" in this period fell by two-thirds, and the total number of such accidents decreased by 50%, in spite of increased population over the same period.17\n The greater the availability of handguns, the higher will be the homicide rates. Statistics showing that as the number of handguns increased in the U.S., the homicide rates also consistently increased. From 1973 to 1992, the number of handguns owned increased by 110%; the per capita rate of homicide was unpatterned and varied erratically over the same period, and was 9.5% lower in 1992. Fewer homicides were committed with firearms in 1988 than in 1973.18\n Handguns account for only 20% of the firearms in use today, but are involved in 90% of criminal and unintentional firearm injuries. Published statistics supporting these assertions. These assertions are false and fraudulently reported. There are no data to support them.19\n Most murderers were law-abiding citizens before they pulled the trigger. Published statistics supporting these assertions. Studies show that 75% of murderers have adult criminal records before the murder; half of the remaining 25% are juveniles with no \"adult\" record; murderers tend to be rather extreme aberrants with histories of violence, crime, and substance abuse.20\n Most shootings are not committed by felons or mentally ill persons, but are acts of passion involving use of a handgun owned for home protection. Published statistics supporting these assertions. (Same as above).\n \n ENDNOTES\n \n  http://www.jpfo.org/data-docs.htm",
