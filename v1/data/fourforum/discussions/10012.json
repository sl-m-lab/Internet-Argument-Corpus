An animal may be partially aware, may be subconsciously aware, or may be acutely aware of an event. Awareness may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception. Awareness provides the raw material from which animals develop qualia, or subjective ideas about their experience.\n \n Researchers have debated what minimal components are necessary for animals to be aware of environmental stimuli, though all animals have some capacity for acute reactive behavior that implies a faculty for awareness.\n \n Popular ideas about consciousness suggest the phenomenon describes a condition of being aware of one's awareness.\"\n See also, \"sentience\"--\n \n \"The noun sentience has 3 meanings:\n \n Meaning #1: state of elementary or undifferentiated consciousness\n Synonym: awareness\n \n \n Meaning #2: the faculty through which the external world is apprehended\n Synonyms: sense, sensation, sentiency, sensory faculty\n \n \n Meaning #3: the readiness to perceive sensations; elementary or undifferentiated consciousness\n Antonym: insentience (meaning #1)\n \n from answers.com.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \"Sentience\" has also been defined as the 'faculty' [meaning the psychical ability, trait, property] by which the external world is apprehended by an organism.\n \n To discover the meaning of 'apprehend', look it up yourself.\n \n From Biology-Online.org\n \n \"awareness\n The act of taking account of an object or state of affairs.

You wish to assert that only animals are included in your class of aware objects.\n\n \n **\n Either it's your turn to miss-speak yourself, or you are still playing childish games, or you still don't grasp a very simple concept. Contrary to your misinterpretation of a labouriously clarified statement I do not \"wish to assert that only animals are included in [my] class of aware objects\". \n \n First, 'objects' have nothing to do with the subject at hand;-- unless, by some materialist Humpty Dumpty distortion, you guys have managed to convince the world that living organisms, including human beings, are merely 'objects', just like rocks and door knobs.Even if you have succeded in doing this, using that word in this context betrays your attitude toward life, that you put a butterfly and toe-jam into the same category. \n \n Second, only living organisms, call them 'objects' if it suits your ideology, possess awareness, although like most other human faculties, we have managed to build some of our awareness faculty into some of our artefacts. Motion detecting illumination devices, for example. Since such devices do not have their own inherent awareness, it does not put me off to hear them described as objects. Heck, it doesn't even bother me to hear a dead body described as an 'object'. But to hear a living being described as an object puts me in mind of sociopaths, serial killers, and concentration camp commanders.\n \n Third, all living beings, organisms, lifeforms of every kind, possess the faculty. It is a part of being alive, and is found wherever life is found.\n \n \n\n However, the prior definition of awareness you quoted was:\n \"awareness\n The act of taking account of an object or state of affairs. It does not imply assessment of nor attention to the qualities or nature of the object.\n \n Which would seem to provide unlimited scope.['/quote]\n \n **\n Only to someone who failed to comprehend what he had read. The second sentence clarifies the first by pointing out that neither analytical thought nor volitional, intentional direction of attention, are necessary to awareness/sentience. That still does not open up 'awareness/sentience' to 'objects' such as rocks, door-knobs, toe-jam, and other 'bits of stuff, while certainly including every living organism, from amoebae to elephants.\n \n \n\n Now let us ask whether you are willing to further Indelimit your subset of life. You have excluded all kingdoms except animals.\n\n \n **\n This is getting too ridiculous. Apparently you did not miss-speak yourself, but either out of tomfoolery or stupidity, truly wish to present the exact opposite of what I most clearly said, as if it were my position and not your own. Either way you are being outrageous, and if you can't get yourself under control\n immediately, do not expect me to respond to anymore of this idiocy.\n \n \n\n (We will ignore the fact that your oriiginal plaint was that the fact that plants do not have brains is meaningless!). \n\n \n **\n Nothing \"meaningless\" about it. Materialists, who will only grant the reality of intelligence, volition, and other psychical phenomena---\n [\"psychical , adjective--Relating to or performed by the mind: cerebral, intellective, intellectual, mental, psychic, psychological. See thoughts.\" answers.com]\n \n ---including sentience/awareness, to animals with brains (since their ideology demands that psychical phenomena be denigrated to being no more than the 'epiphenomena' of concrete objects, such as brains) may think it meaningless. But the fact that the OP demonstrates awareness in plants, \n (something actually noted years ago, but not \"scientifically\" [meaning mechanically] demonstrated 'satisfactorily' to the materialist/mechanist camp), has now been made indisputable, even using the most biased and tendentious of darwinist terminology. And that, my friend, means one heck of a lot, all of it negative, wrt your ideology.\n \n [qujote]\n In the animal kingdom there is a wide diversity of organisms.\n\n \n **\n I tend to think in terms of the biosphere, and in this or that segment of it.\n \n \n\n Consider the lowly paramecium a one celled animal with cilia for locomotion and a very simple layout. Its clearly in the animal kingdom yet it has zip in the way of nervous systems. Is this creature aware in your conceptual space or not? \n\n \n **\n Of course it is.\n \n \n\n Then we can move on to simple critters like sponges, then to something more interesting in the metazoan stable like the hydra. And so forth and so on. At what point in the evolution of the animal kingdom are you willing to say - Awareness starts here?\n\n \n **\n Awareness starts wherever and whenever life starts, and it ends wherever and whenever life ends.\n \n And for the last time-- Get a grip on yourself and approach what I write honestly, or be put in the same category as SLP, lesz, et al. Frankly, your response to this topic has been so childishly off-the-wall that I'm tempted to end it here. So shape up, or ship out.",

In the June 15th issue of G&D, Dr. Xin Li (University of British Columbia) and colleagues report that three proteins work together in the MOS4-associated complex (MAC) to execute innate immunity in the mustard weed, Arabidopsis. \n \n Dr. Li and colleagues study a plant autoimmune model in which a mutation in one immune receptor, SNC1, causes constitutive activation of the plant's immune response. Dr. Li's group found that 3 key downstream effectors of the SNC1 pathway -- MOS4, AtCDC5 and PRL1 -- are homologous to components of the human spliceosome-associated nineteen complex (NTC). The researchers speculate that the evolutionarily conserved NTC may also play a role in animal innate immunity. \n \n \"Our work is further evidence that the little plant Arabidopsis remains a very robust genetic tool for dissecting processes in multicellular eukaryotes, with relevance to the realm of human biology. To our knowledge, this is the first placement of the NTC into a known signaling pathway in any organism. We are continuing to find commonality between animal and plant innate immunity at the level of both receptors and signalling intermediates; the complex we describe, essential for plant innate immunity, may be another example of this.\"\n \n \n ###\n \n at-- eurekalert.org",
