   "Why the hell is this happening in America?\n \nMissouri man goes from rags to riches with $258.5 million lottery win\n By Jason Noble | The Kansas City Star\n JEFFERSON CITY - Chris Shaw makes $7.25 an hour and has $28.96 in his bank account.\n \n Well, at least for now.\n \n Shaw, of Marshall, Mo., won Wednesday's Powerball lottery jackpot - becoming $258.5 million richer literally overnight.\n \n Of course, it's only $125 million if he takes the lump-sum option.\n \n The 29-year-old bought a ticket as his shift at a Break Time convenience store was ending Wednesday evening, but he didn't get around to checking the winning numbers after they were announced that night.\n \n On Thursday morning, he learned the winning ticket had been sold at his Break Time. He went in to check his ticket and, well, you can guess the rest.\n \n By 5 p.m., he was at a news conference at the Missouri lottery's headquarters, talking to the cameras, posing with the woman dressed as a big red Powerball and accepting that big cardboard check.\n \n \"I have nothing - had nothing,\" Shaw said. \"Right now, it's just like a shock, like a dream. You just feel like you're going to wake up at any moment and it'll be gone.\"\n\n Read more: Missouri man goes from rags to riches with $258.5 million lottery win | McClatchy\n \n The guy has lost half his teeth on his top jaw because he was so pitifully poor he couldn't afford dental or medical care.\n \n This is typical of the anti-union and anti-worker American South.
