It's as close to an opera (and an incredibly dark one) as you can get.\n \n The Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version is great, but I personally recommend the original stage DVD with Angela Lansbury. Your best bet is probably to watch one, then the other.\n \n Trust me. If dark opera is your thing, you won't be disappointed.",
