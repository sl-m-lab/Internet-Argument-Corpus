   "Censor the Internet...that's a possible intent of the great Henry Waxman, liberal protector of \"diversity and fairness\" in free speech. Just think how many new government jobs this would create.\n \n Rep. Waxman Wants to Apply Censorship Doctrine to Internet | NewsBusters.org\n \n If Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) is not trying to investigate conservatives, he is trying to squelch their voices. Waxman has jumped into the so-called Fairness Doctrine discussion as of late. Waxman, however, has added another dimension to the issue...the internet (h/t The Prowler).\n \n Media Research Center's Jeff Poor spoke with FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell last year about the internet and the Fairness Doctrine. McDowell talked about a real possibility of internet content being regulated in the near future. \n \n According to The Prowler, Waxman and his staff are already looking at ways to police content on the web.
