   "German experts assert that the biggest threat of nuclear stuff gotten into the terrorists' hands to make their \"dirty bomb\" or whatever originates.....with the USA! This comes as an astonishing news. Still this is an established fact. Sure I can't be in the know of all accidents of the sort in USA. But the record of Los Alamos Nuclear Lab is enough to get scared sh-less. I remember that some time ago 2 hard drives containing classified nuclear data disappeared from there. Presently there is one more probe to investigate the theft ... or what of nuclear stuff enough to produce 2 mini-nukes or so. I wouldn't like to put words into your mouth but the conclusion just suggests itself. Those repeated accidents and poor security inside America are linked to insufficient funding. And this lack of funds is due to excessive spending on Iraq. If America stays where it is now, it may soon face one more 9/11 or one more hurricane Katrina or something surpassing them both. I am absolutely sure Bush's obsession with external threat is erroneous. America could get deadly blow from inside. That's a challenge.",
