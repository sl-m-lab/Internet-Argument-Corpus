   "I'm posting this in response to the main stream media bias which persists in blaming Israel for finally defending itself against the unwarranted indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas over the past number of years. The fact is the Palestinians have complete control over the outcome of this war by simply choosing to live in peace with its neighbors who have compromised to their own detriment in the attempt of accomplishing a lasting peace.\n \n What must also be accepted by all, and shouted from the rooftops is that it is hamas who is placing civilians in harms way by placing them directly in the line of fire as they sacrifice them at the alter of the propaganda war they are promoting against Israel. And what is most poignant is the fact that each and every time the leftist media justifies their actions of placing women and children in shelters from which they then draws fire on them just for their propaganda value as dead victims of an avoidable war, that same media encourages these actions which the militants have no reason to stop since they are getting the results they set out to accomplish. Unless the truth of what these militant hate mongers represent is told, then they have no reason not to continue the lies and dishonest tactics of claiming to want peace as they do everything in their power to promote war.\n \n Islamic radicals are a minority in islam, that is undeniably true. But as long as they have the guns and the motivation to use innocent civilians as human shields, and as long as they are willing to sacrifice their own citizens to the alter of propaganda it will continue to be impossible to negotiate peace with them since their sole reason for existing isn't to accomplish peace but is to destroy Israel. When will the West learn to understand the mind of this enemy? \n \n We ignore the reality of what their true agenda is at our own peril. And in our denial, we actually condemn the one Country that is attempting to take the blinders off and face their enemy openly and honestly by fighting back finally, after years, and thousands of rockets have been indiscriminately fired at their population; each one accompanied by a prayer to allah that it kill innocent civilians. \n \n I pray for Israel today, and will continue to pray for her until she is able to cleanse the land of the scourge that radical islam represents as it threatens her right to exist. And you know what? I'll bet that there are tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians who know and understand the evil which dwells in their midst are also praying for Israel and the IDF. But unfortunately for these voiceless Palestinians, they too understand that the leftist media which buys into and promotes Hamas propaganda will never report that truth of which side they truly fear. \n \n THE DEMONS OF GAZA\n ONLY HAMAS IS TO BLAME FOR THE WAR; ONLY THE PALESTINIANS CAN STOP ITJanuary 10, 2009\n \n Israel hasn't killed a single civilian in the Gaza Strip. Over a hundred civilians have died, and Israeli bombs or shells may have ended their lives. But Israel didn't kill them.\n \n Hamas did.\n \n It's time to smash the lies. The lies of Hamas. The UN lies. And the save-the-terrorists lies of the global media.\n \n There is no moral equivalence between Hamas terrorists and Israeli soldiers. There is no gray area. There is no point in negotiations.\n \n Hamas is a Jew-killing machine. It exists to destroy Israel. What is there to negotiate?\n \n When Hamas can't kill Jews, it's perfectly willing to drive Palestinian civilians into the line of fire - old men, women and children. Hamas herds the innocent into \"shelters,\" then draws Israeli fire on them. And the headline-greedy media cheer them on.\n \n Hamas isn't fighting for political goals. \"Brokered agreements\" are purely means to an end. And the envisioned end is the complete destruction of Israel in the name of a terrorist god. Safe in hidden bunkers or in Damascus, the Hamas leadership is willing to watch an unlimited number of civilians and even street-level terrorists die.\n \n MORE: 13 THINKERS ON WHAT ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIANS AND THE WORLD SHOULD DO\n \n Lives, too, are nothing but means to an end. And dead kids are the coins that keep the propaganda meter ticking.\n \n All Hamas had to do to prevent Israel's act of self-defense was to leave Israel unmolested by terror rockets. All Hamas needs to do now to stop this conflict and spare the Palestinian people it pretends to champion is to stop trying to kill Israelis and agree to let Israel exist in peace.\n \n Hamas didn't, and Hamas won't.\n \n Now Israel has to continue its attack, to wreak all the havoc it can on Hamas before a new American president starts meddling. If Israel stops now, Hamas can declare victory just for surviving - despite its crippling losses. While it's impossible to fully eliminate extremism, killing every terrorist leader hiding in a Gaza bunker is the only hope of achieving even a temporary, imperfect peace. The chance may not come again.\n \n And don't worry about \"creating a power vacuum.\" Let the Palestinians pick up their own pieces. Even anarchy in Gaza is better for Israel than Hamas.\n \n Israelis, Americans and Westerners overall share a tragic intellectual blind spot: We're caught in yesterday's model of terrorism, that of Arafat's PLO, of the IRA, the Red Brigades or the Weather Underground. But, as brutal as those organizations could be, they never believed they were on a mission from God. \n \n Yesteryear's terrorists wanted to change the world. They were willing to shed blood and, in extreme cases, to give their own blood to their causes. But they didn't seek death. They preferred to live to see their \"better world.\"\n \n Now our civilization faces terrorists who regard death as a promotion. They believe that any action can be excused because they're serving their god. And their core belief is that you and I, as stubborn unbelievers, deserve death.\n \n Their grisly god knows no compromise. To give an inch is to betray their god's trust entirely. Yet we - and even some Israelis - believe it's possible to cut deals with them.\n \n In search of peace, Israel handed Gaza to the Palestinians, a people who had never had a state of their own. As thanks, Israel received terror rockets. And the Palestinian people got a gang war.\n \n Peace is the last thing Hamas terrorists and gangsters want. Peace means the game is up. Peace means they've disappointed their god. Peace means no more excuses. They couldn't bear peace for six months.\n \n This is a war to the bitter end. And we're afraid to admit what it's about.\n \n MORE: WHAT IS NEXT FOR GAZA\n \n It's not about American sins or Israeli intransigence. It's about a sickness in the soul of a civilization - of Middle-Eastern Islam - that can only be cured from within. Until Arabs or Iranians decide to cure themselves, we'll have to fight.\n \n Instead, we want to talk. We convince ourselves, against all evidence, that our enemies really want to talk, too, that they just need \"incentives\" (the diplomat's term for bribes). The apparent belief of our president-elect that it's possible to negotiate with faith-fueled fanatics is so naive it's terrifying.\n PAGE 1 2 3 CONTINUE READING <\n THE DEMONS OF GAZA - New York Post",

And it wont be the US which rescues her, but God Himself will intervene and protect her in accordance with His promise to never abandon her based on His relationship and covenant with Abraham. \n \n This thread is dealing with why peace cannot be accomplished and the agenda of militant islam to assure that peace never comes to her. But her survival till the end of this Age is assured based on the promises made by God. I promise you this; the third Temple of David will once again stand in Israel on the same Temple Mount which it existed on prior to its destruction in 70 AD.",

It\\'s true that Israel purchased intelligence from him, but it was intelligence pertaining to THEIR National Security, not ours.

Within a few days, in June 1984, Pollard sold classified information to Sella in exchange for a diamond and sapphire ring and $10,000 cash. He also agreed to $1,500 per month for further espionage.

The chance may not come again.\n \n And don't worry about \"creating a power vacuum.\" Let the Palestinians pick up their own pieces. Even anarchy in Gaza is better for Israel than Hamas.\n \n Israelis, Americans and Westerners overall share a tragic intellectual blind spot: We're caught in yesterday's model of terrorism, that of Arafat's PLO, of the IRA, the Red Brigades or the Weather Underground. But, as brutal as those organizations could be, they never believed they were on a mission from God. \n \n Yesteryear's terrorists wanted to change the world. They were willing to shed blood and, in extreme cases, to give their own blood to their causes. But they didn't seek death. They preferred to live to see their \"better world.\"\n \n Now our civilization faces terrorists who regard death as a promotion. They believe that any action can be excused because they're serving their god. And their core belief is that you and I, as stubborn unbelievers, deserve death.\n \n Their grisly god knows no compromise. To give an inch is to betray their god's trust entirely. Yet we - and even some Israelis - believe it's possible to cut deals with them.\n \n In search of peace, Israel handed Gaza to the Palestinians, a people who had never had a state of their own. As thanks, Israel received terror rockets. And the Palestinian people got a gang war.\n \n Peace is the last thing Hamas terrorists and gangsters want. Peace means the game is up. Peace means they've disappointed their god. Peace means no more excuses. They couldn't bear peace for six months.\n \n This is a war to the bitter end. And we're afraid to admit what it's about.\n \n MORE: WHAT IS NEXT FOR GAZA\n \n It's not about American sins or Israeli intransigence. It's about a sickness in the soul of a civilization - of Middle-Eastern Islam - that can only be cured from within. Until Arabs or Iranians decide to cure themselves, we'll have to fight.\n \n Instead, we want to talk. We convince ourselves, against all evidence, that our enemies really want to talk, too, that they just need \"incentives\" (the diplomat's term for bribes). The apparent belief of our president-elect that it's possible to negotiate with faith-fueled fanatics is so naive it's terrifying.\n PAGE 1 2 3 CONTINUE READING <\n THE DEMONS OF GAZA - New York Post\n\n What a total load of bull.

You just aren't smart enough to realize it for you to make such an ignorant statement.\n Anti-Zionism existed before there was a state of Israel and before there was a formal Zionist movement. Anti-Zionism does not criticize Israel or Zionism for what they do, but rather because they exist.\n \n The roots of Anti-Zionism are varied. They stem from Anti-Semitism, from Nazism, Communism, The Reform Judaism movement, Jewish assimilationism and reactionary portions of rabbinical Judaism.Anti-Zionism, while popular today among some \"progressive\" circles, has unsavory roots in several disparate ideologies.The hidden history of anti-Zionism\n \n \n  PEACE?!

I also saw the truckloads of medical supplies at that same border crossing which Hamas never picked up. I saw that Hamas leaders have taken over the hospital in Gaza, dressing as doctors while using it to store weapons as they use the patients as human shields. \n \n I have seen Hamas placing women and children is specific shelters from which they fired rockets at Israeli neighborhoods from, knowing full well that they are drawing fire on those locations only to then hold the dead children's bodies up as evidence of Israeli genocide. Of course only ignorant partisans like you are blind enough to buy into and promote these evil tactics as evidence of Jewish atrocities rather than calling them the cold blooded murder by Hamas for the sake of propaganda which they actually are in FACT.\n \n \nHave you seen the news since Israel unlawfully came into existence and the local peoples had their land stripped from them? That perfect little israel that responded to stones thrown across the border by the people they stripped the land from with BULLETS? \n\n \n How can Israel's existence be unlawful when it was established according to British Mandate and was the first official act of the Newly established United Nations in May of 1948. This, after years of work by the League of Nations?\n \n And regarding them responding to thrown stones with bullets? Are you so uninformed that you don't know the history of Israel being invaded by her Arab neighbors ONE DAY after being declared a State by the UN? Here, educate yourself instead of rewriting history and spewing your hate based lies.\n The War for Independence\n \n On May 15, one day after the creation of the State of Israel, the Arab armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon invaded the new Jewish state. The Arab forces were significantly larger than Israel's and were better equipped. Yet, coordination and organization were lacking and the Arab armies were often at odds with each other, seeking to incorporate territory from Palestine into their own states. Despite their small numbers, the Jews were well-organized, well-disciplined and well-trained.\n \n The war was marked by long periods of fighting and temporary cease-fires. Finally, fighting officially ended in January 1949, at which time Israel held the 5,600 square miles allotted to it by the UN partition plan plus an addition 2,500 square miles. Transjordan held the eastern sector of Jerusalem and the West Bank and Egypt held the Gaza Strip.ADL - The page you're looking for has moved has moved\n \n \n How about granting the Palestinian nation the freedom to move, the freedom to eat, the freedom to drink, the freedom to heal, and the freedom to power their homes?\n\n \n All of these freedoms are established rights in Israel. But once Israel understood that freedom of movement translated into random attacks on its civilian population, it had to restrict movement for the sake of self defense. And why don't you condemn Yassir Arafat for hiding as much as 5 billion dollars from foreign Government aid over 30 years rather than investing it into building a Palestinian Homeland? Why doesn't it offend you that the PLO leaders preferred a hungry, poor and destitute populace in order to incite hatred for the jews? Israel would have welcomed a peaceful and prosperous palestinian neighbor to live by and trade with, but all they have gotten was broken promises and unwarranted attacks by a militant people whose creed promises the destruction of Israel. You are blind to these realities aren't you!\n \n \n You mean the one they (According to your Bible) committed mass genocide of the actual inhabitants to get? THAT \"historic homeland\"? The one they are STILL committing genocide to take over again?\n\n \n Exactly, the land which Yahweh led them to, GAVE TO THEM, and empowered them to drive the pagans out of supernaturally. Sorry you have no appreciation for fact that only Israel exists according to the will of the highest authority in all of Creation.\n \n \n Not the world, but to dominate and massacre the people that they displaced from the region.\n\n \n Only someone with your warped perspective could consider acting in self defense against the true aggressors who exist to destroy them as wanting to dominate and massacre them.\n \n \n You have given no justifiable reason for the Palestinian people to be slaughtered and shoved off THEIR land just because you Christers want your precious Israel to exist so your \"end times\" can come about.\n\n \n Christers? You mean Christians don't you? Or are you also an anti christian bigot in addition to being an anti-jewish racist?\n \n Anyway, see above, I've answered this by pointing out the billions of dollars which have been buried rather than used in order to actually build a Palestinian Homeland. If the Palestinians wanted to prosper, they had all the tools to accomplish it. Forcing poverty and hopelessness on their own people in order to promote hatred for Israel isn't Israel's fault. The responsibility lies squarely on the shoulders of the perpetrators of the hatred. And of course on the ignorant people like you who continue to promote this raping of historical facts. \n \n \nPErsonal attack. Reported. Irony meter also exploded.\n\n \n After the open, unsubstantiated and blatant hatred you have spewed here at the Jewish people who have by every standard of rationale shown the patience of Job in attempting to make peace with this violent war mongering and hate based sect, the only term which accurately describes you is anti jewish racist. Own it because that's what you obviously are.\n \n \n That sounds like a threat, Archibald.\n\n \n No, it's not a threat. It's a promise. And if you knew biblical prophecy you would be aware of that. But as it stands you will be shocked into reality when it occurs.\n \n \nI still don't understand why so many people interpet the \"Israel\" of the NT to be the present-day literal nation of Israel - most Jewish people don't even believe in Jesus. Why would they be \"His People\" when they don't even qualify to go to heaven with him according to your precious Bible?\n\n \n That's simple ravin, because Man's position with our loving God/Father isn't based on our actions so much as it is based on the Covenant He made with us. And Gods covenant with the Jews through the Patriarch Abraham is everlasting in spite of the stubbornness of this stiff necked people. In fact the suffering they have endured over the last 2000 years since rejecting Messiah hasn't been an abandonment of them at all by Yahweh, but is a fulfillment of the scriptural promise that God chastens those whom He loves.\n \n Before the end of this Age God will remove the scales from their eyes and they will return to their first love. And you should also be aware that all of your hate based wishes for their destruction will surely go unfulfilled since God is their defender and HE will destroy every enemy who stands against them. You know, like the very first attack I posted above which they won when even though they were completely surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned by a combined and simultaneous attack from 6 Arab States determined to prevent them from ever establishing a Jewish Homeland. When will you atheists realize that it's impossible to oppose the living God no matter how much hatred and venom you spew?",

They just want to work, to farm, to drive, to eat and raise their children.\n \n Hamas have made some terrible mistakes, not least their avowed goal of destroying Israel, which have harmed rather than helped the Palestinian population. But Israel have also made some terrible mistakes, such as the Wall, and the policy of disproportionate response, that have harmed, rather than helped, the Israeli people.\n \n All that this current conflict will do is spur more young palestinians to radicalism, to join Hamas. I'm not talking ideals or morals here, I'm talking about what will inevitably happen. That means more rocket attacks on Israel.\n \n I am however inclined to support the Palestinian struggle more than I sympathise with Israel however. Why?

You're slipping my racist friend. emoticon_xdonno\n \n Oh, and one more thing. The US will surely be destroyed one day, and your attitude and the attitudes of those who agree with you reveals why. But Israel will never fall. Even if every hatemonger on Earth converges on her at once. Because when you fight Israel, you are also fighting the God of Abraham. Which explains on the most basic level your hatred for His people, and why you are on the losing side of history. emoticon_xangel\n \n See Prophecy HERE:",

Hamas are very politically- and media- aware (anyone who saw their pro-civilian work immediately after occupying Gaza should agree with me on this). It wouldn't surprise me if they provoked Israel deliberately in order to cause an internationally disapproved-of reaction, especially with a new President of America coming into play.\n With that said, Israel's reaction to Hamas has been impressively over the top - reminiscent of Iraq, even. It is also unclear who the original aggressor in this conflict is - Israel's 'reaction' was more Israel hunting for an excuse to invade than Hamas spoiling for a fight.\n Personally, I see two parties that are more or less both equal (potentially) to blame. All information coming out of the area is spun one way or the other. The only thing I know is that it is within Israel's power to prevent further casualties by ceasing their invasion and returning to the table - something that must be matched by Hamas. However, this doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. It'll be interesting to measure Obama's reaction to the event.",

   "Get it straight SP, the anti jewish rhetoric is ravins. I'm the one speaking against my own bloodline, the Arabs due to their unending attacks which have gone on for multiple decades now in spite of every single fig leaf and concession which Israel has held out. How you can call my criticisms anti-Semitic rather than objective criticisms shows your inability to also discern the truth from the lie of self perpetuated propaganda which the terrorists are so obviously guilty of.\n Ah, I guess I should have made sure to be clearer when debating with a nitpicking prig. I guess a better way to state it would be to have \"(respectively)\" after that statement. I think most people could guess what I was getting at - that the two of you are spewing rhetoric - Ravin anti-semitic and you anti-arabic. I really don't think anyone reading this thread and the two of you would have any problem grasping what I was saying and knowing which person each referred to, but I guess it could have been clearer.\n \n \n \n\n Please do post a link so I can show that Israel didn't make that road impassable in order to prevent ambulances, but any and all vehicles which might be carrying weapons and military supplies under the guise of civilian aid. \n It doesn't say it was solely to prevent ambulences (nor did I say that it was). If they wanted such a thing to check for weapons however, they should have checkpoints rather than berming it up and preventing any travel.\n \n Here is the link: Israel kills 30 civilians at shelter, witnesses tell U.N. - CNN.com\n \n The part in question is the latter half: \nHer remarks came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a blunt press release saying ambulances obtained access to several houses in Zeitoun \"affected by Israel shelling,\" days after they asked to go into the neighborhood.\n \n The release slammed Israel -- an uncharacteristic move for the agency, which is known for its neutrality and quiet, behind-the-scenes activities.\n \n According to the release, the ICRC had wanted \"safe passage for ambulances\" to the neighborhood since Saturday, but didn't receive IDF permission until Wednesday.\n \n The ICRC and the Palestine Red Crescent Society \"found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses. They were too weak to stand up on their own. One man was also found alive, too weak to stand up. In all, there were 12 corpses lying on mattresses,\" the ICRC said. \n \n Rescue teams found 15 wounded people and three corpses in other houses, said the ICRC, which casts the shelling as a single incident.\n \n \"The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded. It considers the delay in allowing rescue services access unacceptable,\" the ICRC said.\n \n Pacheco said she could not say if the incident witnesses described to the U.N. was the same incident in the ICRC report. But they took place in the same area, she said. \n \n \"In the Zeitoun area, it's been a closed area, and there has been fighting and there have been injured. There are other homes and buildings where there were injured who were not evacuated,\" she said. \n \n Witnesses told the U.N. they had been calling for ambulances to collect dead and wounded people in the Zeitoun buildings, she said. \n \n \"This was very much similar to what the ICRC reported yesterday as to what the medical personnel found when they went into the neighborhood,\" Pacheco said.\n \n The Israeli army built earthen walls that made ambulance access to the neighborhood impossible, the ICRC said. \n \n \"The children and the wounded had to be taken to the ambulances on a donkey cart,\" the ICRC said.\n \n Pierre Wettach, the ICRC's head of delegation for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, called the shelling incident \"shocking.\" \n \n \"The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded,\" he said in the ICRC news release.\n \n \n\n \n \nThere are specific check points for medical aid to go through, yet just like that boat which tried to ignore the blockade, these CNN manned ambulances attempted to shirk the established rules. Yet when they are stopped in their tracks you buy CNNs version hook line and sinker.\n \n Perhaps you should read the story before you jump to this conclusion here. IT was international red cross, and no, they were not shirking the rules -they waited FOUR DAYS to get Israeli permission and still had to use the donkey cart.\n \n Perhaps it would do good to know the actual story before you make these assumptions here.\n \n \n \n\n Ahh, but Hamas is the only bad guy here as they will even attempt to smuggle banned contraband in with humanitarian supplies. So they will view any act of compassion by Israel as a sign of weakness and attempt to capitalize on it to further their goal of continuing this war. Then they will sell the humanitarian supplies to the highest bidders rather than give it to the neediest palestinians. How is that Israel's fault?The daily humanitarian pauses continued Tuesday morning between 9 am - 12 pm allowing supply shipments to enter Gaza. \n \n The Jerusalem Post's Yaakov Katz reports on attempts to smuggle into Gaza contraband disguised as humanitarian supplies through the Keren Shalom crossing: \n\n Both sides are the bad guy here. Sorry Archie, but your Israel that you hold up as the perfect little country is not anywhere close.\n \n \n\n Sure he was, and very specifically I might add. Here is the lie he told regarding the birth of Israel, and I quote:\n [Ravin]Have you seen the news since Israel unlawfully came into existence and the local peoples had their land stripped from them? That perfect little israel that responded to stones thrown across the border by the people they stripped the land from with BULLETS?\n So I directly refuted his lie by showing that Israel was attacked simultaneously by 6 Arab neighbors just 1 day after being established. But leave it to the rewriters of history and the hypocrites to blame Israel for actually gaining 2500 sq miles of land in a war in which they were attacked by overwhelming numbers and weaponry. They also gained land in the 6 day war in 68, and the Yon Kippur War of 73. 2 more wars they never started. But the Arabs cried for years for the return of those lands as if it was the jews who were the bullies who just stole the land. And you flaming leftists have never defended their right to occupy those lands. Yet you want me to believe you're an objective observer of history. Weird huh?\n I did not take it as referring to it, just referring to the past 60 years or so in reference to unrest, etc.. And that bullets against stones referred to the palestinians IIRC. \n \n Perhaps you are right in what he was referring to, but the statement called to mind (for me) the permission given in the last decade or so for Israeli troops to respond to stone throwing protestors with bullets.\n \n \n \n \n\n Mentioned by name? Of course not. But described in character and deed? Yes; and our destruction, yes. Here's just an excerpt from the chapter which describes the whole event. Notice that we are judged as a Nation for our moral sins against God and His truths. Which is why traditionalists and moralists like me fight against the Godless and immoral dumbing down of our Society which secular humanism represents in these last days. This is why the GRACE which God has poured out on America in our past will be replaced by His judgement and His wrath when He allows us to be destroyed by fire in one hour. This is obviously referring to a massive nuclear attack which I believe is focussed on our Ports since the container ships will sit far offshore and watch in horror as they realize their products will never again be delivered on these shores.\n Rev 18:2 And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, \"Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.\n \n Rev 18:3 \"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed {acts of} immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.\"\n \n Rev 18:4 I heard another voice from heaven, saying, \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;\n \n Rev 18:5 for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.\n \n Rev 18:6 \"Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back {to her} double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.\n \n Rev 18:7 \"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, 'I SIT {as} A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.'\n \n Rev 18:8 \"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.\n \n Rev 18:9 \"And the kings of the earth, who committed {acts of} immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,\n \n Rev 18:10 standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'\n \n Rev 18:11 \"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more--\n \n Rev 18:12 cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every {kind of} citron wood and every article of ivory and every article {made} from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,\n \n Rev 18:13 and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and {cargoes} of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.\n \n Rev 18:14 \"The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and {men} will no longer find them.\n \n Rev 18:15 \"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,\n \n Rev 18:16 saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;\n \n Rev 18:17 for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,\n \n Rev 18:18 and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What {city} is like the great city?'\n \n Rev 18:19 \"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!'\n Blue Letter Bible - Rev 18 (NASB)\n \n THese could apply to most nations in the world since the time of the Bible, OR it could be talking about the nation that existed at that time (ROME for example). What special characteristics can you point out that hte US uniquely matches?\n \n \n\n Only in your twisted mind is ravin a mirror image of me. The difference between us, and that includes you, is that I'm on the right side of history regarding this issue. You are as wrong as ravin is if you seek to condemn Israel for simply defending themselves against unceasing unwarranted attacks against their civilian population.\n\n I condemn BOTH sides for their attacks against civilians. Neither side is in the right. Hamas is attacking wrongly, and Israel is responding irrationally and with unproportional force (and killing hundreds of civilians).",

   "What a total load of bull. But then, what can you expect coming from Archie.\n \n We are now several weeks into Israel's latest bout of genocidal rampage against the rightful residents of hte are (although can we be suprised?

There was no reason other than guilt for the Holocaust that really was behind it (that and the strong Zionist movement). I think that the creation caused a lot more troubles for the region than we would have seen had they not been formed.\n \n But, it's too late. The deed is done. Israel is now a sovereign nation and hasthe right to remain a sovereign nation. This \"disbanding\" notion is nonsense. I support Israel's right to exist, and I support their right to respond to attacks with proportional force (not the disproportional assault they are currently conducting against a military power that when compared to their own amounts to a flea/chigger (Hamas) against a human (Israel) size wise).",

Because in case it's beyond you, both jews and arabs are semitic peoples. So I wasn't dealing with semantics at all. I was speaking directly to the fact that Israel has done everything humanly possible to make peace with the Palestinian people while the powers that be in the Arab community have done everything possible to block the process of peace. And Israel has every right to defend themselves from repeated attacks whether you deem it necessary or not. Here's what I mean.\n Israel is Right to Defend Its People\n Iain Dale 8:00 AM\n Hamas are a bunch of murderous thugs. Over the past few years they have fired 5,000 rockets on Israel from residential parts of the Gaza strip, killing and injuring dozens of innocent Israelis. Israel has done its best not to react, but in the end their patience has snapped - and understandably so. They have acted using the only kind of force Hamas can understand.\n \n According to Conservative Friends of Israel, over the past week more than 300 rockets, missiles and mortar rounds have been fired from Gaza by Hamas and other militants at Israeli villages and towns. More than 560 have been fired since Hamas escalated rocket firing on 4 November. This is on top of the 5,000 which have been fired from Gaza this year. The media seem to think these rockets are fairly harmless. They are not. They are weapons of terror.Iain Dale's Diary: Israel is Right to Defend Its People\n \n That puts the guilt on them for creating this and all other seemingly violent attacks on them. \n \n \n It doesn't say it was solely to prevent ambulences (nor did I say that it was). If they wanted such a thing to check for weapons however, they should have checkpoints rather than berming it up and preventing any travel.\n \n Here is the link: Israel kills 30 civilians at shelter, witnesses tell U.N. - CNN.com\n \n The part in question is the latter half:\n\n \n Actually, the relevant part of the link is in the first few paragraphs, here:\n JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli forces shelled a house where they had ordered about 100 Palestinian civilians to take shelter, killing about 30 people and wounding many more, witnesses told the U.N.\n \n Ambulance drivers wait for Israel and the Red Cross to give them the green light Thursday to leave Gaza City.\n \n Israel Defense Forces said it is looking into the allegations.\n \n \"Credible eyewitness accounts\" described the incident, which occurred in the volatile Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun, said Allegra Pacheco, deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the Palestinian territories. Pacheco spoke to CNN on Friday.\n \n So we are getting our information directly from the Palestinian propaganda spokesperson when we follow CNNs reporting.\n \n Witnesses reported that \"about 100 civilians were evacuated\" to a house Sunday, and the structure was shelled Monday, she said. The witnesses told the U.N. that two of the survivors said their children died.\n \n \"There was no order given to move civilians from one building into another,\" Israeli security sources said.\n So what we have here is another example of Hamas placing a hundred women, children and seniors into a home, firing rockets from it to draw fire from Israeli forces, and then blaming Israel for the deaths. And like good propagandists, CNN is only too happy to report those lies. And you are only too happy to buy into them.\n \n \n Perhaps you should read the story before you jump to this conclusion here. IT was international red cross, and no, they were not shirking the rules -they waited FOUR DAYS to get Israeli permission and still had to use the donkey cart.\n\n \n How could I, You didn't post one to read.

Sorry Archie, but your Israel that you hold up as the perfect little country is not anywhere close.\n\n \n I must agree on one point while disagreeing on another. I never claimed that Israel is perfect at all, just as I don't claim that America is in any way perfect or without sin in areas of foreign policy. But all we have in this world are degrees of right and wrong since no entity or person is perfect. In this specific case between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel is on the right side. They don't make treaties just to buy time to hit the enemy again as Hamas does. They don't sacrifice their own citizens for propaganda points. They don't kill children to gain sympathy which isn't deserved. \n \n The Jews have given back land they won repelling invasions by Arabs; they purposely gave up what was an additional buffer zone against the advice of every middle eastern expert in the hope that it would lead to peace. But the rockets never stopped flying. And for years, Israel never returned fire. A fact you seem devoid of appreciating or acknowledging in any of your blind criticism of Israel. \n \n \n Perhaps you are right in what he was referring to, but the statement called to mind (for me) the permission given in the last decade or so for Israeli troops to respond to stone throwing protestors with bullets.\n\n \n Got a link to when that permission was given?

Hamas is attacking wrongly, and Israel is responding irrationally and with unproportional force (and killing hundreds of civilians).\n\n \n Tell me SP, how many years, and how many thousands of rockets must Israel endure before you'll give them the go ahead to defend themselves against terrorists? Tell me what the liberal solution is for this dilemma they face. Because it only seems to be the Jews who are being judged here. The terrorists are viewed as irresponsible juvenile delinquents who can't help their actions. That is what's so twisted about this.

SP was not talking about the shelling of the place where 100 civilans were (dispicable act on its own). \n \n SP quite clearly quoted the part about the ambulances.\n \n The shelling was the part taken from \"palestinian propoganda\".\n \n The ambulance part was from the INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS.\n \n The relevant part is right there in the first sentence SP quoted: International Committee of the Red Cross issued a blunt press release saying ambulances \n \n They go on to attribute all the quotes of the ambulance story to the ICRC, and not the \"propaganda\".\n \n But then you wouldn't want people to notice that now would you?\n\n \n I see, so because the ICRC makes an allegation, it must be absolute bipartisan truth huh? No manipulation of facts by them, right? Well what would you say if they've already been exposed for what they are, sold out partisans who support the enemies of Israel at every turn. Here's an example from the Lebanese war where they were caught red handed manufacturing damning evidence against Israel and making sure it got world wide press coverage. Until they were caught, then they went back into their hole until sheeple like you forgot about their dishonesty and corruption of the truth in favor of supporting the terrorists propaganda machine. Here's an excerpt, read it and wake up to the lies you support and feed on so blindly.\n BLOGGERS HAVE become a critical component of the free world's defense in the current war. During the Hizbullah campaign in Lebanon, bloggers scrutinized coverage of the war in a way that has never been done before. Their work has exposed the dirty secret of the Middle East that the media has hidden for so many years: The global media and the international NGO community, which profess to be neutral observers, are in fact colluding with terrorist organizations.\n \n The blogosphere, and particularly Little Green Footballs, Powerline, Zombietime, Michelle Malkin, and EU Referendum, have relentlessly exposed the systematic staging of news events, fabrication of attacks against relief workers, and doctoring of photographic images by Hizbullah with the active assistance of international organizations and the global media.\n \n The International Committee of the Red Cross, with its internationally mandated status as a protected organization, is particularly culpable. The blogosphere - and specifically EU Referendum and Zombietime Web sites - have shown that Red Cross employees in Tyre and Kana fabricated from whole cloth a tale of an Israeli airstrike against Red Cross ambulances in Kana on July 23. In an exhaustively documented report, \"How the Media Legitimized an Anti-Israel Hoax and Changed the Course of a War,\" Zombietime showed how Red Cross employees took an old, rusty ambulance and alleged that the IAF had attacked it with a missile that blew a hole straight through the middle of the red cross on the ambulance's roof.\n \n The Red Cross allegation was reported as fact by such \"credible\" news organizations as Associated Press, Time magazine, the BBC, ITV, The New York Times, The Guardian, The Age, MSNBC, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both published accounts of the attack as evidence of Israeli \"war crimes\" in Lebanon.\n \n Zombietime clearly proved from simple scrutiny of the photographs taken of the ambulance, that the hole in the cross was not the result of a missile attack but the work of the ambulance manufacturer. It was the hole for an air vent. The pockmarks on the roof were the result of age and decay. There had been no fire in the ambulance. There was no attack. It was a complete fabrication, concocted by Red Cross employees who enjoy their protected status because their organization has pledged its neutral status in this and all wars.Terrorist theater tricks - Likud of Holland / Likoed Nederland\n \n Sound familiar? They are a devious and dishonest partisan which cannot be trusted to report facts objectively. Here's more from the same report.\n ONE WEEK later, as EU Referendum reports in a similarly detailed investigation of the much condemned IAF bombing of Kana on July 30, (which actually happened a mile north of Kana at Khuraybah village), Red Cross relief workers actively participated in the staging of a perverted media extravaganza where the bodies of dead children were paraded about before the waiting camera crews for hours and hours.\n \n Rather than demand that the ICRC account for the clear breach of its binding commitment to neutrality, and rather than attack the Lebanese Red Cross for its active collaboration with Hizbullah, the international media has attacked the bloggers. They are brushed off as \"Israel supporters,\" and \"right-wing extremists.\" The aim of these brush-offs is to convince \"right thinking\" citizens that they oughtn't have anything to do with these champions of truth and human decency.\n \n As each day passes, the governments, formal and informal legal apparatuses, and media of free societies show themselves to be less and less capable of contending with the information operations conducted against their societies by subversive forces seeking their destruction.\n \n As each day passes it becomes clear that the responsibility of protecting our nations and societies from internal disintegration has passed to the hands of individuals, often working alone, who refuse to accept the degradation of their societies and so fight with the innovative tools of liberty to protect our way of life. The vigilance of just a handful of bloggers brought us the knowledge of the corruption of our media and the network of global NGOs that we have come to rely on to tell us the \"objective\" truth.\n \n It is up to all citizens of the free world, who value our freedom to recognize this corruption, applaud the bloggers and join them in refusing to allow these corrupt institutions to cloud our commitment to freedom.\n Want more? Scroll down the same link to the next article. It starts with this:\n The media war against Israel\n \n Melanie Philips, August 30, 2006.\n \n \n \n Early in the recent Lebanon war, the blogosphere revealed the fabrication of images by Reuters, whose reputation is now in shreds among those dwindling numbers in the western mainstream media who still acknowledge there is such a thing as the truth. \n Since then, the nature and scale of the various frauds perpetrated by the media during that war put those doctored Reuters pictures into the shade. The western media are no longer merely producing questionable professional practices in reporting a war. They are now active participants in it - and on the wrong side of history.\n \n One of the very few politicians to voice concern at this phenomenon is Australia's foreign minister Alexander Downer, who said:\n \n \"What concerns me greatly is the evidence of dishonesty in the reporting out of Lebanon. For example, a Reuters photographer was forced to resign after doctoring images to exaggerate the impact of Israeli air attacks. There were the widely-reported claims that Israel had bombed deliberately a Red Cross ambulance.\n \n In subsequent weeks, the world has discovered those allegations do not stand up to even the most rudimentary scrutiny. After closer study of the images of the damage to the ambulance, it is beyond serious dispute that this episode has all the makings of a hoax. Yet some of the world's most prestigious media outlets, including some of those represented here today, ran that story as fact - unchallenged, unquestioned. Similarly, there has been the tendency to report every casualty on the Lebanese side of the conflict as if a civilian casualty, when it was indisputable that a great many of those injured or killed in Israeli offensives were armed Hezbollah combatants.\n \n My point is this: in a grown-up society such as our own, the media cannot expect to get away with parading falsehoods as truths, or ignoring salient facts because they happen to be inconvenient to the line of argument - or narrative - that particular journalists, or media organisations, might choose to adopt on any given controversy or issue.\"\n So this is just further ON TOPIC evidence which is covered in this threads OP. Facts which you and the other promoters of Hamas lies refuse to accept. You and your cohorts are nothing more than patsy's to these murderers ravin. ignorant sheeple according to them who don't have the brains to see through their charades. They actually go to bed at night praising allah for the stupid americans who are so emotional and dumbed down that they believe every lie and manufactured story which is spoonfed to them. Congratulations ravin, you and people like SP are the ultimate victims.",

   "Bloggers partisan rantings become unshakeable evidence.............Riiiiight.\n\n \n The bloggers only exposed the fraud. This source and all the sources that reported on it after the fact, once the details were exposed weren't bloggers either. But you must of course remain in denial so as to not admit that you and your cohorts are dupes of pro-terrorist propaganda as a general rule since those are the only sources for info which you accept. Why is that? Because they tell you what you want to believe and you naturally prefer the lie to the truth. Here's more from the second article on that link. \n The major incidents of apparent media fraud are these.\n \n The claim that Israeli aircraft intentionally fired missiles at and struck two Lebanese Red Cross ambulances performing rescue operations, causing huge explosions that injured everyone inside the vehicles. This claim, which gave such incendiary traction to the lie that Israel deliberately targeted civilians, was repeated by ITV News, Time Magazine, the Guardian, Boston Globe, The Age, NBC News, the New York Times and thousands of outlets around the world.\n Zombietime, however, convincingly exposed this claim as a fraud. It is worth reading its analysis in full in order properly to grasp both the enormity of the libel and the way it was not only uncritically accepted but gleefully embellished by respected media outlets, whose journalists either didn't know or care that they were transmitting an outright fabrication. \n Anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of the kind of missiles used by the Israeli air force would grasp immediately that the hole in the roof of the ambulance whose picture went round the world could not have been caused by such a missile. If a missile had indeed hit it there would have been no roof remaining to inspect; nor would there have remained an ambulance. \n Yet the rest of the ambulance in the pictures, although damaged, was pretty well intact - and the allegedly seriously injured ambulance driver not only was pictured with minor injuries, but even these had miraculously disappeared without trace in pictures taken a few days later.\n \n In short, the whole claim was patently risible. As Zombietime revealed, the hole was almost certainly made by an air vent in the roof. It was part of the ambulance. There was no attack on the ambulance. The whole claim was a lie, a hoax, a fraud. Yet this lie has gone round the world, been 'shown' on TV, been embellished by familiar trusted commentators and thus has attained the status of unchallengeable truth. But it is a lie.\n \n Now the Red Cross has rebuked Australian Foreign Minister Downer for relying on an 'unverified' blog for his claim. As Little Green Footballs observes, this was the same Red Cross which - as LGF previously reported - once the 'unverified' blog started using those vanishing journalistic attributes such as eyesight and brain activity to state the overwhelmingly obvious, quietly removed from its website the high-resolution image of the ambulance that had allegedly been struck. For if these pictures were indeed a lie, then the Red Cross itself is squarely in the frame for disseminating it.\n \n The claim that Israel fired a missile which hit a Reuters vehicle and wounded two cameramen. One was a Reuters employee, Fadel Shana; the other, Sabbah Hmaida, was described by Reuters as working for a 'local news website'; although as Little Green Footballs noted, he was also reported variously as working for 1) a local news web site, 2) an Arabic network, 3) Palestinian Media Group, and 4) Dubai TV - and now Caroline Glick has revealed in the Jerusalem Post that he was actually working for none other than Iran.\n But as Powerline has reported here, here, and here, pictures of this Reuters vehicle suggest that it was not hit by anything remotely resembling a missile. There was a modest and rusty gash in the roof and a windscreen that was shattered (although even that is in doubt in another picture). That was it. As with the Red Cross claim, the notion that such damage was consistent with a missile strike is simply ludicrous.\n \n The claim that the Israelis deliberately perpetrated a massacre of civilians at Kana. Apart from the fact that the initial claimed casualty rate here was subsequently all but halved by the Red Cross (to 28), there is significant evidence that many of the most harrowing pictures of the victims, which did so much to turn public opinion against Israel in this war, were staged. \n EU Referendum has now assembled a compendium of its considerable investigative efforts over three weeks entitled The Corruption of the Media, which it has submitted to the Press Complaints Commission. Again, the whole thing repays study. In summary, it says: \n \"many of the incidents recorded in visual form by the media were indeed staged. In fact, we feel we can go further. In our view, the bulk of the relief effort at Khuraybah on 30 July was turned into a perverted propaganda exercise. The site, in effect, became one vast, grotesque film-set on which a macabre drama was played out to a willing and complicit media, which actively co-operated in the production and exploited the results.\"\n EU referendum concludes: \n \"what we do see from Qana is the sheer scale of the staging - not the occasional picture of the many. The majority seems to have been either posed or staged, or both. Given the large AP team present, this suggests that we are looking at more than just a rogue photographer - the malpractice seems institutionalised as normal practice.\"\n \n And even more devastatingly: \n \"In defence of the media, if it can be considered thus, one can only postulate that staging scenes such as these is so common a practice, and so deeply embedded in the whole fabric of photo-journalism (and not just locally in the Middle East), that no one at the incident saw anything wrong with what transpired. \n Either that or, so familiar were they with the techniques used that they simply did not register what was happening. As for the others, in their air-conditioned offices, hundreds and thousands of miles away from the action, did they care one way or the other? \n After all, Shane Richmond of The Daily Telegraph implied, the greater truth was being served. 'Is the child dead?', he asked. 'Was the child killed by Israeli bombs?' Thus, did he say: 'If so, the picture illustrates the story. If the picture does not alter the truth of the story, we're not being disingenuous. And the truth of the story is this: Israeli bombs killed several civilians in Qana, many of whom were children.' \n That is the nearest to an admission we have that it is acceptable to stage photographs.\"\n \n In short, much of the most incendiary media coverage of this war seems to have been either staged or fabricated. The big question is why the western media would perpetrate such institutionalised mendacity. Many ancillary reasons come to mind. There is the reliance upon corrupted news and picture agencies which employ Arab propagandists as stringers and cameramen. There is the herd mentality of the media which decides collectively what the story is.\n \n There is the journalists' fear for their personal safety if they report the truth about terrorist outfits. There is the difficulty of discovering the truth from undemocratic regimes and terrorist organisations. There is the language barrier; there is professional laziness; there is the naive inability to acknowledge the depths of human evil and depravity; there is the moral inversion of the left which believes that western truth-tellers automatically tell lies, while third world liars automatically tell the truth.\n \n But the big answer is that the western media transmit the lies of Hezbollah because they want to believe them. And that's because the Big Lie these media tell - and have themselves been told - about Israel and its place in history and in the world today has achieved the status of unchallengeable truth. \n The plain fact is that western journalists were sent to cover the war being waged against Israel from Lebanon as a war being waged by Israel against Lebanon. And that's because that's how editors think of the Middle East: that the whole ghastly mess is driven by Israel's actions, and that therefore it is only Israel's aggression which is the story to be covered.\n \n Thus history is inverted, half a century of Jewish victimisation is erased from public consciousness, victims are turned into aggressors and genocidal mass murderers turned into victims, and ignorance and prejudice stalk England's once staunch and stalwart land.Terrorist theater tricks - Likud of Holland / Likoed Nederland",

The PLO under Yassir Arafats 30 year reign with held billions of Aid dollars while allowing its citizens to live in squalor, abject poverty and hopelessness. \n \n Rather than build a civilized and productive socialized infrastructure, they have forced a bitter poverty on the Palestinian People for multiple decades while dishonestly blaming Israel for their lack of opportunity. It is mind boggling that so many can deny the facts of the Palestinian Authorities culpability for its own peoples suffering when they had every opportunity, and the wealth to build a vital, prosperous social infrastructure and live in peace and harmony with their more than willing Jewish neighbors. Here are the facts from the files of the PLO as computer hackers uncovered the ugly secret of Arafats hidden mountain of GOLD.\n Hackers uncover secret billions of Arafat's PLO\n \n London Sunday Telegraph, December 5, 1999 \n By Tom Gross in Jerusalem\n \n Was Congress aware of the following London Sunday Telegraph data, while appropriating $400 million foreign aid to the PLO, in addition to the $500 million already transferred to the PLO?! Should Congress tolerate the transfer of the $400 million to the PLO before the GAO establishes transparency of PLO accounts, including Arafat's own bank accounts?! \n Just like the most corrupt rulers in the Third World, so does Arafat plunder his own people, while expanding his own personal financial holdings. Shouldn't Congress MANDATE that foreign aid to the PLO be withheld until the GAO audit is concluded, including Arafat's personal bank account?!!!\n THE Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has salted away billions of pounds for the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in secret foreign bank accounts and investments, including property in London.\n \n The disclosure about the hidden wealth of his PLO comes amid deepening economic hardship in his Gaza and West Bank fiefdoms. It will also hamper his efforts to woo a huge influx of European aid for his fledgling Palestinian regime.\n \n The timing of the disclosures could not have been more embarrassing as Mr Arafat, seated before a stage built to resemble a giant Christmas crib, yesterday opened Millennium celebrations in Bethlehem. He hopes that the year of festivities in Jesus's birthplace will showcase his push for an independent Palestinian state.\n \n New details of the vast PLO fortune he controls have come to light following a series of computer break-ins at the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis. \n The hackers discovered that the PLO maintains about \u00a35 billion in numbered bank accounts in Zurich, Geneva and New York. It also holds accounts with smaller sums in north Africa, Europe and Asia. They are not registered in the PLO's name, but in the names of private individuals. \n The records also showed that the PLO owns shares on the Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo stock exchanges, including stock in the German car giant Mercedes Benz, and property in prestigious areas of European capitals, including Mayfair in London.\n \n The organisation, which once specialised in aircraft hijackings, also has shares in several airlines, including the national carriers of the Maldives and Guinea Bissau. The computer security breach is believed on the West Bank to have been carried out by PLO officials disgruntled with Mr Arafat's leadership. \"They wished to dispel the smokescreen created around the PLO's finances,\" a Palestinian official told The Telegraph.\n \n Mr Arafat has always refused to comment on reports about the foreign bank accounts. But the disclosures caused anger in poverty-stricken Gaza. One embittered Palestinian said: \n \"Why is he sitting on a mountain of gold, while there is a desperate lack of jobs and medical supplies here?\"\n \n Mr Arafat is both president of the Palestinian Authority, the semi-autonomous organisation that governs parts of Gaza and the West Bank, and the chairman of the PLO, which maintains its headquarters in Tunis, its base during its terrorist heyday. \n The creation of the Palestinian Authority, the embryonic government for a future Palestinian state, was supposed to lead to the winding-up of the PLO - and make the Palestinian leadership accountable and law-abiding. But the authority has in fact been repeatedly accused by domestic opponents of rampant corruption and mismanagement.\n \n The web of secret bank accounts and assets held around the world is believed to be so complex that only Mr Arafat himself and two of his most trusted aides know the overall picture. Much of the money is the result of \"taxes\" levied on Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Gulf states in the Seventies and Eighties, and of donations from wealthy states such as Saudi Arabia. \n The assets are controlled by Mr Arafat himself and it is not known what would happen to them if the 70-year-old, who is said to be suffering from Parkinson's disease, should die. An Israeli intelligence analyst said: \n \"These revelations are almost certainly not the whole story. No one can know the full extent of the PLO's assets. They are so well hidden.\"\n \n The disclosures are also likely to prompt international donors, including the European Union countries, to ask why Mr Arafat is still demanding aid for his Palestinian authority. Nor will they have been impressed by his decision to invite Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to Bethlehem. \n Hackers uncover secret billions of Arafat's PLO - London Sunday Telegraph - Likoed Nederland\n \n So my question is, why do you protest against and condemn the existence of the Country which has worked hard to create a prosperous and productive State which is a responsible member of the worlds community of States, as you defend the criminal and obviously unethical actions of a tyrannical regime which prefers to hold its citizens in abject poverty in order to promote a spirit of hatred and discontentment in them so as to propagate an unending hatred for Israel?\n \n I'm curious about how you justify such personal blindness in the face of the historical facts which not only the Palestinian Authority but Hamas, Hezballah and all of the surrounding Arab States (except Jordan and Egypt) have exhibited since the literal day Israel was founded? What kind of blind hatred justifies such contempt for the good guys that it will cause you to support the terrorists? I just don't get it even though I'm an Arab who would like nothing more than to hold my ethnic line up as pillars and positive contributors to the world we all must share in order to survive and prosper as a race.

Qassam missiles are manufactured and deployed primarily in the Gaza Strip; however, the IDF has seized Qassam missiles in Palestinian areas of the West Bank.\n \n Palestinian terror groups prefer to use Qassam rockets as means of terrorizing Israelis because these rockets are easy to manufacture, their components are cheap and readily available, and it is simple to transport and operate them. Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip use elementary technology to produce large quantities of rockets, which give them the ability to attack the Israeli populace in the western Negev at any time, with the IDF unable to effectively respond. Because the rockets are small, Israeli officials have had difficulty shutting down its production. The IDF notes that 97% of the Qassam rockets are launched from civilian areas in Gaza, which limits the IDF response to the terrorists as civilians surround rocket launching pads. Mortar Shells\n \n Between 2001 and November 2007, more than 2,500 mortar shells were fired. Their short range made them effective before the disengagement, especially when they were aimed at the IDF forces which operated in the Gaza Strip and at the Israeli settlements there. In the absence of Israeli targets after the disengagement there was a sharp decrease in the number of rockets fired. \n \n Since April 2007 the terrorist organizations have begun to make greater use of mortar shells, especially Hamas, which does not directly participate in rocket fire. In recent months the fire has been aimed at IDF forces operating in the Gaza Strip and along the security fence, at the crossings (especially Kerem Shalom) and at the Israeli communities close to the security fence, such as Netiv Ha'asara, Kibbutz Kerem Shalom and Kibbutz Nahal Oz . \n \n Katuysha Rockets\n \n Although more rare, Katuysha rockets are occasionally fired from Gaza. Because the Katuysha rocket is much more advanced both in distance and design, Katuyshas have reached heavily populated Israeli cities like Ashkelon. Three Iranian-produced, 122mm Grad Katuysha rockets launched from Gaza have landed in both industrial and populated areas of Ashkelon in January 2008.\n \n Palestinian Terror Groups in Gaza\n \n Hamas: Produces the Qassam rocket (models 1, 2, 3), and is named after the terrorist organization's armed wing. Since Hamas's takeover of Gaza in mid-June 2007 to December 2007, there have been 475 missiles and 635 mortar shells launched at Israeli cities. Hamas rockets are identified by their red and green coloring.\n \n Palestinian Islamic Jihad: Islamic Jihad is affiliated with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and is believed to be funded by Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, the Al-Quds brigade fires Al-Quds rockets at Sderot and the Western Negev on a frequent basis. The Al-Quds rockets are identified by their red and yellow coloring.\n \n Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades: An armed military wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade frequently carries out rocket launches against Israel. In February 2008, the terrorist faction carried out a bombing attack in Dimona, in southern Israel. The Al-Aqsa rockets are identified by their yellow coloring with Arabic writing. The U.S. State department identifies Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades as a terrorist organization. \n \n Impact of Rocket Fire on Israeli Cities: Sderot and the Western Negev\n \n The Qassam rocket fire has had a terrible impact on the Western Negev region, especially on the city of Sderot. The city's population once numbered 24, 000 people. Today the population has fallen to an estimated 19,500, as over 4,000 residents have left. The following areas in Sderot have been considerably impacted by the seven years of rocket fire.\n \n SECURITY: Security in and around Sderot has been greatly affected. Because Sderot lies 2.5 kilometers (about one mile) away from the Western Negev, the city bears most of the brunt from the rocket hits. Since Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip in August 2005, Arab terrorists have increased the attacks, firing over 2500 Qassam rockets. Sderot and the western Negev today experiences on average three Qassam rocket attacks per day. During the last two weeks in the month of May 2007 during the supposed ceasefire, close to 300 Qassam rockets were fired on the town of Sderot.\n \n The Israeli government has installed a radar system or \"red alert alarm\" in an attempt to alert Israelis to possible shellings, though it does not sound on cold or rainy days when the radar cannot detect the rocket launches. In addition, the siren system cannot detect the launching of mortar shells. Once the rocket is launched from Gaza and the siren sounds, Sderot residents have 15 seconds to escape to a bomb shelter. In the year 2007 alone, 2000 Qassams were launched from Gaza to Sderot and the western Negev according to an IDF spokesman.\n \n MENTAL HEALTH: The mental health of Sderot residents has severely deteriorated over the past seven years as each rocket attack results in psychological turmoil. In the past year and a half more than 1,600 instances of stress were reported. Approximately 70% of Sderot residents suffer from signs of post traumatic stress disorder which include extreme stress and anxiety. According to a recent Natal report, between 70% to 94% of Sderot children show symptoms of PTSD. The Natal study found 28 percent of adults and 30 percent of children in Sderot actually have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n Approximately 3000 patient files have been opened in the Sderot Mental Health Center due to the rocket fire environment. In the year 2007 alone, 1,117 trauma victim files were opened, up significantly from 2006. Anxiety symptoms among children often include sleeping difficulties, nightmares, sweating, development regressions, wetting beds, and fear of the outside. There are only 4 psychologists on call in Sderot. Therefore, many Sderot trauma victims do not receive the proper, if any, psychological therapy and care.\n \n EDUCATION: The education in Sderot has been severely affected by the rocket attacks. Only 4 schools in Sderot offer complete buffer protection for students from rocket attacks. About 60% of the schools in Sderot do not have complete protection or buffers for their classrooms . In the past year, 1,100 kids have switched to schools outside of Sderot. Children in Sderot suffer from severe hyperactivity and have difficulty focusing in class. Grades on exams and tests have dropped, while aggressive behavior among students in class has increased. Only 56.5% of 12th grade students in Sderot received their matriculation certificates in 2001, as half the students failed due to the current state of rocket fire.",

   "why are you supporting the Jews? when they crucified Jesus didn't they?? :)\n\n \n First and foremost winston, I support the Jews because I have been following this issue since before color TV existed. And as a child I was seeing it through pro-moslem eyes. Not anti-jewish eyes mind you, because I had jewish friends whom I loved like brothers. But I was very aware of the Arab/Jewish animosity and followed every aspect of it closely with as open and objective a mind as possible because I wanted to know who was at fault.\n \n At every turn as the international community intervened to write up a peace treaty or a cease fire I watched as both sides signed, only to see the Arabs ALWAYS END UP BREAKING IT. I was a current events freak as a 12 year old kid who read 2 to 3 news papers a day, watched the news every night and listened to the radio in my dads car for everything reported pertaining to the middle east. Even my father would complain that the Palestinians would never make peace with Israel. I would demand he explain why and his only response was HATRED... \n \n Although my father also told me that when he lived in Damascus in the 30s, his best friend was a jewish kid who's parents socialized with my grand parents and they cared very much about each other. He said there was no animosity between arabs and jews anywhere in the middle east. Only when Israel became a Nation did this hatred awaken in islam. \n \n So although you would like to attribute my support of Israel to my christian faith, I was ashamed of arab prejudices long before I accepted Jesus. And my family has always been close to the jewish community in our town. \n \n As for the jews crucifying Jesus? Is that a reason to hate all Jews when I know that salvation came to the world by way of the Jew? And my Messiah was born a Jew? How could I love Jesus and hate the bloodline He came to redeem me through? \n \n How would you feel about me if you had in your ancestry a great grandfather who assassinated a world leader, would I have the right to reject and excoriate you because of your grandfathers crime? Would that be right? Of course not. So why would any true believer who is seeking to fulfill Gods commandment to love our neighbor hate jews today for the spiritual blindness of their ancestors? Or even hate them for their current spiritual blindness? \n \n The fact is that hating anyone for rejecting Jesus isn't the solution. That is why I stand so firmly against islam. Because all they promote is a gospel of hate and murder for anyone who rejects their belief system. And that is why I stand against you people so fervently who support them. Because you are supporting the devil himself which the teachings of islam represent. I don't defend Israel or claim in any way that she is perfect or a superior people to others in any way. \n \n But regarding who is right between Israel and the Palestinians? It's a no brainer. And anyone who denies that is deluding themselves. What boggles my mind is how people can be so blind to be fooled by the lies of a known terrorist group, and turn on a civilized society which only wants peace according to every sincere act toward peace they have ever offered. \n \n Are you aware that Israel got only one threatening warning from Jordan as this war started? Do you know what it was? Don't you dare send the Palestinians here if you evict them. Hows that for brotherly arab love? Or is it that Jordan knows the character of these people and wants nothing more to do with them.\n \n Google \"Black September\" and see the tens of thousands of Palestinians Jordan killed in one month back in the 70s, when after taking them in, Arafat/the PLO attempted a coup on that Country against the King of Jordan. The only way to stop them was to kill them and drive them out by force. So why should they be Israel's perpetual problem?",

First of all, each Palestinian family that was removed from the section of Palestine which was turned over to Israel was compensated for their property by the UN. Hundreds of thousands of them took their money and moved their families to other Countries, including the US, where they had family already established, or just chose to live.\n \n Secondly, it wasn't the jews that started the violence at all. It was the 6 combined Arab Countries in concert with the remaining Palestinians which simultaneously invaded this brand new Country literally 24 hours after the UN Mandate was made official and Israel formerly established her independence on May 14, 1948. \n \n In defending themselves against that invasion, even though they were massively out manned, out gunned and being hit from all sides at once, miraculously, according to every practical consideration, when the dust settled around February of 1949, this rag tag band of Jews had actually pushed back the Arab invaders and captured 2500 sq miles of land more than the UN had partitioned for them.\n \n Now, the precise goal of the Arab invaders was to either kill or drive every jew into the Sea, and take the land from them by force and in opposition to the UN Mandate which had been established one day before the invasion. Do you really have the nerve to condemn Israel for their miraculous accomplishment in not only surviving this illegal invasion, but gaining land from the invading Countries in the process? Is that the depth of your sense of justice and fair play? To once again blame the victims of the illegal attack for defeating the attackers is likened to blaming the victim of a mugging for fighting back and subduing the mugger. In every other aspect of rational thought, we would never even consider the criminal. \n \n But when it comes to Israel, the victim becomes the aggressor in this rewritten history, which is nothing more than the losers/invaders version. Also, consider that the same scenario was played out in 1967 during the 6 day war and in 1973 during the Yon Kippur war. In both of those wars Israel was attacked during Holidays when at least 2/3rds of their military personnel were home with their families. The Israeli's were caught completely off guard and unprepared. Yet in spite of being simultaneously invaded by the full forces of 6 Arab Countries in 67 whom they defeated in just 6 days, and by Syria and Egypt in 73 whom they rebuffed in just 3 days, they are seen as the problem by pro-terrorist pundits. You should be ashamed of yourself for holding such a warped sense of history and justice.\n \n If for no other reason, you should realize that God has proven His covenant to Abraham stands till this very day and no amount of human effort will ever defeat Israel. Here's a synopsis of the events which define the series of events Israel has dealt with in order to survive. And you will see that they were always acting defensively against foreign invasions and aggression.\n \n ^ http://www.fbgc.org/Studies/Miracle_of_Israel.pdf ^\n \n \n \nOwn up, the only reason endtimers want the \"Christ-killers\" there, is so they can get theirs on armageddon day.emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nThat is totally correct. According to them it is part of the 'final plan\" that Israel must exist for the plan to realise. Bush is one of those believers.\n so, for the sake of humanity let's be rid of Israel, for without Israel there is no possible end of the world in Biblical terms.\n \n Ask Archie he knows all the prophecies\n\n \n Again your ignorance of scripture and prophecy, not to mention a dismally shallow world view directs your distorted perspective of what Christians believe and why we believe as we do. But what must be first pointed out is that you are directly promoting another genocidal destruction of the Jewish people in the assumption that their annihilation will somehow preserve the world for the rest of us. And I erroneously thought you were pro-human rights. I guess that doesn't extend to Jewish people though, does it winston and penfold.\n \n Let me explain the facts from a believers perspective though; there is a huge difference between believing something will happen based on biblical prophecies and wanting them to happen. You seem to have this perverted vision of christians all over the world ringing their hands as they pray for Armageddon to come to us in all of its destruction and gore. That is ridiculous at every level of rationality. We pray for Gods patience with humanity in the hope that we will get past our tribal differences and learn to live according to His Holy Principles.\n \n We pray for Israel, that the spiritual scales will be removed from the eyes of the Jews as prophecy say's they will be in the last day's, and that they will finally recognize Jesus as Messiah. And we don't pray for the world to end, but do pray for the Lords return according to His will and perfect timing. We also don't have to pray for Israel's survival because we are aware of Gods covenant with her and know that no power on Earth can destroy her, I'm sure to your great disappointment. \n \n We do pray for the survival of the USA and that God wont withdraw His grace from us because of our open rebellion against His principles which all of the opposition on this thread for example, is evidence of regarding the spiritual condition of this generation.\n \n To summarize, Israel's survival isn't a requirement for the Lords return, it's a promise that Israel will survive even though by that time, 2/3rds of the world will have been destroyed through war, natural catastrophe and pestilence. But Israel will survive as a Nation and a people until the final day of this Age of grace and the Lords return.",

Can you explain or justify that inconsistency and blatant hypocrisy in your assessment of the situation? \n \n \nAnd you still haven't answered my question.

Israel never had a military presence in the early days of the partition at all. The Palestinian land was occupied and overseen by the Palestinians. Even when Gaza was returned to Palestinian control a few years ago, Israel had no military presence there which is evident by the constant rockets fired from there. Had their been an oppressive military presence in Gaza those thousands rocket attacks wouldn't have been possible. \n \n So your claims are fallacious on all counts. The only question that remains for me is if your ignorance is willful or just based on buying into the rewritten history and lies of the Arab propaganda? In which case you need to find more honest sources for the actual history of the events which have led to the loss of the Palestinians freedom of movement into Israeli occupied lands in recent years.

Follow the exchange below, and notice my response to winny said \"neither, it WAS pork\". The fact is that Jews don't have to follow any of the food or dietary restrictions which they still follow today. The need ended with the advent of this Age of Grace. Are Christians Kosher today? Do they worry about blended fabrics or making sure that the blood is drained from animals? Not at all.

You post a link of, oh, let's say the 1995 Oslo Accord, like this one for example: Oslo Accords - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Then from within that link you produce a map which reflects the partition at the time, like this one: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Is-wb-gs-gh_v3.png with zoom in capability for your viewing pleasure.\n \n Notice that your map doesn't reflect the actual size of the West bank at all and because you post no supporting explanation at all, gives the impression that the lost land from the original partition was just stolen by Israel rather than being captured in the course of Israel pushing back foreign invasions in the course of defending themselves.

   "Why can Palestinians not vote in all of their own land?\n\n \n Here is how there electoral system works. It is quite different than ours but was established by the Palestinians themselves which is the relevant point of fact. Note the bolded. The colored sections of the map you posted represents the electoral districts based on populations in those area's. The uncolored sections represent undeveloped land within the Palestinian territory. They don't represent Israeli occupied land at all as the black boundary line on your linked map confirms. Also, you can match up the names on the list below with the map I posted to see that they coincide with the highlighted sections on your electoral map. \n Electoral system:\n The previous elections chose 88 PLC members from several multimember constituencies via block voting. In advance of the 2006 elections, Palestinian electoral law was changed to expand the PLC from 88 to 132 seats and create a degree of proportional representation via a parallel voting system.\n Each voter receives two ballots. On the first, the voter chooses one of several nationwide party lists. 66 of the PLC seats are distributed proportionally (in accordance with the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method) to those lists that receive more than 2 % of the total list votes; if a list receives six seats, then the six candidates at the top of the list are elected to the PLC. Each list must include at least one woman in the first three names, at least one woman in the next four names, and at least one woman in the five names that follow.\n The second ballot is for the voter's local constituency. The voter can cast up to as many votes for individual candidates as there are seats in his or her constituency. Votes are unweighted, and top-vote getters are elected to the PLC. For example, a voter in the Nablus district could cast up to six votes; the six candidates with the highest vote totals are elected.\n In some constituencies, one or two seats are set aside for the Christian candidates with the most votes. For instance, in Ramallah, a five-seat constituency, the Christian candidate with the most votes will be elected to the PLC, even if he or she is not among top five candidates overall. The six seats reserved for Christians are considered the minimum quota for their representation in the council. [1].\n The number of seats each electoral district receives is determined by its population; the breakdown is as follows: [2]\n \n Jerusalem: 6 seats (2 reserved for Christians)\n Tubas: 1 seat\n Tulkarm: 3 seats\n Qalqilya: 2 seats\n Salfit: 1 seat\n Nablus: 6 seats\n Jericho: 1 seat\n Ramallah: 5 seats (1 reserved for Christians)\n Jenin: 4 seats\n Bethlehem: 4 seats (2 reserved for Christians)\n Hebron: 9 seats\n North Gaza: 5 seats\n Gaza: 8 seats (1 reserved for Christians)\n Deir al-Balah: 3 seats\n Khan Younis: 5 seats\n Rafah: 3 seats\n Total: 66 seats (6 reserved for Christians)\n \n My personal feelings are that this method of voting is corrupted from the get go and I think, rife for abuse. I base that opinion on this sentence. The voter can cast up to as many votes for individual candidates as there are seats in his or her constituency. Votes are unweighted, and top-vote getters are elected to the PLC. For example, a voter in the Nablus district could cast up to six votes; the six candidates with the highest vote totals are elected. In our system of electing representative, we have only one vote even if there are 5 candidates running in that particular race. That is fair and equitable for all candidates. By allowing me 5 separate votes for my candidate if 5 seats are up in that race, a particular party could promote the one they want and each of the members of their respective party will have 5 votes to push their pre-chosen candidate through to victory. I suggest that this is how Hamas won so many seats the first time they ever got involved in the political arena.",

   "I'm posting the opening post of this thread again just to end this thread the way it started. On topic, with the original message clearly posted for anyone who searches out this subject.\n \n I'm posting this in response to the main stream media bias which persists in blaming Israel for finally defending itself against the unwarranted indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas over the past number of years. The fact is the Palestinians have complete control over the outcome of this war by simply choosing to live in peace with its neighbors who have compromised to their own detriment in the attempt of accomplishing a lasting peace.\n \n What must also be accepted by all, and shouted from the rooftops is that it is hamas who is placing civilians in harms way by placing them directly in the line of fire as they sacrifice them at the alter of the propaganda war they are promoting against Israel. And what is most poignant is the fact that each and every time the leftist media justifies their actions of placing women and children in shelters from which they then draws fire on them just for their propaganda value as dead victims of an avoidable war, that same media encourages these actions which the militants have no reason to stop since they are getting the results they set out to accomplish. Unless the truth of what these militant hate mongers represent is told, then they have no reason not to continue the lies and dishonest tactics of claiming to want peace as they do everything in their power to promote war.\n \n Islamic radicals are a minority in islam, that is undeniably true. But as long as they have the guns and the motivation to use innocent civilians as human shields, and as long as they are willing to sacrifice their own citizens to the alter of propaganda it will continue to be impossible to negotiate peace with them since their sole reason for existing isn't to accomplish peace but is to destroy Israel. When will the West learn to understand the mind of this enemy? \n \n We ignore the reality of what their true agenda is at our own peril. And in our denial, we actually condemn the one Country that is attempting to take the blinders off and face their enemy openly and honestly by fighting back finally, after years, and thousands of rockets have been indiscriminately fired at their population; each one accompanied by a prayer to allah that it kill innocent civilians. \n \n I pray for Israel today, and will continue to pray for her until she is able to cleanse the land of the scourge that radical islam represents as it threatens her right to exist. And you know what? I'll bet that there are tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians who know and understand the evil which dwells in their midst are also praying for Israel and the IDF. But unfortunately for these voiceless Palestinians, they too understand that the leftist media which buys into and promotes Hamas propaganda will never report that truth of which side they truly fear. \n \n THE DEMONS OF GAZA\n ONLY HAMAS IS TO BLAME FOR THE WAR; ONLY THE PALESTINIANS CAN STOP ITJanuary 10, 2009\n \n Israel hasn't killed a single civilian in the Gaza Strip. Over a hundred civilians have died, and Israeli bombs or shells may have ended their lives. But Israel didn't kill them.\n \n Hamas did.\n \n It's time to smash the lies. The lies of Hamas. The UN lies. And the save-the-terrorists lies of the global media.\n \n There is no moral equivalence between Hamas terrorists and Israeli soldiers. There is no gray area. There is no point in negotiations.\n \n Hamas is a Jew-killing machine. It exists to destroy Israel. What is there to negotiate?\n \n When Hamas can't kill Jews, it's perfectly willing to drive Palestinian civilians into the line of fire - old men, women and children. Hamas herds the innocent into \"shelters,\" then draws Israeli fire on them. And the headline-greedy media cheer them on.\n \n Hamas isn't fighting for political goals. \"Brokered agreements\" are purely means to an end. And the envisioned end is the complete destruction of Israel in the name of a terrorist god. Safe in hidden bunkers or in Damascus, the Hamas leadership is willing to watch an unlimited number of civilians and even street-level terrorists die.\n \n MORE: 13 THINKERS ON WHAT ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIANS AND THE WORLD SHOULD DO\n \n Lives, too, are nothing but means to an end. And dead kids are the coins that keep the propaganda meter ticking.\n \n All Hamas had to do to prevent Israel's act of self-defense was to leave Israel unmolested by terror rockets. All Hamas needs to do now to stop this conflict and spare the Palestinian people it pretends to champion is to stop trying to kill Israelis and agree to let Israel exist in peace.\n \n Hamas didn't, and Hamas won't.\n \n Now Israel has to continue its attack, to wreak all the havoc it can on Hamas before a new American president starts meddling. If Israel stops now, Hamas can declare victory just for surviving - despite its crippling losses. While it's impossible to fully eliminate extremism, killing every terrorist leader hiding in a Gaza bunker is the only hope of achieving even a temporary, imperfect peace. The chance may not come again.\n \n And don't worry about \"creating a power vacuum.\" Let the Palestinians pick up their own pieces. Even anarchy in Gaza is better for Israel than Hamas.\n \n Israelis, Americans and Westerners overall share a tragic intellectual blind spot: We're caught in yesterday's model of terrorism, that of Arafat's PLO, of the IRA, the Red Brigades or the Weather Underground. But, as brutal as those organizations could be, they never believed they were on a mission from God. \n \n Yesteryear's terrorists wanted to change the world. They were willing to shed blood and, in extreme cases, to give their own blood to their causes. But they didn't seek death. They preferred to live to see their \"better world.\"\n \n Now our civilization faces terrorists who regard death as a promotion. They believe that any action can be excused because they're serving their god. And their core belief is that you and I, as stubborn unbelievers, deserve death.\n \n Their grisly god knows no compromise. To give an inch is to betray their god's trust entirely. Yet we - and even some Israelis - believe it's possible to cut deals with them.\n \n In search of peace, Israel handed Gaza to the Palestinians, a people who had never had a state of their own. As thanks, Israel received terror rockets. And the Palestinian people got a gang war.\n \n Peace is the last thing Hamas terrorists and gangsters want. Peace means the game is up. Peace means they've disappointed their god. Peace means no more excuses. They couldn't bear peace for six months.\n \n This is a war to the bitter end. And we're afraid to admit what it's about.\n \n MORE: WHAT IS NEXT FOR GAZA\n \n It's not about American sins or Israeli intransigence. It's about a sickness in the soul of a civilization - of Middle-Eastern Islam - that can only be cured from within. Until Arabs or Iranians decide to cure themselves, we'll have to fight.\n \n Instead, we want to talk. We convince ourselves, against all evidence, that our enemies really want to talk, too, that they just need \"incentives\" (the diplomat's term for bribes). The apparent belief of our president-elect that it's possible to negotiate with faith-fueled fanatics is so naive it's terrifying.\n PAGE 1 2 3 CONTINUE READING <\n THE DEMONS OF GAZA - New York Post",

   "Premillennialism refers to the apocalyptic vision many Christians hold of the Last Days, the final war between God and Satan which will end our world as we know it. It is known as the battle of Armageddon. Premillennialism was a theory put forward by a gentleman named John Nelson Darby ( 1800-1882). Darby believed the bible to be literally true, the inerrant word of God. According to Darby, historic time in the bible can be divided up into what he refers to as \"dispensations.\" During each of these dispensations, of which there are seven, humans have been given laws set forth by God under which they are to lead their lives, and in each instance they have failed. Because of their pre-disposition towards wicked behavior, God has been forced to punish his creatures in some way. The Fall, the Flood and the crucifixion of Christ are all seen as \"dispensations\". We are now in the sixth dispensation which is considered the 'penultimate\" dispensation.\n \n \n \n According to this worldview, the Antichrist (the False Redeemer) will return before the end as predicted by St .Paul in II Thessalonians 2: 3-8. This Antichrist will deceive the world, he will be quite charismatic and many will be fooled by him. To be even more devious he may appear as a \"peacemaker.\" So, most Fundamentalists who subscribe to this theology are highly suspect of anyone who preaches peace. War is inevitable and must come to pass before Christ will appear. Here is where it gets tricky, although this trickster, the Antichrist, will make noises about being a peacemaker, he will eventually wage war and Christians will find themselves being persecuted. Notice how often they claim they are being persecuted in our country right now. No matter how hard they try to shove their beliefs down our throats we resist, therefore they are being persecuted, hence the prophesy is correct. .\n \n \n \n Christ will come to the rescue and a great battle will ensue between Christ and Satan on the plain of Armageddon outside of Jerusalem; at this time the seventh dispensation will begin. I kid you not, there are Christians buying up real estate near Armageddon so they will have a front row seat for the big day. Here's the good part, the faithful, those who have been saved in Christ, or\" born again,\" will be taken up into heaven, referred to as the Rapture. The rest of us the unsaved Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Jews will be left to suffer through the rough times. Ever wonder why Christians are so obsessed with \"saving\" people. The more the merrier, and it's for our own good after all.\n \n \n \n Tim LeHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have written a series of books referred to as the \"Left Behind\" series. These novels depict the Last Days and have been immensely popular, selling millions of copies. In this series the Rapture is graphically described, pilots of airplanes will suddenly be raptured up leaving the plane without a pilot ( the co-pilot too, presumably) to crash and burn taking all the unsaved with it. Husbands will wake up to a bodiless nightgown, because their wife was one of the \"saved,\" perhaps the children will be gone too, except the teenagers of course. Cars will become driverless careening down the road killing other sinners and Buddhists or Jews, whatever. This is not a story to them, this is literally what they believe. This belief informs their worldview and their political decisions.\n \n \n \n The Jews have a special role to play in this End of Days drama. First it was necessary for them to inhabit the land of Israel again- this would be a sign that the end days were upon us. This happened in 1948 with the Balfour Declaration. Other events such as the six-day war in 1967, the Gulf War in 1991 and the Sept.11 attacks have all fed the fires of their prophetic doomsday expectations. The most important sign, however, is the rebuilding of the Temple. The site for this new Temple is already occupied, unfortunately, by one of the holiest sites in Islam, the Temple Mount, the location of the al-Aqsa Mosque. Which means, well, you get the picture.

   "Premillennialism refers to the apocalyptic vision many Christians hold of the Last Days, the final war between God and Satan which will end our world as we know it. It is known as the battle of Armageddon. Premillennialism was a theory put forward by a gentleman named John Nelson Darby ( 1800-1882). Darby believed the bible to be literally true, the inerrant word of God. According to Darby, historic time in the bible can be divided up into what he refers to as \"dispensations.\" During each of these dispensations, of which there are seven, humans have been given laws set forth by God under which they are to lead their lives, and in each instance they have failed. Because of their pre-disposition towards wicked behavior, God has been forced to punish his creatures in some way. The Fall, the Flood and the crucifixion of Christ are all seen as \"dispensations\". We are now in the sixth dispensation which is considered the 'penultimate\" dispensation.\n \n \n \n According to this worldview, the Antichrist (the False Redeemer) will return before the end as predicted by St .Paul in II Thessalonians 2: 3-8. This Antichrist will deceive the world, he will be quite charismatic and many will be fooled by him. To be even more devious he may appear as a \"peacemaker.\" So, most Fundamentalists who subscribe to this theology are highly suspect of anyone who preaches peace. War is inevitable and must come to pass before Christ will appear. Here is where it gets tricky, although this trickster, the Antichrist, will make noises about being a peacemaker, he will eventually wage war and Christians will find themselves being persecuted. Notice how often they claim they are being persecuted in our country right now. No matter how hard they try to shove their beliefs down our throats we resist, therefore they are being persecuted, hence the prophesy is correct. .\n \n \n \n Christ will come to the rescue and a great battle will ensue between Christ and Satan on the plain of Armageddon outside of Jerusalem; at this time the seventh dispensation will begin. I kid you not, there are Christians buying up real estate near Armageddon so they will have a front row seat for the big day. Here's the good part, the faithful, those who have been saved in Christ, or\" born again,\" will be taken up into heaven, referred to as the Rapture. The rest of us the unsaved Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Jews will be left to suffer through the rough times. Ever wonder why Christians are so obsessed with \"saving\" people. The more the merrier, and it's for our own good after all.\n \n \n \n Tim LeHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have written a series of books referred to as the \"Left Behind\" series. These novels depict the Last Days and have been immensely popular, selling millions of copies. In this series the Rapture is graphically described, pilots of airplanes will suddenly be raptured up leaving the plane without a pilot ( the co-pilot too, presumably) to crash and burn taking all the unsaved with it. Husbands will wake up to a bodiless nightgown, because their wife was one of the \"saved,\" perhaps the children will be gone too, except the teenagers of course. Cars will become driverless careening down the road killing other sinners and Buddhists or Jews, whatever. This is not a story to them, this is literally what they believe. This belief informs their worldview and their political decisions.\n \n \n \n The Jews have a special role to play in this End of Days drama. First it was necessary for them to inhabit the land of Israel again- this would be a sign that the end days were upon us. This happened in 1948 with the Balfour Declaration. Other events such as the six-day war in 1967, the Gulf War in 1991 and the Sept.11 attacks have all fed the fires of their prophetic doomsday expectations. The most important sign, however, is the rebuilding of the Temple. The site for this new Temple is already occupied, unfortunately, by one of the holiest sites in Islam, the Temple Mount, the location of the al-Aqsa Mosque. Which means, well, you get the picture. Both Christians and Jews believe this re-building of the Temple must happen before the Messiah returns. The difference lies is the aftermath; in the Christian version, two thirds of the Jews will not be \"saved\" and will perish, the rest will \"accept\" Jesus as the Messiah or burn in hell with the rest of the \"unsaved.\" The security around this Mosque remains very tight as there are many fundamentalists, both Jewish and Christian who would like to help the prophesy come true in a timely manner.

They are doomed to burn in hell anyway, unless they convert. Jews are part of the story but it's really only about the \"saved\" Christians in the end.\n\n \n The least you could have done is find an accurate theological source for defining what christians believe regarding the last days, not a political hit piece against Bush. And why didn't you give the link to your source? Do you actually think anyone would believe you authored this? It's Armageddon time; Bush and his loyal Christian fundamentalists want you to have a front row seat! (Whether you want one or not).\n \n And since you're attributing this belief system to me, let me say that what we believe is from the bible, not Darby who just offered his interpretation of what the bible says. I don't believe, for example, that the rapture will pull christians out of the world prior to the antichrist declaring war on humanity and persecuting christians. The rapture wont occur until the very end of the Trib when the last trumpet blows and every eye will see the Lord return with His army to destroy evil.\n \n Which follows that I don't believe Christians in America are being persecuted today at all, yet. When that day comes, they will be beheaded for refusing to receive the mark of the beast. Also, the 7 year tribulation period will be a time of natural catastrophe, pestilence and upheaval the likes that man has never seen. \n \n Also, you might want to minimize the importance of Israel becoming a Nation once again after 1900 years in dispersion, but it was the seminal event which warned of the beginning of the end times and the return of Messiah. That you as a humanist are blind to these facts does nothing to nullify the truth which the biblical prophecies represent. This doesn't mean that christians believe the tribulation period has started yet or that we pray for the violence and war to begin in order to hasten the Lords return. I personally pray for Gods protective hand and His grace to remain in continuing patience so that what the bible promises will happen will be delayed.\n \n And if you understood what the bible truly describes will take place during the last 3 1/2 of the tribulation period, you'd be praying for that also rather than mocking the idea that it will ever take place at all.",

But as a people, Gods covenant with them is faithful and sure. Before the end, Israel will realize her error and finally receive Messiah. This doesn't mean all Jews will learn and accept the truth, but many will. \n \n So it is no different than many gentiles who call themselves christians but have no awareness or relationship with the living God. I find it interesting that you are so worried about the salvation of others when you should be concerned about your own salvation before judging their spiritual condition.\n \n \nI want to have a front seat, do you know how much a front seat will be? Can I buy some land in Armageddon?\n\n \n Just remain as you are and you will have a front seat, but bring a fan as it will be very warm. As for buying land in the valley of Megiddo, only someone who is spiritually suicidal would want to own land in the location of the worlds final war where it is prophesied that the blood will rise to the bridle of a war horse.
