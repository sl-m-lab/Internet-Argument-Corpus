It might be more productive if these debates were concentrated into one thread (like the Catholic one).\n \n To start, here are a couple of questions:\n\n \n \n1. Why do JWs believe that 1914 was the release of the Beast?\n\n He was already around, 1914 was the year he was imprisoned to the earth.\n \n2. Why do JWs believe that Jesus is really Michael the Archangel?\n\n QUOTED FROM 'REASONING FROM THE SCRIPTURES' Watchtower Bible and Tract Society(WBTS)\n Is Jesus Christ the same person as Michael the archangel?\n The name of this Michael appears only five times in the Bible. The glorious spirit person who bears the name is referred to as \"one of the chief princes,\" \"the great prince who has charge of your [Daniel's] people,\" and as \"the archangel.\" (Dan. 10:13; 12:1; Jude 9, RS) Michael means \"Who Is Like God?\" The name evidently designates Michael as the one who takes the lead in upholding Jehovah's sovereignty and destroying God's enemies.\n At 1 Thessalonians 4:16 (RS), the command of Jesus Christ for the resurrection to begin is described as \"the archangel's call,\" and Jude 9 says that the archangel is Michael. Would it be appropriate to liken Jesus' commanding call to that of someone lesser in authority? Reasonably, then, the archangel Michael is Jesus Christ. (Interestingly, the expression \"archangel\" is never found in the plural in the Scriptures, thus implying that there is only one.)\n Revelation 12:7-12 says that Michael and his angels would war against Satan and hurl him and his wicked angels out of heaven in connection with the conferring of kingly authority on Christ. Jesus is later depicted as leading the armies of heaven in war against the nations of the world. (Rev. 19:11-16) Is it not reasonable that Jesus would also be the one to take action against the one he described as \"ruler of this world,\" Satan the Devil? (John 12:31) Daniel 12:1 (RS) associates the 'standing up of Michael' to act with authority with \"a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time.\" That would certainly fit the experience of the nations when Christ as heavenly executioner takes action against them. So the evidence indicates that the Son of God was known as Michael before he came to earth and is known also by that name since his return to heaven where he resides as the glorified spirit Son of God.\n \n3. What is the basis for predicting when Jesus returns?\n\n Prophecy!\n \n4. Why does the Watchtower Version of the Bible differ from other common translations?\n\n Because the others are common and ours is, er. Better. emoticon_xgood \n \n5. Why do JWs go door-to-door for witnessing, though they do not seem to support overseas missionary work?\n\n We go door to door because we are following the pattern set. Acts 20:20. We also do overseas missionary work. Matthew 24:14. In 235 lands.\n \n May I ask which church you belong to???",

For example, ours is Martin Luther because he questioned the Catholic Church and ended up causing a split that became the Lutheran Church (he really didn't want to cause a split, or for it to be named after him).\n\n \n 1. We at first was part of the status quo major religions then we realized they did not practice Christian love during the war years for all the countries in world war 1 outside were mostly Christian and shouldn't be murdering. Then when they locked up the heads of the watchtower with 20-year (they were later cleared) sentences in America of all places it was official. The Roman Empire was never holy. It hated Christians that did not change until Constantine's mother introduced him to Christianity that he used as a political tool later in life.\n \n 2. Michael is not a Christian name. It means, \"Who is like God\". Jesus means \"Jehovah Is Salvation\". Jesus already had another name in the bible Immanuel \"With Us Is God\". If \"who is like God\" is not a legitimate description of Jesus I don't know what is. It is a Hebrew tradition to rename people when something supernatural happens to them. Like Serai to Sarah, Abram to Abraham, Saul to Paul.\n \n 3. Okay yes this is not what we claim happened in 1914. We have dissected the book of Daniel, Isaiah and revelations to a 4 act play almost. Satan is pushed out of heaven (1914), Satan tries to total subjugate all worship (unknown), Jesus will destroy the wicked (unknown), Satan is released and then executed (1000 or so years later).\n \n 4. No \"1.The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in eleven caves along the northwest shore of the Dead Sea between the years 1947 and 1956. http://www.centuryone.com/25dssfacts.html\n \n The NWT was issued out in I believe 6 volumes one every few years. It ended in 1960. Most people don't know the bible is relatively new in the long history of the watchtower. People that claim we made our own bible to base our beliefs on are chronologically ignorant. We did fine for years with out it.\n \n Nobody out side of Jesus is seen as the founder of our faith. C.T. Russell founded the watchtower, but the watchtower is a non-profit bible society. The only thing that we base our faith on is the bible. Jehovah's Witnesses was a name coined at a speech in 1931. We liked it so it stuck. The reason we can't point to Russell is almost all of his personal believes are non biblical. Also JW doctrine is in a constant state of flux. Since we only have the bible to go on and don't believe in any magical succession or authority from God nothing is sacred unlike other religions. \n \n People will tell you tones of stuff the watchtower has said in the past as attempt to damage our credibility. The truth is Jehovah's witnesses are so cynical they don't believe they have credibility out side of the bible and know the watchtower will change. People say we are dogmatic but if that were the case we would actually have a dogma to stick to. Look at Rape for example. The watchtowers opinion of what rape means has been ping pronged for almost over 30 years (just like western society btw). The reason is the ancient definition rape is vastly different than the modern one. Some literalist (every organization has them) in the watchtower want to keep the ancient (biblical) one while progressives will want to use the civil definition. I am sure most watchtowers in the last 15 are probably using the more politically correct definition.\n \n The watchtower was a neutral at first a generic multi denominational Christian organization until 1919. It was mostly trumped up to fight evolution, predestination, and hellfire (noble causes IMO which it still fights). As it went on it began to side mostly with secular scholars. Most of what people think of as the Christian faith was made up way after Jesus died. People in most denominations feel two ways: people that don't believe what they do are tools of Satan, or their traditional beliefs are harmless.",

   "I am not going to make any friends with this post, but here goes.\n \n The New World Translation of the Bible is a bad translation. It is not dead on wrong, but most ancient language scholars agree it's bad and is riddled with error.\n \n The reason for this is simple. There was no weird agenda on the part of the translators to do this. Their belief and interest in the Bible is sincere, however they were not qualified. The Watchtower Society has never 'officially' released the names of the translators, but the information has leaked and is available. One the Franz's was amongst them. It was a team of five men, only one them had any formal training in the ancient languages the Bible was written in - and then only in Greek. Bottom line is that the translation is bad because the translators did not have the knowledge to do the work. \n \n I actually know a lot of Witnesses and studied with them at length (never baptized). Even though I disagree strongly with how the organization is structured and run, they are some of the most sincere Bible students I have ever encountered and they do walk their talk.",

   "This seems plasible, but Jehovah does not care about technology.\n\n Absolutely! The scriptures say that nothing was unattainable for them, which means they were a very advanced people, and who knows given another 5 or 6 hundred years maybe they could have even harnessed electricity or discovered fossil fuels or something like that (If they hadn't already). They were just as intelligent as we are today, and with an extended longevity these advancements may have come even sooner.\n Jehovah realised their capabilities and had to act otherwise if that world had of reached the same level of technology as we have today then surely Armageddon would have had to happen sooner also. It seems very often that technological advancement causes pollution of the natural environment even destruction in the most severe cases, so in keeping with his will for man to \"fill the earth and subdue it\" he would have had to intervene at THAT time. Which could have meant no chance of life generations later for you and I, but out of the need for justice and fairness he had to intervene by confusing their language to slow the pace down until the time was right. Like now! \n That's my thought on the subject that is very apart from the Bible so don't take it as truth. I'm just playing with the space allowed by the Bible.\n \nMore likely their wide spread communication skills would have supressed true religion. I think that demonstrating you don't trust God will keep his word is a large enought offense.\n\n I also think that their being of one language may have lessened any possible culture clashes between the different peoples of that time and thus a more peaceful world, leaving the door wide open for technological advancement rather than warfare. Although warfare has often forced advancement I hope you'll see my point.",

But the fact that he can listen to a certain station does not mean that he does. He must first turn on the radio and then select the station. Likewise, Jehovah has the ability to foreknow events, but the Bible shows that he makes selective and discretionary use of that ability, with due regard for the free will with which he has endowed his human creation.-Compare Genesis 22:12; 18:20, 21.\n There are many verses that show God's restraint in laying out before everyone exactly what is to occur, but this doesn't mean he cannot do it if he wants.\n \n \ni cant see how its logical for JWs to believe that God is up in heaven sometimes, and on earth for visits when he can,\n\n When has he ever literally been present on earth? If he made all the stars and atoms then logically he must equal them in some way, Jehovah has glory and brilliance beyond the ability of human sight to endure,\n Ex 33:20 \"no man may see [God] and yet live.\"\n Only the angels, spirit creatures, have vision that can behold his face in a literal sense. (Mt 18:10; Lu 1:19) In the book of Revelation the apostle John had a vision that approximated seeing God, in the sense that it revealed the effect of beholding him on his throne. God was not like a man in appearance, for he has not revealed any figure of his to man, as John himself said later: \"No man has seen God at any time.\" (Joh 1:18) Rather, God was shown to be like highly polished gems, precious, glowing, beautiful, that attract the eye and win delighted admiration. He was \"in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone, and round about the throne there [was] a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.\" (Re 4:3) Thus, he is lovely in appearance and pleasant to look at, causing one to lose oneself in wonderment. (Most of the above was cut and pasted from a JW's publication.)\n Basically if God was to literally come to earth then the whole planet would disintegrate, he's too powerful. \n \nbut a lot of what the JWs believe seem to be twisted interpretations.\n Like?",

Since effort is required on the part of the individuals, it must be the class that is foreordained. God purposed that the entire class would conform to the pattern set by Jesus Christ. Those selected by God to be part of that class, however, must prove faithful if they are actually to attain the reward set before them.)\n Eph. 1:4, 5: \"He chose us in union with him [Jesus Christ] before the founding of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love. For he foreordained us to the adoption through Jesus Christ as sons to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.\" (It is noteworthy that, at Luke 11:50, 51, Jesus parallels \"the founding of the world\" with the time of Abel. Abel is the first human who continued to have God's favor throughout his life. Thus, it was after the rebellion in Eden but before the conception of Abel that God formed his purpose to produce a \"seed\" through which deliverance would be provided. [Gen. 3:15] God purposed that associated with the principal Seed, Jesus Christ, would be a group of his faithful followers who would share with him in a new government over the earth, the Messianic Kingdom.)

Judas was hand picked by Jesus himself, but still turned away. so did Peter, although he repented. and look at pharoah, if you think blindness is a wake up call (in Paul's case) think about getting your entire kingdom plagued and then losing your first born child. but that still didnt make him change his ways\n \n I still dont believe God selects a few people to go to heaven. if going to heaven is solely up to God then probably 2 Peter 3:9 is just a lie (God is \"not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\") because why would God say he wants all men to come to repentance and at the same time close the door indefinitely to the majority of the world population. does that make sense?\n\n \n Because we spit in God's face everytime we sin.

Or does it mean that, instead of having a lowly body of flesh, they will be clothed with a glorious spirit body when raised to heavenly life? Let the following scripture answer.)\n 1 Cor. 15:40, 42-44, 47-50: \"There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort. So also is the resurrection of the dead. . . . It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. . . . The first man [Adam] is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man [Jesus Christ] is out of heaven. As the one made of dust is, so those made of dust are also; and as the heavenly one is, so those who are heavenly are also. And just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one. However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom.\" (There is no allowance here for any mixing of the two sorts of bodies or the taking of a fleshly body to heaven.)\n Luke 22:69\n 1 Corinthians 8:6\n This verse goes against what your trying to prove, it denotes two separate individuals!!!\n John 21:14\n Are you suggesting that spirit creatures cannot materialise to be seen by humans?\n Matthew 1:18\n Are you sure this has something to do with being 200% god-man?\n Acts 9:20-31\n So he's God's son, not God himself.\n Acts 17:23-31 \n Very poor, he was preaching to the Athenians about almighty God not Jesus.\n John 5:25-32, 39\n Verse 26, Shows the father having authority over the Son.\n Verse 27, the same authority is given to the son.\n Verse 30, well, this clinches it really showing the son doing only what the father wants him to.\n Verse 31,32, no God-man here!!\n John 5:22-23\n Verse 22, Again it is clear to all those that let it be that the father holds compleate control over the son he is his boss.\n Verse 23, \"he that does not honour the son does not honour the father that sent him\" So once again the father holds authority over the son to such an extent that he sent him to the earth to be killed.\n \n Sandycane,\n John, 1.1\n \"In the begining was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"\n not all bibles would agree with that translation because they know it doesn't make sense, it contradicts itself. \n Revelation, 19.13\n \"He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His title was the Word of God.\"\n I don't know if you saw the reason why I asked Archimedes for some scriptural evidence but it was to prove the false assumption of a god-man, this verse doesn't it says Jesus was God's messenger. \n Revelation, 1.7,8\n \"Look! He comes with the clouds of heaven. And everyone will see Him- even those who pierced Him. And all the nations of the earth will weep because of Him. Yes! Amen! \"I am the Alpha and the Omega- the begining and the end,\" says the Lord God. \"I am the one who is, who always was, and is still to come, the Almighty One.\"\n oh dear! Take a look at the context of the verse that your attempting to rip out of context, rev. 1:1 says the revelation was give by God to Jesus to the angles then to John, so at time God is speaking and sometimes Jesus, so looking again at your verse;\n Revelation 1:7-8\n 7 Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him. Yes, Amen.\n So this is talking of Jesus.\n 8 \"I am the Al'pha and the O\u00b7me'ga,\" says Jehovah(Or the Lord God in your Bible) God, \"the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.\"\n And this part is talking of the Almighty one, you should take more care of the grammar.\n .Isaih, 9.6\n \"For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. And the government will rest on His shoulders. These will be His royal titles: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\"\n Absolutely! but I think you miss the point that Jesus is never referred to in the scriptures as ALMIGHTY God, humans are referred to as gods and that doesn't make them almighty does it??? \"Everlasting father\" simply means that he has replaced Adam as our father by coming and paying the ransom for us.",

Just like individual soldiers don't know if they will return home JWs don't know if they are saved until its over.

Okay maybe you are not catholic so you don't know what homoousion is. The \"same substance\" or \"same nature\" is what the teaching of the trinity is.

Montalban is Greek Orthodox Maximus is Catholic. Their respective religions believe in apostolic succession. Meaning they can basically add to the bible with impunity through other ecumenical texts. One is the Nicene creed. This is the creed that made the trinity an \"official\" Christian doctrine for the \"all\" Christendom. Everyone else that did not acknowledge it got their butts kicked. Every time heretics (or Jews/Muslims) raise up more creeds are written explicitly defining or refining the trinity. For them believing that the trinity is eternal is fine and the papers just \"clarify\" what is not in the bible. So ecumenical faiths just cite a bunch of holy decrees by roundtables of bishops (see link above). \n \n I think Protestants sects have a problem because it seems sort of silly running back to the old church for answers. So they try to \"prove it\" with the bible. You can't unless you change the bible which most did (no problem with that religiously speaking for its your faith). It is not necessary to run to the bible, and to try to make it fit. In reality Jesus was a glorified Jew. Jews wrote the bible. Jews don't have a trinity.

   " Sandycane\n Mainly for study I use the 'New World Translation' published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract society, although I do have an assortment of different bibles to use I prefer this one because it has been tested to hold to a more sincere translation rather that allowing tradition and creed to creep in.\n Foreword\n IT IS a very responsible thing to translate the Holy Scriptures from their original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek into modern speech. Translating the Holy Scriptures means rendering into another language the thoughts and sayings of Jehovah God, the heavenly Author of this sacred library of sixty-six books that holy men of long ago were inspired to write down for our benefit today.\n That is a very sobering thought. The translators of this work, who fear and love the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, feel toward Him a special responsibility to transmit his thoughts and declarations as accurately as possible. They also feel a responsibility toward the searching readers who depend upon a translation of the inspired Word of the Most High God for their everlasting salvation.\n It was with such a sense of solemn responsibility that over the course of many years this committee of dedicated men have produced the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. The entire work was originally released in six volumes, from 1950 to 1960. From the start it was the desire of the translators to have all these volumes brought together into one book, inasmuch as the Holy Scriptures are in actuality one book by the One Author. While the original volumes contained marginal references and footnotes, the revised one-volume edition, released in 1961, contained neither footnotes nor marginal references. A second revision was released in 1970 and a third revision with footnotes followed in 1971. In 1969 the committee released The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, which presented under the Greek text revised by Westcott and Hort (1948 Reprint) a literal word-for-word translation into English. During the past 34 years the New World Translation has been translated in part or in its entirety into ten other languages, with a total printing and distribution surpassing 39 million.\n This new edition is not just a refinement of the translated text beyond its already previous revisions, but it offers a complete updating and revision of the footnote apparatus and marginal (cross) references that were initially presented in English, from 1950 to 1960.\n For information as to the features of this revised edition and the service it can render to the users, we refer you to the Introduction. This 1984 revision has been released by us to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for printing, translation into other leading languages and distribution. We thus make it available with a deep sense of gratitude to the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, who has so privileged us and in whose spirit we have trusted in producing this revision. We pray for his blessing upon those who use this translation for spiritual advancement.\n January 1, 1984, New York, N.Y.\n \n Have you found some problems with this translation that you want to discuss?\n Richard.",

   "I am not Witness, but I studied with them for a little over a year. And I know and am friends with a lot Witnesses to this day.\n \n I have a copy of The New World Translation. I find the wording rather cumbersome at times. I don't think it's a very good translation. Ancient language scholars have found errors and the rumor mill is that only one of the committe members even had any training (2 years of Greek), and since the Watchtower Society won't say different, I am apt to believe the rumors.\n \n You are dang right that undertaking translating God's word is serious stuff. You better have the skills for the task and be able to prove you do. Not releasing the names of the translators or their credentials is highly suspect. I have no reason to trust a nameless, faceless stranger - we are talking about the word of God here.\n \n I think Witnesses are generally right in many of their beliefs. But there are a few things.\n \n The idea that everyone has to agree on every fricken thing. I know they actually don't. I remember once that two sisters had told me two different opinions on the same matter, when I mentioned this to one of the elders he told me that the sisters really weren't in disagreement (and he did not even know one of them!) A little critical thinking and variety of thought is healthy, thorough and good.\n \n Another issue is the dependence on the Governing Body. I think the individual congregations would be better left to themselves. Heriarchy from the governing body on down is worse than that of the Catholic Church, and quite frankly Catholics are granted more freedom to disagree. I just don't get it. I would not trust my purse to a group of strangers in New York - let alone decisions about my relationship with God.\n \n I also find the use use, reasons and methods around disfellowshipping and shunning to be emotional blackmail and mental abuse. When I found out about them it brought me right back to the days of my marriage (I was abused) - I cried for days. That was when I stopped studying with Witnesses. \n \n There is much that is good about the religion. People are sincere and so is their study. But don't be fooled into thinking it's all sweet and happy. \n \n Sandy - JWs consider themselves to be the only true Christians and say so quite openly in their meetings and literature.

He is not half God and half man. He is fully divine and fully man. That is, Jesus has two distinct natures: divine and human. Jesus is the Word who was God and was with God and was made flesh, (John 1:1,14). This means that in the single person of Jesus is both a human and divine nature. The divine nature was not changed. It was not altered. He is not merely a man who \"had God within Him\" nor is he a man who \"manifested the God principle.\" He is God, second person of the Trinity. \"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word,\" (Heb. 1:3, NIV). Jesus' two natures are not \"mixed together,\" nor are they combined into a new God-man nature. They are separate yet act as a unit in the one person of Jesus. This is called the Hypostatic Union. \n The following chart should help you see the two natures of Jesus \"in action\": \n \n GOD MAN \n He is worshiped (Matt. 2:2,11; 14:33). He worshiped the Father (John 17). \n He was called God (John 20:28; Heb. 1:8) He was called man (Mark 15:39; John 19:5). \n He was called Son of God (Mark 1:1) He was called Son of Man (John 9:35-37) \n He is prayed to (Acts 7:59). He prayed to the Father (John 17). \n He is sinless (1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15). He was tempted (Matt. 4:1). \n He knows all things (John 21:17). He grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52). \n He gives eternal life (John 10:28). He died (Rom. 5:8). \n All the fullness of deity dwells in Him (Col. 2:9). He has a body of flesh and bones (Luke 24:39). \n \n (Sorry, it is kind of sloppy. I hope you can follow)\n \n The Communicatio Idiomatum\n \n A doctrine that is related to the Hypostatic Union is the communicatio idiomatum (Latin for \"communication of properties\"). It is the teaching that the attributes of both the divine and human natures are ascribed to the one person of Jesus. This means that the man Jesus could lay claim to the glory He had with the Father before the world was made (John 17:5), claim that He descended from heaven, (John 3:13), and also claim omnipresence, (Matt. 28:20). All of these are divine qualities that are laid claim to by Jesus; therefore, the attributes of the divine properties were claimed by the person of Jesus.\n \n Mistakes Cultists make\n \n One of the most common errors that non-Christian cults make is not understanding the two natures of Christ. For example, the Jehovah's Witnesses focus on Jesus' humanity and ignore His divinity. The repeatedly quote verses dealing with Jesus as a man and try and set them against scripture showing that Jesus is also divine. On the other hand, the Christian Scientists do the reverse. They focus on the scriptures showing Jesus' divinity to the extent of denying His true humanity. \n For a proper understanding of Jesus and, therefore, all other doctrines that relate to Him, His two natures must be properly understood and defined. Jesus is one person with two natures. This is why He would grow in wisdom and stature (Luke 2:52) yet know all things (John 21:17). He is the Divine Word that became flesh (John 1:1,14).\n The Bible is about Jesus (John 5:39). The prophets prophesied about Him (Acts 10:43). The Father bore witness of Him (John 5:37; 8:18). The Holy Spirit bore witness of Him (John 15:26). The works Jesus did bore witness of Him (John 5:36; 10:25). The multitudes bore witness of Him (John 12:17). And, Jesus bore witness of Himself (John 14:6; 18:6).\n Other verses to consider when examining His deity are John 10:30-33; 20:28; Col. 2:9; Phil. 2:5-8; Heb. 1:6-8; and 2 Pet. 1:1. \n 1 Tim. 2:5 says, \"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\" Right now, there is a man in heaven on the throne of God. He is our advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). He is our Savior (Titus 2:13). He is our Lord (Rom. 10:9-10). He is Jesus.",

There is no way that a descendant of Adam can gain salvation on his own, no matter how noble his works are. Salvation is a gift from God given to those who put faith in the sin-atoning value of the sacrifice of his Son.)\n Heb. 5:9, RS: \"He [Jesus] became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.\" (Italics added.) (Does this conflict with the statement that Christians are \"saved through faith\"? Not at all. Obedience simply demonstrates that their faith is genuine.)\n Jas. 2:14, 26, RS: \"What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.\" (A person does not earn salvation by his works.

(John 1:14; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9) Trinitarians say that since God is eternal, so the Son of God is eternal. But how can a person be a son and at the same time be as old as his father?\n Trinitarians claim that in the case of Jesus, \"only-begotten\" is not the same as the dictionary definition of \"begetting,\" which is \"to procreate as the father.\" (Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary) They say that in Jesus' case it means \"the sense of unoriginated relationship,\" a sort of only son relationship without the begetting. (Vine's Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words) Does that sound logical to you? Can a man father a son without begetting him?\n Furthermore, why does the Bible use the very same Greek word for \"only-begotten\" (as Vine admits without any explanation) to describe the relationship of Isaac to Abraham? Hebrews 11:17 speaks of Isaac as Abraham's \"only-begotten son.\" There can be no question that in Isaac's case, he was only-begotten in the normal sense, not equal in time or position to his father.\n The basic Greek word for \"only-begotten\" used for Jesus and Isaac is mo\u00b7no\u00b7ge\u00b7nes', from mo'nos, meaning \"only,\" and gi'no\u00b7mai, a root word meaning \"to generate,\" \"to become (come into being),\" states Strong's Exhaustive Concordance. Hence, mo\u00b7no\u00b7ge\u00b7nes' is defined as: \"Only born, only begotten, i.e. an only child.\"-A Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, by E. Robinson.\n The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, edited by Gerhard Kittel, says: \"[Mo\u00b7no\u00b7ge\u00b7nes'] means 'of sole descent,' i.e., without brothers or sisters.\" This book also states that at John 1:18; 3:16, 18; and 1 John 4:9, \"the relation of Jesus is not just compared to that of an only child to its father. It is the relation of the only-begotten to the Father.\"\n So Jesus, the only-begotten Son, had a beginning to his life. And Almighty God can rightly be called his Begetter, or Father, in the same sense that an earthly father, like Abraham, begets a son. (Hebrews 11:17) Hence, when the Bible speaks of God as the \"Father\" of Jesus, it means what it says-that they are two separate individuals. God is the senior. Jesus is the junior-in time, position, power, and knowledge.\n When one considers that Jesus was not the only spirit son of God created in heaven, it becomes evident why the term \"only-begotten Son\" was used in his case. Countless other created spirit beings, angels, are also called \"sons of God,\" in the same sense that Adam was, because their life-force originated with Jehovah God, the Fountain, or Source, of life. (Job 38:7; Psalm 36:9; Luke 3:38) But these were all created through the \"only-begotten Son,\" who was the only one directly begotten by God.-Colossians 1:15-17.\n \nCol. 2.9;\n\n COLOSIANS 2:9\n 'Reasoning from the Scriptures' pg. 420-1\n According to Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, the\u00b7o'tes (the nominative form, from which the\u00b7o'te\u00b7tos is derived) means \"divinity, divine nature.\" (Oxford, 1968, p. 792) Being truly \"divinity,\" or of \"divine nature,\" does not make Jesus as the Son of God coequal and coeternal with the Father, any more than the fact that all humans share \"humanity\" or \"human nature\" makes them coequal or all the same age.\n \nPhil. 2.5-8;\n\n Focus on verse 6, This says that Christ did not think himself to be equal to God.\n \n \nHeb.1.8.\n\n HEBREWS 1:8\n 'Reasoning on the Scriptures' pg. 442\n Which rendering is harmonious with the context? The preceding verses say that God is speaking, not that he is being addressed; and the following verse uses the expression \"God, thy God,\" showing that the one addressed is not the Most High God but is a worshiper of that God. Hebrews 1:8 quotes from Psalm 45:6, which originally was addressed to a human king of Israel. Obviously, the Bible writer of this psalm did not think that this human king was Almighty God. Rather, Psalm 45:6, in RS, reads \"Your divine throne.\" (NE says, \"Your throne is like God's throne.\" JP [verse 7]: \"Thy throne given of God.\") Solomon, who was possibly the king originally addressed in Psalm 45, was said to sit \"upon Jehovah's throne.\" (1 Chron. 29:23, NW) In harmony with the fact that God is the \"throne,\" or Source and Upholder of Christ's kingship, Daniel 7:13, 14 and Luke 1:32 show that God confers such authority on him.\n Hebrews 1:8, 9 quotes from Psalm 45:6, 7, concerning which the Bible scholar B. F. Westcott states: \"The LXX. admits of two renderings: [ho the\u00b7os'] can be taken as a vocative in both cases (Thy throne, O God, . . . therefore, O God, Thy God . . . ) or it can be taken as the subject (or the predicate) in the first case (God is Thy throne, or Thy throne is God . . . ), and in apposition to [ho the\u00b7os' sou] in the second case (Therefore God, even Thy God . . . ). . . . It is scarcely possible that ['Elo\u00b7him'] in the original can be addressed to the king. The presumption therefore is against the belief that [ho the\u00b7os'] is a vocative in the LXX. Thus on the whole it seems best to adopt in the first clause the rendering: God is Thy throne (or, Thy throne is God), that is 'Thy kingdom is founded upon God, the immovable Rock.'\"-The Epistle to the Hebrews (London, 1889), pp. 25, 26.\n \n \nJesus was raised in the Same body that was crucified. John, 2. 19-22 Jesus said, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\" He was speaking of the temple of His body.\n\n You have to take the rest of the Bible into account before running off with out-of-context statements, the bible clearly shows that Jesus was raised up in a spirit body.\n \n 1 Cor. 15:45: \"It is even so written: 'The first man Adam became a living soul.' The last Adam [Jesus Christ, who was perfect as was Adam when created] became a life-giving spirit.\"\n \n 1 Pet. 3:18: \"Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.\n Not only that Sandycane but you will nullify the ransom (again) if you belive that Jesus was resurrected in the same body, because you can't take a ransom back once it has been paid, can you?\n \n All the verses you provide are either taken right out of context or are falsely applied or are just nothing to do with the point in question.\n \n \n ARCHIMEDES\n \n My 2nd reply:\n \n CHRISTIAN APOLOGETICS & RESEARCH MINISTRY www.carm.org\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Jesus' Two Natures\n \n \nJesus is God in human flesh. He is not half God and half man. He is fully divine and fully man. That is, Jesus has two distinct natures: divine and human. Jesus is the Word who was God and was with God and was made flesh, (John 1:1,14). This means that in the single person of Jesus is both a human and divine nature. The divine nature was not changed. It was not altered. He is not merely a man who \"had God within Him\" nor is he a man who \"manifested the God principle.\" He is God, second person of the Trinity. \"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word,\" (Heb. 1:3, NIV). Jesus' two natures are not \"mixed together,\" nor are they combined into a new God-man nature. They are separate yet act as a unit in the one person of Jesus. This is called the Hypostatic Union. \n\n Why not just let the Bible tell you what is going on rather then telling the Bible?\n \nThe following chart should help you see the two natures of Jesus \"in action\": \n \n GOD MAN \n He is worshiped (Matt. 2:2,11; 14:33).\n\n Only true if you follow poor translations of the Bible and I'll show you why;\n \n 'Insight on the Scriptures' pg. 523-4\n Obeisance to a human king is found in Jesus' illustration at Matthew 18:26. It is evident that this was the kind of obeisance that the astrologers rendered to the child Jesus, \"born king of the Jews,\" that Herod professed interest in expressing, and that the soldiers mockingly rendered to Jesus before his impalement. They clearly did not view Jesus as God or as a deity. (Mt 2:2, 8; Mr 15:19) While some translators use the word \"worship\" in the majority of cases where pro\u00b7sky\u00b7ne'o describes persons' actions toward Jesus, the evidence does not warrant one's reading too much into this rendering. Rather, the circumstances that evoked the obeisance correspond very closely to those producing obeisance to the earlier prophets and kings. (Compare Mt 8:2; 9:18; 15:25; 20:20 with 1Sa 25:23, 24; 2Sa 14:4-7; 1Ki 1:16; 2Ki 4:36, 37.) The very expressions of those involved often reveal that, while they clearly recognized Jesus as God's representative, they rendered obeisance to him, not as to God or a deity, but as \"God's Son,\" the foretold \"Son of man,\" the Messiah with divine authority. On many occasions their obeisance expressed a gratitude for divine revelation or evidence of favor like that expressed in earlier times.-Mt 14:32, 33; 28:5-10, 16-18; Lu 24:50-52; Joh 9:35, 38.\n \nHe worshiped the Father (John 17).\n\n He certainly did.\n \nHe was called God (John 20:28; Heb. 1:8)\n\n John 20:28\n 'Should you believe in the Trinity' pg.19 \n But what about the apostle Thomas' saying, \"My Lord and my God!\" to Jesus at John 20:28? To Thomas, Jesus was like \"a god,\" especially in the miraculous circumstances that prompted his exclamation. Some scholars suggest that Thomas may simply have made an emotional exclamation of astonishment, spoken to Jesus but directed to God. In either case, Thomas did not think that Jesus was Almighty God, for he and all the other apostles knew that Jesus never claimed to be God but taught that Jehovah alone is \"the only true God.\"-John 17:3.\n Again, the context helps us to understand this. A few days earlier the resurrected Jesus had told Mary Magdalene to tell the disciples: \"I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.\" (John 20:17) Even though Jesus was already resurrected as a mighty spirit, Jehovah was still his God. And Jesus continued to refer to Him as such even in the last book of the Bible, after he was glorified.-Revelation 1:5, 6; 3:2, 12.\n Just three verses after Thomas' exclamation, at John 20:31, the Bible further clarifies the matter by stating: \"These have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God,\" not that he was Almighty God. And it meant \"Son\" in a literal way, as with a natural father and son, not as some mysterious part of a Trinity Godhead.\n Heb. 1:8\n See my reply to Sandycane under the subheading HEBREWS 1:8.\n \nHe was called man (Mark 15:39; John 19:5).\n\n That's all he was. \n \nHe was called Son of God (Mark 1:1) He was called Son of Man (John 9:35-37) \n\n How is this evidence for a 200% God-Man?\n \nHe is prayed to (Acts 7:59).\n\n Look at the next verse\n Acts 7:60\n 60 Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice: \"Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.\" And after saying this he fell asleep [in death].\n Now that was a prayer.\n 'Insight on the Scriptures' pg. 667-8 \n Though some claim that prayer may properly be addressed to others, such as to God's Son, the evidence is emphatically to the contrary. True, there are rare instances in which words are addressed to Jesus Christ in heaven. Stephen, when about to die, appealed to Jesus, saying, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" (Ac 7:59) However, the context reveals a circumstance giving basis for this exceptional expression. Stephen at that very time had a vision of \"Jesus standing at God's right hand,\" and evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus' personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the head of the Christian congregation. (Ac 7:55, 56; Col 1:18) Similarly, the apostle John, at the conclusion of the Revelation, says, \"Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.\" (Re 22:20) But again the context shows that, in a vision (Re 1:10; 4:1, 2), John had been hearing Jesus speak of his future coming and thus John responded with the above expression of his desire for that coming. (Re 22:16, 20) In both cases, that of Stephen and that of John, the situation differs little from that of the conversation John had with a heavenly person in this Revelation vision. (Re 7:13, 14; compare Ac 22:6-22.) There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: \"In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.\"-Php 4:6.\n \nHe prayed to the Father (John 17).\n\n Of course. \n \nHe is sinless (1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15). He was tempted (Matt. 4:1).\n\n Are you saying that Adam wasn't perfect and sinless before his selfish act.\n \nHe knows all things (John 21:17).\n\n Compared to these guys he did.\n \nHe grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52). \n\n So he did.\n \nHe gives eternal life (John 10:28). He died (Rom. 5:8). \n\n Not while on earth he didn't, clearly!\n \nAll the fullness of deity dwells in Him (Col. 2:9).\n\n See my reply to sandycane under subheading COLOSIANS 2:9. \n \nHe has a body of flesh and bones (Luke 24:39).\n\n That he did. \n \n \nA doctrine that is related to the Hypostatic Union is the communicatio idiomatum (Latin for \"communication of properties\"). It is the teaching that the attributes of both the divine and human natures are ascribed to the one person of Jesus. This means that the man Jesus could lay claim to the glory He had with the Father before the world was made (John 17:5), claim that He descended from heaven, (John 3:13), and also claim omnipresence, (Matt. 28:20). All of these are divine qualities that are laid claim to by Jesus; therefore, the attributes of the divine properties were claimed by the person of Jesus.\n\n You don't have to be a God-Man to make these claims, he was simply formed into a man from the spirit realm so he could quite legally tell every one that.\n \n \nOne of the most common errors that non-Christian cults make is not understanding the two natures of Christ. For example, the Jehovah's Witnesses focus on Jesus' humanity and ignore His divinity. The repeatedly quote verses dealing with Jesus as a man and try and set them against scripture showing that Jesus is also divine. On the other hand, the Christian Scientists do the reverse. They focus on the scriptures showing Jesus' divinity to the extent of denying His true humanity. \n For a proper understanding of Jesus and, therefore, all other doctrines that relate to Him, His two natures must be properly understood and defined. Jesus is one person with two natures. This is why He would grow in wisdom and stature (Luke 2:52) yet know all things (John 21:17). He is the Divine Word that became flesh (John 1:1,14).\n The Bible is about Jesus (John 5:39). The prophets prophesied about Him (Acts 10:43). The Father bore witness of Him (John 5:37; 8:18). The Holy Spirit bore witness of Him (John 15:26). The works Jesus did bore witness of Him (John 5:36; 10:25). The multitudes bore witness of Him (John 12:17). And, Jesus bore witness of Himself (John 14:6; 18:6).\n Other verses to consider when examining His deity are John 10:30-33; 20:28; Col. 2:9; Phil. 2:5-8; Heb. 1:6-8; and 2 Pet. 1:1. \n 1 Tim. 2:5 says, \"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\" Right now, there is a man in heaven on the throne of God. He is our advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). He is our Savior (Titus 2:13). He is our Lord (Rom. 10:9-10). He is Jesus.\n\n How does just saying that he was God while on earth prove that he was. You seem to forget that all the scriptures of the Bible fall into place very nicely without the need of obscure and pointless explanation when it is understood the way JW's explain it.\n \n Sandycane, Archimedes,\n \n Did you realize that you nullify the sacrifice Jesus paid if you hold to add-on God-Man doctrine?\n \n  'Should you believe in the Trinity' pg. 15\n How Much Was the Ransom?\n ONE of the main reasons why Jesus came to earth also has a direct bearing on the Trinity. The Bible states: \"There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all.\"-1 Timothy 2:5, 6.\n Jesus, no more and no less than a perfect human, became a ransom that compensated exactly for what Adam lost-the right to perfect human life on earth. So Jesus could rightly be called \"the last Adam\" by the apostle Paul, who said in the same context: \"Just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.\" (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45) The perfect human life of Jesus was the \"corresponding ransom\" required by divine justice-no more, no less. A basic principle even of human justice is that the price paid should fit the wrong committed.\n If Jesus, however, were part of a Godhead, the ransom price would have been infinitely higher than what God's own Law required. Exodus 21:23-25; 23 \"But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\" also Leviticus 24:19-21. It was only a perfect human, Adam, who sinned in Eden, not God. So the ransom, to be truly in line with God's justice, had to be strictly an equivalent-a perfect human, \"the last Adam.\" Thus, when God sent Jesus to earth as the ransom, he made Jesus to be what would satisfy justice, not an incarnation, not a god-man, but a perfect man, \"lower than angels.\" (Hebrews 2:9; compare Psalm 8:5, 6.) How could any part of an almighty Godhead-Father, Son, or holy spirit-ever be lower than angels?\n \n Christian love.",

   "You are a little uniformed to how the org works it is not your fault. The local halls are to themselves (maybe you didn't mean legally). A quick and dirty explanation is the watchtower is like the federal government the branch office the state. The governing body is the people that sign the checks and dictate what is law. It is not how you describe we are not dependant on them, for we are them. What most people don't understand is that we are also a political party (theocrat). Like the military there is no disagreement with in the context of the party. When we change the rules we change them. We don't have a static codex of rules out side of the overt ones in the bible.\n\n \n Maybe dependence is the wrong word. More like trust in them allowing to make major decisions for individuals halls - or individuals. Stop saying \"we\". Only the governing body makes rules and nobody gets to disagree. \n \n \nIt is not black mail we are conditional. We don't \"hang\" with people we already kicked out. Why chill with someone you are quarantining? It is like making a prison with out doors. We disfellowship pedophiles, and people say that is not harsh enough. \"You should do more to\"... what beat them? \n\n \n Pedophiles whould immediately be turned over to the police.\n \n Regarding disfellowshipping. I know a woman who was disfellowshipped for disagreeeing with scriptural interpretation. I know another woman who was disfellowshipped at the hardest time in her life. She had just quit smoking and drugs, was overcoming her addictions - they disfellowshipped her right at the moment she needed support most. This meant her family, too. I still want to kick her brother's *** for complying and leaving his sister out cold. You have no idea how foul I find this. \"Do as we say or you will even lose your family\" most certainly is emotional blackmail.\n \n It disgusts me to no end.\n \n \nAlso have you seen our pictures of Armageddon? Fooled into Sweet and happy end of the world? We are the cynical people that don't believe in an after life for 99% of its members.\n \n We also considered ourselves false Christians during big goof ups, and consider our selves very fallible. How humble can you be than \"Oops we did it again\" :p\n\n \n Yep, but only Witnesses get to oops. Any mistakes those outside the org are making are absolutely unforgivable. Only Witnesses are good enough for Christ. Still waiting to find that scripture in the Bible.\n \n Sorry if I seem harsh, I love many Witnesses and agree with much of what they believe, but the stuff I disagree with makes me all kinds of angry.",

Sandycane that lovely verse you cite is meant for those that aren't sincere in their search through the scriptures, to prove that you are sincere show me how the Bible withstands the false doctrine of the Trinity that's all God wants sincerity.

This method of \"translating\" often seeks not to translate the actual words of the Hebrew or Greek into English, but rather attempts to translate thoughts or ideas. This is a more subjective enterprise. It is really a form what has been known in the past as paraphrasing (e.g. the old Living Bible), or turning a translation into a running commentary, based upon what the translators think a passage means, rather than confining themselves to the actual words they are supposed to be translating into English. The great danger, of course, is that it is a very small step from \"translating\" a passage based upon what one thinks it means, to translating a passage based upon what one would like it to mean. The NIV for example, supposedly \"more accurate\" than the King James Version, abandons word-for-word translating in many instances, such as Deuteronomy 20:7, Esther 1:1, Matthew 5:32, and Luke 23:45. The newer modern inclusive language versions of the Bible, (e.g., the NLT, CEV, and GW) are even worse, (for this see the section on Inclusive Language). In these versions, the actual words of the Hebrew or Greek, especially such \"masculine imagery\" words as anthropos or adelphos are not translated into English equivalents at all. The words used instead are neither accurate nor, in many instances, even honest. Plainly the \"translators\" of these versions would like the Biblical la7lguages of Hebrew and Greek to be \"gender-neutral': even if they are not. They \"translate\" the Bible into what they would like it to be, i.e., a book that is modern, progressive, \"non-sexist\", in short a book that is in accord with modern secularist views on women and what constitutes \"politically correct\" English.\n These type of translations are very dangerous Sandy beware, God authored the Bible not men.\n \n \nAll of the questions you ask have already been answered in this thread. If you do not understand them, I will be happy to explain them as many times as needed.\n If, however, you are trying to understand the Scripture as it was re-written by the JW, it will be very difficult.

The people entrusted to make the decisions are voted into office by the majority. If the people don't like what their leaders are doing, they are replaced. From what I see, the JW organization is run like a dictatorship (or cult).

We don't wear crosses either.\n \n \nWhat are your core values, what is your morality and where do you get it? What is it subject to?\n\n \n Really most of the broad out codes of conduct is pulled straight from the bible.

If so, what does your god advocate? What ideals does your god and your religion follow?\n\n \n If you read the Old Testament yeah the Hebrew God is not for any of those things not even absolutely protecting the innocent. Jehovah actually advocates fealty and servitude to himself or whom he left in charge regardless of how inept they are. Our ideals is mostly preaching the gospel, and overtly distancing our selves from Satan.

How can you justify granting totalitarian powers to human beings, who are fallible?\n\n \n That is the nature of religion.

Look at how the watchtower is portrayed by the media or government a side effect of that.\n \n \n \nHow is your religion different from mainstream Christianity?.\n\n \n We are Unitarian (don't believe in the trinity), have no afterlife for most people, believe the modern world is going to end someday, and replaced by Gods Kingdom.

This is the world that God loved and for which Jesus died. However, The Oxford History of Christianity states: \"The 'world' is also a term in Christian usage for something alienated from God and hostile to him.\" How is this true? Catholic author Roland Minnerath, in his book Les chr\u00e9tiens et le monde (Christians and the World), explains: \"Taken in a derogatory sense, the world is thus seen as . . . the domain where powers hostile to God carry out their activity and that constitutes by its opposition to Christ's victorious rule an enemy empire under Satan's control.\" This \"world\" is the mass of humanity that is alienated from God. True Christians are no part of this world, and it hates them.\n Toward the end of the first century, John had in mind this world when he wrote: \"Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world-the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one's means of life-does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.\" (1 John 2:15, 16) He also wrote: \"We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.\" (1 John 5:19) Jesus himself called Satan \"the ruler of this world.\"-John 12:31; 16:11.\n \n We don't salute the flag because it doesn't belong to God it's an invention of man, allowed to exit by God and soon to disappear. JW's pay their taxes, are law abiding, don't protest at the government, infact If the whole world was full of JW's it would be such a peaceful and law abiding place it would seem like another planet.\n \n \nSandy\n btw, I just looked up \"citizen\" to check for spelling and, the definition is: \"a person who by birth or naturalization owes allegiance to a government and is entitled to protection from it.\"\n Are American JW's true citizens of this country, or any other, for that matter? \n\n Not really, we won't follow them into Armageddon!!!\n Watchtower magazine 9/1 1998 pg. 16\n Stay Close to the Theocracy\n The Theocratic View of Secular Rule\n 11 If Jehovah's Witnesses are under theocracy, God rule, how do they view national rulers? Jesus said that his followers would be \"no part of the world.\" (John 17:16) However, Christians recognize their debt to \"Caesar,\" secular governments. Jesus said that they should \"pay back . . . Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.\" (Matthew 22:21) According to the Bible, human governments \"stand placed in their relative positions by God.\" Jehovah, the Source of all authority, permits governments to exist, and he expects them to do good to those under their jurisdiction. When they do so, they are \"God's minister.\" Christians are subject to the government of the land in which they live \"on account of [their] conscience.\" (Romans 13:1-7) Of course, if the state should demand something contrary to God's law, the Christian would \"obey God as ruler rather than men.\"-Acts 5:29.\n 12 What about when true Christians are persecuted by governmental authorities? Then they follow the example of the early Christians, who endured periods of great persecution. (Acts 8:1; 13:50) These tests of faith were not unexpected, since Jesus had warned that they would come. (Matthew 5:10-12; Mark 4:17) Yet, those early Christians did not retaliate against their persecutors; neither did their faith weaken under the pressure. Rather, they followed the example of Jesus: \"When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.\" (1 Peter 2:21-23) Yes, Christian principles won out over the provocations of Satan.-Romans 12:21.\n 13 The same is true today. During this century, Jehovah's Witnesses have suffered greatly at the hands of despotic rulers-just as Jesus foretold. (Matthew 24:9, 13) In some lands, lies and misrepresentations are circulated by those trying to pressure the authorities to act against these sincere Christians. Still, despite such \"bad report,\" the Witnesses by their fine conduct recommend themselves as God's ministers. (2 Corinthians 6:4, 8) When possible, they present their case to officials and before the courts of the land so as to demonstrate their innocence of wrongdoing. They use whatever avenues are open to them to make a public defense of the good news. (Philippians 1:7) But after they have done all they can within the law, they leave matters in Jehovah's hands. (Psalm 5:8-12; Proverbs 20:22) If need be, they, like the early Christians, are not afraid to suffer for the sake of righteousness.-1 Peter 3:14-17; 4:12-14, 16.\n \n Always be open-minded.",

Examples:\n\n Lets see if we have.\n \nGenesis 1.1-2\n \"In the begining God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was empty, a formless mass cloaked in darkness. And the Spirit of God was hovering over it's surface.\"\n The NWT has CHANGED the word \"Spirit\" to \"active force\" in order to deny that the Holy Spirit is alive.\n\n Sandy, a quick demonstration of the usage of the term \"spirit\" in the scriptures and then I will expand on this in your next points.\n 'insight on the scriptures vol. 2.' Pg. 1017\n The Greek pneu'ma (spirit) comes from pne'o, meaning \"breathe or blow,\" and the Hebrew ru'ach (spirit) is believed to come from a root having the same meaning. Ru'ach and pneu'ma, then, basically mean \"breath\" but have extended meanings beyond that basic sense. (Compare Hab 2:19; Re 13:15.) They can also mean wind; the vital force in living creatures; one's spirit; spirit persons, including God and his angelic creatures; and God's active force, or holy spirit. (Compare Koehler and Baumgartner's Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, Leiden, 1958, pp. 877-879; Brown, Driver, and Briggs' Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, 1980, pp. 924-926; Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, edited by G. Friedrich, translated by G. Bromiley, 1971, Vol. VI, pp. 332-451.) All these meanings have something in common: They all refer to that which is invisible to human sight and which gives evidence of force in motion. Such invisible force is capable of producing visible effects.\n \nZechariah 12.10\n \"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.\"\n The NWT has CHANGED the word \"me\" to \"the one\" since the correct, original wording shows that Jesus is God in flesh, which the JW deny.\n\n Wachtower magazine 8/15, 1953.\n To avoid what seems to be a piercing of Jehovah some of the later Hebrew manuscripts read \"look upon him whom they have pierced\", rather than \"look upon me whom they have pierced\". At first these late Jewish manuscripts show this in the Keri, or corrected reading in the margin; but eventually in some manuscripts the change was brought up into the body of the text itself. Rotherham's translation, on the basis of these late manuscripts, offers in a footnote \"him\" as an acceptable reading in place of \"me\". So does the American Standard Version. Some modern translations, such as Moffatt and An American Translation and Revised Standard Version, use \"him\" instead of \"me\" in the main body of the text itself. However, the oldest and best Hebrew manuscripts read \"me\" rather than \"him\".\n As far as literal piercing is concerned, this occurred in the case of Christ Jesus, and at John 19:37 the prophecy of Zechariah 12:10 is quoted and applied to Jesus: \"They will look upon the one whom they pierced.\" (NW) They did not literally pierce God, who was in heaven and to whom Jesus spoke when he was on the torture stake. (Matt. 27:46; Luke 23:46) God could not die, and then resurrect himself. (Ps. 90:2) Yet inasmuch as Jesus Christ was Jehovah's representative who became \"the exact representation of his very being\", in piercing Jesus they could be said to be piercing Jehovah. (Heb. 1:3, NW) When sending out his followers to preach Jesus said: \"He that receives you receives me also, and he that receives me receives him also that sent me forth.\" (Matt. 10:40, NW) This shows that in receiving Jesus we receive Jehovah who sent him. In like manner, to pierce Jesus is to pierce Jehovah who sent him. It does not prove Jesus and Jehovah are one, any more than it proves Jesus and his followers are literally one. In another case Jehovah showed that to reject his representative is to reject Him. When Samuel was Jehovah's appointed judge over Israel the people came requesting a king instead of a judge. Samuel was displeased when they said: \"Give us a king to judge us.\" But Jehovah told Samuel: \"They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me.\" (1 Sam. 8:4-7, AS) In rejecting Jehovah's representative they rejected Jehovah, in effect; but this did not make Samuel one with Jehovah in a trinity.\n \nI could go on, but, I think this shows clearly that the JW have altered the bible to suit themselves.\n\n Did you realize that some very good scholars agree with the renditions of the NWT, or do you still believe witch-hunt websites?\n \nRegarding the Trinity of God:\n \"God is a trinity of three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father is not the same person as the Son; the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as the Father. They are not three gods and not three beings. They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all God\n\n Very jumpy doctrine!\n \n Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc..., and these are demonstrations of personhood.\n\n only if you ignore the context of the Bible! \n \nThey are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful.\n\n No there not. Are you sure you've read the bible?\n \n If any one of the three were removed, there would be no God... Therefore, the doctrine of the Trinity is arrived at by looking at the whole of Scripture, not in a single verse.\n\n I will start a thread as you wish.\n \n It is the doctrine that there is only one God, not three, and that the one God exists in three persons: Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. An analogy would be time. Time is past, present, and future. But there are not three times, only one.\" (quoted from .carm.org) Examples:\n\n which one is the son? Past, present or future. Which one is the father? Past, present, or future. Which one is the nameless holy spirit.....\n \nGod the Father:\n St. Matthew 28.19, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n \n The Son:\n 1 John 2.22, \"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is anti-christ, that denieth the Father and the Son.\"\n \n The Holy Spirit:\n John 4.24, \"God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.\"\n 2 Corinthians 3.17, \"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"\n\n as far as trinity defence goes sandy, this is very poor it doesn't even mention the things you suggest.

It certainly is the Bible. How good a translation it is compared to others the experts can bicker over until they are red in the face. As I suspect none on this board can read ancient Hebrew or Greek we all simply have to take the experts word for it on what is the better translation - and since the experts disagree - - - who can say. I have several translations and use them all (I even have one in Spanish). I find the NIV the easiest read, though. They all tell the same story. \n \n It's interpretation more than translation that brings up real disagreement. Two people can look at the exact same thing and see totally different things. One day about a month ago we got hammered with a snow storm. I walked outside \"oh great - more of the white **** to shovel\", my son was \"it's so pretty on the trees.\" We were both looking down the same street and neither of us was wrong. That's humanity. We are never gonna agree on everything - we are all right and wrong some of the time and some of the time at the SAME TIME.\n \n Anyway - some experts say there is error in the NWT, some say otherwise. So? It seems like small point really. But to answer your question above. \"Jehovah\" was added to the Greek scriptures in the NWT where it never existed.

   "Hi Richard,\n You said, \"JW will always admit they have been wrong, that's why I'm JW, simple.\" I don't understand that reason.\n \n I have been doing some research on various Christian groups. Here is a partial list of what I've come up with:\n \n United Pentecostal Church (www.UPCI.org) \n God, the Father- One God, Creator of all things\n God, the Son- Jesus is the Son of God according to the flesh, God made flesh\n Holy Ghost- not a third person in the Godhead, but rather the Spirit of God\n \n Orthodox Church in America (www.oca.org)\n \"Thus, the Church teaches that while there is only One God, yet there are Three who are God--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit--perfectly united and never divided yet not merged into one with no proper distinction.\"\n \n Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (www.lcms.org)\n \"Teaches and responds to the Triune God: the Father, creator of all that exists; Jesus Christ, the Son, who became human to suffer and die for the sins of all human beings and to rise to life again in the ultimate victory over death and Satan; and the Holy Spirit, who creates faith through God's Word and the Sacraments. The three persons of the Trinity are coequal and coeternal, one God.\"\n \n United Methodist Mission and Ministry (www.awfumc.org)\n \"Historically and specifically, United Methodists believe...\n 1) in one living, true and eternal God, infinite in power, wisdom and goodness, Creator of all things. God reveals Gods self as the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, distinct but inseparable.\n 2) in Jesus Christ, truely God and truely human, the Word and Son of the Father. We believe that devine Godhead and bodily Human were joined together in one person, Jesus Christ, who lived, suffered and died on the cross to reconcile us to God.\n 3) in a physical resurrection: that Jesus was burried, rose from the dead, and ascended to Heaven until He shall return in triumph. He is Savior, Mediator, Friend and Judge.\n 4) in the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, as the leading, comforting, empowering and guiding presence of God in the world.\" (there is more)\n \n Catholic Answers (www.catholic.com)\n \"The parallelism of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is not unique to Matthew's Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor.13:14, Heb.9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today--that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three devine persons who are one divine being (God).\"\n \n The above site has this to say about the JW org.:\n \"The NWT is universally rejected by non-Witnesses, including secular Greek and Hebrew scholars. These scholars, and informed critics of the Watchtower, speculate that few of the members who served on the committee were experienced as translators or even knew the rudiments of Hebrew or Greek; the NWT appears to be little more than a modification of already-existing English versions. It was by means of two former Witnesses, Bill Cetnar (who worked in the Brooklyn headquarters) and Raymond Franz (a former menber of the WTS's governing body) that the identity of the committee members became known and therefore that the scholars' suspicions were confirmed. According to Cetnar and Franz, only one member of the committee (Frederick Franz, fourth WTS president and Raymond Franz's uncle) studied biblical languages at all, and he studied non-biblical Greek for only two years.\"\n \n I am not trying to promote \"my\" religion, whatever you may think that is. \n I am trying to show that the Jehovahs Witness organization, is nothing more than a non-Christian cult.\n \n Sandy\n Here is a Real interesting site I just found: http://neirr.org/s7-aber2.html\n\n \n \"the NWT appears to be little more than a modification of already-existing English versions\"\n \n Okay so you are conflicting your self. How can it be a bad translation by and little more than a modification of already-existing English versions? This makes no sense. We are Neo-heretics we are not going to share the same beliefs as the chruch. The UN defines us as a para-christian religion, non-christian is harsh.

   "Jitobear,\n Thanks for the links, I especially liked the GCI site (put it in my \"favorites\")\n So, by definition, does the JW org. fall into the cult catagory?\n I think they do.\n \n I think the more important issue here is, \"Why isn't it a crime, punishable by law, to be the promoter of a cult?\" \n These \"leaders\" are not only affecting the persons Life in a negative way, but also, their eternal Life.\n \n I think the leaders of these \"cult religions\" should be delt with the same as the big-shot drug dealers. Extreme, you may say, but, why? We make laws to punish people who threaten human life in other ways, why should emotional and especially spiritual harm be overlooked?\n \n Sandy\n\n \n I don't think that a lot of people realize they are operating a cult. I also think most religions have some aspect of cult about them. I mean, how many Christians believe that non-Christians or gays, etc. won't be saved? I think Witnesses are very sincere Christians. However in their desire to seperate themselves they are using cult tactics. I doubt any of the leadership within the organization really realize it. Also, this is not an organization that exploits people. \n \n No, I don't think they need to be prosecuted unless they are actually breaking the law, such as exploitating people for money or physically threatening or abusing members, especially if they wish to leave (i.e., Waco, Jonestown). Witnesses on the other hand insist on obeying the law. The sister I studied with wouldn't even speed!",

We are a nation whos soil resides in between the ears of is citizens. No other group on earth has effectively pioneered this new concept. It is not a cult in the truest sense.\n \n The quandary all these people have is sovereignty. People want to impose on the watchtowers rights as part of a sovereign state regardless if it is physical. Basically people are saying it should be illegal to be another government or that government's authority must be reserved to only physicalities.",

   "\n Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (www.lcms.org)\n \"Teaches and responds to the Triune God: the Father, creator of all that exists; Jesus Christ, the Son, who became human to suffer and die for the sins of all human beings and to rise to life again in the ultimate victory over death and Satan; and the Holy Spirit, who creates faith through God's Word and the Sacraments. The three persons of the Trinity are coequal and coeternal, one God.\"\n \n\n \n That's my denomination. If you want to look at some really interesting splits off the Lutheran Church, check out the Wisconsin (more conservative) and Evengalical Lutheran Church of America (more liberal) websites. If I knew them or had time to look them up, I would. Google should easily find them.",
