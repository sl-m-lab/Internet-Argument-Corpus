Except they are clearly hypocrites when it comes to applying that bit of logic to their own beliefs. \n \n Also, as hunter has pointed out, creationists don't understand evolution. He links something outside of evolution as a part evolution. Using abiogenesis as a proxy attack upon evolution is a common, fradulent method of creationists. Abiogenesis could easily be wrong but that does not make evolution false. In my opinion, hunter's mind would explode if he found out God created the very first living organism which then marched forth in a evolutionary textbook fashion to modern life. \n \n In addition, hunter's comments show a clear sign of impatience and weakness. Merely because evolution cannot explain everything now, creation must be correct. That is weakness and impatience. The inability to wait for the answers without embracing evidenceless explantions.\n \n I also find it amusing that people like hunter resort to faith for their beliefs. Faith is a belief in something completely without proof (dictionary). Yet evolution has moutains of proof. He rejects the things that has evidence for the idea that has absolutely none.\n \n This is why creationist are seen as XXXXXX in today's world.",

Rather the creation of the universe is outside of the scope of the theory of evolution. The theory is not intended to explain the creation of the universe. You'll have to look elsewhere to explore answers to that question.\n \n What good is it? I certainly don't have the knowledge to answer that question in totality, but one area that the theory has significant practical value is in researching how bacteria and/or viruses evolve. Understanding evolutionary theory in this realm can presumably help prevent significant outbreaks of disease. (Anyone with more specific knowledge of the topic, please feel free to amend or add to the idea.) Understanding evolutionary theory can also help us understand how life has changed over the millions of years that it has existed on this planet... and how it continues to change.\n \n \nWhat is the purpose of trying to debunk the fact that God created man in his own image?\n\n You tell me, then we'll both know. Who is trying to debunk that idea? The concept of God is outside the scope of evolutionary theory.

However, such an entity is outside the knowledge of the physical world in which we exist.

   "Hunter, c'mon... You should know better than this by now. How many times has it been explained to you? The theory of evolution doesn't 'avoid' the creation of the universe. Rather the creation of the universe is outside of the scope of the theory of evolution. The theory is not intended to explain the creation of the universe. You'll have to look elsewhere to explore answers to that question.\n \n What good is it? I certainly don't have the knowledge to answer that question in totality, but one area that the theory has significant practical value is in researching how bacteria and/or viruses evolve. Understanding evolutionary theory in this realm can presumably help prevent significant outbreaks of disease. (Anyone with more specific knowledge of the topic, please feel free to amend or add to the idea.) Understanding evolutionary theory can also help us understand how life has changed over the millions of years that it has existed on this planet... and how it continues to change.\n \n \n You tell me, then we'll both know. Who is trying to debunk that idea? The concept of God is outside the scope of evolutionary theory. It is certainly conceivable that some metaphysical energy or a specific entity is and continues to be the driving force behind evolution. However, such an entity is outside the knowledge of the physical world in which we exist. Belief of such an entity is possible... but not knowledge.\n \n \n And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.\n \n \n You'll probably get as many different answers to such a question as there are 'evolutionists.' (Whatever it is you mean by that term.) There are over a billion Christians whose personal faith and relationship with their Savior does not conflict with the reality of evolution. Try asking one of them. (And it may behoove you to recognize that you are in the minority of Christians who do not recognize the validity of evolutionary theory.)\n\n \n Okay then, are you \" Bootfitter\" in screen name only or do you have some actual knowledge of boots?",

   "The more things change, the more they remain the same.\n\n You seem to enjoy contradicting yourself with nonsense.\n \nI think that how life began is an important issue to everyone.\n\n You think? Why is that? What relevance does it have to your life or mine if we understand how life began? It is an interesting question and it may give some insights that benefit humanity in the future, once we have more than hypotheses to answer the question. I do know that two viruses have been constructed from scratch in the lab. One has been tested and is indistinguishible from the original. The other is polio, and the DNA sequence is identical to the real virus. It reproduces in culture but, of course, has not been tested.\n \n There is also the fact that self propagating molecules have been produced in the lab. Some are enclosed in lipid membranes, similar to cellular membranes. We don't know where research into abiogenesis will lead at this point, but I agree that it is an important field of research. If it yields half of the benefit to humankind that evolutionary theory has, then it will be worth the effort.\n \nIf the theory of evolution avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it?\n\n Good question! If plumbing avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If nuclear physics avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If medicine avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If archetecture avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it?\n \n The answer is quite simple unless you are a simpleton. None of them have anything to do with the creation of the universe and life as we know it. By the way, the creation of the universe and life (as we know it) aren't actully the same question either.\n \nWhat is the purpose of trying to debunk the fact that God created man in his own image?\n\n I don't know. Who is doing that. Certainly not me. I guess the difference is that I don't try to instruct God on how He accomplished His creation. You seem to believe that you have some special knowledge. Does God talk to you?\n \nOne of the greatest scientist of all time believed that a supreme being created life as we know it; that would be Albert Einstein.\n\n First, how is that relevant?\n \n Second, I think that you should look into Spinoza's idea of God, since Einstein stated that his God was the God of Spinoza. Spinoza's God was nature itself. According to Spinoza and Einstein, nature is the creator of everything.\n \nMan did not evolve from apes, he was created by God .\n\n Nice assertion. One must wonder why your God chose to create man with more than 98% similarity to chimpanzees. I look at morphology, physiology, anatomy, and DNA analysis and conclude that chimps and humans have a common ancestor. You read a book of mythology and superstition and conclude otherwise.\n \nAn interesting question would be this; what do the evolutionists think about salvation through grace and life after death?\n\n You've got to be kidding. How is that an interesting question? What does that have to do with the topic under discussion. You must be a golfer. Your \"question\" is just a \"layup\" to Pascal's wager. Your next post will be to claim that since we can't be sure, then we should pretend that your faith is correct. Bad bet.",
