I think that you should look through at least one or two of them, considering your position. I'm something of a biblical scholar myself.

That's also why religious belief has been on the decline for centuries.\n \n Like philosopher Bertrand Russell, I can more easily imagine a God who rewards skeptical free-thinking over blind adherence to whatever religion is the norm within an individual's geographic location. If I were a creator, I would be ashamed of my creative skills if my project had little respect for their own logic-based deductive abilities, and instead just believed whatever they were told. I certainly wouldn't want unimaginative robot-like beings such as that to be said to be created in my image.\n \n Respectfully,\n Derek",
