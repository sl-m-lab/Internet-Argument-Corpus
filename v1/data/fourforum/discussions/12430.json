   "Letting the government decide what is too expensive for a health care program is just another way for government to decide who dies and who doesn't. You can bet your bippy that the big wheels at the top of the government pyramid and all those with money and connections within the government control machine will get whatever treatment they want...no matter the cost...and no matter their age.\n \n I have no doubt that open heart surgery for an 83 year old patient (like Barbara Bush) will be denied under Barack's plan...except for ex-Presidents and ex-First Ladies like he and Michelle will not soon enough become.\n \n The government has no business controlling health care or who pays what for treatment.\n \n Life prolonging cancer drugs to be banned because they cost too much | Mail Online\n \n \n \n Thousands of patients with terminal cancer were dealt a blow last night after a decision was made to deny them life prolonging drugs.\n \n The Government's rationing body said two drugs for advanced breast cancer and a rare form of stomach cancer were too expensive for the NHS. \n The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is expected to confirm guidance in the next few weeks that will effectively ban their use.\n \n The move comes despite a pledge by Nice to be more flexible in giving life-extending drugs to terminally-ill cancer patients after a public outcry last year over 'death sentence' decisions. Leading campaigners last night said Nice had failed the 'acid test' of whether it really intended to give new priority to people with just a few months to live.\n \n One drug, Lapatinib, can halve the speed of growth of breast cancer in one in five women with an aggressive form of the disease. \n \n Dr Gillian Leng, Nice deputy chief executive, said 'The committee concluded that Lapatinib is not a cost-effective use of NHS resources when compared with current treatment.' \n \n Up to 1,500 stomach cancer patients also face a ban on Sutent - the only drug that can extend their lives. \n \n Draft guidance by Nice said the drug should not be used even though it approved its use for kidney cancer last month.",
