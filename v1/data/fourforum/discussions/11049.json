   "In the face of plummeting car sales, Ford Motor Company has taken steps to reduce its aggressive, pro-homosexual policies, prompting a family-rights group to call off its boycott of the carmaker.\n \n The American Family Association says it's suspending its two-year boycott of Ford, noting the auto giant has met the conditions of the original agreement between AFA and Ford from 2005.\n \n AFA Chairman Donald Wildmon said the original agreement between the family group and Ford contained four items:\n \n Ford would not renew current promotions or create future incentives that give cash donations to homosexual organizations based on the purchase of a vehicle.\n Ford would not make corporate donations to homosexual organizations that, as part of their activities, engage in political or social campaigns to promote civil unions or same-sex marriage.\n Ford would stop giving cash and vehicle donations or endorsements to homosexual social activities such as 'gay'-pride parades.\n Ford would cease all advertising on homosexual websites and through homosexual media outlets (magazines, television, radio) in the U.S. with the exception of $100,000 to be used by Volvo. The Volvo ads would be the same ads used in the general media and not aimed at the homosexual community specifically.\n \n Wildmon said a few minor issues remain, and AFA will continue to bring these to the attention of Ford.\n http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=58587\n \n There's the lie...\n (Note how the article includes ABSOLUTELY NO QUOTE from Ford substantiating this claim... emoticon_emb )",

   "And here's the truth...\n \n \n Yesterday the American Family Association issued a press release claiming that the Ford Motor Company had surrendered to their ongoing boycott and would cease marketing to gays and end charitable contributions to LGBT organizations.\n \n This morning I made a few phone calls, initially speaking to Suzanne Wait, head of Ford GLOBE, the company's LGBT employee group. Wait declined to comment on the AFA's claim, referring me to Jim Cain, Director of Product Communications at Ford. After a pleasant chat on the phone, Cain sent me this email to clarify Ford's position on LGBT marketing. The AFA has made its decision and is ready to move on. Our principles have not changed. We are committed to treating everyone fairly and with respect, including our dealers, customers and employees. Ford will continue to market its products widely to attract as many customers as possible and make charitable contributions to strengthen communities to the extent business conditions allow. Difficult business conditions in recent years have reduced our overall spending across the board.\n \n Jim Cain\n Director, Product Communications\n Ford, Lincoln and Mercury \n http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2008/03/ford-statement-refutes-afas-claims.html\n \n Just out of curiousity, WHY does anybody listen to the AFA, or WND, or a variety of religious right resources that claim to be about \"family values\" but in the end show that they put NO \"value\" in truth and honesty?",
