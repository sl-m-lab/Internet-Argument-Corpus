   "For the last three years I have been trying to amend the law making silencer use in Washington State a gross misdemeanor. RCW 9.41.250(c) RCW 9.41.250: Dangerous weapons ? Penalty ? Exemption for law enforcement officers. bans silencer use by everyone in WA including military, police and licensed dealers. It also bans the use of any device not attached to the firearm, such as shooting boxes, insulated rooms and down range baffles. The local rifle range I shoot at is being sued in part due to noise complaints by people that recently moved in next to the range, but the law forbids us from doing anything to reduce noise, except stop shooting.\n \n I have been trying to drum up support for bill 1604 which would make an exception for those silencers registered with the federal government, but it is hard to do. Interest in silencer use is rare in the only state west of the Mississippi that bans their use. \n \n Anyone who can legally own a gun and lives in one of the 36 states that allow unlicensed civilians to own silencers can obtain ATF authorization to make or buy them. Those people who pay the $200 tax and submit to the FBI background check are very unlikely to break the law and risk their right to own firearms.\n \n I polled all of the county sheriffs about silencer related crime and have only found ten in the entire state, so their violent misuse is very rare compared to other firearms.\n \n Does anyone here have any idea why anyone would want to keep the use of registered silencers illegal? I am interested in the opinions of those who do not feel that a person has the right to keep and bear arms. Thanks.\n \n Ranb",

Welcome to the board anyway :)\n \n It would be interesting to see the 'opinions' of those politicians who were against our civil rights and lost their elected positions to voice their opinions. emoticon_smile",

   "I already know their opinion on the matter. They supported silencer use, but their support only extended to watching the bill allowing it die in committee session after session. It is easy to say you support a bill that you are sure will never get a hearing in committee and make it to the House floor for a vote.\n \n I wrote to the new Reps that were elected this month. Their attitude is the same as the ones that were voted out. It is because very few people are making any noise about it. \n \n Ranb",
