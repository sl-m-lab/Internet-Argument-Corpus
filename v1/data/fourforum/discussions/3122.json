But...\n Four years ago we had an election, it was stollen, not by a candidate, per se, but moreover by our Supreme Court who Appointed a winner as they saw fit. \n So, yes, we are SUPPOSED to be a nation which allows free elections, but it's not always the case. \n Granted, I'm not so keen on the idea of government getting out of the business of marriage all at once either. I believe that is just too simplistic and would actually be creating more problems than it would solve. \n The easiest route would then be to recognize yet another set of legal marriage perameters, ie gay marriages. \n Personal views aside, it's the laws we are not so much as trying to change rather than become more inclusive and certainly not relgious dogma. \n \n What really gets me are all the arguments which are meant to change focus from the legal issues to religious issues. They really are not the same at all. Just because some laws happen to coincide with some religious views doesn't mean they are one in the same. Not all religions or religious views are every satiated in terms of what is allowed by laws of man. \n \n \"You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.\"",

However, our own sheer and endless incompetence does not mean the government becomes our nanny and moral police. \n \n \n\n If the government does not maintain its involvement in marriage, then who will address the problems that occur when a marriage breaks up? Surely legislation is necessary to answer the legal questions which arise over child custody and the dispersal of assets etc. and how a marriage is recognised in the first instance.\n\n \n Perhaps that is the only place where government should be involved in marriage. Family court should be the only place where custody and marriage is recognized by the courts. Who gets what and why. Not who can get married and what benefits they recieve. As rights upon death, let the wills take over, not federal laws. \n \n \n\n Without giving this too much consideration, I can also see problems with a government treating it's society only as individuals (if we were to ignore the institution of marriage).

Why can't we still promote the rights of the family unit? Allow tax benefits for dependents, which we'd be doing anyways regardless of maritial status. Why can't we do it without the word marriage?

Albeit some people may be that way, but the folks I think we've been dealing with can't/won't see the truth even if it hit them over the head. My fiance says \"we don't have control over those people and can't change their thinking\". I'm starting to realize this.\n \n I've also learned on here about \"hate\" as in hate groups. Hate groups don't call themselves hate group members anymore than terrorists don't call themselves terrorists. When the word \"hate\" is used, it's not taken as \"hate group\" hate, but hating someone...thus the response \"we don't hate you\". Most people call this denial.\n \n Guess I did a lot of learning/struggling on this board, but it's been worth it.\n\n \n \n And we are here to support you as well! There is always stuff out there to help us keep our heads up. Don't think that the greatest minds didn't get frustrated in the fight for justice, they just didn't let it stop them. Ghandi, MLK, Harvey Milk and the list goes on.......",

   "See this is what irks the heck out of me. Why? Gay and lesbian couples are forced to spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars to ensure only similar rights and protections of which are completely ASSUMED to legally married couples. \n My partner can never gain custody of my son if something were to happen to me because my son's father still retains parental rights. My partner would probably never see my son again. A child she has helped raise moreso than his natural father ever has. \n She has been the one to go to PTA meetings, sports seminars and games, class concerts and projects, parent-teacher meetings (with me)...etc. Not his father. He has never once attended a sports event/game/seminar, he has never once attended any concerts or recitals, he's never seen his son on stage, he's never taken him to an amusment park or baseball game. No....\n My partner and I have. \n He's always been welcome to be a part of his son's life, to actively take a parental role, but he has CHOOSEN not to. And even so, if I were to die, HE would gain custody of a child he knows NOTHING about! My partner would be out of luck. \n Sure, she could probably gain some sort of visitaion rights as having been so active in his life, but I wouldn't put it past my ex to stop her from being able to activate any such right.\n\n \n Just wanted to update here: my son's father called me today and said he wants to come to one of our son's football games! I nearly passed out with shock.\n \"Of course you're welcome to\" is what I replied. I was close to having a heart attack. \n Now, of course I must understand that the reality of his actually coming out to one of our son's football games is mighty slim. It's a nice jesture, but jestures aren't going to help heal all the pain of missing his dad that my son feels. \n His dad has another family with five other kids. Our son is his oldest but feels like an intruder whenever he visits. He adores his little brothers and sister, but the eldest one of his dad's brood and he seem to argue quite a bit. That isn't all that uncommon of step-syblings actually. Seeing as the eldest isn't my ex-husbands natural child. He adopted him when his mother and he were married. \n And that just brings up a whole other mess of emotions. \n He gets to adopt his wife's child but my partner cannot. \n What's up with that? \n (Rhetorical question actually...I know the legalities of it all by heart)",

Not to trivialize, but it reminds me of \"ER\", the tv show...one of the characters is having to suffer through this very thing.\n\n \n Ah yes, the Carrie Weaver Issue: I know of what you speak. No, unfortunately because his natural father will not relinquish his parental rights my partner will never be allowed to adopt my son through \"Second parent adoption.\" Even if he did, the state in which we live does not allow for second parent adoptions. But that's really the least of my concerns.\n The issue with the character on \"ER\" was that he child did NOT have a second parent and it's only biological family was that of Carrie's partner. What bothered me about that characterization was that it occurs in the same state in which my partner and I reside. The producers didn't mention that time as a parent has a lot of power in this state. Whether or not their are any laws on the books, which there are not, durration of parentage or parental duties actually does have weight here. \n So, as I said before, my partner would probably be able to petition the courts for some sort of visitation rights as having been the predominant parental adult in his life, but since my ex lives in another state which is famous for actually removing children from gay/lesbian homes it's unlikely she would ever be allowed to exersize her visitation. \n That is another problem with the lack of marraige rights. The problem of portability and lack of \"Full faith and Credit\" being utilized in gay/lesbian cases.",

   "I'm don't completely understand the unemployment benefits regarding this issue so I really can't comment on that. Could you drop some important information about it? \n \n Loosely? Perhaps. Government has many aims. Why can't we still promote the rights of the family unit? Allow tax benefits for dependents, which we'd be doing anyways regardless of maritial status. Why can't we do it without the word marriage? Marriage in today's society has relatively little meaning. It's monetary value is clear, but the initial origin of Marriage has losts it's meaning quite some time ago.\n\n \n I'm not sure how the social security system in the US works. But in my case, if a married partner is unemployed, their eligibility for a social security benefit is based on their partners income. ie. if the partner earns say... 30K a year, they would be ineligible for payments. If they were not seen to be legally married, the partner would be able to receive payments without a problem. In this case, I'm sure a lot of legally married couples would rather be treated as individuals.\n \n I agree with many of the previous posts about the rights that are denied to couples who cannot officially marry, progress needs to be made. However, I think marriage still has a lot of meaning to couples that want to take that path, even without the monetary value (which I have never found beneficial in my circumstance).",

   "\n As a conservative belief holder, I strongly hold the notion that smaller government is better government. Also as a conservative belief holder, I strongly hold the notion that government should get out of my life and the lives of my fellow citizens. \n \n Removing government from any and all marriage would slim down the beauraracy and increase citizen privacy. \n \n Why should the government even be in marriage?\n \n\n \n First, it sounds to me like you are more of a libertarian than a conservative. The truest conservative supports no government power over the economy yet total power in forcing morality on the people (i.e. a theocracy.) Social liberalism/libertarianism is the belief that the government has no right to force morality on the people.\n \n At any rate, though, I agree with you. However, if we were to remove marriage laws, all this would accomplish would be to liberate men from their duties to women and children. Women and children will still be chained to each other through:\n a) child custody laws, and\n b) the absence of a law stating that \"no one has the right to force children to do things that they don't want to do.\"\n \n Solely destroying marriage laws is only in the interest of the men. Destroying child custody laws is in the interest of the women, at least after the marriage laws are destroyed. And children's rights laws are obviously in the interest of the children.\n \n Don't just liberate men. Liberate EVERYBODY.",
