Strict gun laws would prevent these occurrences.\n \n Yet, there seems to be a disconnect. The lax gun laws are being illustrated and tied to causation, but the inverse falls off the radar. There seems to be no attempt to tie strict gun laws to causation of the opposite. Although it is strongly inferred. We're supposed to conclude by logic that, if lax gun laws cause shootings, the inverse is evident and undoubtable. (But don't examine that inference with any scrutiny.......unless you want to laugh your butt off!)\n \n Because, if you use logic to examine the inverse: lax gun laws cause shootings....therefore...strict gun laws prevent shootings, you will reach a wonderfully hillarious conclusion!\n \n Applying the exact same logic used to deduce that lax gun laws cause shootings to the inverse, you will get this:\n \n Police departments, gun shows, shooting ranges, and NRA conventions are often drenched in blood during mass shootings due to the presence of large numbers of firearms. \n \n Inversely, nobody ever gets shot in Chicago, Washington D.C. or Virginia Tech because of their COMPLETE BANS ON FIREARMS POSSESSION.\n \n Yep. Sometimes it sure is fun to watch the results when you hold conjecture up to the spotlight of logic!\n \n (Oh! Silly me! I forgot that logic has nothing to do with the emotional basis for the gun control agenda! It's all about feelings!)\n\n I don't think that police departments or gun shows are comparable to whole cities like Washington D.C. Logic doesn't appear to have much to do with your own agenda.",

   "Hmmm.... it looks like Hamilton is defending a federal power to regulate the militia in Federalist 29.\n\n \n Uh, NO. did you read what you posted below?\n \n \n\"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.' '' \n The Avalon Project : Federalist No 29\n[/QUOTE]\n \n Besides you and the rest of the gun grabber anti Constitutionalist always insisted that you had to be \"in the army\" to keep and bear arms.\n \n Now, answer my question. WHO IS THE MILITIA? 10 USC section 311. THAT IS PUBLIC LAW BTW... Let's see you squirm out of that one.",

What is it babbling about?\n\n \n Obviously the opinion you never read but depend on your handlers to tell you what to think.\n \n From the Heller case:\n \nThe Court also added dicta regarding the private ownership of machine guns. In doing so, it suggested the elevation of the \"in common use at the time\" prong of the Miller decision, which by itself protects handguns, over the first prong (protecting arms that \"have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\"), which may not by itself protect machine guns: \"It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service-M16 rifles and the like-may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment's ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home.\"[52]\n\n \n Oh star gazer, I would call the ATF 'federales\" also.
