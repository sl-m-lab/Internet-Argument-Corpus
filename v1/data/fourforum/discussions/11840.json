   "Reagan Appointee and (Recent) McCain Adviser Charles Fried Supports Obama - The Plank\n \n Reagan Appointee and (Recent) McCain Adviser Charles Fried Supports Obama\n \n Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School, has long been one of the most important conservative thinkers in the United States. Under President Reagan, he served, with great distinction, as Solicitor General of the United States. Since then, he has been prominently associated with several Republican leaders and candidates, most recently John McCain, for whom he expressed his enthusiastic support in January.\n \n This week, Fried announced that he has voted for Obama-Biden by absentee ballot. In his letter to Trevor Potter, the General Counsel to the McCain-Palin campaign, he asked that his name be removed from the several campaign-related committees on which he serves. In that letter, he said that chief among the reasons for his decision \"is the choice of Sarah Palin at a time of deep national crisis.\"\n \n Fried is exceptionally thoughtful and principled; his vote for Obama is especially noteworthy.\n \n --Cass. R. Sunstein\n \n UPDATE: Fried writes to TNR: I admire Senator McCain and was glad to help in his campaign, and to be listed as doing so; but when I concluded that I must vote for Obama for the reason stated in my letter, I felt it wrong to appear to be recommending to others a vote that I was not prepared to cast myself. So it was more of an erasure than a public affirmation--although obviously my vote meant that I thought that Obama was preferable to McCain-Palin. I do not consider abstention a proper option.",

   "It's the political background and reasoning of your conservatives jumping ship, dear. I think they know what \"well qualified\" means, to the extent that even hundreds of thousands of dollars in clothing can't hide what isn't.\n\n \n First off, please don't call me \"dear\". \n \n Second, I'm not sure I would call Obama \"well qualified\". I view Obama as little more than a talking head, a puppet with someone else pulling the strings. Obama is a brilliant orator, and a charismatic figure, but that really doesn't impress me for someone who wants to lead the US. It would be nice to think that they can actually think for themselves, rather than find out someone else is pulling the strings from behind the scenes...like with Governor Bush. \n \n Don't get me wrong, I will not be voting for McCain either. Neither is a good choice.",
