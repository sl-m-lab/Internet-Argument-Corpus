   "There was a very good reason for deposing Zelaya : he intended to become another \"president for life\" like his mentor and patron Chavez. Allende also tried but the Army 'deposed' him,\n It is a common fallacy of the left and all those na\u00efve foreigners that because someone was elected democratically, once in power he can use any means to his disposal, legal or otherwise to stay in power for life, to do away with democracy. This is what Allende and Zelaya tried and failed and Chavez so far has got away with.\n To use the ladder of democracy to gain power and then pull it away once in power is not democratic at all.\n \n \n The coup in Honduras: Defying the outside world | The Economist",
