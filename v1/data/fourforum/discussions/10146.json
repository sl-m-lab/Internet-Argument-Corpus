   "I have just noticed, by a simple google search of \"{character} dies\" that there are about a billion sites out there with genuine spoilers, these XXXXXX are posting a complete list of deaths and how it ends, all over the place, on forums, newsgroups, blogs, on pages that have nothing to do with HP or anything even to do with literature!\n \n So don't ruin your soon-to-be experienced pleasure and stay off any kind of site where people can post random stuff. One of my friends already knows something she really didn't want to know because she was scrolling down a page and saw a sentence or two of spoiler before she closed the window. She doesn't know for sure it's a genuine spoiler but all the same she's not happy.",

I get a full load of spoilers right in my face on a completely unrelated thread. And then I see the little bastard that posted that one posted dozens of threads about them, and then even had the nerve to clain the people DESERVED TO KNOW!\n \n Well, it did ruin some of the suspense, but the book still kept me up untill 3:45 AM today...",

   "I read the book. I had never read any of the others or seen any of the movies. I just wanted to see what all the hype was about so I picked up a copy at the local book store.\n \n My first impression was that it did not make a lot of sense. I think, though, that if I had read the other books, or knew anything at all about the back story, that it would have been easier to follow. Since my only exposure ot harry potter to date has been the pictures on McDonalds cups, I was pretty lost.\n \n Content aside, I think it was a decently written book, but the author REALLY overdoes the slapstick style in a lot of places. \n \n I think that if you liked harry potter, you would probably like the Dresden files books by Jim Butcher. A friend of mine gave me a bunch of them and they are a fun read. They are written in kin dof the same slapstick style, but it is used much more effectively and is written for a slightly (emphasis on slightly) more adult audience.",

Both :xcensored me off especially the latter and were unnessesary.\n\n \n Not at all; I like my fiction dark and unforgiving and that's what Rowling delivered! I was almost shocked by the first chapter, given that it is essentially children's fiction, but it drew me right in because I knew it was gonna get worse (ie better) from there.\n \n I think it was a good idea to kill off so many people, especially for example Moody near the start and one of the twins near the end, because at some points I really didn't know if all the main protagonists would survive, which added to the excitement.\n \n I also liked the way Dumbledore turned out to not be so clean-cut as he was supposed to be, I loved the revelation of Snape and their plan to kill Dumbledore to affect the wand situation etc, all in all it was much cleverer and much more intricate than I would have predicted.\n \n And my favourite bit by far was Neville killing Nagini. Get in there Neville! You the man!",
