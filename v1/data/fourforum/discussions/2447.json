   "Several times in these forums I have stated that there is no way to KNOW in the realm in which we exist whether or not there is a God or gods. Within this realm, we can only believe. Ultimately, there is no logic in a belief in God... it is belief. It is faith, and as such, needs no logic to back it up.\n \n What I am asking now is this: \n Is it possible to transcend this realm in which our physical bodies exist and KNOW that which is unknowable through observation, logic, and reason in this realm? Is it possible to KNOW anything that is knowable in all realms of existence -- physical or otherwise -- via trascendence of this realm? Is it possible that there is a state of being that makes the pursuit of truth through observation,logic and reason as elementary and laughable as faith and belief appear to be from the perspective of logic and reason?",

   "wow, whistler. you could have just as well not responded altogether...\n \n bootfitter, if it were possible to trandscend into the spirit realm and obtain evidence of God's existence, then the process should be replicable and teachable. anyone of sufficient knowledge and discipline should be able to transcend regularly once they have practiced enough\n \n the thing is, for centuries men have been talking about entering the spiritual realm, through meditation, etc. also, there are countless reports of people who have had near-death experiences and regained conciousness bringing back vivid descriptions of paradise/hell while in their unconcious state. and these experiences are nothing like dreams people would normally have.\n \n i think at the end of it all its a matter of faith. all these phenomenon can be explained by \"science\" as purely mental, and that no spiritual realm has been visited. off course, the observer himself may be very convinced that he has reached a spiritual realm. however, all he/she would have is a strong conviction and nothing else. what if the experience was simply due to the brain's reaction to extreme trauma?\n \n i think if it were possible and duplicable, then we wouldnt be sitting here discussing if it were possible or not",

To say there is no God (which you cannot prove) and to say there is a God (which I cannot prove) both require faith or belief. That faith or belief can be based on a logical thought process none the less. We may differ in our conclusions and still both have correctly used logic. The use of logic does not guaranty the CORRECT answer. One must also have the correct assumptions to arrive at the correct answer. The problem with your logic is that you assume facts not in evidence. Namely, you assume that there is no God. You look at the fossil record or whatever and then with minimal knowledge and understanding (because you are not omniscient) you declare there is no God. This is belief. Not proof.\n \n Therefore, the concept of transendance is irrelevant to me. You have not presented a logical argument to assume you base assumptions and therefore I am unable to go further.",
