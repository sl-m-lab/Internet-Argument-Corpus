Boron is somewhere in between the two.\n \n check this:\n http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev28-4/text/atoms.htm\n \n about midway down the page there's a photo of some boron atoms, each being quite large enough to require several hundreds of pixels, depending on the picture size.\n \n Resolutions such as described in that article are quite sufficient to say that the problem proposed (of figuring out where the camera was) is not limited to a mathmatical study. It could happen...with extremely high resolution equipment. It is true that we do not have equipment that can view an object 225,000 miles away with the resolution required to measure atomic sized variations. Rather than fight with you about the equipment and the concept of infinite resolution, let me just say that the resolution could be high enough to discern any change in the appearance of an object due to that object's movement to another position or orientation, no matter how slight the move.\n \n Would that suffice for you?\n \n \n \n\n It's silly.

Based on the picture you've provided, I put the cameraman somewhere near here.\nI think the time stamp is required.\n \n Consider this:\n \n Imagine that the moon and the earth are each yoyos tethered on a long string attached to their center pins. The moon is not spinning relative to the string. it is much like a real yoyo that's been \"walkin' the dog\" and then held still so long that it stopped spinning with its string being fully extended and is now being slung around in a large circular orbit around the earth. (Yes, Kronus...I know it's not exactly a circular orbit.) The same face of the yoyo is always looking straight along the string toward the center of the yoyo's orbit.\n \n The center of the yoyo moon's orbit is the center of the yoyo earth. The yoyo earth is still spinning on the string.\n \n Now imagine yourself being extremely small compared to yoyo earth and that you are perched on the edge of yoyo earth near the string slot trying to look at the yoyo moon. As you ride around in circles on the edge of yoyo earth, you will be able to see the yoyo moon for something less than half the time. As you move, the angle between the two lines formed by a) your line of sight and b) the string holding yoyo moon to yoyo earth will continuously change from Xdeg when you first sight the yoyo moon, decreasing to zero when you pass the string.)and then going to -Xdeg just before losing sightline again.\n \n Since the real moon is irregular and not slick like a cue ball, each view from a different angle will vary from the one next to it.

Draw a line from someone on the surface of the earth, through the surface of the moon and down to its core. Do the same for everyone on earth. All those lines will pass through a circle on the surface of the moon - a projection of the earth onto that surface, if you will. That circle will be approx 57.6km across, or 57613m.\n \n The largest earth-bound telescope in development, the VLT, can resolve down to objects 3ft across, giving you an effective resolution within that circle of around 60000 pixels, translating to a maximum theoretical accuracy of the telescope's location back here on earth of around 210 metres (if the moon is overhead - far worse if it is near the horizon).\n \n If you infer the time from the lighting on the moon's surface rather than knowing it exactly, your longitudinal margin of error, given the same optical quality, increases to just under 1 degree (at best, given an ideal half-moon visible terminator), which could be anything up to a hundred kilometres.\n \n Of course, to actually fit the whole moon into the picture, so that you could tell where the overhead 'middle' was, you would need a 13,110,434 megapixel CCD, which at current levels of technology would measure 35 metres across - making the whole process redundant because it would be far easier to spot the camera itself from space than to work backwards from the images of the moon it produces.",
