   "...\n \n John Kerry said, \"I am determined to reach out across party lines,\"\n and we thought it sounded like a good idea. Consequently, we\n developed our own website dedicated to John Kerry --\n http://kerry-04.org/\n It is the Internet's most comprehensive site on THE REAL JFK, replete\n with the TRUTH about John Kerry. Kerry-04.org is updated constantly\n and now features hundreds of great photos of \"The Johns.\"  \n \n There are only a few short weeks to ensure the defeat of John Kerry.\n Please visit http://kerry-04.org/ and forward this message to anyone\n you think will benefit from the truth about Kerry. \n \n Also, on 30 September, our petition calling for John Kerry's\n prosecution and disqualification from public office for \"giving aid\n and comfort to the enemy\" in time of war,  will be delivered to Senate\n President Richard Cheney, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and\n Attorney General John Ashcroft. Regardless of the outcome of Kerry's\n campaign for president, as John Kerry made his war record the\n centerpiece of his campaign, we intend to make it the centerpiece of\n this call for his prosecution and disqualification for any public\n office. Please join 140,000 fellow Patriots who have already signed\n the petition calling for Kerry's prosecution. Link to --\n http://www.PatriotPetitions.US/Kerry\n \n ...\n \n ...\n \n \n ...",

Why don't you try a different approach; tell us what's good about your candidate and let us decide what's bad about the other one. emoticon_rolleyes",

He and the rest of congress voted to give the president executive authority to use military force, if necessary, not to start a full-scale war (or did they?)\n http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr100302.htm\n \nControversial language is being hotly debated in an effort to satisfy political constituencies and for Congress to avoid responsibility of whether to go to war. So far the proposed resolution never mentions war, only empowering the President to use force at his will to bring about peace. Rather strange language indeed!\n\n \n And these people make it sound like \"funding\" is all you need to make things work right. If there were wastes, then there were. I'm sure you could find lots of examples of Cheney or Rummy looking to slash budgets.\n \n \n JUDGES, COURTS & LAW\n \n Against racial profiling and preference when dealing with terrorism\n \n Voted against confirmation William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\n \n Voted against confirmation of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court\n \n Only support activist judges who will support abortion, persecute Christians and rewrite the Constitution\n \n Voted against confirmation John Ashcroft as U.S. Attorney General\n \n Voted against punitive damage limits in products liability cases\n \n As Michael Dukakis' Lt. Governor from 1983-1985, supported granting prison furloughs to hundreds of Massachusetts inmates\n\n Who cares which supreme court justice he is against? \n Good lord, what would we do if fascit Asscroft wasn't AG?\n And he voted against putting a cap on the amount of damages someone can get from product liability (tobacco companies wouldn't have wanted that one would they?) that's just a sin, isn't it?\n \n \n FOREIGN POLICY\n \n Against linking Most Favored Nation [to China] status [due] to China's human rights record\n \n Voted for Kyoto Protocol on Environment that exempted major Third World polluters, while creating an unfair burden on American taxpayers\n \n Supported Iraq regime change as late as January 2003, but not anymore\n \n Support unilateral nuclear freeze\n \n Support submitting completely to the UN, as well as the International Criminal Court, taking all sovereignty away from the U.S. and its citizens\n \n Don't know what the Geneva Conventions say, mean or who they apply to \n\n Surely the last one comes from the Bush/Bush Sr. playbook.\n Homie has always supported the ousting of Saddam. \n When has he ever said that we would surrender sovereignty? So stupid.\n Why wouldn't he be against Most Favored Nation status for a human rights abuser?\n What sane person wouldn't want a \"nuclear freeze\" instead of a \"nuclear winter?\" Stupid.\n \n John Kerry is a douchebag.

   "There is no ban on stem cell research. Bush has doubled federal funding for stem cell research through his term.\n\n Bush is against using the most benficial kind of stem cell research which is embryonic stem cell research. The only stem cells we are able to use for research (federally funded) are of existing cell lines.\n http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/08/09/stem.cell.bush/\n http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/07/stem.cell.ap/\n \nBut the letter complains that only 19 of those lines are now available to researchers and those available are contaminated with mouse feeder cells which makes their use for humans uncertain.\n\n This explains what Bush is against.\n http://www.dnalc.org/stemcells.html\n Existing stem cell lines are limited in that a lab must vie for these cells. They cannot culture their own from blastocysts. And the ones that do exist aren't ideal.\n \n There is clearly a ban on funding the most beneficial (some say the only beneficial) kind. The only kind that is funded is a result of the banned kind and is almost useless in comparison, but the \"damage\" has already been done to those poor blastocysts. Hey, maybe science doesn't need federal funding? That might be the next argument against embryonic stem cell research. \n \n \nAt one point John Kerry said he thought that US forces should be put under UN command as part of an international force.\n\n Well, if allowing the UN to \"authorize\" our attack of Iraq in 1991 was putting our troops in control of the UN as part of an international force, then Bush Sr. is guilty of that. Besides I've yet to see Kerry quoted as saying that.\n \n \nWhy would John Kerry vote to allow the president use of force if he didn't want force to be used...?\n\n Oh, he was all for some form of war. The form Bush chose must have been the wrong one. \n \n \nJohn Kerry was for the war. He called Saddam Hussein and his arsenal a serious threat. Then, he was the anti-war candidate. Then, knowing everything he knows today, he would still have gone to war with Iraq. Now he says he wouldn't have gone to war with Iraq.\n\n What arsenal? He was never the anti-war candidate. That was Howard Dean. The Dems are screwed by Kerry voting to give Bush authority. Now he realizes that everyone hates the war and that it could have been solid ammo against Bush. The people are screwed even worse. If you were against the war from the beginning, you have no candidate. Funny how it works out that way.\n \n \nNew position due next week.\n\n Will we be able to win the \"war on terror\" then?",
