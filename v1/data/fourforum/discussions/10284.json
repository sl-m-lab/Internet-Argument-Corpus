   "We see reproduction of previous errors (hear, here), plus he adds a new error (omission of \"I\" right at the beginning) - what do you know, this is exactly like tracing evolutionary relationships!\n \n \n It would have been useful for EDO to read a little further into the thread, up to http://www.iidb.org/vbb/showthread.php?p=4732806#post4732806\n \n Hi Everyone--\n \n I have now thoroughly read the Talk Origins Woodpecker article ... and [drum roll] you're RIGHT! I was wrong! Now that I understand woodpecker tongues, I see NO serious obstacles at all for the evolutionary development (or better, \"designed adaptability\") of the woodpecker tongue. I will resume my habit-which-had-gotten-slack of checking Talk Origins and other great Darwin Apologetics sites for treatment of subjects before posting.\n \n So please bookmark this post and add it to your list of about 5 or 6 things that AFDave has publicly admitted being wrong about in the past year and a half, then I will look for apologies from all of you that say I'm dishonest, K?\n \n A couple of points ...\n \n 1) My impression of woodpecker tongues is fairly widespread, even in non-creationist pubs ... this came from Missouri Conservationist, from the kid's section in that magazine. I like kid's magazines. I want to know what's being taught to them. I also write children's material ... another Dynamation at www.kids4truth.com is coming out next month and another one early next year.\n \n ....... [Minor disagreement with article]\n \n 3) I plan to notify AIG to add \"woodpecker tongues\" to the list of arguments creationists should NOT use.\n \n.\n \n \n EDO would also have learned that, contrary to his claims, woodpecker tongues are not \"anchored in the nose holes\" \n [From TO] Several creationist websites and tracts which I have come across claim that the woodpecker's tongue \"is anchored in the right nostril,\"(C1) or grows \"backwards\" out of the nasal cavity (C2). The primary connections between the woodpecker's hyoid apparatus and the rest of its body are muscles and ligaments which attach the hyoid to the mandible (jawbone), cartilage of the throat, and base (not top) of the skull - the same configuration found in all other birds. In the adults of a few species, the hyoid horns may eventually grow forward and into the nasal cavity from above - however the hyoid and the tongue certainly do not grow FROM the nasal cavity. \n \n \n I'm going to copy and paste a bit of material from the T.O. article to document the recklessly false implications and claims in the opening post here about the uniqueness and unevolvability of the woodpecker tongue, but I'd recommend going and reading the original article at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/woodpecker/woodpecker.html , because it has nice illustrations. (That's another advantage of linking to a well-done treatment rather than reinventing the wheel here.) \nThe lengths of the hyoid horns in different birds vary quite a bit, but they are all functionally quite similar. The chicken (figure 3A) gives a well-studied example of a bird which is not closely related to the woodpecker, yet shares all the essential features of woodpecker hyoids (figure 3B).\n \n Compare to the chicken hyoid to the woodpecker hyoid. Note the branchiomandibularis muscles (Mbm) which wrap around the hyoid horns and attach to the jaw. The attachments are similar in the flicker, but the horns and Mbm muscles are longer. ........... The hyoid horns of the chicken and the fascial sheath in which they rest (the fascia vaginalis - Fvg) extend backwards on either side of the throat, then curl up behind the chicken's ears to the back of the head (figure 3A).\n \n The sheath itself forms from a sack of lubricating fluid which the horns grow into as they develop. This lubrication gives the horns some freedom to slide up or down the sheath as the tongue is pulled in or out. There are some elastic connections between the sheath and horns, but they are certainly not \"anchored\" to the skull.\n \n Note the attachments of the branchiomandibularis muscles (labeled \"Mbm\"), which connect near the end of the hyoid horns, run down through the \"sheath,\" and attach to the middle of the jawbone (attachments labeled \"Mbma\" and \"Mbmp\"). These are the muscles which slide the horns down in the sheaths, tighten them against the skull, and thus extend the rigid avian tongue (4).\n \n Thus, the twin horns of a bird's hyoid serve only as an attachment site for muscles which actually originate in the lower jaw - contraction of these muscles pulls the horns, and the whole hyoid apparatus, forward and against the skull, thrusting the tongue out of the mouth like a spear.\n \n Once this concept is understood, it is obvious that lengthening the hyoid horns and attached muscles, without making any other changes to overall structure or function, would effectively give the bird a longer tongue and allow it to protrude that tongue farther out of the mouth. In fact, this is exactly what happens as a young woodpecker grows into an adult.\n \n When a flicker is hatched, its hyoid horns extend only to behind its ears, like those of a chicken. As it grows, the sheath, horns, and muscle grow longer, curving forward over the head and into the nasal cavity (5).\n \n ...........\n \n Compare the horns of the chicken hyoid (figure 3) with those of the adult flicker (figures 4 and 5.1). Notice that although the flicker horns are far longer, they each contain two bones (the ceratobrancials and epibrancials) and one tiny joint, with a piece of cartilage on the tip of the epibranchial - just like the chicken. There are a few other minor morphological differences, such as the presence of the urohyale bone (UH) in the chicken, but the overall homology is clear.\n \n .........\n \n As mentioned earlier, the hyoid horns of a hatchling flicker (and other long-tongued woodpeckers) are quite short (see figure 5.2) and are comparable to those of short-tongued species of woodpecker such as the sapsucker (fig 5.3) which, in turn, has hyoid horns no longer than those of many songbirds (5).\n \n It is only with age that the hyoid horns of the flicker grow up to the top of the head, forward, and into the nasal cavity, where the sheath fuses to the nasal membrane. This makes adaptive sense, since the young flicker is fed by its parents, and a long tongue would only get in the way.\n \n The genetic changes necessary for such a modification are quite minor. No new structures are required, merely an extended period of growth to lengthen an existing structure.\n",

   "This is all really pretty simple. It isn't a case of the base of the tounge hopping backwards in some bizarre manner, as suggested in the first post. Gradual change here is quite simple. When animals develop they start as a bunch of undifferentiated cells. As they grow the cells pick up chemical cues and start to become specific cells. Organs, skin, nerves, what have you. One of the cues says \"put base of tounge here\". All that's required here is for the cues to gradually trigger further and further back. As this happens the tongue becomes longer and the woodpecker has an easier time getting food; a clearly adaptive trait. All very straightforward and easy to explain. That is, as long as one wants to actually seek truth. If one is simply asking questions and not seeking answers, but rather pretending that asking a \"hard\" question proves something, then I suppose it could seem significant somehow.",
