It is WAY, WAY out of wack in most parts of the country. \n \n What we were looking for from the report, and didn't really get, was a reasonable expectation for over correction.

This is going to change the balance of the situation.\n \n IMO, Truthsayers financial advisor is full of it....likely trying to cover their butt because, like so many others, they have told people BUY, BUY, BUY. High end housing is self limiting. There are only so many folks who cn afford $ million + houses, and most of them are not given to foolish financial decisions. A bubble based on investors irrational exuberance is going to primarily effect the sector of the market that is reachable by the highest number of investors. In most cases, that would be the $50-$450k market segment. As you move into the upper end of the scale, fewer buyers are able to afford to enter the market. \n \n In this case, with the creative financing available, that upper number probably moves to the $700-$800k range. \n \n The most dramatic changes in the housing market have not been in the upper end of the spectrum, they have been in the middle and lower segments.",

Most (developers) are still flush from the boom with reserves of six months to service interest on 1st trust deeds and construction loans and their construction loans are 6-9 months of prepaid interest for build time. If a completed project doesn't sell in three months, a developer lowers the selling price (from top profit margin) and again at appropriate intervals. Foreclosures generally begin at 6-8 months after project completion, so I'm looking at late spring for that side of the housing market to falter.\n \n Resident or investor dwelling foreclosures will take longer as a decrease in new construction takes time for economic flow-through to impact mortgage holders due to unemployment benefits. And mortgage companies will 'work' with individual mortgage holders to avoid moving paper from performing to non-performing asset status. I think credit card delinquency will surface before foreclosures become prominent.",

I like to actively manage...sometimes micromanage.\n \n Despite my big retirement plans, I found retirement mind numbingly boring after just a few weeks.

I could (and do) spend lots of time on such projects. I LOVE retirement and find myself busy every day .... in a totally unscheduled way. The hardest part of adjusting to retirement for me was slowing down and learning that I no longer had to answer the bell.

Good luck.\n Dono\n\n \n \n I am still working on the old chevy, and a few other projects.\n \n The problem seems to be that I have gotten used to running 18-20 hours per day. I just don't know what to do with the free time. I am sure I will figure somethign out...after I get my wifes business in line, and get out from under my current consulting contracts, and run out a couple other ideas I have rattling around in my head.\n \n The biggest bonus I have seen so far to retirement (if you can call thi retirement) is the ability to be irresponsible without feeling bad about it. For example, I was talking to a friend Sunday night that was taking his family to Branson for a couple days. He asked if we wanted to go along. I tossed the wife and the kids in the mini van monday morning and headed down. Just got back. A year ago, I would not have even considered it. Now I am retired so I figure \"why the hell not??\"",
