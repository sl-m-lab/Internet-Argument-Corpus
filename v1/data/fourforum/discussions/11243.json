In michigan in 2004 they had petition signing sundays in churches, a state wide organization to put marriage on the ballot. So why not do the same with abortion? If these nutcases feel so strongly that abortion should be banned and they have made the case, as in the marriage initiatives, that the will of the people should be heard then why not get their butts in gear and put it to a popular vote? All I have heard from these christianists is that the people should get to vote and that the courts should not over ride the will of the people. If they turly believe that then why not put it on the ballot and let the people be heard? Could it be that, unlike marriage, the majority of people support a womans right to choose?",

Interesting.\n \n \nRemember also, that the \"Creator\" was for a majority of the signers of the Declaration the Great Clockwinder who set the world in motion and then stepped out of the picture - the Deist \"Creator\". the idea of a personal \"God\" who interfered in the affairs of men would have been absurd to many of them.\n\n Most of the Framers were not deists. This is evidenced by the fact that many of them echoed statements such as those from George Washington, who issued the first Thanksgiving Proclamation, which in part encouraged the people to:\n unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations, and beseech Him to pardon our national and other trangressions; to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shown kindness to us), and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally, to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as He alone knows to be best.\n Praying to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations to do anything is not very compatible with the \"clockwinder\" God who does not interfere in the affairs of men.\n \n \nOn the other hand, you can search the Constitution which declares itself to be the \"supreme law of the land\" from beginning to end and never once find the word \"God\".\n\n And?\n \n \nIn fact, both Article 6 and the First Amendment welcome people of all faiths and no faith into the government, the nation, and the equal protection of the laws.\n\n No one is disputing this.",

So long as our legislatures and courts acknowledge that the original meaning of the constitution is controlling, I will not have to worry about a law that would ban my speech if that speech would have been protected when the First Amendment was ratified.\n \n It is the people who adhere to a living constitution that one really should fear; for judges of this philosophy are able, by their own presuppositions, to legitimately change the meaning of the Constitution, which of course means that they could encroach upon rights that are protected.\n \n \nI'll err, like Thomas More in his response to his son-in-law, on the widest possible interpretation of what the Constitution says.

She or he is not infringing on anyone else's rights.emoticon_xgood\nAnd yet this ideal is no where in any constitution of the United States nor the writings of those who wrote it.\n \n Basically you have taken the entire constitution and implied that what they were getting at is we should promote freedom to the point where it doesn't hurt someone else (whatever that mean) and simply choose to ignore what is actually written. This is nothing less than rendering the Constitution a useless piece of paper.\n \n \nThis sums up quite well why \"Originalism\" is a sham:\n \n In his Doors of Perception Aldous Huxley proposes that our capacity to\n reason and even our senses are governed by mental patterns, perceptual sets,\n that determine the limits of what the mind can conceive. The mind uses a\n taxonomy--a set of categories--into which it squashes the somewhat messier\n occurences of life, that not only shapes what we think but what we can\n think. Everywhere, polar categories such as liberal and conservative,\n cosmopolitan and provincial, A-Type and B-Type, believer and secularist\n constrain both the public conversation and the interior monologue. And to\n have different categories, or different categories of categories, would make\n of us a different people.\nIt seems to me the biggest sham shown so far is your ability to form an argument.\n \n Why don't you address my points and write your own words? Why can't you state a criteria for interpreting the constitution?",

   "Yes and yes in part!\n \n Why is that a problem for you?\nBecause it goes against every founding document we have. FUrthermore, the use of foreign countries is crazy considering it severely limits the powers of the people. You make the judiciary the most power branch yet it was meant to be the weakest.\n \n This is from the Anti-Federalist Papers...they basically describe a situation where we have a living constitution:\n The power of this court is in many cases superior to that of the legislature. I have showed, in a former paper, that this court will be authorised to decide upon the meaning of the constitution; and that, not only according to the natural and obvious meaning of the words, but also according to the spirit and intention of it. In the exercise of this power they will not be subordinate to, but above the legislature. For all the departments of this government will receive their powers, so far as they are expressed in the constitution, from the people immediately, who are the source of power. The legislature can only exercise such powers as are given them by the constitution; they cannot assume any of the rights annexed to the judicial; for this plain reason, that the same authority which vested the legislature with their powers, vested the judicial with theirs. Both are derived from the same source; both therefore are equally valid, and the judicial hold their powers independently of the legislature, as the legislature do of the judicial. The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature. In England the judges are not only subject to have their decisions set aside by the house of lords, for error, but in cases where they give an explanation to the laws or constitution of the country contrary to the sense of the parliament -though the parliament will not set aside the judgment of the court-yet, they have authority, by a new law, to explain the former one, and by this means to prevent a reception of such decisions. But no such power is in the legislature. The judges are supreme and no law, explanatory of the constitution, will be binding on them.\nThis simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power\n\n \nThat's the very function of the judiciary under Article 3 of the Constitution.\nNot it isn't! This is directly stated in the anti-federalists and federalist papers. \n \n \n \n\n The very reasons why unelected judges are appointed for life are to remove them from the hurly-burly of electoral politics and allow them to exercise their considered judgment about what the Constitution means.\nIndeed. You remove this by allowing them to make laws as they see fit. \n \n \nShould the public disagree, as it did with Dred Scott, they may either wage war or amend the Constitution (as the 21st repealed the 18th) and correct things as they see fit.\nSo the judges were right in Dred Scott according to your view.\n \n \nIn any case, to imprison the minds of 21st Century justices in the prison of the \"original\" (whatever that means) meanings of the words of an 18th Century document is a fool's errand\nYou haven't shown how it is. You argue that to follow an old law is foolish and should be changed by some unelected person. This removes all power and makes it so the judiciary branch is the most power. This is the foolish stance. \n \n \nLike it or not, it really DOES depend on what the meaning of \"is\" is.\nYet your stance is that there is no meaning of \"is\".",

Do you think the words \"Warrant of habitability\" are forever fixed? \n \n Who or what would you have give them meaning?\n\n \n Well, the Constitution defines the overall relationship between government and the governed, and between various branches of government. This is simply spelled out, and there isn't much room for legal manoeuvers. Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals. Government has the power to punish murderers, for example, but it is not so obvious that it can arbitrarily decree that abortion is murder, because there is no consensus over whether a foetus is a victim in the legal sense.

   "Every legal document changes its meaning over time.\n \n If you will, take what most people consider to be the start of the \"democratic\" form of government, the Magna Carta.\n \n When John signed it a Runnymede, it was a document designed to give the landed barons control over their lands and serfs, yet look at what it has become over 800 years.\n So the words had meaning! Good for you. Now the meaning of the document hasn't changed because the only people with an authority to change meaning of what they wrote is the authors of any document. If we were bound by the Magna Carta then that would be the definition we would have to use. \n \n It is important to point out that the Magna Carta is not a legal document in our system of government.\n \n \nThe actual words of any legal document serve as important starting points, but as starting points only.\n \n Then it's up to the judges to decide the meanings of those words in contemporary society. To do otherwise is to condemn the Constitution to a ritualistic formalism.\nNo, to do so it to give life to what the people adopted...not what 9 unelected elitists say it should be. Again, provide a founding document to support your claim. I've provided many that contradict your claims. \n \n The constitution changes meaning by amendments...not by a judge.\n \n \nBTW, if the landlord does not take care of a rodent or insect issue in my rental property, I may certainly change the terms of the lease. Do you think the words \"Warrant of habitability\" are forever fixed? \nThey are fixed in the meaning of the words when the contract was signed. If you live there 10 years and you decide \"Warrant of habitability\" suddenly means a luxury lifestyle then you would be wrong and any judge would be as well.\n \n \nWho or what would you have give them meaning?\nThere is no need to discuss the differences betweens contract law and statutory law. We are strictly dealing with statutory law.",

Something is only \"unconstitutional\" when it was made so when the provision was adopted in the constitution...no more no less.\n\n \n The Constitution can only change through amendment. However, unless the Constitution specifies how far it may be applied, then it is perfectly valid to interpret how far to apply it, and courts and legislatures are the institutions that do this.

   "Well, the Constitution defines the overall relationship between government and the governed, and between various branches of government. This is simply spelled out, and there isn't much room for legal manoeuvers. Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals. Government has the power to punish murderers, for example, but it is not so obvious that it can arbitrarily decree that abortion is murder, because there is no consensus over whether a foetus is a victim in the legal sense. Now, you could write that into the Constitution, as some are trying, but that document is silent on the issue of what a human person actually is -- and as we all know, the society that produced it didn't regard slaves or women as full persons in their own right, neither did it extend full rights to everyone besides male property owners. Such issues were decided subsequently, by legislative actions, court decisions and/or constitutional amendments.\nI'd say you are right up until saying it can be decided based on \"court decision\".

However, unless the Constitution specifies how far it may be applied, then it is perfectly valid to interpret how far to apply it, and courts and legislatures are the institutions that do this.\nNo it isn't..this is foolish. You assume the person or persons that wrote and adopted an amendment had no idea what its meaning was. They obviously did. To say it is open ended is to imply you can give whatever meaning you want to it. \n \n Words have meaning and if you decide a judge can make up there meaning then the top power is not with the people but with the judges. The anti-federalist papers said this specifically and the federalists said \"no way this will happen..they are the weakest branch\". I guess the joke was on them.\n \n \n There is plenty of wiggle room in the Constitution where interpretation of its application is concerned, and it's foolish in the extreme to pretend otherwise. \nIt may not always be easy to know what the original meaning of a provision is but you at least need to seek that out. I'm not about to say the 8th amendment is very easily understood but when it comes to the death penalty the 8th amendment clearly doesn't imply (as an example). This is because I search for what was meant by the people that wrote it. What I don't find valid is to have a judge try to discover the meaning from whatever means he/she feels it best (foreign courts, public \"opinion\", etc). There is just no validity nor is there any standard for doing so.\n \n \nIf the Constitution were as simple to interpret and apply as you like to pretend, Steve, the courts would be out of business.\nI never said it was simple but some things certainly are. This is the same with many professionals. For example, accounting is not that hard but when you are trained in it then it is much easier to figure out the answer.\n \n \nThus, for example, once basic rights such as the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, or the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, are recognised by a significant public consensus, then the courts act perfectly constitutionally in extending constitutional protections to individuals targeted by a tyrannical government that seeks to impose narrow religious prejudices on people who do not share them.\nSo the courts should rule based on public opinion polls?

   "However, the founders also had the wisdom to recognise that values and culture change, and they did not mean for future generations to be tightly bound by their own slave-owning culture where women were second class citizens. The ambit of rights was never specified absolutely in the Constitution, and has evolved considerably over time. We consider things to be rights today that the founders did not.\n\n First of all, I haven't seen you post here in a while, so welcome back.\n \n You are not likely to get any disagreement with the statements you made above. Where you will get disagreement, however, is with the claim that judges may appropriately update, change, etc. the Constitution. Indeed it is clear that the founders wanted a Constitution that could be changed (that was, after all, a flaw of the Articles of Confederation); but they were absolutely clear about how any changes would be made: not by judges, but by the process established in Article V.\n \n You pick an interesting example of how the Constitution \"evolved\": slavery. This is interesting because abolishing slavery did not happen as a result of judges' interpretation of Constitutional text, but rather by democratic adoption of a new amendment. Even more interesting, the foothold of slavery was actually exacerbated by the Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Sanford.\n \n \nWhen you consider that the US and state governments, in common with European governments, did not start banning all abortions till (if I recall) the 19th century, it suggests that government at the time read into the Constitution an authority to control the lives of women it did not, in fact, possess, or at least that had not been explicitly granted by the Constitution. The founders were silent on the matter.\n\n This isn't exactly correct. From the ratification of the Constitution, Abortion had always been prohibited after \"quickening\" by the common law. Statutes started to emerge after advances in science led to an increased amount of knowledge regarding the formation of the human being. The result of such knowledge led virtually every existing state to ban abortions before quickening.",

It is up to the legislature to respond to evolving circumstances and to determine how legal texts should change. They are in a much better place to accomplish that than are judges anyhow.",

   "Where you will get disagreement, however, is with the claim that judges may appropriately update, change, etc. the Constitution.\n\n \n Thank you for your welcome back. As I didn't make precisely this claim, the disagreement doesn't apply to me. I said judges interpreted how far to apply the Constitution, for example, in deciding whether something is a basic right (or not) that is protected against attempts by government to take it away. Sometimes, extremely rarely, judges are ahead of legislative or public opinion, for example, as with Loving v. Virginia, or Griswold v. Connecticut, decisions I have no quarrel with. Usually, they tend to track it more closely, as with Roe v. Wade, where public opinion hasn't shifted much over a generation or two, and was in favour of reducing restrictions in order to save women's lives, and put reproductive decisions more firmly in women's hands. However, never do judges get the final say. Ultimately, that always rests with legislatures, though they have to find supermajorities or jump through various hoops to override judges by constitutional amendments.\n \n \nIndeed it is clear that the founders wanted a Constitution that could be changed (that was, after all, a flaw of the Articles of Confederation); but they were absolutely clear about how any changes would be made: not by judges, but by the process established in Article V.\n\n \n Of course, and no judicial decision has ever changed the letter of any Constitution, except, I suppose, where such a decision throws out some amendment to a state constitution, as in the case of Romer v. Evans in Colorado. No judge, however, could reject an amendment to the US Constitution.\n \n (I would even respectfully suggest that whenever there is a concerted effort to deny rights to people who claim them as basic, then that denial is what needs to be placed into the Constitution, so there can be no argument about it. Courts and judges, being human, will always err, but I'd prefer they err on the side of individual rights, rather than the side of government authoritarianism.)\n \n \nYou pick an interesting example of how the Constitution \"evolved\": slavery. This is interesting because abolishing slavery did not happen as a result of judges' interpretation of Constitutional text, but rather by democratic adoption of a new amendment. Even more interesting, the foothold of slavery was actually exacerbated by the Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Sanford.\n\n \n And I would reply that there is more than one way to skin a cat. I agree that judges very rarely get ahead of public or legislative opinion, but I do not think it is some sort of catastrophe when they occasionally do. Governments (including legislatures) are rarely keen to recognise the rights of individuals or limits to their own authority, after all, and the courts are a principal defence against tyranny, especially for voting minorities. In any case, the judicial decision is never final under the US system, it can be reversed (in effect) if enough legislators think it is a bad one.\n \n \nThis isn't exactly correct. From the ratification of the Constitution, Abortion had always been prohibited after \"quickening\" by the common law. Statutes started to emerge after advances in science led to an increased amount of knowledge regarding the formation of the human being. The result of such knowledge led virtually every existing state to ban abortions before quickening.\n\n \n Right, but it wasn't until the 19th century that blanket restrictions started to be passed. Current law is generally in accord with the modern scientific consensus, where abortion is available on demand in the first trimester (before there is a brain with any significant functionality), considerably more restricted in the second (where ambiguity about the functionality of the brain exists), and very difficult to obtain in the third (where there is a chance of foetal survival outside the womb).\n \n I'm fairly comfortable with where abortion law stands now, and would neither restrict it further nor expand it. Of course, scientific advances might cause me to change that opinion, but arguments from religious morality are not very likely to.",

   "This:\n \n Now, what does the issue of incorporation have to do with whether the amendment protects citizens from denial of rights on the basis of race or for other reasons as well? If the 14th amendment was intended by its author to incorporate the bill of rights and apply earlier amendments to the states, then the 14th amendment went beyond merely guaranteeing those rights that were being denied on the basis of race, to protect, for example, the first amendment rights of freedom of the press and of religion. John Bingham's arguments suggest that the 14th amendment was intended, broadly, to protect all persons from the denial by the states of rights protected under the Bill of Rights. And indeed, proposed language that specifically named race, introduced by Thaddeus Stevens, was removed from the final version of the 14th amendment. So while it's clear to me that the framers of the 14th amendment were primarily concerned with preventing the states from denying rights on the basis of race, it's not clear that they were exclusively intending this. And of course, whatever the specific intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, the Supreme Court has over time interpreted the amendment as protecting the rights of all persons, and not merely to preventing race discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th amendment protects the rights of gay people.\n \n from another poster on another forum expresses the essence of my point.\n \n All the words of the Constitution are subject to judicial interpretation, and that interpretation must, as always, begin with the words. \n \n Where it begins is, of course, not where it ends.",
