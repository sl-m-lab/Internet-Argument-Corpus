(i.e. the positive thing was CAUSED by Christianity, ignoring other non-Christian elements where the same thing is observed)\n\n \n That's not actually what I said. I was just pointing out that a religion and it's adherents are not actually on the same page sometimes. Sometimes Christians do things despite their religion, not in the name of it. IMO, Christianity in it's purest form is quite benign, and in fact benevolent. It's when it's adherents stray from it and get sidetracked by unnecessary moral issues at a political level that their focus goes in the wrong direction.\n \n \nJust imagine if gays had that sort of privilege. We could declare that people who contract HIV or do drugs aren't really \"gay\". Political parties could quickly and efficiently distance themselves from anybody caught in a scandal by renouncing or distancing their association in that party.\n\n \n Actually, applying this to gays is a good example, though not in the way you used it. People could look at gays and assume that because a few gays do something bad, that it reflects on gays in general and that it indicates a problem with \"gayness\". That would be incorrect of course, and that there is no reason to assume they would not have done something bad gay or not. The same applies to Christians. In fact, if a more 'miltant-minded' Christian starts following the words of Christ, he won't be militant-minded anymore. He will be peace-minded.\n \n In fact, gays are mostly given such latitude of understanding these days, but not Christians as your posts exemplify. Anti-Religion truly is the last socially-acceptable form of prejudice.\n \n \nThe real standard is to judge the whole by the effects brought about by the whole.\n\n \n That doesn't take into account individualism, nor cases where large numbers of people stray from the religion's tenets. \n \n Look, it doesn't take a lot of work to see what Jesus says for people to act like. It's not like it's hard to find out. If you see someone acting contrary to Christ's teachings, then the reasonable assumption is to assume that they are acting despite the religion, not because of it. It's not rocket science!\n \n \nIf anything, you figure out where the process went wrong. But that can't happen with Christianity, cause it requires Christians assume that Christianity is flawless as a fundamental ideal.\n\n \n Fine, then show me where the standard set by Christ is flawed. Show me where \"bless those who curse you\" is a flawed ideal, as well as admonitions to be a peacemaker, while you're at it. Oh, and while you're at it, let's hear why we shouldn't be good Samaritans too, and what's flawed about that idea.\n \n See, the process doesn't go wrong with the religion--it goes wrong because sometimes people fail to live up to it. Quite simply, there is standard set by Christ in terms of behavior, and people hope to live up to it. Sometimes they do, something they don't. Christians are just as human as you or anyone else. The only process there is that someone didn't live up to the tenets of the religion as they should have. Meanwhile, people like you hold them to some standard higher than the rest of humanity, and expect them to be super-human when they are just as human as you are and fail sometimes.",

Meanwhile, people like you hold them to some standard higher than the rest of humanity, and expect them to be super-human when they are just as human as you are and fail sometimes.\n\n \n One problem with this argument is that not all Christians agree with what \"Christian\" standards of behavior should be. Some Christians insist that, even though Jesus never said anything about being gay or about gay people, that he nevertheless \"condemned\" homosexuality through other people's writings in the Bible. Other Christians dispute this claim and note that Jesus never said anything about \"homosexuality,\" and therefore, Christians should not presume that God condemns it. They look to other quotations attributed to Jesus in the Bible, such as \"judge not lest ye be judged,\" and \"love your neighbor as yourself.\" Some Christians accept divorce, even though Jesus reportedly called for no divorce, while other Christians insist there can be no divorce, even as they permit couples to anul their marriages. Some Christians support going to war, while other Christians insist that Jesus meant \"turn the other cheek\" and that all war is contrary to God's will. Some Christians support the death penalty, while other Christians insist that Jesus opposed all killing. \n \n There have been groups acting in the name of Jesus and Christianity who have done things that most of us would regard as clearly immoral. The Ku Klux Klan is one such group. Christians who supported white supremacy, racial segregation, and before that slavery asserted that they were acting in the name of Jesus. These were not just individuals, but whole churches. The Southern Baptists came into existence as the pro-slavery wing of Baptists. \n \n To say that Christians agree on what the Christian behavior ought to be, and that individuals simply fall short of acting as Christians, is to ignore the many passionate disagreements and even battles among different groups of Christians over what Christian behavior ought to be. Christians have never all agreed on what Christian behavior should be. Different groups of Christians have interpreted Jesus' message, and the message of the Gospels, differently.",

   "One problem with this argument is that not all Christians agree with what \"Christian\" standards of behavior should be. Some Christians insist that, even though Jesus never said anything about being gay or about gay people, that he nevertheless \"condemned\" homosexuality through other people's writings in the Bible. Other Christians dispute this claim and note that Jesus never said anything about \"homosexuality,\" and therefore, Christians should not presume that God condemns it. They look to other quotations attributed to Jesus in the Bible, such as \"judge not lest ye be judged,\" and \"love your neighbor as yourself.\" Some Christians accept divorce, even though Jesus reportedly called for no divorce, while other Christians insist there can be no divorce, even as they permit couples to anul their marriages. Some Christians support going to war, while other Christians insist that Jesus meant \"turn the other cheek\" and that all war is contrary to God's will. Some Christians support the death penalty, while other Christians insist that Jesus opposed all killing. \n\n \n Then you yourself have just refuted the generalisation that 'Christianity is bad', which is the generalisation I find to be more prevalent.

I also thought you did say that Christians agree on what being a Christian means. If I misunderstood you, I apologize.\n\n \n Well, I do think the core teachings of Christianity are good. I guess the real question is whether or not a religion is defined solely by the behavior of its adherents, or solely by its central teachings (from it's founder), or some combination of the two. I tend to associate Christianity with Christ, so I tend to think of it in terms of it's core teachings and whether or not it's adherents live up to it. It's sort of like the old question of whether you view a political party by it's members or by it's platform.

   "I think there are parts of the Bible there is not consensus on, but I do think there are central tenets that most or all Christians agree on, that are the very core of the religion.\n\n \n That may be true, but as in arguments about the meaning of the constitution or the Declaration of Independence, different people view the meaning of the core tenets differently. For example, when it comes to turning the other cheek and loving one's enemies, I think different Christians look very differently upon what this means in practice. Some interpret the teachings of Jesus to mean that we should never kill another person or go to war. Others say there are exceptions to the teachings of Jesus, or circumstances where people should apply different standards. Some Christians regard divorce as completely unacceptable because of the teachings of Jesus, while other Christians, perhaps most, do accept divorce, and many even get divorced themselves. When it comes to how to regard gay people, Christians are also divided, particularly because Jesus never said anything about this topic. I certainly do not think that opposing equality for gay people can be a central tenet of Christianity, given this absence of any statement at all on the subject by Jesus, and it seems that some Christians have to really stretch their interpretations of the teachings of Jesus in order to claim that gay people are condemned or should be excluded from the church. \n \n It seems to me that there is more disagreement than agreement among Christians about what some of the core tenets of the faith mean in practice. And it seems that, while people do indeed fall short of their ideal in practicing their faith, there are also many Christians who have a different understanding of what their faith calls for than other Christians do. For example, many Christians insist that gay people have fallen short of the standards of Jesus and engage in sin by loving their spouses. Most gay Christians, at least the gay Christians I know, disagree with this and say that in their understanding of Christian tenets, being gay and loving one's spouse are not sins at all. Therefore, they have not fallen short, but instead have a different understanding of what the tenets of the faith call for.",

   "That's not actually what I said. I was just pointing out that a religion and it's adherents are not actually on the same page sometimes. Sometimes Christians do things despite their religion, not in the name of it.\n\n Suppose a boss ran a business whereby he dictated that people should be kind to each other. Considerate. Greet each customer with a smile.\n And if they didn't they were beaten.\n \n Obviously, the enforcement runs counter-intuitive to the desired effect.\n But in a \"Christian\" thinking manner, we could overlook the fact that the mechanism and desired outcomes are not consistent with the human mentality, and proclaim that the employees are proceeding \"despite\" the company policy.\n \n Likewise, Christianity sometimes ignores some of the more basic aspects of humanity, and the optimum way to achieve good results. Like trying to teach \"abstinence only\" when that methodology is proven to be inferior to a more balanced methodology which teaches all the options.\n \n And on some issues, Christianity has basically ignored the Bible where it has shown some of these problems. Like on the issue of women's equality, whereby if you go by the Bible dictates there are several aspects of how America does business which are clearly \"un-Christian\".\n \n \n \nIMO, Christianity in it's purest form is quite benign, and in fact benevolent. It's when it's adherents stray from it and get sidetracked by unnecessary moral issues at a political level that their focus goes in the wrong direction.\n\n That exists as well.\n But there are times when you have to question the methodology prescribed for obtaining the goal to realize that there is something inherently wrong with the approach itself.\n \n \n \nActually, applying this to gays is a good example, though not in the way you used it.\n\n And thus you're about to provide your own example.\n An example which does absolutely nothing to disprove what I was talking about, or even really address what I was talking about.\n \n But instead, change the subject...\n \n The capability to declare somebody as \"not of this group\" just because you don't like what that person did is absurd. We don't apply that standard for any other category.\n \n \n \nIn fact, if a more 'miltant-minded' Christian starts following the words of Christ, he won't be militant-minded anymore. He will be peace-minded.\n\n To some degree, I agree. Possibly with a different focus.\n Part of being \"peace-minded\" is learning when to allow another person to live their life as they see fit, even when you don't approve. Especially if the only real reason you have is disapproval...\n \n \n \nIn fact, gays are mostly given such latitude of understanding these days, but not Christians as your posts exemplify. Anti-Religion truly is the last socially-acceptable form of prejudice.\n\n And here Jyoshu delves hip deep into the bullsh!t, and dives for the bottom, digging with a shovel for China.\n \n I have given no example whereby gays are excluded from a standard that Christians are held to.\n The pretense that such a thing exists is insane. Deluding yourself away from reality.\n \n Gays are openly discriminated against. Discriminating against gays is a part political platform for Republicans. It's used as a tool to GARNER VOTES.\n \n Recently there was a \"summit\" held in conjunction with presidential candidates to talk about a variety of things. One of the big topics was different ways in which gays could be marginalized.\n \n If ANY presidential candidate ever spoke in the same way, substituting \"Christianity\" for \"gays\", it would be the end of his career.\n \n And yet you pretend that Christians are the last real source of victim-hood.\n ROFLMAO!\n \n \n \nLook, it doesn't take a lot of work to see what Jesus says for people to act like. It's not like it's hard to find out. If you see someone acting contrary to Christ's teachings, then the reasonable assumption is to assume that they are acting despite the religion, not because of it. It's not rocket science!\n\n Suppose I told you to make a bridge across a river for automobile traffic.\n And I told you to use popsicle sticks and Elmer's glue as your building tools.\n And then I criticized the results because obviously the product \"strays\" from the goals of the project...\n \n Wouldn't make any sense, would it.\n \n Too often Christianity loses sight of the goals, ignoring how the result of the work ACTUALLY is, and then criticizes the individuals failing to recognize the real fundamental flaw.",

   "Fine, then show me where the standard set by Christ is flawed. Show me where \"bless those who curse you\" is a flawed ideal, as well as admonitions to be a peacemaker, while you're at it. Oh, and while you're at it, let's hear why we shouldn't be good Samaritans too, and what's flawed about that idea.\n\n < snore <\n It's funny how you tried to slyly limit the conversation there to just \"standards set by Christ\".\n If Christians just followed \"Christ's\" standards, then those Christians who are fixated on gays wouldn't be so insistent on discriminating against gays cause Jesus never said anything about homosexuality.\n \n Oh wait. That's where the standard suddenly becomes more than just \"standard set by Christ\", ...\n \n But ignoring all the strawman arguments you pose, how about this bible passage.\n \n 1 Timothy 2\n 11A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. \n 12I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.\n \n Can you let me know when the Christian movement will start to revoke woman's suffrage?\n To strip females of the capability to be in the legislature? Or law enforcement? or ...\n \n \n \nSee, the process doesn't go wrong with the religion--it goes wrong because sometimes people fail to live up to it.\n\n And therein lies the rub.\n A refusal to question the command to meet a certain standard in a certain way.\n The concept of having the bridge is exalted, while refusing to acknowledge that it's ridiculous to build the bridge out of toothpicks.\n \n When the \"standard\" asks people to be something they aren't, or cannot be, the legitimacy of the \"standard\" should be questioned.\n But instead, despite scientific evidence and repeated demonstrations of failure, it is the people that are blamed and not the standard.\n \n Suppose you had a medical treatment whereby it failed to cure and caused much pain and suffering. Over and over and over again.\n The \"Christian\" approach you embody would condemn the people for failing the cure, and completely refuse to question the claim to the cure in the first place.\n \n Yes. The concept of a \"cure\" is great, but people shouldn't get so wrapped up in the goal of a \"cure\" that they blame the PEOPLE for failing to live up to it.\n \n \n \nMeanwhile, people like you hold them to some standard higher than the rest of humanity, and expect them to be super-human when they are just as human as you are and fail sometimes.\n\n What have I said that is as you describe here?\n \n You are completely wrong in your summary.\n My point is that it is CHRISTIANITY that sets the \"higher standard\" and \"expects them to be super-human when they are just as human\"...",
