   "In the spirit of finger pointing, accusations and finger pointing best displayed here, I present you with the following news link.\n \n FOXNews.com - SWAT Team Member Leaves Assault Rifle in Front of Utah Home - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News\n \n \nSALT LAKE CITY &#8212; A member of Salt Lake County's SWAT team left an M4 assault rifle in front of someone's home after leaving the scene of a standoff in the township of White City.\n \n Salt Lake County Sheriff's Deputy Levi Hughes says the gun was left by a veteran member of the SWAT team who forgot the weapon in the grass while packing up gear after the standoff ended.\n \n A homeowner found the rifle in the front yard of a house a few hours later and notified authorities. Hughes says an officer on patrol stopped by the home and recognized the rifle as a weapon belonging to the SWAT team.\n \n Hughes says leaving the gun behind was an unacceptable, terrible mistake. Hughes says the officer will face disciplinary action, but probably won't be fired.\n\n \n A SWAT officer, a member of the \"best of the best\" team as far as police forces go, left a weapon behind where it could've been snatched up by any two bit criminal and used on a crime spree as people were mowed down by true automatic firepower.\n \n Those of you who believe that only the military and police should have guns, you just got a kick in the teeth from this incident occurring. So quit ragging on private citizens who aren't \"perfect\" as far as you're concerned.",
