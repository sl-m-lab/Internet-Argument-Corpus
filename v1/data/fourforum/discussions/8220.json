   "Warsaw is going to limit products transit to Ukraine and Russia delivered from Western Europe. Well this announcement was made in view of Kiev and Moscow's embargo on import of Polish meat and meat foods.\n Well, to tell the truth everything is clear. The relationship between Poland and Russia is strained as a result of oil pipeline construction at the Baltic Sea bottom. So Poland's decision about the products transit limit is clear to me. But what is wrong with Ukraine? Look, the attempts of political influence under the mask of economical sanctions are growing in the world. I thought that Ukraine and Poland are old partners in policy and economy, especially after the Orange Revolution. And what has happened with our relations I wonder? \n I can find only one explanation in this situation. Poland is trying to kill two birds by one stone. They want to spite Russia first of all. And at the same time are trying to push our officials to unilaterally admit the crime of 'Volin genocide' and beat our breasts. The fact is that they accuse us of killing 30 thousand of Poles in 1943 while they are keeping mum about annihilation of 80 000 Ukranians by Polish army at that time. By one word, Poland is pressing Ukraine with economical sanctions.",
