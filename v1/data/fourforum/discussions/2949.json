   "The US is trying to make Iran drug dependent so to say. Washington has started this affair long ago and today it has become the main leverage of influence on obstinate Persians. US's attempts to fabricate Iran's nuke crime in the eyes of the international community have failed (one can also hardly treat seriously Israel's latest statements about its intention to bomb Iranian nuke center in Busher). American anxiety for violation of democratic rights and freedom in Iran also hasn't been shared by the world (we're fed up with what's going on in Iraq). However it wasn't in vain that Americans have been luring Talibs for such a long time and closed their eyes to the constantly growing drug outflow from Afghanistan. In 2001 only the bastards got $43 mln from the generous sponsor! All this proved to be useful. Moreover one of Americans' conditions for them not to meddle into struggle between the local chieftains was continuous supply of drugs to Iran and the Central Asian states. At present there are several bribed posts at the border between Iran and Afghanistan which let drug lots pass into Iran without hindrance.",
