   "A new Democratic ad questioning the Senator's backing of Bush in '04 shows portions of the firey speech where Miller was condemning George Bush and the Republicans bigtime. This was during the Democratic convention that nominated Slick Willy and statue Gore. [That was 12 years ago.]\n \n \n Now Senator Miller will nominate George Bush at the Republican convention.\n \n The Dems call this flip flopping.\n \n It seems to me that a somewhat valid defense often presented by the left in favor of John Kerry's flip flopping has been the thought that over a period of time, a man can legitimately change his mind. That argument fits here nicely, wouldn't you say? I mean it's not like Zell said he was for Kerry last week, then Bush the next.\n \n Zell saw the light in the past 12 years and recognized that Kerry and the group that follow his socialistic tendencies are bad for everything. He's doing the right thing in backing Bush.",

   "I think Mr. Miller has every right to endorse President Bush. Indeed, I think Mr. Bush is far more in line with Mr. Miller's views than Mr. Kerry is. You might label it a flipflop (of the same vein as many of Kerry's), but I think it illustrates what I've been saying all along: \"Flipflop\" is a stupid label.\n \n What WOULD be a \"bad\" flipflop would be if Mr. Miller recants his earlier praise of John Kerry as \"an authentic American hero.\" Presumably, one can support Bush on the basis of his record and ideas without joining into the gutter politics that have pervaded this election.",

I think it's more representative of learning what's really going on rather than blindly supporting only Democrats just because you're a Democrat. Zell's a fine man who refuses to put party over country.\n \n I do the same thing sometimes. I'd have voted for Leiberman had the Democrats had sense enough to nominate him.",
