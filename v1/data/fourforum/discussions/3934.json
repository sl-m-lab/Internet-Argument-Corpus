   "amen to that!!! im bi, and i fully support gay marriages. i think that some of the ways they have sex should be prevented only because of health issues that might occur, but other than that, i see no reason why gay marriages shouldnt be allowed. :p",

   "I'm not saying you have to change, or even that you can't get married. You can get married NOW, you just can't get a license for it. If you want to make a life commitment to someone, what's stopping you?\n \n I'm talking about the fact that many people don't want the standard of marriage as a civil institution broadened. (for that matter, many don't like the very fact that gay couples are together either, but that's your business and none of mine.)\n\n It doesnt matter what the population thinks. Not all laws are up to the public to decide.\n \n The only thing needed for a law to pass is politicians. So frankly, unless ur a senator or a representative, it doesn't matter what you think.\n \n I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.\n \n And if ur under the impression that politicians listen to what you have to say, understand that they don't care. The public matters only near reelection time.\n \n Oh, a question. If the public tries to install an unconstitutional law, is it still right? For instance, if all the white people in the U.S.A. decide, \"hey, i feel lazy. I don't wanna work,\" and legalize slavery again, would it be right?",

So frankly, unless ur a senator or a representative, it doesn't matter what you think.\n \n I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.\n\n \n (me)That might be the case, but the people decide who their senator or representative is, so they, inexorably, are deciding the laws. but, yes, nearly a third of the population has no say what-so-ever, in the right circumstances. \n \n [QUOTE=AlokaParyetra] And if ur under the impression that politicians listen to what you have to say, understand that they don't care. The public matters only near re-election time. [QUOTE]\n \n \n (me)On the contrary, only a stupid politican would ignore the public, because it will jepordize his chances in the next election. They might not care about each and every orginization, or each and every little complaint, but they listen to the orginizations and complaints that are either large in numbers, or have good advertizing opportunities. (i.e., helping out a church center to make him/her look noble and caring, ect.)\n \n \nOh, a question. If the public tries to install an unconstitutional law, is it still right? For instance, if all the white people in the U.S.A. decide, \"hey, i feel lazy. I don't wanna work,\" and legalize slavery again, would it be right?\n\n \n (me)I agree that there have not been enough laws made to protect the general public from those types of things happening again, but take a look at the people in power; they have not gotten to thier posistions by having prejudice, or other extreme behaviors. With this brought to light, i think that its safe to say that the government is a lot better off than it has been, and that even though those things still rattle on throughout our country, it will eventually, inevitably die out until the only feelings close to prejudice are simple quarrls between school children.\n \n ( i previewed this post, and the quotes are messed up, sorry.)",

   "Too bad--people don't have to give up their religious beliefs to pacify you. Deal with it, and drop the god-complex while you're at it.\n\n \n Who is asking you to give up your religious beliefs? No one that I know of. It would seem, however, that you wish to impose YOUR religious beliefs on others!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \n \n \nNope, and your vitriol doesn't get you anywhere. Oh, in case you haven't noticed, there are no ballot initiatives for violence against gays. Only protecting the institution of marriage.\n\n \n You are REALLY hung up on your concept of marriage as an \"institution\"\n \n \n \n \nNo need to, as you aren't even arguing the whole issue. You simply want to keep it limited to one facet, the legal one. You don't get to decide that. You don't get to decide what religious views people hold to and what they don't. Sorry! :) \n\n \n NEWS FLASH!!!!!! NEITHER DO YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \n \n \nIronic since the only one all hot and bothered here is you. \n \n How 'Phelpsian' of you.\n\n \n \"Hot and bothered\"?

I don't wanna work,\" and legalize slavery again, would it be right?\n\n \n It's a good question, but the key word is \"unconstitutional\" which has to be decided by a court. If a law is deemed unconstitutional by the highest court (and sometimes by amendment), then I would agree with you, but there is no way to legally determine if a law is unconstitutional until the court has determined it. We know that slavery is unconstitutional NOW because it was deemed so by the Emancipation Proclamation and the 14th Amendment. It was not unconstitutional in the early 1800s, and in fact several of our country's revered founding fathers owned slaves.\n \n It's easy to call something like slavery wrong in hindsight from a 21st century perspective,but if you had lived in the culture of the late 1700s, you might well have had slaves yourself. No, that doesn't make it right, but the cultural standards of what is right and wrong have changed over the years.\n \n With that said, I don't think slavery analogizes opposition to gay marriage very well at all. In fact in some ways, the moral indignation toward slavery analogizes the current moral indignation over gay marriage.",
