   "Conservatives talk a lot about how they support free markets. This, however, is fraud. Conservatives do not support free markets - here's why:\n \n Conservatives, first and foremost, support state moralism. They believe that the government has the right to force everyone to conform to what society thinks is \"decent,\" regardless of individual rights.\n \n Some of the moralism they advocate is a direct violation of the free market. For example, the War on Drugs violates the free-market right of people to produce and sell goods - in this case, drugs. The Eighteenth Amendment - the apex of conservative moralistic tyranny - prohibits the \"manufacture, sale, or transportation\" of alcohol. That is economic freedom being destroyed.\n \n But even in principle, conservatism is incompatible with the laissez-faire ideal. Central to conservatism is an opposition to self-ownership; a belief that human life is owned by God (religious conservatism) or society (secular conservatism.) When such a principle becomes law, the free market is destroyed. If the state can control the personal lives of individuals, then it can joystick demand, and thus exercise a control over the market more severe than that which the liberals advocate.\n \n Personal freedom is a precondition for economic freedom. There can be no free market without free people.",
