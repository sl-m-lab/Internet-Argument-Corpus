Now with Obama in office we can't just pull out like it never happened, that would cause more trouble in the end. We have allies among the Afghan people, if we pull out without making sure the Taliban is gone they will simply take over control and we would in effect be responsible for more deaths.

In the 10 years of your aging and maturity no companies when back in time to engineer wars with Iraq and Afghanistan.\n \n \n9/11 was planned...duh?\n\n by those you were attributing the wars to... duh\n \n \nAnd no, corporate greed did not precipitate the national emotion...it took advantage of it. \n\n I don't deny that those that could took advantage of the wars did but that is hardly surprising, what I am saying is that they did not cause the wars so it is absurd to say they were the reason why we went to war.\n \n The cause is the reason and the cause was 9/11 and the threat of terrorism in general. This is like a guy noticing that his view is better after a tree fell, but then claiming that his non-existent wish manifested in a storm to knock it down.\n \n \nReally? Try again. Oil, construction and engineering, intelligence, IT, security, transportation, etc etc. You're fooling yourself if you believe only \"weapons dealer and mercenariers\" benefit. I have friends that have gone to Iraq, Afghanistan, and \"other places\" as firefighters and paramedics and they have made a small fortune every year they were there (tax free as well). A firefighter/EMT friend of mine who worked as an EMT for about 35-40k a year and served as a volunteer firefighter went to Iraq and brought home 140k dollars tax free for 9 months in country. As far as I know...he is neither a weapons dealer or a mercenary. War is profitable for a wide margin of people.\n \n You would need a pay increase like that to get people to go to a foreign country for 9 months and live in dangerous conditions.\n \n \nAQ, Bin Laden, the Taliban, and islamic extremism were and in most cases continue to be threats. That takes nothing away from the fact that we probably could have dealt with these threats differently, and now that we have the benefit of 10 years of knowledge and perspective...one can clearly see that they were and continue to be inefficient means of dealing with these threats. \n \n Bin Laden would not have been captured without those two wars and you would have to be quite ignorant not to realize that. The threat to the united states has gone down, no one expected it to disappear. What bush hoped would happen did happen. The changes in Iraq and Afghanistan sparked democratic feelings in other middle eastern countries once they saw it was stable. The goals bush set for his admin have been met. Yet people still act like they were on the fly excuses. They were on the fly but no more excuse than the original 'defend the nation'. 'Saving' the Iraqi and afghani people and finding WMD were the means to the goal stated. People pretend as if national defense stopped being the issue then it became WMD's then it became the welfare of arab nations. You don't fight a war in one dimension. The people who carried out these policies firmly believed that terrorist aren't recruited in free democracies, so a free democratic middle east was the 'final solution'. WMD's were the focus of anti-terrorism efforts and only crazy people think that they ever 'let up' on finding bin laden.\n \n \nI support nationalism and capitalism...but I in no way feel it is essential to destroy other countries, kill innocent men and women, and risk the lives of our men and women in uniform to feed these concepts. Nationalism and capitalism can thrive during peacetime too, ya know?\n\n Capitalism thrives exclusively during peace time. A soldier produces nothing but death in war, it is only the security in peace that necessitates their existance for a capitalist country.\n \n I don't give a hoot about nationalism, unlike most lefties that does not mean I care about every one's nationalism but the U.S. I don't care about anyone's. I would see every nation in the world dissolved right now if it would mean freedom and peace. The way things are going the U.S. is shaping up to be a real enemy of freedom anyway.\n \n As for war, the wars (again) were not about capitalism but about self-defense. The innocent civilian ____ is meaningless drivel. A war has hardly been conducted with such respect for non-combatants property and health as these. \n \n \nNotice I never used the term \"imperialism\". \n\n Notice I said 'they'.\n \n \nGood job knocking down your own strawman.\n\n Thanks, good job for not being there :)",

Although it is clear you are trying to be unoffensive, I still have a criticism of your post emoticon_xangel. I don't think you should hold back because you are afraid of offending anyone. If you can make the case, any American you make it to should only be offended (a derivation of guilt in this case) if they personally supported the imperialistic actions.\n \n Second the government is not one entity, most of it can behave a-morally most of the time but that doesn't mean no one makes any decisions considering morality. In fact this world would be even more screwed up (if you can imagine) if governments were truly a-moral. Democracies especially reflect the morals of their people. I never meant to argue that the U.S. acted as some altruistic super-man teddy bear hybrid never acting for it's own benefit. If we have a problem it's that too many people think that's what we should be aiming at. That being said we have committed serious resources towards the direct benefit of other nations and peoples. The reasons why we did that are what we argue about. People like me pretty much follow this quote: \"'Tis a common observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own.\" - Benjamin Franklin. From which it seems pretty clear that in failing to fight for mankinds liberty we endanger our own.\n \n Some however see virtue in altruism and would just love to claim that no American would ever get anything out of it. It is to such people that the other benefits they see are seen as threats to the altruistic nature of foreign action. To these people it makes it immoral to fight for the freedom of Iraqis if America could get cheaper gas or be safer from terrorism by the same act.\n \n Then there are the pseudo-pacifist, pseudo-pacifism (although they will not admit it) is the flip side of nationalism. A pseudo-pacifist on the surface claims that no fighting is good, no invasion is good. Even purely humanitarian efforts must be avoided because any foreign action could get you into a fight (like Somalia). They however support policing inside one country. The ultimate implication is that within the inarguably arbitrary territories of nations there exists the need to protect people but not between nations. Such people recognize the rights of an abstract nation above those of the individuals in it. TBH these people are the most offensive to me. They will ignore the most heinous evil on the grounds that it's their own problem based on meaningless cultural and historic differences of the region. An idea that was only practical for americans when the ocean was a defense, but whose soundness was always questionable. How short would WWII have been if such people hadn't prevailed at first? No one cared about the fascist, it was a German-Japanese-Italian problem after all.\n \n Finally I will try to watch that, I am an objectivist and will probably find it interesting. I would like to point out that Rand was hardly an active foreign policy person. It seems to me she would rather just stay put and watch everything go to hell so long as America was protected. I think she had a mistaken notion that freeing people was altruistic. She was dead sure that the soviets were to incompetent to wage war on the west. From her books and interviews you can be sure her plan to deal with communism and collectivism in general was to sit back and watch it rot to dust.\n \n In summation it was not the aggression of the U.S. I was contending it was the idea that direct profit motive had any power to trigger it.\n \n edit I can't view the video from here, on the bright side I found out primeval has new episodes :)",

   "Freedom..regarding my assertion that Rands philosophy is aimed at the more able people if not the elite in society.\n YouTube - &#x202a;Ayn Rand Interview with Tom Snyder, (1 of 3)&#x202c;&rlm;\n 9 min 20sec\n \n Rand 'I dont think I would want to attract as many people as religions do.'\n\n She probably meant she wouldn't want to attract people in the same way, plus this is late in her life and she has already been accused of being a cult leader. She may be emphasizing that there is nothing about her personally that is inherent in objectivism. In that context this could mean something more like 'I am not a pope'.\n \n She said \"I regard the spread of Objectivism through today's culture as an intellectual movement-i.e., a trend among independent individuals who share the same ideas-but not as an organized movement.\"\n \n I have read several places where she has said that everyone needs philosophy and you can be sure she meant objectivism. Anything else is just a bit of propaganda trying to paint her as some machiavellian figure. It hardly needs to be said because everything about her view on objectivism reeks a of a total lack of classism. You don't need to explicitly remind people you mean 'everyone' when you talk about 'man' not 'poor people' or 'capitalist'.",

   "I disagree .I think she said what she meant, that she did not want to attract as many people as religions do..she didnt mean herself she meant her doctrine.\n\n Alright if we are being all literal note the word 'I' refers to one's self not one's philosophy.\n \n \nI think that she accepted that societies need an elite and a proleteriat but obviously could not openly say it.\n\n She accepted that not everyone was a genius and some people would have to make a living other ways. She accepted this but not with the same connotations that words like elite and proletariat carry with them. She certainly didn't believe in different philosophies, laws, or rights for men depending on how much they produced. She said that any work done by a thinking mind is productive work. I am glad you are buying atlas shrugged, pay attention to Bill Brent, Jeff Allen, Wet Nurse (Tony), and especially Edwin \"Eddie\" Willers (the book starts with him if I remember).\n \n \n \nShe was not as all embracing as you seem to suggest.\n\n Who she wants to associate with is not who philosophy applies to. She couldn't claim that it doesn't 'embrace' everyone even if she wanted to since every single defense of the thing was done in the abstract on near universal human traits. Luckily she never did.\n \n \nThere is a clip on youtube where she rejects the notion that a woman should be POTUS and says something like' if we should stoop so low' then justifies it by saying that women could be senators or congresswomen but never the head of the the armed forces.\n\n What do her sexual fantasies have to do with reality?",

You will see it in the novels too. I am sure it is just as I said sexual fantasy though.\n \n I wouldn't (and didn't) take that statement very seriously because of this.",

Hey, you are a conservative aren't you?\n \n\n \n \"George Bush sent troops to the Middle East in response to 9-11, and now that they did their job under the administration who's president spent his campaign promising to pull them out, the terrorists got angry and retaliated.

   "The answer to the problem should have been applied at the beginning, now their is not much anyone can do about it without making a big mess.\n \n If we simply abandoned Iraq and Afghanistan right now both economies would probably crash, both countries would fall under the rule of the religious retards and many innocent people would suffer.\n \n What would you do?\n\n \n I'd pull out, but make sure the US keeps its guard up. That would greatly military spending, which we desperately need to do. We have too many of our own problems to be spending money on foreign countries.\n \n Anyway, terrorists already have the support of most people in Islamic Countries throughout the Middle East. In Guerrilla warfare, if you have the support of the people, you've already won. Those people want Islamic fundamentalist theocratic government, and we can't legislate their attitudes away. Those people are asking for Islamic rule, so there's no point in postponing the inevitable.",
