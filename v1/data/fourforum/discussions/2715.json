   "To RushTFE:\n i believe that everything happens for a reasons but i dont know what that reason is.... emoticon_frazzled\n \n It all depends on what you believe as to our origins as to what you believe the meaning of life is and whether everything happens for a reason. I personally believe that everything happens for a reason. I believe the meaning of life is to love, and to know the Love of God. For it is expressed many times throughout the Bible that God made us out of love - not out of hatred, not because He wanted to be like a nasty kid on the top of an ant hill with a magnifying glass, nor even because He was bored and wanted something to do, he made us out of love so that we could love Him and that He could in turn love us. \n \n I believe that the reason why we have so many youth susicides in Australia and else where is that they think that they aren't anything special, that they aren't loved and so on, that they are just \"rearranged pondscum\". But the Bible teaches us that we are special, so special that He sent His Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for us. I've been dealt a few \"hard cards\" and I'm sure that if I thought that I didn't have a purpose, i.e. just an accident, that I would have killed myself before. Knowing the love of Jesus, however, has stopped me from trying. I am now moving on with my life...",
