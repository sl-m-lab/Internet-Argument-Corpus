   "My biggest concern about Obama is that a lot of people seem to be treating him like the 2nd coming or something--a political messiah, rather than engaging in a healthy dose of skepticism. Obama is a darling of the media right now. Bush is a rather unpopular president, but my fear is that people are going to just jump to the first candidate that looks really promising just because they're ready for someone else. I don't want to see the country get into some 'anyone-but-Bush' mode, even if we do need someone other than Bush. We still need to be picky. Whoever we get will be our president for at least 4 years, maybe 8. I will say that, at this point, I'm more comfortable with Obama than Hillary Clinton. I think Obama (between the two) might be the less polarizing person.",

   "Everyone is talking about Hilary's potential polarizing effect as the main issue with her. This could be a problem, but I take issue with her record more than anything else. Voting for the war and demanding more troops there up until she decided to run. Now she's not saying she regrets her vote, but she's changed her tune on the sending more troops because it is politically expedient.\n She also has been big on fighting things like violent and sexual video games. It's not that I don't think these are not so great things, I just don't think it's congress' place and I think it's a waste of valuable time.\n \n Obama's lack of experience in Washington has become quite appealing to tell you the truth.

   "\n Obama's lack of experience in Washington has become quite appealing to tell you the truth. He feels less tainted.\n\n \n Yeah, I've been going back and forth on that. Experience in DC means two things, it seems to me. First, you know how things work. You know the procedures, you know which department does what, you know who's in charge of what agency, etc. If Obama doesn't have a handle on all that by now, I'm assuming he'll fill in the gaps soon enough. Secondly, it means being part of the network. You know people, they know you. You owe them favors, they owe you. This can help in getting things done, or it can lead to, for example, unqualified people being put in charge of important agencies as a return on past favors. The longer someone works in DC the more people have hooks in them, the more IOUs they have outstanding. I'm not sure that being in DC another 6 years would make Obama a more attractive candidate.",
