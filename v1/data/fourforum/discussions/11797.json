Putting money in the pockets of the wealthy might mean more investment somewhere down the line, but will just as likely be spent on an imported yacht or fuel for a private jet.\n\n \n A very minimal portion of the cost of constructing a facility of any kind actually goes into the workers pocket, the majority of the funds go into the builders pocket. I used to be in the construction field, and this is what I learned, The average cost of a house in my area is $750,000 bucks, it takes about two weeks on average to build this house, start to finish. You have your framers, roofers, plumbers, electricians, brick layers, sheet rockers, painters, concrete workers, and inspectors. Most of these workers consist of two people, 2 electricians, two plumbers,etc. Anyhow, the total amount of workers on a house never exceed 30, and if every worker is making twenty five bucks an hour, and a lot of them dont make that, you get a total of 60,000 dollars spent on labor. Then you have the cost of the property, which averages about 40,000 dollars, and the final cost of about 70,000 dollars for materials and minimal other costs, you get a grand total of 170,000 dollars for this house. That leaves 580,000 dollars going into somebodys pocket, and it sure aint the guys making 25 bucks an hour. In short, Obama will only hurt the guy making 25 bucks an hour. Think about this, Obama says he wants to give a tax break to individuals making less than 250,000 dollars a year, but how is he really going to help a person in this range? Is he going to send us a monthly check in the form of a tax refund, is he going put us in a smaller sales tax bracket, is merchandise going to cost less for us, are we going to have to pay less property taxes than the guy next door making over 250,000 dollars a year, or are we going to have less taxes on our income than the guy who makes over 250,000 a year. None of this is going to happen, because it would be unfeasible to do this. The only thing that would be true would be the taxes on ones income, and we already pay less taxes than the guy who makes more money. All these promises by Obama are lies and empty promises, and people are being mislead into believing it.

The rich are, finally, going to have to pay their way for the services they gotten either free or at very low cost from our tax-financed services at all levels, police protection, the protection of the courts, roads, bridges, infrastructure, etc., and the increased money will, I hope, be used to lower the debt that Bush incurred in order to lower taxes on the rich.\n \n Obama also wants to create American jobs instead of outsourcing them overseas. Outsourcing was done by the Bush administration in order that the very rich could have access to slave labor in China and elsewhere. Unfortunately, they were stupid and didn't realize that jobless Americans would be unable to pay off their mortgages and buy goods.\n \n Obama wants to see working people paid a living wage so that they can afford to buy, to consume American goods, so they can afford to pay off their mortgages, send their kids to college, do all the things that are part of the American dream that Bush has so carefully dismantled.\n \n Obama wants our nation to become America, the land of opportunity for all, again.\n \n Only anti-Americans would have a problem with that.\n\n \n If Obama can find a way of producing the goods that America buys from the third world at the same price or cheaper, good for him!\n Obviously no government can, so what does the new administration do, import ban , import duties?\n Obama can increase the taxes on the rich then decide what to do with it but as for producing cheap American goods without Americans recieving far less wages, please explain.",

   "If my argument is utterly groundless as you say then prove it. And show where community public works projects will be stifled by McCain's plan at all. The fact is that my scenario above isn't theoretical, but an economic fact. Why do you think the economy crashed under Carter? He had the same basic plan as Obama. And times weren't even that bad when he started out. Obama will bring our economy to a standstill, as growth goes. HERE, Obama Vs. Carter Vs. Mondale - Capital Commerce (usnews.com) see if you can tell their economic speeches apart from each other.\n\n \n In a recession the worst thing you can do is cut spending and cut taxes. The UK did this under Thatcher and Major and it caused the two deepest recessions in modern British history, it pushed more and more people out of work and decimated entire areas of the country. When the economy picked up in the mid 80s the boom lasted barely 2 years before crashing again. It was only when Labour introduced a modicum of redistribution in the form of Working Families Tax Credit and the minimum wage that the economy took off.",

You must replace attacking someone in favor of reasoning with them. It is the nature of what your side represents. How about you disprove these economic realities?\n \n \n \n Do you really believe that raising the taxes on the rich who already pay over 90% of all taxes in this country, will actually trickle down to better lives for the average joe? Are you so ignorant as to not realize that when taxes are raised on the corporation who manufacture all of our consumer products, 3 specific results always occur?\n 1) They raise prices so we pay more as the end users.\n 2) they lay off workers as we cut back on spending due to higher costs.\n And 3) they move their manufacturing facilities overseas where labor and costs are lower.\n \n So they don't just submit to the higher taxes like the lemmings which you sheeple who are following Obama do. They pass the higher costs onto the consumer and find cheaper ways to produce at the workers expense.\n \n As for the wealthy executives who earn millions a year and who pay the second highest percentage of taxes already on Earth; by raising their taxes more, they will just stop buying luxury items which will lead to more layoffs in those industries, thereby deepening the unemployment rate further. \n \n Of course you will ignore these facts in favor of supporting your messiah. Like I said yesterday, you leftists wont realize what your support for Obama means until you feel his knife in your back.\n",

   "Obama wants the rich to pay their fair share. A far higher percentage of the incomes of the poor goes into taxes than does the income of the super rich.\n \n Huh? The rich already pay a huge share of taxes. By definition, if a person is \"poor,\n \" they pay NO taxes at all. Not true. In many cases the Poor pay an oppressive food or basic necessity tax on all the goods they consume. That means whether there is a tax cut or not it will be of no use to them. What Obama truly wants is redistribute wealth. Instead of taking from the poor to enrich the already rich? Take from the rich and give to the poor. That never works because you are essential giving people incentives on staying poor. No. It means that the poor can see that they or their children are positioned and educated to lift themselves out of poverty.\n \n From the labors of the poor. The poor working person creates wealth through his or her labors.\n \n Partly true, but the people who run the business are the ones that truly make the company grow. You're forgetting about the labors of workers that makes it possible for a company to grow. Labor is intrinsically linked to all aspects of creating wealth. And, there have been many cases of those who run a business stealing the ideas of their workers without benefiting those workers for their ideas, and they, those who own the company selfishly benefit from the ideas they have stolen from others. If they made bad decisions the laborers would be out of work. No. If CEOs make bad decisions, they get enormous bonuses nevertheless and are always rewarded with gold or platinum parachutes. In other words it's both that create wealth not just the working person.\n \n Labor produces wealth. If labor is well-compensated, it has the assets to consume and buy.\n \n Again without the brains labor is nothing. See my previous arguments.\n \n The super rich do not need to make so much profit, especially if they profit by exploiting the labors of poor working people. A decrease in profits for the very rich plus a small increase for the cost of labor will not add that much to prices -- and the working poor will not be so poor any more and they will be able to pay higher prices.\n \n Incorrect. If the owners of the companies cannot make more money they cannot grow. Simple as that. Exploiting? You make it seem so easy, when in fact it is not. An increase will in labor will always drive up the costs prices regardless. A company exists to grow and expand. It simply cannot stay in the same position or it risks closed.  If that's true, why do companies and businesses almost always need a line of credit in order to maintain and grow? If simple wealth creates more wealth, why are businesses being stalled by the current financial crisis?\n \n Better to pay a little more for goods made in the U.S. than to be poisoned by goods made very cheaply in China by slave labor.\n \n Then don't buy Chinese made goods. You have a choice you know. BTW, your ideas are almost if not similar to Communist ones. It would be great if things worked out that way, unfortunately they do not. You simply cannot achieve such a thing as long as we remain human.\n\n \n I always look at labels to avoid buying Chinese-made goods. I ask at my grocery store for information on the source of food I wish to buy. I never, ever shop at Wal-mart because most of Wal-mart's goods are imported from China.",
