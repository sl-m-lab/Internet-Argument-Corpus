According to the article roughly 70% of tax payers are eligible. As far as I can tell it is just online tax prep software provided by companies like intuit (the TurboTax/Quicken people) that does your taxes. In fact, the Intuit free file program IS turbotax. \n \n It seems like most people who qualify are not going to have very complex tax returns...mostly W-2 earnings with a little investment and mortgage interest tossed in. Thats simple enough...why pay somebody to do it?",

Why wait 1 more month to get a bigger return, when you can take a 10% hit up front and get it now.\n \n People in general are lazy and stupid",

   "So, in other words, stupidity. That fits pretty well with my experiences when it comes to the American taxpayer in general.\n \n I did a little researching after I read that article and apparently if you Efile and opt to have your refund direct deposited into your bank account you can get it back in as little as 9 days. That is pretty quick. I can't help but wonder if that will cut into the refund loan cash cow at all. \n \n Personally, I always owe. I don't see any point to making interest free loans to uncle sam. \n \n I posted this same question on another forum and several people came back with \"taxes are complicated....\" I have to wonder if they have ever seen a 1040 before, becuase it is not any more complicated than filling out a credit card application and we know that Americans certainly have no problem getting those filled out. For most americans, taxes amount to copying your W2 information onto the 1040 and then taking the standard deduction.\n \n I would urge anybody who quailifies to use the freefile system. Just give it a shot. IF you get to the end and don't think that it is right, you don't have to transmit it...you can always go back and pay a tex prep guy to ask you the exact same questions and put it into the exact same program.\n \n Hell, I will do it for you for $100 AND give you a refund anticipation loan at only 650% APR (which is that most refund loans cost if you annualized them).",

   "Plus the average American has a completely unfounded fear of the IRS. Having a CPA do your taxes alleviates that fear. The likelyhood of a the IRS comming after the average tax payer for screwing up and getting away with a few grand is really quite low especially since the IRS is overworked and understaffed. People cheat all the time and get away with it. But it is the fear of the IRS that pushes many to pay exorbiant fees for the simplest of returns.",
