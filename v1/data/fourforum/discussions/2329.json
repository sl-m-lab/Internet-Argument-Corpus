Doesn't the MO/KS dispute precede the Civil War?\n\n Yes, the MO/KS dispute did begin prior to the Civil War and then became part and parcel of the greater conflict after the outbreak of hostilities. His main contribution to tactics is on small group tactics. He pioneered the division of a fighting force into small groups (10-15) which operate independent of the chain of command, but towards the larger, group objective. Sort of what we see today in terror \"cell\" makeup. In addition, he brought to bear the concept of the hit and run attack with overwhelming firepower. While the Federal troops were using single shot rifles, Quantrill's Raiders would attack a platoon or a company with each man bursting from the underbrush on horseback (for speed and manoeuvring) armed with (in general) 2-3 revolvers, 1-2 sawed off shotuguns and either a machete or a sabre. This allowed the raiders to attack, dump nearly 15x the amount of lead on their enemies in a few minutes and then escape again on horseback while the Federal foot soldiers were still dazed from the ambush. Pretty advanced stuff for Quantrill's time, Interesting guy too, I recommend checking out one of his biographies, they are pretty wild",

   "Most effective: \"Uncle Billy\", William T. Sherman, who brought the fight to where it belonged: in the front yard and homes of the rebels. \n \n Too bad the lesson hasn't been properly digested by some.\n\n \n I beg to differ. I take it you have not studied the history of Sherman as told by many of his contemporaries. You are correct in assessing that Sherman is one of the pioneers of the doctrine of total war. The devastation he wrought was unlike any the country had ever seen including the sack of D.C. in the War of 1812. Sherman's men showed utter disregard for the citizens of the CSA in respect to property and life. His campaign was one of the darkest times in American History in respect to the military code of ethics and collateral damage. I suppose you would also argue that Hitler or Stalin were effective leaders because they mananged to silence all dissent against their regimes and retain power over their nations without having to worry about popular support. His actions would be equivalent to our troops currently assault the Holy Mosque at Najaf and destroying most the surrounding Holy Shrine. We could follow that action up marching into the country side and destroying the any farmers' property that had supplied the Mehdi army. I encourage anyone who gets the chance to visit this area of Georgia to notice how many pre Civil War structures there are compared to other regions in the South that Sherman didn't touch.\n \n I have enclosed several excerpts from a detailed analysis of the General's most famous campaign, the siege of Atlanta and March to the Sea.\n \n http://www.law.emory.edu/EILR/volumes/fall95/robisch.html\n \n War Crimes that were not addressed by Sherman.\n On one occasion, south of Atlanta near Jonesboro, a brigade of Union infantry fought for possession of a portion of one of the railroads in order to destroy a section of track.[52] Before being overpowered by the Union brigade's superior numbers, the defending Confederate forces inflicted a number of casualties on the attacking federal troops.[53] Once Union victory appeared inevitable, a great many of the rebels, recognizing that further resistance was futile, threw down their weapons and attempted to surrender.[54] Some federal soldiers, however, continued to fire at these capitulating rebels or stabbed them with their bayonets in apparent retaliation for the casualties suffered by the infantry earlier in the engagement.[55] Union buglers had to sound the \"cease fire\" order several times before the killing stopped.[56] A federal soldier who observed this incident described the scene as a \"slaughter the like of which I never witnessed before and I pray that I may never see again.\"[57]\n \n In a description of Sherman's troops behavior:\n Nevertheless, arson and looting became so common that a biographer sympathetic to Sherman characterized the march as a month-long Halloween celebration.\n \n The march to the sea ended at Savannah on the Atlantic coast in mid-December 1864.[260] In his official report of the march, Sherman estimated the total damage done by his men at $100,000,000, a huge sum in 1864.[261] Of that amount, he judged that twenty percent represented the military advantage for the Union and that the remainder was \"simple waste and destruction.\"[262]",

   "Tactical Generals: Longstreet was one of the best. He was the one of the first advocates of trench warfare and if he had his way the face to face combat of most of the war would have never occured. Forrest was a masterful tactician who pioneered hit and run and guerilla warfare. Grant was one of the first generals to recognize that a war of attrition can decimate an enemy that is tactically superior but numerically and logisticall inferior.\n \n Leaders: Lee enjoyed a charismatic following that few generals have ever known. He had old school ethics and was capable of getting his men to follow him into the depths of hell. Admiral Farragut was also a great leader in this respect, he understood that leading your men by example spurs men to do greater things then they thought they were capable of. \"Damn the torpedoes!

At the very bottom in the conclusion it says that although most modern standards of just war activities were enacted after this period, this is what we must judge a general by in history. If you wish to make the point that the man was a great tactician or leader then you must also be willing to accept that person's flaws in their strategy. The author concedes at the end that Sherman's actions violated current military codes and accepted laws of armed conflict. \n \n The most compassionsate? I am beginning to doubt you even read past the introduction. Sherman shelled Atlanta b/c he figured most of the citizens had simply left. He even bragged about his ability to hit any house he wanted to in the city. His cavalry shelled the town of Macon, GA without giving it any warning and with no intetion of occupying the city. Such a saint...\n \n At the bottom of the page it explains the legality of Sherman's campaign, in the conclusion:\n \n \n \"Although contemporary legal standards would not compel General Sherman to make major changes in the basic operational approaches he employed in his Atlanta campaign and the march to the sea, he would need to modify his tactics greatly in order to attain compliance with the current law of war. Specifically, the general should have paid greater attention to the rights of noncombatants, which include both civilians and enemy prisoners of war; he should have afforded greater respect for private property and the procedures applicable to a military force's use or seizure of such property; he should have taken appropriate, proactive steps to exercise better control of his soldiers in order to prevent them from committing unlawful acts and to prosecute those soldiers who did commit unlawful acts; and he should have seriously considered the proportionality of his actions. For example, the degree of destruction or damage to legitimate military targets must outweigh the resulting incidental damage to nonmilitary personnel and structures. Had the general considered these possibilities in 1864, his operations in Georgia and his army would enjoy a very different historical reputation.\"\n \n Clearly the man's actions are not looked upon as a shining example of military operations. We must take into account the rules of war at the time but at the same time realize that rules against this specific activity had not been made because no military action like this had taken place in American history.",

   "I understand the argument that you are trying to make, however we disagree on Sherman's tactics. \n\n \n Just to underline my point: Sherman undoubtedly understood the sheer insanity of much of the tactics employed in the Civil War, which consisted of charging an enemy who was waiting behind fortified and entrenched positions. That he innovatively sought to attack elsewhere, and preferred to burn a poor schmuck's barn down rather than kill his son, has only earned him the South's contempt. He made them howl, but we are to believe they preferred death to howling. A survivor can say such things. A great-grandson can say such things easier.

What exactly was his contribution?\n\n \n When I say face to face I am referring to the combat that occured when both sides would line up or march across a field from one another and fire en masse into their oppenents ranks. Longstreet wasn't a fan of this combat.\n \n Soldiers die in war, no one can disagree with that point until we get robots to do all our fighting for us. Defense strategies can't be blamed for deaths per se, it actually falls on the shoulders of the attackers when they assault such a position. Your reasoning would blame the inventor of the machine gun for millions of deaths.\n \n He was best able to illustrate these tactics on a grand scale in the siege of St. Petersburg and the defense of Richmond. If you get a chance to read about that point in the war it is quite interesting stuff.\n \n http://www.wordiq.com/definition/James_Longstreet\n \n \nAs a general, Longstreet showed a clear preference for defensive fighting, preferring to position his troops in strong defensive positions and compel the enemy to attack him. Once the enemy had worn itself down, then and only then would Longstreet contemplate an attack of his own. In fact, troops under his command never lost a defensive position during the war. His record as an offensive tactician was a mixed bag, however, and he often clashed with the highly aggressive Lee on the subject of the proper tactics to employ in battle.\n",
