   "Hi Easyrider,\n The one thing we can always count on with the skeptics and Christ deniers is their ability to corrupt and deny the history which the bible so accurately records. After all, that is what the Old Testament is and the Jew was always credited prior to this century with being the best disciplined and most accurate record keepers in the ancient world. \n \n Most claims against the Bible by secularists and atheists are arguments of lack of evidence, that is the claim is based on the assumption that the Bible is wrong until evidence is found to prove it right. This is a fallacy that ignores the fact that evidence may exists but has yet to be discovered, or that evidence has been destroyed by time or acts of man. A good example is the fact that Jerusalem has been destroyed and rebuilt at least twice, and thus much useful evidence would have been destroyed, and deliberately so. History has shown that when new evidence is found it supports the Biblical account. So it is by fallacious arguments that the deniers continue to reject the fact that no evidence has ever been discovered which specifically and directly proves the bible wrong. And these are the very arguments you are getting here and have and will continue to get from tremor. After all, that is the only direction he can argue from since he has no evidence from history or archeology at all to support his denials of reality. Here's an excerpt from another link which conveys my opinion of the skeptics tactics very well.\n In the nineteenth century the acceptance of evolutionary theory and the application of higher criticism in religion resulted in the Bible being cast as a work of theological fiction. Its history was regarded as legend and its miracles as myths. This radical reassessment of Scripture was argued in part on the absence in the historical record of peoples in the Older Testament such as the Hittites. And because their linkage in the biblical text with larger-than-life personages like Abraham, David, and Solomon, these figures of faith were likewise rendered suspect. Moses was also said to be a myth because critical scrutiny deemed aspects of his biblical description as unhistorical. One reason for this supposed lack of historical reliability was the biblical statement that Moses had written the Torah (Deuteronomy 31:24). The scholarly consensus was that Moses must have been illiterate since the ancient Egyptians were thought to have delegated the work of writing to scribes. As a result, neither kings nor commoners learned the art. The Newer Testament was also regarded with equal criticism. It was viewed as the product of later ecclesiastical invention, with the Gospel of John offered as a prime example of a second century document of Gentile origin.\n \n This momentum of scriptural skepticism could not be sustained. With the advent of the twentieth century the pendulum swung back toward an affirmation of biblical legitimacy. Even as the nineteenth century came to a close a return to biblical conservatism was forcing its way forward with discoveries such as that of the ancient capital of the Hittite Empire at Boghaz-K\u00f6y (Hattusha) along with more than 10,000 clay tablets chronicling its prodigious civilization! No longer were the Hittites a non-existent race nor were there grounds for excising the Patriarchs from plausibility as being equally historical. There also emerged from ancient Egypt a set of cosmetic tablets depicting King Narmer of the first dynasty (3100 B.C.). On one of the tablets the image of the king is revealed holding writing tablets, confirming that this first of Egypt&#8217;s dynastic pharaoh&#8217;s was literate. And since Moses had been educated in \"all the learning of the Egyptians\" (Acts 7:22), he must have also been well versed in this scribal skill.\n \n Then at the mid-point of the century came the monumental discovery in caves along the shores of the Dead Sea of biblical and Jewish sectarian manuscripts. Analysis of the sectarian documents from the area of Qumran (dated from 152 B.C. to A.D.68) brought to light numerous parallels with vocabulary and theological viewpoints in the Newer Testament. This comparison argued not only for a first century date of composition for the Newer Testament, but also for its Jewish authorship. As a result the Gospel of John, formerly showcased by scholars as an expression of Gentile syncretism, was re-classified as the most Jewish of the Gospels! Finally, with the establishment of the State of Israel and a new generation of Israeli archaeologists, evidence of the Jewish past in the Holy Land was increasingly being unearthed. Following the lead of such pioneering figures as Yigael Yadin, who boasted that he went into the field \"with a spade in one hand and a Bible in the other,\" Israelis paraded before a watching world the rock witness of their biblical heritage. Accordingly, the twentieth century closed with major newsmagazines touting in cover stories the discoveries of the century as having offered archaeological confirmation of the Bible. Jack Cottrell represented this optimism by stating: \"Through the wealth of data uncovered by historical and archaeological research, we are able to measure the Bible&#8217;s historical accuracy. In every case where its claims can be thus tested, the Bible proves to be accurate and reliable.\"1Archaeology and the Legitimacy Bible",

Here's an excerpt from another link which conveys my opinion of the skeptics tactics very well.\n In the nineteenth century the acceptance of evolutionary theory and the application of higher criticism in religion resulted in the Bible being cast as a work of theological fiction. Its history was regarded as legend and its miracles as myths. This radical reassessment of Scripture was argued in part on the absence in the historical record of peoples in the Older Testament such as the Hittites. And because their linkage in the biblical text with larger-than-life personages like Abraham, David, and Solomon, these figures of faith were likewise rendered suspect. Moses was also said to be a myth because critical scrutiny deemed aspects of his biblical description as unhistorical. One reason for this supposed lack of historical reliability was the biblical statement that Moses had written the Torah (Deuteronomy 31:24). The scholarly consensus was that Moses must have been illiterate since the ancient Egyptians were thought to have delegated the work of writing to scribes. As a result, neither kings nor commoners learned the art. The Newer Testament was also regarded with equal criticism. It was viewed as the product of later ecclesiastical invention, with the Gospel of John offered as a prime example of a second century document of Gentile origin.\n \n This momentum of scriptural skepticism could not be sustained. With the advent of the twentieth century the pendulum swung back toward an affirmation of biblical legitimacy. Even as the nineteenth century came to a close a return to biblical conservatism was forcing its way forward with discoveries such as that of the ancient capital of the Hittite Empire at Boghaz-K\u00f6y (Hattusha) along with more than 10,000 clay tablets chronicling its prodigious civilization! No longer were the Hittites a non-existent race nor were there grounds for excising the Patriarchs from plausibility as being equally historical. There also emerged from ancient Egypt a set of cosmetic tablets depicting King Narmer of the first dynasty (3100 B.C.). On one of the tablets the image of the king is revealed holding writing tablets, confirming that this first of Egypt&#8217;s dynastic pharaoh&#8217;s was literate. And since Moses had been educated in \"all the learning of the Egyptians\" (Acts 7:22), he must have also been well versed in this scribal skill.\n \n Then at the mid-point of the century came the monumental discovery in caves along the shores of the Dead Sea of biblical and Jewish sectarian manuscripts. Analysis of the sectarian documents from the area of Qumran (dated from 152 B.C. to A.D.68) brought to light numerous parallels with vocabulary and theological viewpoints in the Newer Testament. This comparison argued not only for a first century date of composition for the Newer Testament, but also for its Jewish authorship. As a result the Gospel of John, formerly showcased by scholars as an expression of Gentile syncretism, was re-classified as the most Jewish of the Gospels! Finally, with the establishment of the State of Israel and a new generation of Israeli archaeologists, evidence of the Jewish past in the Holy Land was increasingly being unearthed. Following the lead of such pioneering figures as Yigael Yadin, who boasted that he went into the field \"with a spade in one hand and a Bible in the other,\" Israelis paraded before a watching world the rock witness of their biblical heritage. Accordingly, the twentieth century closed with major newsmagazines touting in cover stories the discoveries of the century as having offered archaeological confirmation of the Bible. Jack Cottrell represented this optimism by stating: \"Through the wealth of data uncovered by historical and archaeological research, we are able to measure the Bible&#8217;s historical accuracy. In every case where its claims can be thus tested, the Bible proves to be accurate and reliable.\"1Archaeology and the Legitimacy Bible\n\n \n An excellent observation and resource, Archangel.

It will probably keep you from getting saved.\n \n And now that you're busted, you might want to go lick your wounds.\n\n \n \n I hate to burst your bubble but\n \n According to the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home of Joseph and Mary and the site of the Annunciation (when Mary was told by the Angel Gabriel that she would have Jesus as her son); in the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettle in Nazareth after fleeing to Egypt from their home in Bethlehem.[ Mt.] The differences and possible contradictions between these two accounts of the nativity of Jesus are part of the Synoptic Problem. Nazareth is also allegedly where Jesus grew up from some point in his childhood.\n \n However, some modern scholars argue that Nazareth may be, in fact, where Jesus was born,[26] while others argue that Nazareth didn't exist at all. The critical question now under scholarly and polemical (atheist and Christian) debate is when exactly and at what stage in the Roman period Nazareth came into existence, that is, whether settlement there began before or after 70 AD (the First Jewish War).[27]\n \n James Strange, an American archaeologist, notes: \"Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.\"[28] Strange&#9472;supposing the existence of a settlement&#9472;originally guessed Nazareth's population at the time of Christ to be \"roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people\", but later, in a subsequent publication, at \"a maximum of about 480.\"[29] Some have argued that the absence of textual references to Nazareth in the Old Testament and the Talmud, as well as the works of Josephus, suggest that a town called 'Nazareth' did not exist in Jesus' day.[30]\n \n Ancient Nazareth may have built on the hillside, as indicated in the Gospel of Luke: [And they led Jesus] to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.[Lk. 4:29] However, the hill in question (the Nebi Sa'in) is far too steep for ancient dwellings and averages a 14% grade in the venerated area.[31] Historic Nazareth was essentially constructed in the valley; the windy hilltops in the vicinity have only been occupied since the construction of Nazareth Illit in 1957. Noteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the kokh (plural:kokhim) or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the first century AD.[32] Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.[33]\n \n Excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan venerated area revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there,[34] Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal archaeologist for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts,[35] attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward. John Dominic Crossan, a major figure in New Testament studies, remarked that Bagatti's archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant hamlet [36].",

   "Hi Easyrider,\n The one thing we can always count on with the skeptics and Christ deniers is their ability to corrupt and deny the history which the bible so accurately records. After all, that is what the Old Testament is and the Jew was always credited prior to this century with being the best disciplined and most accurate record keepers in the ancient world. \n\n \n Wow, first Christians religi-jack Judaism. I can only imagine Jewish leaders who spent their lives studying 3000 years worth of their history only to be told by some ignorant fisherman that they just spent the last 3 years getting right with Jesus and were now ready to teach the Jewish people the correct way to glorify God. Now you want to say Hey we kept an accurate account of what happened, but the OT, (by the way how come the Jewish version and the Christian version don't match word for word?) but Christians didn't, 5000 whole and fragment books of the NT and you can't get to to match and the first complete text is from the 4th century. Seems the Jewish took the responsibility somewhat more seriously than their Christian counterparts. \n \n Oh in case you were wondering the city of Nazareth isn't mentioned in Jewish texts. \n \n \nMost claims against the Bible by secularists and atheists are arguments of lack of evidence, that is the claim is based on the assumption that the Bible is wrong until evidence is found to prove it right. This is a fallacy that ignores the fact that evidence may exists but has yet to be discovered, or that evidence has been destroyed by time or acts of man. A good example is the fact that Jerusalem has been destroyed and rebuilt at least twice, and thus much useful evidence would have been destroyed, and deliberately so. \n\n \n No most arguments against are not lack of evidence. I usually see that when the answers start getting creative. \n \n I does he know it was useful if it was destroyed? How does he know any evidence that would have been found would not invalidate some major component of Christianity?\n \n \nHistory has shown that when new evidence is found it supports the Biblical account. \n\n \n I notice you leave out \"every time\" here but your wording below implies it. So we are clear some discoveries have supported the text, some have shown the text was wrong. \n \n \n \nSo it is by fallacious arguments that the deniers continue to reject the fact that no evidence has ever been discovered which specifically and directly proves the bible wrong. \n\n \n This is a rather asinine statement. Parts of the bible are correct, so very observant that nothing has ever been found to prove it wrong and even if that was not the case there are how many different ideas, names, discriptions, events etc and your impressed that nobody has proven it all wrong. \n \n It's an interesting idea you have. If I write a book about a devine being and his born out of wedlock of an adulteress affair son and include my idealogy, beliefs and then finally reference things that actually happened, \n Again because Jewish leaders managed to get some things right (To hear you tell it the only thing the Jewish people got wrong was Jesus) concerning who was father to who or names of cities or dates doesn't support the validity of the NT.\n \n \nAnd these are the very arguments you are getting here and have and will continue to get from tremor. After all, that is the only direction he can argue from since he has no evidence from history or archeology at all to support his denials of reality. Here's an excerpt from another link which conveys my opinion of the skeptics tactics very well.\n\n \n \n Well let's see how honest this is\n \nIn the nineteenth century the acceptance of evolutionary theory and the application of higher criticism in religion resulted in the Bible being cast as a work of theological fiction. Its history was regarded as legend and its miracles as myths. This radical reassessment of Scripture was argued in part on the absence in the historical record of peoples in the Older Testament such as the Hittites. \n\n \n To this nonsense could have been stopped if only the Church had acted as it predecessors did and initiate an inqusition to deal with heresy like this or at least reinstate laws and punishments banning such behavior. \n \n Maybe people were a little nervous about whether they really would go to Heaven. Considering what a pathetic job was done in maintaining the integrity of the text.\n \n So I would suggest that most criticism was instigated in response to the lack of reasonable answers to inconsitincies, various denominations trying to prove who was right and innocent desire to know more, which is where I would put Darwin.\n \n \nAnd because their linkage in the biblical text with larger-than-life personages like Abraham, David, and Solomon, these figures of faith were likewise rendered suspect. Moses was also said to be a myth because critical scrutiny deemed aspects of his biblical description as unhistorical. One reason for this supposed lack of historical reliability was the biblical statement that Moses had written the Torah (Deuteronomy 31:24). The scholarly consensus was that Moses must have been illiterate since the ancient Egyptians were thought to have delegated the work of writing to scribes. As a result, neither kings nor commoners learned the art. The Newer Testament was also regarded with equal criticism. It was viewed as the product of later ecclesiastical invention, with the Gospel of John offered as a prime example of a second century document of Gentile origin.\n \n This momentum of scriptural skepticism could not be sustained.

And since Moses had been educated in \"all the learning of the Egyptians\" (Acts 7:22), he must have also been well versed in this scribal skill.\n\n \n Maybe if every time a NT text was found it wasn't something new, the excitment would have been a little less. I see he tried to sneek in the Patriachs on the back of the Hittites and I never heard Abraham, David and Solomon never existed because they were larger than life, maybe some embellishment about Solomon, but that is about it. \n Wow the King and Moses could at least maybe read hieroglyphics and yes of course Moses was trained to be able to perform every job an Egyptian might do, even reading and writing his native and then foriegn languages.\n \n You know if the Bible wasn't incorrect so many times then it would not have had the same degree of ctritcism. Just a lot of people actually agreeing with the Bible.\n \n \nThen at the mid-point of the century came the monumental discovery in caves along the shores of the Dead Sea of biblical and Jewish sectarian manuscripts. Analysis of the sectarian documents from the area of Qumran (dated from 152 B.C. to A.D.68) brought to light numerous parallels with vocabulary and theological viewpoints in the Newer Testament.

   "I hate to burst your bubble but the so-called nativity \"contradictions\" don't hold water, as far as I and many others are concerned. The following site shows why:\n \n Harmony of the Nativity Accounts\n \n A harmony of the nativity accounts in the gospels of Matthew & Luke\n \n\n \n Then trouble not your little heart grasshopper, Mr. Jones attempt was \n interesting, but ultimately I think it was a waste of his time or rethink what it is he wants to achieve and go about it differently.\n \n \n \nMatthew is Jewish and it's mentioned in his writings, so Strange is wrong.\n\n \n Do you not get lonely being the only person on the planet to come to this conclusion?\n \n \n \nGo back to my post # 4 showing archaeological evidence that Strange needs to review. His theory needs updating in light of the evidence previously noted.\n\n \n You are intent on missing the point aren't you.\n \n \nTrebor's own website shows there's a cliff within walking distance of Nazareth. How about you and Trebor argue out your differences? That would be a novelty around here - two Christ-deniers working out their own contradictions.\n\n \n Would you like some assistance with your comprehension skills? There is no conflict between Trebor and I. Read it again slowly and don't be afraid to ask if there is something you don't understand.",
