   "Health care for ALL.\n \n \nTomorrow, the next wave of the Mobilization for Health Care for All begins. After over 100 people have risked arrest across the country in sit-ins in the last month, we are beginning to shift the debate about health care reform in our country. Our actions have helped to put a spotlight on the real problem - the insurance companies - and elevate the real solution - Medicare for All. And they have demonstrated the real engine of change: the determined, courageous action of everyday people willing to put their bodies on the line to challenge injustice.\n \n Just as stories of insurance abuse and denial of care are finally being covered more frequently in the media, the insurance companies have begun openly attacking reform even more boldly. It's becoming clear to more and more people that until we take on the insurance companies that are not just killing us but killing our democracy, we will never win real reform - Medicare for All. This is our opening. When we go back to sit-in this week we're going to demand that they take every lobbying dollar they're spending to corrupt our democracy and kill reform and demand they use them instead to pay for the care they're denying. And we're going to do it all over the country.\n \n October 28th is the launch of the next wave of Patients Not Profit Sit-Ins. And the wave will continue until at least November 4th. Below you'll find a list with each city, details for the action, a contact, and networking site link. Check the website for updates to the list. We're confirming new cities each day. If you're close enough to attend one of these actions and you're not plugged in yet - get connected now and participate. If you're city isn't listed and you want to help organize a sit-in there, email organize@mobilizeforhealthcare.org with \"Local Leader / Your City & State\" in the subject and be sure to include your phone number in the email.\n \n Our campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience is spreading across America, and we're not going to stop until we've broken the grip of the insurance companies on our democracy and our lives. \n \n The Next Wave of Actions &#8211; Healthcare-NOW!\n\n \n October 28th cities include:\n \n Augusta, GA\n \n Columbus, OH\n \n Glendale, CA\n \n Newark, NJ\n \n New York City, NY\n \n Rochester, NY\n \n San Francisco, CA\n \n Seattle, WA\n \n Sunrise, FL\n \n Virginia Beach, VA\n \n Warwick, RI\n \n Baltimore, MD\n \n Louisville, KY\n \n Philadelphia, PA\n \n San Diego, CA\n \n Albuquerque, NM\n \n Atlanta, GA\n \n Detroit, MI\n \n Portland, OR\n \n \n \n L'esprit du r\u00e9volution vive. \n \n YouTube - Casablanca La Marseillaise",
