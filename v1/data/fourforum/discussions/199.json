   "Christians believe that God has communicated to us through the Bible and that he communicated to us through his Son Jesus Christ. but since you dont believe the bible, you probably wont accept that as an answer. so i will give you some scientific evidence that God exists. you might not be able to understand it, if you dont know english very well (no offense). i admit, i cut and pasted this argument. but it is a very good argument nonetheless. here we go:\n \n \n Would you like a bit of scientific evidence for the \"intelligent design\" of life? How about some mathematical PROOF of the existence of God? Put on your thinking caps; here it is:\n \n \n The Bible, which claims there is a Creator God who designed the world and brought it into being, says that \"life is in the blood\" (Leviticus 17:11), so for our proof, let's look at the key ingredient in blood: Hemoglobin. \n \n \n Hemoglobin is the most important protein in our bodies. It is responsible both for the red color of our blood and for the oxygen transfer chemistry system that is required for our breathing. \n \n \n There is only one specific sequence of amino acids that forms hemoglobin. All twenty of the amino acids are included, with anywhere from one to 69 of each amino acid involved in making one hemoglobin protein. \n \n \n [Skip this paragraph if you hate wading through technical stuff: \n \n The famed double-helix DNA includes about three billion rungs of a digital, error-correcting code, utilizing combinations of only four nucleic acids: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. These four nucleic acids (similar to \"letters\" of the alphabet\") compose the 20 amino acids (similar to words) that form over 100,000 functional proteins (similar to sentences, including punctuation codes, usually consisting of chains that are 100 to 500 amino acids long). This alphabet-code structure has not changed throughout the history of the earth. All of these codes are stored in the DNA \"master blueprint\" that is continually being replicated in every living thing. Because of the precise specificity of this code, it is quite straightforward to mathematically analyze just how specific it is.] \n \n \n Which brings us back to hemoglobin, that one vital protein that enables you to breath. Hemoglobin is only one of these genetic \"sentences.\" Given the length of the amino acid chain in hemoglobin, there are over 10650 permutations of amino acids possible, but only one of these possible combinations is hemoglobin. \n \n \n More precisely, there are 7.4 x 10654 ways to arrange these amino acids. To put it in terms we can \"see\", there are this many combinations:\n \n \n 7,400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000\n \n \n Did hemoglobin develop by time and chance alone? I think you will agree that it would be pretty tricky for this particular combination to develop without intelligent design in light of the following two facts:\n \n \n There are only 1066 atoms =\n \n 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in the entire universe\n \n and\n \n There have been no more than 1017 seconds =\n \n 100,000,000,000,000,000 seconds\n \n in the generally accepted age of the universe (~11 billion years). \n \n In other words, there isn't any time to waste on false tries!\n \n \n It is obvious that the chances of this specific sequence occurring by chance is utterly absurd. In fact, in physics, the mathematical definition of \"absurd\" is any probability less than 1 in 1050, so this puts us far beyond absurd. It is absolutely impossible that hemoglobin could have ever accidentally come together even once in the history of the universe. \n \n \n There is only one logical conclusion: there is an intelligent designer of life. And since He is that fascinatingly smart, do you imagine He would have figured out a way to communicate with us? If He did, do you think it might be wise to listen?",
