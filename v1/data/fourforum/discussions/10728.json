   "Yep. The US Senate has spoken. All those rising temperatures and melting glaciers are just an illusion. Nothing to see here, folks, move right along and go on burning oil like there was no tomorrow!\n \n Let's take a look at this claim:\n \n \n\"Over 400 prominent scientists from more than two dozen countries recently voiced significant objections to major aspects of the so-called \"consensus\" on man-made global warming. These scientists, many of whom are current and former participants in the UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), criticized the climate claims made by the UN IPCC and former Vice President Al Gore.\"\n\n \n We have lots of weasel phrases that don't mean much:\n \n \nprominent scientists, significant objections, major aspects, so-called \"consensus\", climate claims\n\n \n What does it mean? Precisely nothing. Lots of \"prominent scientists\" disagree with each other about this or that; there have been \"significant objections\" to almost every scientific theory; and as for \"major aspects\", that means nothing. Anything anyone objects to can be inflated into a \"major aspect\" which is a phrase with the advantage of total unspecificity, and commits the critic to nothing concrete at all. It's all civil-service-speak for \"do nothing\".\n \n Do many scientists doubt there is a man-made contribution to global warming? No. Do scientists disagree about how much and what to do about it? Yes. Is this political statement going to be used by the destructive full-steam-ahead-and-damn-the-environmental-consequences gang to cast doubts on global warming issues they'd prefer to ignore? Of course.\n \n I am shocked so many people prefer to stick their silly necks in the sand for political reasons, rather than accept the reality that human activity does alter environments, and not usually with good effect. Even if we aren't sure exactly how much or what the consequences will be. But there are always consequences, which GW deniers prefer to forget about in the hope that they will die off before their children have to deal with them.",

This link leads to other links that reveal much about this story and the injustice to those who dare speak out against these claims which can't be supported with solid evidence.\n \n During today's hearing, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, confronted Stephen Johnson, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with a threatening e-mail from a group of which EPA is currently a member. The e-mail threatens to \"destroy\" the career of a climate skeptic. Michael T. Eckhart, president of the environmental group the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), wrote in an email on July 13, 2007 to Marlo Lewis, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI):\n \n \"It is my intention to destroy your career as a liar. If you produce one more editorial against climate change, I will launch a campaign against your professional integrity. I will call you a liar and charlatan to the Harvard community of which you and I are members. I will call you out as a man who has been bought by Corporate America. Go ahead, guy. Take me on.\"\n \n In a July 16, Washington Times article, Eckhart confirmed that he did indeed write the email.\n \n After Senator Inhofe read Eckhart's comments, Johnson vowed to launch a probe concerning the threatening e-mail. Johnson responded to Inhofe saying, \"I was not aware of this quote.\" He continued, \"Statements like this are of concern to me. I am a believer in cooperation and collaboration across all sectors.\" Johnson then added, \"This is an area I will look into for the record.\" (See YouTube video of exchange between Senator Inhofe and Johnson)\n \n Senator Inhofe replied, \"I would like to have you look into this and make an evaluation, talk it over with your people and see if it is appropriate to be a part of an organization that is headed up by a person who makes this statement.\"\n \n Following the hearing, Senator Inhofe announced that he will be sending letters to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, and EPA, urging them to \"reconsider their membership in ACORE.\" \n \n Full Text of Eckhart's July 13, 2007 e-mail to CEI's Lewis:\n \n Marlo -\n \n You are so full of ####.\n \n You have been proven wrong.

After all, this would fit in with his whole \"establishment\" conspiracy in which \"the man\" is trying to keep him quiet.\n \n You've gone batty. Answer me this question, please, which I have to phrase incredibly clearly because you lack the comprehension skills to understand my previous post: if 400 qualified scientists (and I used \"qualified\" loosely in this context) are skeptical of IPCC's findings, how many qualified scientists are not? You need a ratio before you start blathering about some sort of upheaval in the scientific community.\n \n These comments are directed toward both jyoshu and Archie: Clearly, you guys haven't learned from the DI's \"Dissent from Darwinism\" fiasco.

Project Steve kicked \"Dissent\"'s XXX even without asking these questions, and applying such reasonable scrutiny results in an outcome that Archie would rather forget. 99.85% of qualified scientists active in the field of biology have no problem with evolution.

I am glad someone has finally noted that \"Scientists\" are not some bulk commodity. I have noted that folks on both sides tend to inflate their numbers with bulk scientists. I almost expect to see a headline that reads \"Over 12,000 lbs of Scientist can't be wrong.\"\n \n Not all scientists are of the same cloth. Some will deny any new theory simply because it controverts what they have held dear for years. Witness the debate about plate tectonics(!)

One is upset that the IPCC expressed a 90% certainty, not that the IPCC must be wrong. One just doubts that we can do anything to change the current trend.

I'm not dismissive of anything any scientist reports, provided there is evidence for the case being made. As a practicing scientist, I developed and tested many hypotheses -- most were wrong, as is usually the case. I am perfectly willing to change my mind about some hypothesis, if new and reliable data contradict it. This is generally if not universally true among scientists. And when scientists occasionally refuse to change their minds in the face of overwhelming data, they basically become irrelevant in their field, which moves past them and leaves them behind.\n \n I accept global warming is true (because I've seen the data), and more guardedly I accept the general consensus among climatologists that there is most probably an anthropogenic component. I accept this not as an expert in climatology or the earth sciences, but because I do have confidence in the scientific method, and those scientific fields are as competitive as any other including my own, meaning that wrong ideas will eventually be found out and replaced by scientists keen to make a name for themselves. Of course it could eventually turn out that global warming theories might be false or exaggerated, but do you really want to bet your children's lives on it?\n \n What I deride is the kneejerk, dismissive denialism of the see-nothing, do-nothing political right that there is anything to worry about, when there manifestly is, irrespective of the causes or postulated solutions. I don't necessarily accept that climatologists have everything right, nor that all their predictions will come true if nothing is done, nor do I necessarily accept that good solutions can be found or are politically feasible to implement even if they are found. But I have no patience at all with the attitude of full speed ahead and damn the consequences.\n \n Whether your GOPers like to admit it or not, the earth is going through significant climatic changes with consequences that could very well be dire for human civilisation. It may be that it is not obvious what, if anything, can practically be done to prevent, reverse or control the changes in surface temperatures, but we surely need to be alert to the consequences and implications rather than pretending there won't be any. I'd prefer to see the argument shift in focus from whether there is global warming, about which there is really little scientific debate any more, to what our response to it should be, given any eventual contingency. What do we do if ice caps melt and sea levels do rise by 80 meters? What do we do when some agricultural land becomes unproductive, while other lands might -- I emphasise MIGHT -- become agriculturally exploitable? How do we cope with potentially massive movements or even extinctions of populations? How do we cope with potential wars over resources? These are all good questions that no-one wants to talk about, for obvious reasons.\n \n That would be the responsible, conservative thing to do, which is, I suppose, why the GOP has refused to do it. Why should we assume the Pollyannas will be right?",

   "U.S. Senate Report: Over 400 Prominent Scientists Disputed Man-Made Global Warming Claims in 2007 \n \n \"Over 400 prominent scientists from more than two dozen countries recently voiced significant objections to major aspects of the so-called \"consensus\" on man-made global warming. These scientists, many of whom are current and former participants in the UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), criticized the climate claims made by the UN IPCC and former Vice President Al Gore. \n \n The new report issued by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's office of the GOP Ranking Member details the views of the scientists, the overwhelming majority of whom spoke out in 2007. \n \n Even some in the establishment media now appear to be taking notice of the growing number of skeptical scientists. In October, the Washington Post Staff Writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics \"appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.\" Many scientists from around the world have dubbed 2007 as the year man-made global warming fears \"bite the dust.\" (LINK) In addition, many scientists who are also progressive environmentalists believe climate fear promotion has \"co-opted\" the green movement. (LINK) \n \n This blockbuster Senate report lists the scientists by name, country of residence, and academic/institutional affiliation. It also features their own words, biographies, and weblinks to their peer reviewed studies and original source materials as gathered from public statements, various news outlets, and websites in 2007. This new \"consensus busters\" report is poised to redefine the debate. \n More at http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&ContentRecord_id=f80a6386-802a-23ad-40c8-3c63dc2d02cb\n\n \n If this is the report I am thinking of, the \"400 scientists\" is really closer to 200, and the figure was taken from several seperate statements that circulated for signatures - many of the scientists signed each one (one scientist signing two or three different statements over certain period of time, not knowing that they would all be added together), and the report merely took each one and added it to the others.\n \n It may be that this is a different one, but I recently heard of hte \"400\" figure as being that. I'll see if I can look into it more.",

   "My question is, if the algore ministry of fear mongering for the promotion and personal enrichment of his Carbon Credit Scam is so real and inevitable, then why is evidence Global Cooling every where we look? Explain these very real weather realities and results around the World as pointed out by Geophycisist, David Deming if what is actually happening is Man Made Global Warning. \n \n http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20071219/COMMENTARY/10575140\n Article published Dec 19, 2007\n Year of global cooling\n \n December 19, 2007 \n \n By David Deming - Al Gore says global warming is a planetary emergency. It is difficult to see how this can be so when record low temperatures are being set all over the world. In 2007, hundreds of people died, not from global warming, but from cold weather hazards. \n \n Since the mid-19th century, the mean global temperature has increased by 0.7 degrees Celsius. This slight warming is not unusual, and lies well within the range of natural variation. Carbon dioxide continues to build in the atmosphere, but the mean planetary temperature hasn't increased significantly for nearly nine years. Antarctica is getting colder. Neither the intensity nor the frequency of hurricanes has increased. The 2007 season was the third-quietest since 1966. In 2006 not a single hurricane made landfall in the U.S. \n \n South America this year experienced one of its coldest winters in decades. In Buenos Aires, snow fell for the first time since the year 1918. Dozens of homeless people died from exposure. In Peru, 200 people died from the cold and thousands more became infected with respiratory diseases. Crops failed, livestock perished, and the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency. \n \n Unexpected bitter cold swept the entire Southern Hemisphere in 2007. Johannesburg, South Africa, had the first significant snowfall in 26 years. Australia experienced the coldest June ever. In northeastern Australia, the city of Townsville underwent the longest period of continuously cold weather since 1941. In New Zealand, the weather turned so cold that vineyards were endangered. \n \n Last January, $1.42 billion worth of California produce was lost to a devastating five-day freeze. Thousands of agricultural employees were thrown out of work. At the supermarket, citrus prices soared. In the wake of the freeze, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked President Bush to issue a disaster declaration for affected counties. A few months earlier, Mr. Schwarzenegger had enthusiastically signed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, a law designed to cool the climate. California Sen. Barbara Boxer continues to push for similar legislation in the U.S. Senate. \n \n In April, a killing freeze destroyed 95 percent of South Carolina's peach crop, and 90 percent of North Carolina's apple harvest. At Charlotte, N.C., a record low temperature of 21 degrees Fahrenheit on April 8 was the coldest ever recorded for April, breaking a record set in 1923. On June 8, Denver recorded a new low of 31 degrees Fahrenheit. Denver's temperature records extend back to 1872. \n \n Recent weeks have seen the return of unusually cold conditions to the Northern Hemisphere. On Dec. 7, St. Cloud, Minn., set a new record low of minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit. On the same date, record low temperatures were also recorded in Pennsylvania and Ohio. \n \n Extreme cold weather is occurring worldwide. On Dec. 4, in Seoul, Korea, the temperature was a record minus 5 degrees Celsius. Nov. 24, in Meacham, Ore., the minimum temperature was 12 degrees Fahrenheit colder than the previous record low set in 1952. The Canadian government warns that this winter is likely to be the coldest in 15 years. \n \n Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri are just emerging from a destructive ice storm that left at least 36 people dead and a million without electric power. People worldwide are being reminded of what used to be common sense: Cold temperatures are inimical to human welfare and warm weather is beneficial. Left in the dark and cold, Oklahomans rushed out to buy electric generators powered by gasoline, not solar cells. No one seemed particularly concerned about the welfare of polar bears, penguins or walruses. Fossil fuels don't seem so awful when you're in the cold and dark. \n \n If you think any of the preceding facts can falsify global warming, you're hopelessly naive. Nothing creates cognitive dissonance in the mind of a true believer. In 2005, a Canadian Greenpeace representative explained \"global warming can mean colder, it can mean drier, it can mean wetter.\" In other words, all weather variations are evidence for global warming. I can't make this stuff up. \n \n Global warming has long since passed from scientific hypothesis to the realm of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. \n \n David Deming is a geophysicist, an adjunct scholar with the National Center for Policy Analysis, and associate professor of Arts and Sciences at the University of Oklahoma. \n ",

   "Let's see what actual scientists -- as opposed to senate and petroleum industry poodles -- have to say about global warming:\n \n From the Royal Society:\n \n Facts and fictions about climate change\n \n \nIt has become fashionable in some parts of the UK media to portray the scientific evidence that has been collected about climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities as an exaggeration. Some articles have claimed that scientists are ignoring uncertainties in our understanding of the climate and the factors that affect it. Some have questioned the motives of the scientists who have presented the most authoritative assessments of the science of climate change, claiming that they have a vested interest in playing up the potential effects that climate change is likely to have.\n \n This document examines twelve misleading arguments (presented in bold typeface) put forward by the opponents of urgent action on climate change and highlights the scientific evidence that exposes their flaws. It has been prepared by a group led by Sir David Wallace FRS, Treasurer of the Royal Society, and Sir John Houghton FRS, former chair of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This document has been endorsed by the Council of the Royal Society, and draws primarily on scientific papers published in leading peer-reviewed journals and the work of authoritative scientific organisations, such as the IPCC and the United States National Academy of Sciences.\n\n \n The PDF file is here.\n \n Just for ease, the misleading arguments considered and rebutted in just this one document are the following:\n 1. The IPCC has become too politicised and does not accurately reflect the wide range of views within the scientific community. The IPCC summary for policymakers does not adequately represent the scientific uncertainty.\n \n 2. Many scientists do not think that climate change is a problem. Some scientists have signed petitions stating that climate change is not a problem.\n \n 3. There is little evidence that global warming is happening or, if it is happening, it is not very much. Some parts of the world are actually becoming cooler. Increased urbanisation could be responsible for much of the increase in observed temperatures. Satellite temperature records do not show any global warming. If there has been global warming recently, it would not even be a unique occurrence within the past 1000 years. Europe has been much warmer in the past.\n \n 4. The Earth is getting hotter, but not because of emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. Carbon dioxide makes up such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that even if it doubled it would make little difference to the climate. Variations in the sun are more likely to be the cause of climate changing than increases in greenhouse gases.\n \n 5. There is no reliable way of predicting how temperatures will change in the future. The climate is so complex that it is hard to predict what might happen. The IPCC's climate scenarios are developed by economists not scientists and are often misleadingly presented as predictions or forecasts, when they are actually just scenarios - the most extreme of which are totally unrealistic The IPCC's findings are dependent on models that are badly flawed. No climate model has been scientifically validated. The IPCC 2001 predictions showed a wider uncertainty range than that in earlier reports.\n \n 6. Scientists have been exaggerating the evidence by claiming that individual extreme weather events have been caused by climate change. The recent flooding in the UK in places like Boscastle and Carlisle would have happened anyway, and the frequency of hurricanes hitting the Caribbean and Atlantic coast of the United States is no different than in the past. Even if they appear to be more severe, this is only because more people are living in places that are affected by natural extreme weather events.\n \n 7. There is conflicting evidence about whether the ice at the poles is melting and, in fact, it is actually becoming thicker in Antarctica.\n \n 8. There is little evidence of a rise in sea level due to global warming. There is no correlation between rises in climate temperature and sea levels. There has been no consistent trend this century, with sea level rising in some places but not in others. Even if sea level is rising it has nothing to do with global warming and is actually due to the fact that southern England is sinking due to the bending of the Earth's crust.\n \n 9. Even if climate change is occurring, it won't be that dangerous. Abrupt climate change is just another scare story. While an atmospheric concentration for carbon dioxide of 550 parts per million has been proposed as a political target, there has been no scientific determination of \"dangerous\" levels of greenhouse gas concentrations.\n \n 10. There is no evidence that climate change will be bad for people. In fact, warmer weather will actually be good for those people who live in cold countries. Climate change may make some places like Russia warmer and more productive places to live. A warmer climate will be good for the UK's economy, with more tourists and better wine-producing conditions. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide would produce a rise in plant productivity and crop yields. Surely we should let the benefits and costs of climate change even themselves out.\n \n 11. There are too many uncertainties about climate change and its impacts to justify taking action. It would be better to wait until we are more certain about climate change before acting.\n \n 12: The Kyoto Protocol is a waste of time because the United States will not ratify it. The emission reduction targets required under the Kyoto Protocol are \"trivial\" and would do no more than postpone global warming by six years. Implementing the Kyoto Protocol would be too costly. The trillions of dollars that would be wasted on the Kyoto Protocol should be spent on helping developing countries tackle poverty.\n While this particular document is aimed at UK readers -- the Royal Society is Britain's equivalent to the NAS -- similar denialism appears in the US. All these arguments have perfectly sensible rebuttals, viewable in the PDF file, if only people would take the time to sit down and read them. But rather than treating the matter seriously and scientifically, they prefer to take political potshots -- little Neros fiddling while Rome warms up.\n \n It's always the case that every scientific theory, especially those with considerable social and economic impact, will have its detractors, both genuine ones (some of them cranks or the otherwise disgruntled) and those with an ulterior motive in trying to debunk it. The tobacco industry sponsored lots of scientists determined to \"debunk\" the steadily accumulating data that smoking was injurious to health. Now we have the petroleum industry trying the same sort of lark in the face of a considerable and ever-growing scientific consensus. The data pointing to GW keeps mounting, and the industry lobby gets more and more desperate -- published science can't save their bacon or paint reality the way they'd rather, so they hope a \"senate report\" engineered by the GOP and the petroleum industry will.\n \n The choice is stark. We can either take GW seriously and try to do something about it, or twiddle our thumbs and do nothing. In the worst case that most climatologists are the XXXXXX the GOP and Esso would like us to believe they are, and GW is a false alarm, our efforts will have cleaned up our act, made the environment healthier and more livable, and generated pressure for energy efficiency. All desirable results, even if GW were false -- we cannot lose here. In the best case, we may be able to either avert a disaster, or perhaps postpone it sufficiently to make any necessary social and economic adjustments peacefully. But the GOP doesn't want to discuss those.\n \n Hopefully, after the rout of the Bushies from the WH later this year, we will have a presidency that takes the threat more seriously. A long-suffering nation needs a dose of reality there.",

   "Regarding argument #2, Misleading arguments 2. Many scientists do not think that climate change is a problem. \n Some scientists have signed petitions stating that climate change is not a problem.\n \n This isn't true at all. Scientists aren't even in denial regarding that climate change is real and happening as we speak. The contention is that it is solely caused by man made pollution. How do Global Warming proponents explain that back in the late 19th Century, before the Industrial Revolution even began to pollute the atmosphere, we saw the melting of Kilimanjaro... http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/55553/page/8 \n Glaciers and Global Climate\n \n The observations described above point to a combination of factors other than warming air-chiefly a drying of the surrounding air that reduced accumulation and increased ablation-as responsible for the decline of the ice on Kilimanjaro since the first observations in the 1880s. The mass balance is dominated by sublimation, which requires much more energy per unit mass than melting; this energy is supplied by solar radiation.\n \n These processes are fairly insensitive to temperature and hence to global warming. If air temperatures were eventually to rise above freezing, sensible-heat flux and atmospheric long-wave emission would take the lead from sublimation and solar radiation. Since the summit glaciers do not experience shading, all sharp-edged features would soon disappear. But the sharp-edged features have persisted for more than a century. By the time the 19th-century explorers reached Kilimanjaro's summit, vertical walls had already developed, setting in motion the loss processes that have continued to this day.\n \n An additional clue about the pacing of ice loss comes from the water levels in nearby Lake Victoria. Long-term records and proxy evidence of lake levels indicate a substantial decline in regional precipitation at the end of the 19th century after some considerably wetter decades. Overall, the historical records available suggest that the large ice cap described by Victorian-era explorers was more likely the product of an unusually wet period than of cooler global temperatures.\n \n If human-induced global warming has played any role in the shrinkage of Kilimanjaro's ice, it could only have joined the game quite late, after the result was already clearly decided, acting at most as an accessory, influencing the outcome indirectly. The detection and attribution studies indicating that human influence on global climate emerged some time after 1950 reach the same conclusion about East African temperature far below the peak.\n \n The fact that the loss of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro cannot be used as proof of global warming does not mean that the Earth is not warming. There is ample and conclusive evidence that Earth's average temperature has increased in the past 100 years, and the decline of mid- and high-latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence. But the special conditions on Kilimanjaro make it unlike the higher-latitude mountains, whose glaciers are shrinking because of rising atmospheric temperatures. Mass- and energy-balance considerations and the shapes of features all point in the same direction, suggesting an insignificant role for atmospheric temperature in the fluctuations of Kilimanjaro's ice.\n And can the Sun be a reasonable and logical suspect in climate changes on a Worldwide scale based on its Solar Output? http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html#Q10\n Can the observed changes be explained by natural variability, including changes in solar output?\n Since our entire climate system is fundamentally driven by energy from the sun, it stands to reason that if the sun's energy output were to change, then so would the climate. Since the advent of space-borne measurements in the late 1970s, solar output has indeed been shown to vary. There appears to be confirmation of earlier suggestions of an 11 (and 22) year cycle of irradiance. With only 20 years of reliable measurements however, it is difficult to deduce a trend. But, from the short record we have so far, the trend in solar irradiance is estimated at ~0.09 W/m2 compared to 0.4 W/m2 from well-mixed greenhouse gases. There are many indications that the sun also has a longer-term variation which has potentially contributed to the century-scale forcing to a greater degree. There is though, a great deal of uncertainty in estimates of solar irradiance beyond what can be measured by satellites, and still the contribution of direct solar irradiance forcing is small compared to the greenhouse gas component. However, our understanding of the indirect effects of changes in solar output and feedbacks in the climate system is minimal. There is much need to refine our understanding of key natural forcing mechanisms of the climate, including solar irradiance changes, in order to reduce uncertainty in our projections of future climate change.\n \n In addition to changes in energy from the sun itself, the Earth's position and orientation relative to the sun (our orbit) also varies slightly, thereby bringing us closer and further away from the sun in predictable cycles (called Milankovitch cycles). Variations in these cycles are believed to be the cause of Earth's ice-ages (glacials). Particularly important for the development of glacials is the radiation receipt at high northern latitudes. Diminishing radiation at these latitudes during the summer months would have enabled winter snow and ice cover to persist throughout the year, eventually leading to a permanent snow- or icepack. While Milankovitch cycles have tremendous value as a theory to explain ice-ages and long-term changes in the climate, they are unlikely to have very much impact on the decade-century timescale. Over several centuries, it may be possible to observe the effect of these orbital parameters, however for the prediction of climate change in the 21st century, these changes will be far less important than radiative forcing from greenhouse gases.",

   "Industrial revolution began circa 1750. Late 19th century is not pre industrial revolution.\n\n \n My point Jo is that it is the combined Worldwide polluting that is happening today that causes the proponents to imply that man is polluting faster than the Earth can recycle the poisons out of the atmosphere and thereby avoid or prevent Global Warming. \n \n For example, here is an excerpt that states that in 1829 England had increased Coal production to 15 million tons a year. I suggest to you that today England can mine 15 million tons a week, if not per day.\n \n http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1981/2/81.02.06.x.html\n Different methods of mining coal were employed in various locales throughout England. All coal mining had one trait in common; the movement of coal was accomplished solely by muscle power-animal, man, woman and child, the latter being the most desirable for their size. The process of removing the coal was obviously as slow as it was dirty. Coal was moved along horizontal tunnels by the basketful and hauled up a vertical shaft to the surface. Later, the underground movement of coal was speeded up by the utilization of ponies and carts on rail. The production of coal increased steadily, from 2 1/2 million to more than 15 million tons by 1829.\n Here is evidence that confirms what I said above regarding England's current Coal Production. Now take what England is producing and multiply that times the rest of the World. According to this article, the World produces 4 to 5 billion tons per year. \n \n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmwelaf/ucenergy/m10.htm\n It is worth repeating what Malcolm Wicks said in his July 2005 statement. He noted that \"in 2000, total UK coal production stood at 306 million tonnes. Of that~ 172 million tonnes was produced by deep mines and 134 million tonnes by surface mines: the latter is not an insignificant figure. Annual coal use in electricity generation, which absorbs around c~5 per cent of UK coal production, stood at 46.9 million tonnes. In 2000, UK-produced coal supplied around 55 per cent of coal-fired electricity feedstock and more than 40 per cent. of it came from surface mines. \n So you see, just according to the Coal production in England, the numbers from the early Ind.Rev. compared to today are miniscule. Especially when the whole Worlds various pollutants are considered. The fact remains that not until the early 20th century when Coal and fossil fuel burning became the power source for mass production, and before ANY anti pollution technology was even considered necessary did the accumulation of billions of tons of heavy metals and other pollutants get thrown into the atmosphere. \n \n So don't get sidetracked by focussing on precisely when the Industrial Revolution began and lose sight of the fact that it became a threat to the World's air quality early in the 20th century.",

   "But the Washington Times wasn't the only evidence I put forth that offers a reasonable explanation for what is occurring. In fact I showed with other articles that the high altitude melting of Mt Kilimanjaro and other Glacier's starting way back in the 19th century could not in any way be attributed to man made causes at all, but through increased and changing Solar activity. The main point that many scientists are making is not that the weather is changing but simply that those changes cannot be attributed to human causes only but other factors like increasing solar output by our Sun is undeniably having a very real impact on the Earths Weather generally speaking and Global Warming specifically.\n \n So you see GO, your argument is an invalid argument because it makes a huge leap to one conclusion when that conclusion doesn't answer all of the evidence that describes what is happening in reality. It is like agreeing that a basketball is a sphere, and then extrapolating that because the Earth is also a sphere, that it too must be a basketball. Both facts regarding the two objects being spheres are true, but the conclusion regarding the Earth is a false conclusion. \n \n So I resubmit my evidence regarding Solar Radiation and the length of time it has been impacting our Weather as evidence that just because we were unable to effectively translate our 19th century observations and place them in proper context till now, that doesn't mean we should ignore them or not ask the hard questions regarding their occurrences.\n \n \nThat Washington Times columnist has totally cherry-picked his facts.

Many scientists do not think that climate change is a problem. \n Some scientists have signed petitions stating that climate change is not a problem.\n \n This isn't true at all. Scientists aren't even in denial regarding that climate change is real and happening as we speak. The contention is that it is solely caused by man made pollution. How do Global Warming proponents explain that back in the late 19th Century, before the Industrial Revolution even began to pollute the atmosphere, we saw the melting of Kilimanjaro... http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/55553/page/8 \n Glaciers and Global Climate\n \n The observations described above point to a combination of factors other than warming air-chiefly a drying of the surrounding air that reduced accumulation and increased ablation-as responsible for the decline of the ice on Kilimanjaro since the first observations in the 1880s. The mass balance is dominated by sublimation, which requires much more energy per unit mass than melting; this energy is supplied by solar radiation.\n \n These processes are fairly insensitive to temperature and hence to global warming. If air temperatures were eventually to rise above freezing, sensible-heat flux and atmospheric long-wave emission would take the lead from sublimation and solar radiation. Since the summit glaciers do not experience shading, all sharp-edged features would soon disappear. But the sharp-edged features have persisted for more than a century. By the time the 19th-century explorers reached Kilimanjaro's summit, vertical walls had already developed, setting in motion the loss processes that have continued to this day.\n \n An additional clue about the pacing of ice loss comes from the water levels in nearby Lake Victoria. Long-term records and proxy evidence of lake levels indicate a substantial decline in regional precipitation at the end of the 19th century after some considerably wetter decades. Overall, the historical records available suggest that the large ice cap described by Victorian-era explorers was more likely the product of an unusually wet period than of cooler global temperatures.\n \n If human-induced global warming has played any role in the shrinkage of Kilimanjaro's ice, it could only have joined the game quite late, after the result was already clearly decided, acting at most as an accessory, influencing the outcome indirectly. The detection and attribution studies indicating that human influence on global climate emerged some time after 1950 reach the same conclusion about East African temperature far below the peak.\n \n The fact that the loss of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro cannot be used as proof of global warming does not mean that the Earth is not warming. There is ample and conclusive evidence that Earth's average temperature has increased in the past 100 years, and the decline of mid- and high-latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence. But the special conditions on Kilimanjaro make it unlike the higher-latitude mountains, whose glaciers are shrinking because of rising atmospheric temperatures. Mass- and energy-balance considerations and the shapes of features all point in the same direction, suggesting an insignificant role for atmospheric temperature in the fluctuations of Kilimanjaro's ice.\n And can the Sun be a reasonable and logical suspect in climate changes on a Worldwide scale based on its Solar Output? http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html#Q10\n Can the observed changes be explained by natural variability, including changes in solar output?\n Since our entire climate system is fundamentally driven by energy from the sun, it stands to reason that if the sun's energy output were to change, then so would the climate. Since the advent of space-borne measurements in the late 1970s, solar output has indeed been shown to vary. There appears to be confirmation of earlier suggestions of an 11 (and 22) year cycle of irradiance. With only 20 years of reliable measurements however, it is difficult to deduce a trend. But, from the short record we have so far, the trend in solar irradiance is estimated at ~0.09 W/m2 compared to 0.4 W/m2 from well-mixed greenhouse gases. There are many indications that the sun also has a longer-term variation which has potentially contributed to the century-scale forcing to a greater degree. There is though, a great deal of uncertainty in estimates of solar irradiance beyond what can be measured by satellites, and still the contribution of direct solar irradiance forcing is small compared to the greenhouse gas component. However, our understanding of the indirect effects of changes in solar output and feedbacks in the climate system is minimal. There is much need to refine our understanding of key natural forcing mechanisms of the climate, including solar irradiance changes, in order to reduce uncertainty in our projections of future climate change.\n \n In addition to changes in energy from the sun itself, the Earth's position and orientation relative to the sun (our orbit) also varies slightly, thereby bringing us closer and further away from the sun in predictable cycles (called Milankovitch cycles). Variations in these cycles are believed to be the cause of Earth's ice-ages (glacials). Particularly important for the development of glacials is the radiation receipt at high northern latitudes. Diminishing radiation at these latitudes during the summer months would have enabled winter snow and ice cover to persist throughout the year, eventually leading to a permanent snow- or icepack. While Milankovitch cycles have tremendous value as a theory to explain ice-ages and long-term changes in the climate, they are unlikely to have very much impact on the decade-century timescale. Over several centuries, it may be possible to observe the effect of these orbital parameters, however for the prediction of climate change in the 21st century, these changes will be far less important than radiative forcing from greenhouse gases.\n",

   "This is an old news story, but it's to the point in showing that Inhofe's attempts to debunk climate science have been long standing:\n \n Warmed Over\n \n \nThe U.S. Senate's leading abuser of science has struck again. Not content with calling the notion of human-caused global warming \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\" (as he did in a July 2003 Senate floor speech), last week James Inhofe returned with an \"update\" on climate-change science. In his latest speech, timed to coincide with the final steps toward implementation of the Kyoto Protocol (which the United States won't be joining), Inhofe asserted that \"put simply, man-induced global warming is an article of religious faith.\" Clearly, he hasn't changed his tune.\n\n \n And that was in 2005. Now it's just the same old BS, different day, only it's kicking against 2 more years worth of data supporting the reality of GW.\n \n Here's one commentary on the Famous Four Hundred Inhofe quoted:\n \n More on the 'scientific' attacks on global warming\n \n \nI'm not certain a dozen on the list would qualify as \"prominent scientists,\" and many of those, like Freeman Dyson -- a theoretical physicist -- have no expertise in climate science whatsoever...\n \n Even Ray Kurzweil, not a scientist but a brilliant inventor, is on the list. Why? Because he apparently told CNN and the Washington Post:\n \n \n\"These slides that Gore puts up are ludicrous, they don't account for anything like the technological progress we're going to experience ... None of the global warming discussions mention the word \"nanotechnology.\" Yet nanotechnology will eliminate the need for fossil fuels within 20 years ... I think global warming is real but it has been modest thus far -- 1 degree f. in 100 years. It would be concern if that continued or accelerated for a long period of time, but that's not going to happen.\"\n \n \n And people say I'm a techno-optimist. So Kurzweil actually believes in climate science -- rather than the reverse, as Inhofe claims -- but thinks catastrophic global warming won't happen because of a techno-fix that stops emissions. If wishes were horses ... everyone would get trampled to death...\n\n \n Many of the rest who have had their 15 seconds of fame in a ripped-off quote aren't even scientists -- they are economists, TV weathermen and the like, and even many of the scientists aren't climatologists, but people who may be expert in their own field, but don't necessarily know much about climatology.\n \n It's rather like those bone-headed Creationists quoting doctors, lawyers and engineers about evolution vs. Creationism, as though any of them knew anything about biology.

I find it more responsible to listen to all instead of listen to some. If that makes me an ostrich then perhaps it is easier to hear underground.\n\n \n It's actually a good thing most scientists aren't like Lesz, and are willing to listen to other scientists who have come to different conclusions. Can you imagine if all scientists everywhere were the sort who refused to consider other conclusions and actually question their own, even resorting to tactics like demonizing the newspaper it was reported in as if that changes what's being reported about?\n \n Notice the pattern, that happens nearly every time, with man-made global warming dogmatists.[*]The 'only-climatologists-can-study-this' approach. That's usually the first canard argument you see them grabbing onto when faced with the reality that not every reputable scientist agrees. Suddenly, one has to be a \"climatologist\" to even remotely understand global warming.

Oops! emoticon_xangel So they have to resort to the next tactic ...[*]The 'ol shoot the messenger tactic of \"oh-that's-the-Washington-Times-or-Fox-News-so-it-didn't-really-happen\" approach.

Or if they write an article about a shuttle launch, then the launch didn't really happen because it was Fox News that reported it. LOL. As if it even really matters what news outlet reported about the issue .... the issue is still there!!! If you don't like The Wash. Times, then check the sources out yourself. But I guess it's easier to use a cop out and just pretend it's not real since it's the Wash Times that happened to put out the story.\n For goodness' sake, why would anyone not at least listen or consider something if so many scientists out there say they are coming to different conclusions? It's sorta ironic because the global warming dogmatists have taken sort of a position not unlike the Church did with Galileo, or with Copernicus. When science ceases to question itself with the questions of it's own scientists and resorts to dogmatism instead, it ceases to be science. It should always be questioning when there are questions and differing conclusions. These global warming dogmatists have found themselves in the position of being the ones refusing to question and consider evidence, and therefore are trying to defend stubbornness and their own form of dogma. They've put themselves in that position by taking a hard line stance on something over which there are many unanswered questions.",

Individual climatologists quoted by Inhofe's mob might well have cogent criticisms to make of GW theory, but Inhofe's \"report\" is not the right place to look for or discuss it. It is not a scientific review, it's a political statement.\n \n And face it, some of the the anti-GW advocates ARE being paid by the oil industry. Fact.\n \n The point is that arguments pro or con have to be evaluated scientifically on their own merits, not cherrypicked as soundbites for a propaganda pamphlet.

If there is evidence to the contrary, the scientific community will evaluate it. So far, the consensus evaluation is that we do have something to worry about. Maybe the current consensus is wrong, but it will take more than random quote mining by Inhofe to establish a new scientific consensus.\n \n The difference between you and me is that while I would prefer the current consensus to be wrong, I am willing to be persuaded by evidence against my wishes that what I would rather were wrong is probably right. I go with the preponderance of evidence, and if that changes, then I'll change my mind on GW.

Do you even care what these scientists have to say? \n \n Total McCarthy tactics on your part and the part of many. I wish the real scientists who believe in global warming would distance themselves from people like you and actually give an honest debate on it while respecting those who disagree or question.\n \n \nI'd rather GW were either false or susceptible to a quick and easy fix\nI don't think this is true and not true for many elitist.",

   "Steve, dear, when you and Jim and the rest of the right-wing gaggle manage to tell us what the scientific evidence against global warming is, I'll pay attention. Political propaganda, however, it a pointless waste of time.\n \n It would be nice if global warming weren't real. Pretending it isn't, despite the evidence it is, isn't good science, however. Go to it and find the evidence against! It would be nice not to have that to worry about as well, after all.\nYour initial mistake is to assume that we who argue against you and FAT ALBERT about global warming and the cure for it do not believe there is any warming going on. What a silly child you are. Of course the globe is warming. It has been through cycles before. We are currently exiting a long ice age (I think this is about the third or fourth one we know of.) We'll freeze over again and have another Ice Age before it's over. When we're coming out of that one, there'll likely be a whole new batch of Fat Alberts and sheeple like you who think that humans can change their lifestyle or buy carbon credits and and the problem will go away.\n \n You and Al belong in a zoo.\n \n \nI completely agree.\n \n There has never been a true debate on the actual science and details of global warming on this site.\n \n They tend to go something like this -\n \n Poster #1 - \"I'm not convinced that GW is real, at the very least, I'm not sure it's entirely human caused or that the science is completely sound. There seems to be a lack of concensus and many unanswered questions that merit investigation.\"\n \n Posters #2-10 - \"GLOBAL WARMING IS A FACT. IF YOU DENY THAT YOU ARE EITHER STUPID, A POLITICAL GOP HACK, OR PAID OFF BY THE OIL COMPANIES.\" Proceed to put fingers in ears and chant \"NA NA NA NA NA NA\".\n \n The \"pro GW\" side for lack of a better term has done a masterful (GWB like :) ) job of painting anyone that disagrees with them as being politically incorrect, ignorant and evil, while they portray themselves as white knights saving the world. It's classic propaganda, that IMHO, if the science was sound enough, would not be required.\n \n Waxy\nAlmost exactly correct!emoticon_xhoho",
