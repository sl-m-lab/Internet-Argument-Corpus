The only way that homophobia will decrease is if people are exposed to gays and realize that they're not really different at all, and the earlier that exposure starts, the better. Having special \"gay schools\" just emphasizes differences that aren't really there. Granted, it's tough enough being in high school without being ostrasized for being gay, and my heart goes out to openly gay high school students for what they must be going through, but it's their courage that will make things easier for future kids.",

   "This is good stuff too!\n \n \n \n \n Q: Why can't at-risk children remain in their current schools? Isn't this segregation? \n \n A: These are children that have been in traditional schools, but have needed to leave or have dropped out because of physical violence and/or emotional harm. Thanks to HMHS they have a safe place to learn so that they can graduate with an education, a diploma and their lives ahead of them. Being in a separate space during the school day doesn't mean that these students will never learn how to adjust to the demands of the larger world. Every day they face real-life pressures, including harassment. \n \n It is not segregation to remove a child from a dangerous situation in order to give them a chance to learn safely. HMHS is a successful refuge for a small portion of youth, who have fled unsafe schools in order to secure their right to a safe educational environment; no one is arguing for a totally separate school system. \n \n \n \n \n To anser someones question on this one.\n \n \n Q: How does the secure environment of HMHS prepare children for \"the real world\"?\n \n A: Every day they face real-life pressures, including harassment.

If you want gay high schools, the government will have to build them, and I'm sure as hell not paying for that. Then you have to hire gay teachers, bus drivers, and administrators. You don't have to pay to go public schools, that's why gays don't pay. But when kids don't like what's being taught at public schools, then they have to pay to go to private schools. The government doesn't help them out there. Same with gays. They have the right to go to school for free, BUT at a public school. If that doesn't fit their needs, then they dish out the money out of their pockets to send their kids to a gay school. If you don't like what is given to you, sometimes you have to fork up the money to get what you want. This is the case.

One time when the teacher was out of the room, they got in a group and started strangling me with a drafting line. That's about the same consistency as a fishing line. It was so bad that I started to get blood-red around my neck, and it cut me.\" Later in the school year, his classmates also cut him with knives. On another occasion, he reported, \"I was dragged down a flight of stairs by my feet.\" \n \n Lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are nearly three times as likely as their peers to have been involved in at least one physical fight at school, three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon at school, and nearly four times as likely to skip school because they feel unsafe, according to a 1999 survey administered to Massachusetts students. \n \n Girls and boys are harassed in different ways, we found. \"Gay men get more physical threats; female students are more likely to get sexually harassed and be threatened with sexual violence,\" Dahlia P. told me in Texas. \"We'll hear things like, 'I can make you straight' or 'Why don't you get some of your girlfriends and we can have a party.'\" \n \n Source http://www.cyc-net.org/today/today010905.html\n \n or\n \n CALIFORNIA\n << April 1998: Five students file a lawsuit against the Morgan Hill Unified School District claiming that officials at Live Oak High School and Murphy Middle School did nothing to stop antigay harassment dating back to 1991. One of the plaintiffs, a seventh-grader, was hospitalized after a group of boys repeatedly beat him at a school bus stop while shouting antigay epithets. The bus driver, the suit says, did nothing.\n \n source http://www.advocate.com/html/stories/809/809_youthquake.asp\n \n \n NEVADA\n << January 2000: Derek Henkle, a former Reno student, sues the school district there for failing to protect him from antigay harassment, including threats that he would be dragged from a pickup truck and an incident in which a lasso was thrown around his neck.\n \n source http://www.advocate.com/html/stories/809/809_youthquake.asp\n \n \n \n Thats right just tell em to \"get over it\"",

Thus, heterosexuals are the main victims of homophobic harassment. \n \n A 1999 survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) friendly youth organizations by the Gay Lesbian & Straight Educational Network (GLSEN) found that: \n \n 91% sometimes or frequently hear anti-gay comments such as 'XXXXXX' and 'XXXX' in school. \n 61% report verbal harassment Of those who reported verbal harassment, 46% reported that the experienced it daily. \n \n 47% report sexual harassment \n 28% report physical attacked. \n 38% did not feel comfortable speaking to school staff about LGBT issues. \n 58% say that they do not feel safe in school. 19 \n \n \n \n source: http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_stud.htm\n\n \n \n You can throw out all these facts you want. But the simple fact is gays have choices. Nobody forces them to go to public schools. They can either go to a public school, free of charge, and be exposed to whatever hatred may be there. They can pay to go to a private school, or they can pay to go to an all gay school. Simply put. Beggars can't be choosers. If you can't take it in a public school, don't whine to the government and aks them for money to send you to an all gay school.\n \n In Alabama, for instance, there are many nearly all white schools where a few blacks also attend. The blacks are hassled just like gays are. Should we go back to segregation and have all white and all black schools? The idea of separating people and having them go to school with only people like them will just take us back to pre-Civil Rights times. People will not be exposed to other cultures and ideas, and this will cause people to be tolerant to people only like them. This will further spur more hatred toward groups like gays, lesbians, blacks, nerds, etc.",

Make it a private school if you want. Don't care. Just think it's a good idea not to be bullied so as to be able to concentrate on studies.\n \n As far as extra curricular school activities I think there are benefits all around. School dances wouldn't be a place where you had to have a date of the opposite sex if you didn't want that. Sports...heck, it seems that's were most of the bullying takes place would occur.\n \n Health class wouldn't be place where discussions of only heterosexual sex would take place. Perhaps the kids could learn to know about safe sex (cuts down on aids). How many high school lesbians do you think know what a dental dam is and why it's important? You think they would teach these things in regular schools? Right now the school board is having discussions of having only to teach abstinence. \n \n And what about history. Historical events that have happened due to homosexuality could be taught filling in gaps in history that are not taught in regular history. Like famous gay/lesbians and how they have affected history (Mrs. FDR, the members of the gay SS and how Hitler affected WWII because of his gay troops, and many other historical figures that have major roles in history).\n \n I just think overall, that there is a lot of stuff to teach out there that is not being taught because of people's issues with homosexuality. I think it's a shame and will only lead to the continuation of ignorance when it comes to homosexuality.\n \n I believe also, that as a homosexual, as a group, we are more inclusive of others, more accepting. Perhaps we could rub some of this acceptance off on our budding youth.",
