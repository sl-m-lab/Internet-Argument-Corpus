Does one merely shop around to find a broker who does this? There is no stock exchange per se. Does one go to another individual and simply purchase them directly? How would one go about finding the individual?\n \n The reason I ask this question was because one stock in particular was recommended with a caveat that it was purely a speculative play but that the potential warranted the risk. I've been following that stock and it does appear that he correctly called it and it might pay off big. It can't be much worse than sticking $5 bills in a slot machine.",
