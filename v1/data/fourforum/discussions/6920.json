   "The main task of European politicians is to save their countries fron repeating French scenario. I don't mean changing of migratory and social politics - these are long-term measures. I think that we need first of all to do something for blocking forces acting as main catalysts and instigators of disorders. I talk about people who live in Europe under the mask of refugees form some Arab and other Muslim countries. Well, for example, it's well-known fact about Chechens' refugees' role in France disorders. They weren't the driving force but they played the leaders and inspirers' role successfully. And of course their European looks helped them well. In spite of the fact that they are Caucasian there are a lot of fair-haired and light-eyed representatives. And that's why it's hard to point them out as rioters unlike Afros or Arabs. Moreover, their president order was posted on the web with the call to Chechen diasporas all over the World to unite and line up for activities to oppress European officials' \"reprisals\" relating Chechens.",
