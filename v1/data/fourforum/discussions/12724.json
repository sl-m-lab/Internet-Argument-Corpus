   "I'm \"Mormon.\" (LDS is the preferred term.) This site had me in tears on the floor. Laughing. The \"Correct Version\" is indeed a fairly accurate response to this site. But the original... OH MAN! I can't wait to send a link to all my LDS friends. It's priceless. I can usually understand where they get the idea from; some piece of more complex doctrine hopelessly oversimplified, taken out of context, and/or exaggerated. But this... This is HALARIOUS! I have NO idea where he gets ANY of his info from. Maybe he read an L. Ron Hubbard book, mixed it with Star Wars, Dune, and Space Odyssey, then threw in a TON of stuff that he made up, and chucked in the name \"Kolob\" because he's sure that he heard that someplace. I think it would be impossible for him to be more wrong if he tried. Thanks for digging this up, and thanks for checking and adding the \"Correct Version\"! \n \n I'm going to start a question/answer thread about Mormons, just in case you or anybody else wants to hear what we really believe.",
