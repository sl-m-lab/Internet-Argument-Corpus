   "Mr. Berezovsky this former Russian tycoon now in the lap of luxury in here is ready to move into poor Ukraine. And then the Ukrainians may extradite him to Russia where he's been wanted so much and so long. There must be some logic to the madness of the old weirdo who has never before shown lack of brain. It's the logic of a criminal facing dead penalty and choosing life behind the bars or near them. What made Berezovsky act this way? I think I've got some explanation. There is some reliable info he is no stranger to the phony story with IRA military equipment supplies to a terror group in Great Britain. Needless to say what could be the reaction of our authorities scary of possible terror attacks here if Mr. B. really caught red-handed. B. has always had close relationship with Chechen separatists branded terrorists in Russia. I tend to think B. got the prompt from our big shots to leave a.s.a.p. in any direction up to his liking. BTW IRA withdrew the offer to destroy its whole weaponry. It adds meat to the fascinating theory linking B. to IRA deal.",
