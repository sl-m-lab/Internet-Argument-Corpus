   "October 1st, 2005\n \n \n Osama bin Laden was far from the first jihadist to kill infidels as an expression of religious piety. This years marks the 600th anniversary of the death of Tamerlane (Timur Lang; \"Timur the Lame\", d. 1405), or Amir Timur (\"Timur\" signifies \"Iron\" in Turkish). Osama lacks both Tamerlane's sophisticated (for his time) military forces and his brilliance as a strategist. But both are or were pious Muslims who paid homage to religious leaders, and both had the goal of making jihad a global force. Santayana was correct when he told us that those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeat it. \n \n Tamerlane was born at Kash (Shahr-i-Sebz, the \"Green City\") in Transoxiana (some 50 miles south of Samarkand, in modern Uzbekistan), on April 8 (or 11), 1336 C.E. Amir Turghay, his father, was chief of the Gurgan or Chagtai branch of the Barlas Turks. By age 34 (1369/70), Timur had killed his major rival (Mir Husain), becoming the pre-eminent ruler of Transoxiana. He spent the next six to seven years consolidating his power in Transoxiana before launching the aggressive conquests of Persia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and then attacking Hindustan (India) under the tottering Delhi Sultanate. [1]\n \n Grousset [2] contrasts Jenghiz Khan's \"straightforward planning\" and \"clean sweeps\" with the \"higgledy-piggledy\" order of Timur's expeditions, and the often incomplete nature of the latter's conquests:\n \n Tamerlane's [Timur's] conquering activities were carried on from the Volga to Damascus, from Smyrna to the Ganges and the Yulduz, and his expeditions into these regions followed no geographical order. He sped from Tashkent to Shiraz, from Tabriz to Khodzhent, as enemy aggression dictated; a campaign in Russia occurred between two in Persia, an expedition into Central Asia between two raids into the Caucasus...[Timur] at the end of every successful campaign left the country without making any dispositions for its control except Khwarizm and Persia, and even there not until the very end. It is true that he slaughtered all his enemies as thoroughly and conscientiously as the great Mongol, and the pyramids of human heads left behind him as a warning example tell their own tale. Yet the survivors forgot the lesson given them and soon resumed secret or overt attempts at rebellion, so that it was all to do again. It appears too, that these blood soaked pyramids diverted [Timur] from the essential objective. Baghdad, Brussa (Bursa), Sarai, Kara Shahr, and Delhi were all sacked by him, but he did not overcome the Ottoman Empire, the Golden Horde, the khanate of Mogholistan, or the Indian Sultanate; and even the Jelairs of Iraq 'Arabi rose up again as soon as he had passed. Thus he had to conquer Khwarizm three times, the Ili six or seven times (without ever managing to hold it for longer than the duration of the campaign), eastern Persia twice, western Persia at least three times, in addition to waging two campaigns in Russia...[Timur's] campaigns \"always had to be fought again\", and fight them again he did. \n \n Timur's campaigns are infamous for their extensive massacres and emblematic \"pyramids of heads\". Brown [3] cites \"only a few\" prominent examples:\n \n As specimens of those acts mention may be made of his massacre of the people of Sistan 1383-4, when he caused some two thousand prisoners to be built up into a wall; his cold- blooded slaughter of a hundred thousand captive Indians near Dihli [Delhi] (December, 1398); his burying alive of four thousand Armenians in 1400-1, and the twenty towers of skulls erected by him at Aleppo and Damascus in the same year; and his massacre of 70,000 of the inhabitants of Isfahan in (November, 1387)...\n \n Timur was a pious Muslim, who may well have belonged to the Naqshbandi Sufi order. [4; also see my earlier essay, \"Sufi Jihad\", for a discussion of Sufism and jihad.] Grousset [5] emphasizes the important Islamic motivation for Timur's jihad campaigns:\n \n It is the Qur'an to which he continually appeals, the imams and [Sufi] dervishes who prophesy his success. [emphasis added] His wars were to influence the character of the jihad, the Holy War, even when- as was almost always the case- he was fighting Muslims. He had only to accuse these Muslims of lukewarmness, whether the Jagataites of the Ili and Uiguria, whose conversion was so recent, or the Sultans of Delhi who...refrained from massacring their millions of Hindu subjects.\n \n Read the rest at: http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=4868\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1336\n 1,400 years of Islamic Imperialism and Colonialism: The Forbidden History \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1333 The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1326 Islam's Supremacist Past Is Its Present \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1303 Multiculturalism, Tolerance and Pluralism in Islam \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1298 Tolerance and Pluralism: Islamic Supremacist Literature sold in OZ Islamic Bookstores \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1292 Islamic Separtists in Australia: That's why we don't believe in democracy \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1281 Tolerance and Pluralism: Islamic Supremacist Literature casually sold in Australian Mosque \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1261 Tolerance and Pluralism: Muslim converts to Christianity face persecution and death in Bangladesh \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1246\n Tolerance and Pluralism: Muslim Book calls Norwegians\n 'Satan's sons'\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1237 \n Triple-pronged Jihad -- Military, Economic and Cultural \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1216\n Al-Qaeda book on managing savagery\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1204\n Chicago Tribune: Watchdog group assails mosque's Saudi\n books\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1185\n Egyptian Progressive Criticizes Muslim Intellectual\n Doublespeak\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1184\n Submission - Never-ending Islamic Conspiracies\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1172\n Blood Libel: Muslim Conspiracy Theories\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1113\n Comparing the Rhetoric of Jihadism and Nazism\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1050\n Arab ethnic cleansing imperialism and colonialism:\n 1,400 Years of Islamic Aggression\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/928\n Saudi export of strict Islam raises suspicions\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/906\n The Race Against Lies\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/810\n Christians and Jews Demonized in Saudi Textbooks\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/718\n Islamic concept of Al-Taqiyah to infiltrate and\n destroy kafir countries\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/803\n The Rise of Middle Eastern Crime in Australia\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/767\n \"Intolerant Form of Islam\" Taught in German Public\n Schools\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/762\n Egyptian Textbook: Beheadings are part of Islamic\n Culture\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/713\n Exclusivism and multiculturalism in Islamic society\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/536\n Hate at the Local Mosque\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/380\n The Imperialism of Khilafists: Their grand designs to\n conquer the west\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/363\n New Book Calls Europe 'Province of Islam'\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/23\n The Agenda of Islam: A War Between Civilizations\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/2\n The Clash Of Civilizations And The Great Caliphate",
