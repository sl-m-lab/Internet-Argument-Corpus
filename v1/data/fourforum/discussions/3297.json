The real culprit is malpractice insurance. Doctors are forced to pay super high rates, yet be paid barely ocosts by the HMO's and insurance companies. Medicaid and medicare pay reimbursement at an even lower rate. After years of colleges and medical school, student loans etc.... It is not a financially healthy field to go playing in like years ago.\n \n The best we can hope for is caps on malpractice lawsuit settlements to lower the insruance premiums, raised reimbursements from medicare and medicaid. and a national provider index, so doctors get paid enough to want to be doctors. More emphasis on nurse practioners would be helpful as well.",

   "I see a lot of ridicule in some of the posts, probably from some who could never get in a medical school, much less pass the courses or meet the requirements required to put M.D. after their name. I spent a number of years with a company that automated medical groups and clinics, and in that time I met hundreds of doctors from every specialty. The company owner, my boss, was a neurosurgeon. I found that most doctors are dedicated professionals who did not go into medicine just to make money. Of course most earn a good income and many enjoy the trappings that go with wealth, but so do many other professionals in other fields. Most people have no idea what it takes just to keep the doors open at a medical clinic. My company made thousands on just software updates due to constant changes in Medicare procedures, not including the cost and maintenance of the equipment we sold. Insurance costs are staggering. Medical equipment and supplies, floorspace, records, medical and non-medical personnel, the list goes on. There were some doctors I met that flunked out of charm school, I really didn't like them personally, but I respected them for their knowledge ... and still do.\n Dono",

   "I can only speak from the perspective of rural doctors. First, let me tell you that I worked in a rural hospital that piloted the DRG system of payment which is reimbursement based on diagnosis. While it caused a lot of cutbacks after the system was implemented, there is no reason to say that the doctors don't get paid enough. Doctors, in rural hospitals do not \"take call\", the ER's are staffed with doctors from companies who supply this service. \n Many doctors fill up their daily clinic schedules with Medicare patients and their continual follow-ups. Their visits are routinely scheduled for 30 minutes each. Doctors take Medicare assignment and can estimate their weekly earnings based on how many Medicare patients they see. Welfare patients are assigned to doctors and the pay for seeing a welfare patient is minimal. Insurance companies contract --you know the HMO story. \n Too many times the ER is used as a clinic, because of the above reasons. The doctor doesn't have any openings, unless you are a special friend--the gargoyle at the reception desk, won't squeeze you in. \n \n Just my opinion, doctors go to school to be doctors because they can for whatever reasons, status, money, ect. not because of their desire to heal the sick. Or maybe they start out thinking they are going to heal people but the burocracy (sp) spoils the job. There is no such thing as the country doc who comes to your home to see a sick person.\n \n Yes, they have to pay high malpractice insurance. Blame this sue happy society on that. If people really knew what went on in hospitals and what their doctors do--there would be twice or three times the suits. Many rural doctors quit delivering babies due to lawsuits -a very vulnerable area for lawsuits. \n However, some doctors do some very illegal things. One of those kindergarten issues, all have to pay the price for a few wrongdoers. \n \n My vehicle insurance and home insurance are high too compared to my income.\n \n Those are some of my thoughts",
