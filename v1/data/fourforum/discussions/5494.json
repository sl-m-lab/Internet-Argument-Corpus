   "I believe I predicted a few days ago. Hillary/Warner in 2008. You heard it here first. On the Republican side it will most likely come down to McCain or Allen, with Owens a dark horse. \n ===============================\n Gov. Mark Warner looking ready to join the fledgling field.\n \n By Howard Fineman\n MSNBC contributor\n Updated: 3:38 p.m. ET June 1, 2005\n \n WASHINGTON - The buzz here is about Deep Throat and how President Bush allegedly lost his 'Mo, but, being the campaign geek I am, I'm thinking about the future: the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.\n \n Here's where we are as we enter the starting gate. There are paired entries, as they say in horse racing. Hillary (and Bill) Clinton in Number One, of course. Then, the 2004 John-John ticket-mates, Senators Kerry and Edwards. The third pair are smooth-moving moderates: Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia. Rounding out the field, three other governors: Richardson of New Mexico, Vilsack of Iowa, Rendell of Pennsylvania.\n \n Hillary's Hillary. 'Nuff said. The entry I'd rather talk about this time around is arguably the most obscure -- Warner.\n \n Let's put the caveats up front. He is relatively young (50), has zero experience in defense or foreign policy, has no military background or national organization, and strikes some people who know him as unusually hungry and manipulative. Also, he will be out of office at the end of this year (Virginia has one-term-only governors), and who knows what will happen between then and '08 to affect the national landscape. We are in a dangerous and unpredictable world.\n \n Still, he bears watching, and here's why:\n \n He's a governor\n In recent decades, governorships have been the best launch vehicles, especially if they are in the South or West. Among Democrats, we're talking about governors who managed to avoid the label \"liberal\" as they rise to national prominence: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8062256/",
