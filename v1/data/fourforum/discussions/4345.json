What I question is this: if a film like the Passion, which is an artistic achievement if there ever was one, is not to be recognized by the academy, then obviously they do not judge every film by the standards that you say they do. I find it quite odd that they won't at least nominate such a film in a major catagory although I think I understand why.",

While favorable public reaction makes bigger dollar numbers, established producers don't make a film unless research is complete and the theatre, DVD/video, TV and now bootleg rights are in place. They're looking for a specific ROI on a film and with distribution and show business accounting in place most major releases going to make money even if a picture bombs. If a hit, better. In a way, movies are like politics; while the public mass thinks they're important, and they are needed, they're just another component in a formula and what they actually think as individuals isn't all that important. Pre-release audiences provide the feedback for necessary adjustments to the multiple pre-release versions and that somewhat takes care of the public factor.\n \n So the Academy is a professional association, like many others, awarding their peers kudos, not the public. The public reaction factor, revenue, has mostly already been determined. More after release revenue for winners, but that's not the point. Academy members are at the Oscar Awards to be seen, admired and hated by their own kind, where working is the major factor, far more important to them than public viewers. That they are unique and accomplished in that respect is what attracts viewers from the mostly mundane and common public.",
