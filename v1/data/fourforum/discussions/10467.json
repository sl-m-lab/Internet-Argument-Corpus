Wouldn't the whole idea of a man wanting change to a woman to with a man be considered heterosexual? I guess I don't understand how if a man turns into a woman to be with a man would still be a gay issue.\n \n I do understand about the discrimintion and we should fight to make sure that everyone is not discriminated against and has equal opportunities in life.\n \n How is someone who identifies with being female and likes men still considered gay?",

   "I guess one way of looking at it is to realise that transgendered individuals face even more discrimination (and more vicious and violent discrimination) than gays do. The similarity is that both make choices about sexual identity and gender roles. Gay men, for example, choose different gender roles from either straight men or women -- it's not that gay men become like women, in the popular stereotype, it's that they choose to form relationships between naturally equal partners. \n \n Apparently this is dreadfully offensive to some straight people even if they aren't asked to form such relationships themselves, but what they seem to dread even more is someone who not only repudiates (i.e. \"betrays\") their own sex, but sometimes does it surgically. Maybe these alternative choices are seen as \"insulting\" to their own choice of conformist gender roles, by calling their personal judgement into question; maybe they are just irrational, animal fear of the unknown and not understood.\n \n At any rate, I for one can see why we should have solidarity between gays, bisexuals and T-folk -- if we can't accept them and their right to make decisions about their own sexuality, who will?",

Some of you do know me otherwise, so hello, I'm not trying to fool anyone, just have been bothered online for expressing my opinions, and thought this might be an interesting change, if you've read the short story about axolotls and seeing the world completely through another's eyes. Hmmm..... Regardless, I find it amazing that people are often very uncomfortable posting with others, just on the basis of their reasoning. We are very dependent, as a society, IMO, on filtering communications through perceptions of gender or sexual orientation, among other identifying labels.\n \n I agree that acceptance and non-discrimination are the most importance factors. But part of what leads to that, is also just understanding what these things are.\n \n I am reading some wikipedia entries. I am still not clear on the differences between transgender and transsexual. I would like to be able to explain it better to young people who ask. I have meet a transgendered child whose mother had a similar perspective to the mother on the Oprah Winfrey show. And yes, people get sex change operations, but medicine has not figured out how to completely alter a person's gender to what they might desire. So I am not sure that it is accurate to say that, for example, a man who gets a sex change operation to a woman, and goes with a male partners is hetereosexual, or not homosexual. Though the partner may be heterosexual. I don't know.\n \n Here is what wikipedia says about transgender.\n \n --------------\n \n Transgender is the state of one's \"gender identity\" (self-identification as male, female, both or neither) not matching one's \"assigned gender\" (identification by others as male or female based on physical/genetic sex). \"Transgendered\" does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation - transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual or asexual.\n A transgendered individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the traditional gender continuum, or exist outside of it as \"other,\" \"agender,\" \"intergender,\" or \"third gender\". Transgendered people may also identify as bigender, or along several places on either the traditional transgender continuum, or the more encompassing continuums which have been developed in response to the significantly more detailed studies done in recent years.[1]\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender\n \n -------------\n \n There is also a wikipedia transsexual entry, but I am not seeing the finer distinctions.\n \n There appears to be cross-over or blurring in categories with gay. \n \n ------------\n \n But if I am confused, and I am a fairly open-minded person, I imagine communicating the information to the broader public will be quite a task.",

Why not accept a transgender male as transgender male, or a transgender female as transgender female?\n \n A doctor who performs sex change operations also appeared on the program. She was transgender female but formally lived in the closet as your conventional heterosexual male, a gynecologist who was married and had children. She came out to her wife and family, started living openly as a transgender female, went through sex change medical practices, and became such a surgeon, herself. Here's an interesting catch - she and her wife remain married. Does that make them both bisexual? Does that mean gay marriage is a reality in this country in more ways than we realize? I forget if she still considers herself her children's father or mother. I'm guessing, mother, because the transgender teen's brother felt that, in gaining a brother, he had still lost his sister, and grieved over this.\n \n But why not accept it, however poorly we are able to define things for what they are or aren't.\n \n Maybe we just need new terms.",

   "I'll be frank. I have trouble with some of it. The show did not provide much background information on the history of these issues -- which I will separate here clearly from gay rights -- and it was hard for me to comprehend some of the mother's position. The transgender teenager boy had her/his breasts removed at the age of sixteen. This is quite radical, I thought. Shouldn't the mom have their child wait longer on this, until they are an adult, since the procedure is so permanent? But on the other hand, the youth seemed happy. While the transgender woman in their twenties did not have a supportive upbringing and it was clearly very painful to them, a source of unhappiness.\n \n The transgender child I met also seemed happy and well-adjusted. So support and acceptance, IMO, is very important. Though I question some of the positions being presented, such as how these things develop in people, how \"genetic\" or not it is, and without further information, I agree that gender doesn't fundamentally change.

I'd never believe that one can change one's innate behaviour, nor should people try to.

It's the reclassification of someone's sex to something else I have a problem with, or at least don't see the point to.\n \n These days we have no discrimination based on mental sexuality; a woman's brain is utterly equal to a man's. The only thing we do sexually discriminate by is physical sexuality, based on a recognition that the male and female body is physically different. Women's tennis, to take a mundane example, is only open to women due to a recognition that the body they are born with is physically different to one a man was born with, regardless of the sex of the mind. So where is the logic in allowing someone to compete with a man's body, albeit superficially altered, because they have \"the mind of a woman\"?\n \n In short, if Stan wants to call himself Loretta, to dress, act and get married as a woman then fair enough, it makes no difference.

It's just a recognition that not all people fit into easily definable categories.\n \n Some people are going to have some characteristics that are stereotypically male and others that are stereotypically female. Some will have characteristics that aren't easily classifiable as male or female. Why do we have to shoehorn them all into one of the two permissible boxes?\n \n We don't have to live in the boxes convention sets out for us, especially when convention goes against biology and individual liberty. It's not \"wrong\" to object to someone else's classification -- it's a disagreement.",

   "Here's an interesting article I just found on transgender athletes competing (a new topic for me). It reports that with a possible exception for swimming, M to F does not gain an advantage (for example, individuals lose muscle mass, a supposed advantage), while F to M raises issues because of rules around taking hormones. But not an insurmountable issue with the waiting requirement following sex change. The writer reports that transgender atheletes are not new, more that athletes are coming out more. Beijing '08 shall see the first M to F cyclist.\n\n \n Your example here is one of the limitation of a common classification system -- it just can't cope with every possibility, because nature allows for more possibilities than arbitrary philosophical dualism acknowledges. There may not even BE a \"right\" classification system in a society where hormone treatments can alter the physical appearance and performance of someone's body.\n \n It may be that athletics associations, like architects figuring out how many different kinds of toilets a building needs, will find it convenient to alter their rules to accommodate transsexuals in standard male-female categories; or it may be that they'll create new \"intersex\" categories if there is a sufficient demand and it makes sporting sense. (Britain, for example, now has a fair proportion of \"unisex\" single-occupancy toilets, though not nearly enough.) Maybe transsexuals will simply be forced to live with some barriers against their full and untrammelled participation in sport.\n \n I think there are wider and more pressing theaters of discrimination against transsexuals than sporting events, though.",

The dualistic model seems more embedded in my thinking, at times, than I like. Getting in the way of understanding, rather than helping it. I suppose gender, like sexual orientation, is better grasped in terms of a continuum, while even that does poorly.\n \n One advantage to Olympic competitions is that it breaks stereotypes in people's minds about who \"transsexuals\" and tg persons are. Many of whom think only of entertainers and prostitutes. Indeed, the question was initially posed to me because many free urban weekly presses have a page or two of \"transsexual\" \"escorts\". A problem for the tg movement, I guess, is that for many individuals, most of whom are not \"escorts\", being tg by definition involves a desire to blend in. But I imagine, this doesn't serve an equal rights movement too well, nor does it help tg young people have role models in all walks of life, not just \"escort\" services, as well as the rest of the populace to better understand.\n \n Personally, from that article, I would completely support tg participation in sports. Athletic competitions are about more than just scores. And I would be surprised if major athletes had any objections. If there are distinct advantages, committees could cross that bridge when they get there. But, hey, how do we really measure these advantages/disadvantages? Who is best at soccer? Basketball? etc. To be really fair, we'd have to exclude entire nations.",

There is some use in simplifying a system to a 2-valued one: if you want to know whether or not to take a flashlight or an umbrella, it doesn't matter whether the darkness or rain is heavy or not, as any amount of either will make the tool useful.

   "Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi agreed Friday to fast-track a transgender-inclusive Employment Non-discrimination Act (ENDA) once there are enough votes to pass it, The Advocate has learned exclusively. Although a version of the bill that protects only sexual orientation will be marked up by committee and move to a floor vote next week, the Democrat from California has promised to hold a floor vote on a fully inclusive ENDA without delay as soon as the political support is there.\n \n So basically she's promised the trans-inclusive-ENDA-or-nothing crowd a floor vote once they do their homework and get enough votes to pass their bill. (They don't have the votes, Barney Frank has said the trans-inclusive bill will lose by 50 votes.) In the meantime, she's going to move ahead with the GLB ENDA, which does have the votes.

The Christian right is lobbying hard to get Republicans to oppose ENDA in any form and to get President Bush to veto the bill if it comes to his desk.
