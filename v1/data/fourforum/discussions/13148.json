   "6 Cops, 59 Shots, 43 Wounds, 1 Dead in Tenn.\n Wednesday, August 19, 2009 \n Associated Press\n \n CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. - Alonzo Heyward carried a rifle around his low-rent neighborhood one day last month, ranting about suicide and ignoring the pleas of friends for hours before six Chattanooga police officers surrounded him on his front porch and decided it had to end.\n \n His father says Heyward told the officers, \"I'm not out here to hurt anybody.\"\n \n But the police, who tried unsuccessfully to disarm Heyward, fired 59 rounds to kill him on July 18. The medical examiner found 43 bullet wounds in his chest, face, arms, hands, legs, buttocks and groin. Police contend Heyward was a danger to others and threatened the six officers.\n \n Chattanooga police spokeswoman Jerri Weary described the case as \"suicide by cop.\"\n \n As questions continue to surround the shooting, Heyward's family and civil rights leaders take issue with the police response.\n \n \"We have a large concern about the amount of shots fired,\" said Valoria Armstrong, president of the NAACP branch in Chattanooga.\n \n A Chattanooga Times Free Press editorial cartoon asked \"IS THIS EXCESSIVE FORCE?\" - spelling out the question with letters labeling the wounds in a drawing based on Heyward's autopsy report.\n \n His father, James Marine, 61, does not believe Heyward really wanted to kill himself or that he was trying to commit \"suicide by cop.\"\n \n \"He just needed somebody to talk to,\" Marine said. ... \"I believe he was just depressed at that time.\"\n \n A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation probe is ongoing. Federal and local authorities are awaiting the TBI report before they do their own examinations of the case. Hamilton County District Attorney Bill Cox said he wants to see the TBI report before deciding whether to pursue a criminal case.\n \n Heyward, a 32-year-old moving company employee, was black. The six officers are white. They were temporarily placed on administrative leave but have since returned to work.\n \n Police spokeswoman Weary said the officers confronted Heyward when they responded to a report of three men wrestling over a gun in the street just after 4 a.m.\n \n Heyward's father said there was never any wrestling over the .44 Magnum rifle that his son was carrying and sometimes pointing at his chin.\n \n Police said the officers tried but failed to disarm Heyward with a stun gun. Weary said Heyward ignored repeated commands to drop the rifle and officers fired when they felt threatened by the way he moved it.\n \n Police accounts and a patrol car video indicate the shots were fired in three volleys, all within 30 seconds. Each officer used a .45-caliber pistol. Some officers emptied their magazines, reloaded and fired again, while others didn't fire all their bullets, Weary said.\n \n Some of the gunshots ripped through the unoccupied front room of the house Heyward was renting from his employer, the owner of a local moving company. No one else was injured.\n \n The FBI and Justice Department do not keep national \"suicide by cop\" statistics. FBI records from September 2008 show 391 \"justifiable homicides\" by law enforcement in 2007, up slightly from the previous year.\n \n Eugene O'Donnell, a former policeman and prosecutor who is now a professor of police studies at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said there is \"no magic number\" when it comes to officers firing at a suspect.\n \n If death is believed to be imminent \"there isn't anybody in the country who can tell the cops 10 shots and no more,\" O'Donnell said.\n \n \"Unfortunately this is replicated all over the country. When you send the police they bring deadly force with them. They come armed and they come predisposed to use force,\" O'Donnell said.\n \n According to court records, Heyward had been charged three times in the past with domestic assault. The first two were dismissed. The third, from a January 2008 incident, remained pending at the time of his death.\n \n He was sentenced in 2005 to 11 months, 29 days in the county workhouse for passing worthless checks, but the sentence was suspended for good behavior and he was given probation.\n \n He also had a few driving related charges on his record, including a violation of the auto registration law for which he received a 30 day suspended sentence in 1997.\n \n The morning he died, Heyward was distraught after returning from a party where he had been drinking, his father said.\n \n \"He didn't think anybody cared about him,\" Marine said.\n \n Heyward was also upset about not seeing his children - a daughter and two sons - according to brother James Heyward.\n \n The video shows that police were told Heyward was drunk and talking about killing himself before they started shooting.\n \n Chattanooga police officers get two to four hours of training annually on dealing with people who are mentally ill or under the influence of drugs or narcotics. But Weary said the training could not be applied in this case because the situation was too fluid and unfolded too quickly.\n \n Weary wouldn't say whether Heyward had a history of mental health problems, citing the ongoing investigation. Marine said his son had no history of mental illness.\n \n Amanda Counts, Heyward's girlfriend, and neighbor Darrell Turner said they witnessed the shooting. They said Heyward was lying on the porch on top of the rifle when officers opened fire.\n \n \"Before the first shot was fired he was down,\" Counts said. \"Not one time did he threaten anyone.\"\n \n Citing the ongoing investigation, police declined to answer questions about Heyward's position when officers started shooting.\n \n Counts and Turner both said that during the first brief interruption in the barrage of police gunshots, they heard Heyward ask, \"Why are you shooting me?\"\n \n That cannot be heard in the recording provided by police.\n \n Police Chief Freeman Cooper this month told Chattanooga radio station WGOW the simultaneous shooting by all six officers shows they acted properly.\n \n \"We are saying that our people did what we trained them to do,\" the police chief said.\n \n The officers involved in the shooting had between three and six years on the force.\n \n Heyward's father said he thinks a different police response could have brought the incident last month to a peaceful conclusion.\n \n \"I believe he would have put that weapon down,\" Marine said. \"They should have said, 'Mr. Heyward, put the weapon down. We're here to help you.' ... He wasn't threatening no one.\"",

   "Oh so police need as many rounds as they can get their hands on, and there is 6 of them but when the 100 pound woman, in a dark alley is getting attacked by 6 men she only needs 10 rounds! That should help crime. \n \n Oh btw this is my 2 cents on firearms.\n \n I live in Queensland Australia. As many of you may know in 1996 Australia decided to enact gun laws to \"protect\" the people from massacres with firearms and in fact all firearm related crime, as if the law abiding hand in their guns there will be no crime. As many of you may also know these laws have been a massive success. In fact these laws are simply brilliant........................................... if you are a criminal! They helped criminals rape, murder and steal and terrorise the law abiding. In Victoria alone homicides in 1997 went up more than 150% in ONE YEAR . And nation wide armed robberies up more than 44%. How did these firearm laws designed to protect its citizens possible fail i hear you asking. Well simple law abiding citizens turned in their ONLY means of protection giving criminals a right of way to do whatever they want to unarmed prey. \n \n We here in Australia cannot DEFEND OUR LIVES anymore. We had our basic human right to defend ourselves from those who choose to do wrong right taken away. We cannot pull out or glock and put a bullet though the guy sneaking into your house at 2 o'clock in the morning who plans on murdering you and your family. You must call the police who will be there in 35 minutes (average response time for QLD police) and then see what weapon he is carrying. If he has a knife you must find a knife. If he has a baseball bat you must use a baseball bat (if he has a gun the you are so screwed). You must wait for him to make treating moves towards you before you can defend yourself. This is MADNESS. \n \n Lets look at how much good banning LAW ABIDING citizens from owning firearms has done for those who live in England. Oh wait violent crimes are skyrocketing!! Who would have thought hey. England gun crime rate and in fact ALL crimes are skyrocketing, because the law abiding citizens simply cannot defend themselves, \"oh don't worry the government will protect us i hear anti gun nuts cry\" I do believe this to be quite hard considering British police do not carry firearms. Besides what can possibly go wrong when we put our lives in the hands of the government? the German government did such a great job at defending its people when Adolf Hitler was in power. Other governments such as the North Korea or Cuba or Serra Leone, or maybe even the Zimbabwe government has really helps its citizens. \n \n When will gun control nuts figure out that GUNS IN THE HANDS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS SAVE LIVES? Switzerland where every male over 18 has a \"military\" firearm has the lowest crime rates anywhere in the world. \n \n I will be moving to America when i turn 18 trust me. I will go shooting with all of you patriots who love the United States of America, and who love their Constitution guaranteeing the basic human rights. People who hate the second amendment basically hate the constitution of the United States of America. For you see without the 2nd amendment the 1st would fall, the 3, the 4th and the 5 would be ignored. And pretty soon the government could do whatever the hell they want. It is pretty funny to me as people who hate the 2nd amendment use the 1st amendment to criticise it. But what they do not see is that guns gave them their freedom of speech, the civil war was fought with firearms, and every war has been since. \n \n \n \n A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 27 words that guarantee every American citizen the right to defend themselves and their country from anybody who wishes to do them harm or from a tyrannical government. All those who oppose the second amendment from those at the Brady campaign or Mothers against guns, want law abiding citizens to become subjects, not citizens. Gun control NEVER has or will work and I look forward to standing on a US shooting range exercising MY Constitutional rights with those who love FREEDOM! \n \n \n \n NEVER GIVE AN INCH TO ANTI GUN NUTJOBS, THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS AND YOUR FREEDOM. DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS, DEFEND YOUR FREEDOM AND THE FUTURE FREEDOM OF THE USA! \n \n The government did not just stop there, oh no! \n \n Non lethal Toys: \n \n Anything that looked like a firearm is now resticted HEAVILY or outright banned. Now I know that everybody from every other country on the planet loves airsoft but not us! Our government since 1996 has made Airsoft a sport where you shoot plastic BBS at each other and the worst injury ever is a chipped tooth illegal, and infact are MORE heavily restricted that 44 magnums. In fact the only way to get airsoft guns into australia you must smuggle it illegally! Our government is controlling what we do for fun, CONTROLLING TOYS. Yet anti gun nuts still say that we are better off for this ban on a HARMLESS TOY. How insane is that. \n \n We have these %%!*$%!$ weapon grading caterogies, so anything that looks like a military gun is classed R for restited. This means YOU CANNOT EVER BUY IT. So an airsoft Mp5 M4, or anything like that is in the same category as the real thing. \n \n Paintball is just as bad, They are put into the same category as Shotguns and rimfire guns and airrifles. So you must register every gun, have a 28 day cooling off period and you are limited on the amount of firearms/ paintball markers you are allowed to purchase. Now these paintball guns we have in Australia CANNOT even look like a real firearm and cannot ever be modified to look like one. (In case you rob a bank with one! lolololollolllololo) \n \n The government has banned fully auto, semi automatic long arms and the only ones left are semi auto handguns (which gun control australia are now trying to ban, saying that there is no need to own them as NO sport in the world uses semi auto handugns) and bolt action rifles and single shot handguns. They keep on saying thiis is for the good of the nation but as we all know this is %%!*$%!$. As soon as they get semi auto handguns banned the next item up on their list is the last bit of freedom we have. \n \n So there you have it, if you want to play a harmess sport that even GUN HATING ENGLAND can still play you are simply not allowed to and you never can. It does not matter if you have licences or anthing you simply cannot own one. IF you want to play paintbll you have to got through 100s of hours worth of paperwork, background checks and licencing so our government knows who has them so when the day comes police can storm into your house like they did after hurricane Katrina and beat you up and take away your paintball gun. Nothing good has come out of our gun ban as we are having more rights takedn away. We annot buy fireworks to CELEBRATE special occasions as the government has banned these. We have lost the right to self defence the most BASIC of all rights, the right to life. We have simply had our rights slowly and quitely taken away till some day in the near future we will wake up with resticitons on where we can go, who we can speak to and what we wear, buy, and say. \n \n Please america I beg you STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS, STAND UP FOR YOUR FREEDOM AND YOUR LIBERIES. It starts out with firearms and then moves on to knives fireworks like down here. \n \n Now then over in America you have the Brady campaign for promoting criminal violence and citizen submissiveness. \n \n Over here we have a wonderful organisation called Gun Control Australia or Government Control over Australians. They are led into battle by a woman with the logic of potato and the intelligence of a dog (sorry to all dogs as that was just plain offensive) \n \n Here she is on a show called sunrise hosted by 2 people. The woman Mel whose ONLY qualifications of raising 3 children and koshie is a finance expert turned \"gun hating genius\" Unfortunately we do not have a Glenn Beck in Australia on TV who will invite my Hero Wayne LaPierre on to give some balance to his stories. Oh no! He always invites Gun haters on, such as the woman you are about to see, who has a hard time putting lies together as facts are much too difficult for here to remember, instead she just makes up a few as she goes along. \n \n Will post these after i get to 10 posts (just seach on Youtube anti gun on sunrise)\n Now then to all gun lovers/freedom lovers/patriots out there I will give you a round of applause if you can name me ALL the Lies she tries to pass off as facts. \n \n But the incompetence does not stop there ladies and gentlemen, in the next balanced story delved by Sunrise with the help of Samantha Lee her pleas about guns do not stop. \n \n YouTube - Sunrise Firearm debate Will post these after i get to 10 posts (just seach on Youtube anti gun on sunrise)\n \n \n Have a look at that one. The man who bothered to come along with some facts and do some research is he is an MP up in North QLD, who has to deal with thousands of wild pigs killing native wildlife with a bolt action 308. So he shoots one and the rest just run away. Wilson Tuckey is the only other MP I know of who supports your right to defend your family with a firearm. \n \n Many of you would have seen this: \n \n Will post these after i get to 10 posts (just seach on Youtube anti gun on sunrise)\n YouTube - Sunrise Pistol Toting Pastor[/url] \n \n Where koshie believes that nobody would ever attack a church!! Not even terrorists. \n \n We are up against that: A woman who comes on TV makes up some bullishit and then goes home leaving her security in the hands of the government. \n \n Here is an interview in which Samantha Lee basically says LAW ABIDING citianes are too incompetent to look after their own firearms \n \n Glover continues yesterday's discussion on the subject of carjacking and \n The increase in violence around Sydney. He says last night there were shots \n Fire from a car into a residence above a shop in Auburn. He wonders why \n there are still so many guns still in circulation years after the tightening \n of gun laws. Interview with Samantha Lee, an anti-gun activist from the \n National Coalition for Gun Control. She says that one of the major problems \n with gun control is that, back in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre, the \n Prime Minister banned semi-automatic long arm and shot guns, but he did not \n ban semi-automatic hand guns. She says these guns are available to the \n general public. She would like to see them banned for civilian usage. She \n says the more guns there are out there in the community, the greater the \n likelihood they will be stolen and flow into the criminal market. Glover \n says security guards need semi-automatic hand guns. Lee says this is a \n matter that needs to be debated. She says there are 300,000 semi-automatics \n out in there in the community, and 100,000 of them are not accounted for. \n Glover says that some people argue that banning guns is not the answer, \n because criminals will always manage to get hold of them. Lee says that the \n main way that criminals get guns is by stealing them from legal owners. She \n says if we reduce the number of guns legally held within the community, we \n will reduce the number of guns flowing into the illegal market. She says the \n Australian Institute of Criminology backs this up. She says that since the \n latest round of gun laws were introduced, the number of people killed each \n year by firearms has dropped by 560 to 300. \n \n Interviewees: Samantha Lee, National Coalition for Gun Control \n \n Whenever I need a laugh I just pop over to the gun control australia website\n \n GCA believes that the Australian instititute of criminology (a government run organisation) is lying, that hunters LOVE killing defenceless pests that are killing our local animals and plants. That law abiding shooters just sell their guns to homicidal maniacs and that America is the problem and the NRA is the Devil. (BTW guys I love the NRA and I plan to be a life member of it) \n \n They don't just stop there though they dig deep into Australians problems by doing some hard journalism by interviewing 12 year olds who believed that guns, cigarettes and plastic bags were the 3 worst inventions ever!!!! Not Nuclear weapons or gas chambers or even biological agents. Their plan to stop violence though is a cracker! Taking the students lead, we are reminded that cigarette packets [and, indeed, some plastic bags!] are legally compelled to contain a warning about the dangers of using the contents. It seems obvious that all guns should also have a message etched into the steel of the barrel, the wood of the stock and the glass of the telescopic sight: \n \n THIS DEVICE IS DESIGNED TO KILL \n THIS DEVICE IS DESIGNED TO KILL \n THIS DEVICE IS DESIGNED TO KILL \n That will make most mass murders stop and think about using firearms wont it hey! They believe that the Gun lobby and the NRA are a threat to the children because the children will all bring guns to school! \n \n What a joke we are up against! \n \n Yet people think it will never happen in america. DONT LET IT HAPPEN \n \n These are just some of the things that are happenign in australia. You can now get pulled over by the police while they inspect your vehicle and give you tickes for your rear brake pads being slightly warn down, plus we need permits to make sandsculptures on public beaches!!",

   "If he answers each post he will be at 10 :)\n \n I suppose the story Sarge posted is part of propaganda? Not on his part but of the author and the public servants who did the shooting. What do they expect to be taken away from all this pablum? \"if you have a gun you will be shot to rag dolls\"? That is the only purpose I see here. Meanwhile, recently they questioned a woman who had shot an armed intruder and ask her why whe shot the perp 5 times with a small frame revolver. Her answer, \"well the 6th time it started clicking\".\n \n I wonder if the anti Constitutionalist on this board will make an issue with all the misses? That is their main contention that armed citizens need \"training like the cops get\"...supposedly trying method substitution to make it more difficult to use armed self-defense. They alone want to be the tsarists who never run out of excuses to diminish rights-----meanwhile, 90 million armed Americans live peacefully in their homes-----and wait.\n\n \n Well Doc i'm just suprised the Brady bunch hasn't jumped on this like a hound dog on a pork chop. It fits their agenda perfectly. Crazed gun nut endangering society forces the guardians of society to shoot him. If the damned guns were illegal in the first place we wouldn't have this. emoticon_xagree",
