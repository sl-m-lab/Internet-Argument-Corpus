Ok, that's hyperbole, but still.\n \n This expresses how I feel about nascar\n\n \n LOL, I need one of those shirts!\n \n I'm not big on soccer, and frankly, could care less about David Beckham or his wife. I watched a fair bit of it when I was on holiday in Scotland and Italy last fall. Even with a spode's understanding of the game, I find it incredibly boring. I do have a lot of respect for the physical skills and stamina of the players though.\n \n NASCAR is a joke in my mind, but people love. I think they go for race, but stay for the crashes. Carnage sells. So do rednecks. Thus, NASCAR is a billion dollar industry.\n \n I have to admit that I watch poker on TV. I used to watch it a lot, now far more rarely, but I do enjoy. I love to play it too.\n \n I laughed out loud at Sinjin's comment on baseball. I've never been a baseball fan, I played a lot of it as a kid, but I pitched, caught, or played SS/2B, so I tended to be in the heart of the \"action\". A few innning spent standing around in the outfield was enough to make me go numb. As for watching baseball, no thanks. I caved in to peer pressure and joined one of those fantasy baseball leagues this year, I actually have a kick XXX team, so I've been paying some attention to MLB for the first time in my life. Like Homer Simpson says, you make sports more fun by betting money on it.\n \n The NHL playoffs this year have been some of the best hockey I can remember. My Oiler's run to the Cup final last year will be hard to top, but the quality of this years playoffs has been fantastic. That, and my predicitions have been 90% correct. I really should have joined a pool a bet money on it. :p\n \n Waxy",

I think this has more to do with Mrs Beckham's wishes.\n\n \n Funny how he has been called up for the England squad again, doesn't sound like International career is over.

We already have baseball if boredom is what you're looking for in a sport.\n\n \n It is not a about the score, you can have an exciting match that still ends in 0:0. I have seen such matches where it was end to end play, but the ball just didn't end up in the net. I think sports like American Football are boring with the continual stop/starts and the continual obsession with stats.\n \n For all those believe football is boring you should spend a match day with me and my mates. We head to the pub at 1130am for it opening, drink until about 2pm. Watch the game, dance and sing football songs. When the game finishes we head back to the pub for more drinks until the bars close(12-1).\n The above is just a typical game, at a Scotland game we all get dressed up in our Kilts and do the above. You haven't seen a football match until you have been to see Scotland, the last game I went to some of fans had bagpipes and they played various football songs through out the game.\n \n Football isn't just about the 90 minutes of play, it is about the atmosphere before and after the match.\n \n Now back on the original topic, I couldn't really care less about David Beckham and his move to LA and I am not even American.",

It's a blast. You'll never see so many people painted green, wearing watermelons on their heads and just generally having a good time. The great thing is, when it comes to game time, EVERYONE is into the game and cheering (or all too often booing emoticon_cry ) like crazy.\n \n I find your description of a good \"football\" day funny though, that day sounds like it would be a good time to me regardless of whether or not there was even a game! It could be a professional tiddly winks match or a spelling bee and that day would still be a blast.\n \n I'm a football addict, I grew up playing and watching it, my dad coached for 20 years. I can watch college football and the Canadian Football League (CFL) all day Saturday, and then watch 12 hours of the NFL on Sunday, followed by the Monday Night and Thursday Night games and never tire of it.

It makes for a great video game anyway.\n \n American football is a lot like a chess match. At its very basics, it's a battle of behemoth men, inches apart, in an all out physical contest.\n \n But behind that, and the key to victory, is the coaching, preparation, and execution of the game plan. The battle between coaches to out prepare the opponent, and most importantly, to win the mental battle of play calling and strategy during the game is key to the outcome.\n \n It's this mental battle, the game as a chess match with the players as pawns, that I personally find fascinating about the game, and it's what keeps me watching for hours on end.\n \n Waxy",
