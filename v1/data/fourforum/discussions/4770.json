   "It ain't Bubba \n \n Bubba died in a fire and his body was burned pretty badly. The morgue needed someone to identify the body, so they sent for his two best friends, Daryl and Gomer. The three men had always done everything together. \n \n \n Daryl arrived first, and when the mortician pulled back the sheet, Daryl said, \"Yup, his face is burnt up pretty bad. You better roll him over.\" \n \n \n \n The mortician rolled him over, and Daryl said, \"Nope, ain't Bubba.\" \n \n The mortician thought that was rather strange. Then he brought Gomer in to identify the body. Gomer took a look at the body and said, \"Yup, he's pretty well burnt up. Roll him over.\" \n \n The mortician rolled him over and Gomer said, \"No, it ain't Bubba.\" \n \n \n \n The mortician asked, \"How can you tell?\" \n \n Gomer said, \"Well, Bubba had two XXX holes.\" \n \n \"What? He had two XXX holes?!\" said the mortician. \n \n \"Yup, everyone knew he had two XXX holes. Every time we went to town, folks would say, 'Here comes Bubba with them two XXX holes.'\"",
