   "Well, that's good news. Meanwhile, acceptance of marriage equality continues to grow:\n \n Winning with the Young\n \n \nCollege freshmen continued their decade-old upward trend of support for gay marriage in fall 2007, according to a mammoth annual survey of more than 270,000 freshmen at 356 colleges and universities and just released by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n One year earlier, in fall 2006, 61.2 percent of college freshmen supported \"legal marital status\" for gay and lesbian couples. By fall 2007 that percentage had risen by 2.3 percentage points to 63.5 percent.\n \n When the question was first asked in 1997, just 50.9 percent of freshmen supported \"legal marital status\" for gays.\n \n \n Women were far more supportive than men, which is perhaps not surprising as women are allegedly more relationship-oriented.\n \n Meanwhile, Republicans are apparently downplaying the issue nationally:\n \n A Momentous Shrug at Civil Unions\n \n \nI fully expected that the GOP candidates would leverage New Hampshire's newly enacted civil union law to remind voters that only they will protect the traditional family. I'm sure there were comments made at rallies and in restaurants that I didn't hear and that reporters chose to ignore. But short of Mike Huckabee's statement in the ABC/WMUR/Facebook debate that he and Obama likely held different positions on same-sex marriage, fulminations against lesbian and gay couples simply failed to materialize.\n\n \n Even the local GOP has not yet tried to overturn the law. Perhaps the old fossils and Culture Warriors of the GOP are beginning to realise that whaling on gays courts the knuckle-scraping yahoo vote, but loses the middle and the young.\n \n Equal marriage by whatever name is eventually going to come to the US, as more and more states enact civil union or even marriage legislation. The only question is how painful do Christianists intend to make the process? If they were real Christians, and devoted to civil rights and liberties, they'd gracefully give in.",
