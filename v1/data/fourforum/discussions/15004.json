   "GOP cuts deep as right revolts - David Rogers - POLITICO.com\n \n \nFaced with a revolt on the right, House Republicans scrambled Wednesday to adjust their budget strategy and come up with tens of billions of dollars in additional savings - including a possible across-the-board cut - to appease tea party supporters.\n \n The day began with the once-proud House Appropriations Committee previewing what it saw as an unprecedented package of more than $40 billion in reductions from current domestic and foreign aid funding. But even as the numbers were released, conservatives at a morning caucus demanded twice the reductions. And by late in the day, the committee's cardinals were closeted away in the Capitol, fending off talk of across-the-board cuts but also admitting they will most likely need days more to come up with an alternative.\n\n \n \nThis time pressure is one reason both conservatives and some moderates have been attracted by the idea of an across-the-board reduction. But Appropriations Committee leaders are strongly opposed to this course and argue now that its defense savings should be added to the picture, thereby getting closer to the magic $100 billion target.\n \n The rub here is that while the Pentagon budget would, in fact, be cut from Obama's request, it and other security-related spending would go up by a net of $8 billion compared with 2010. And that math puts the committee back in a pickle, making the new reduction even smaller: $40 billion minus $8 billion equals $32 billion.\n\n \n \n These guys, the deficit hawks, cant come up with $100 billion in cuts, which is a pathetic 1.75% of the federal budget. We NEED AT LEAST $600 billion in cuts AND tax increases if we want to balance the budget and do something about the national debt, and these guys think that their pathetic $100 billion, that they cant even reach, is actually doing something.",

The 2 party system in this country is in no small part the CAUSE of our troubles. IF you look at the US prior to the institutionalization of the 2 party system, congress had a hell of a time getting anything passed. They pretty much had to get a majority of their fellow congressmen to agree that something was a good idea without the benefit of being able to expect a large block of votes just because the party said so and people know they cannot buck the party and still be re-elected. \n \n I think it is safe to say that without the 2 party system, most of the expensive spending programs that are bankrupting us today would not exist. \n \n That said, now we have a situation where those programs DO exist, and we need decisive action, and NOW we are deciding to buck the 2 party system, which is going to make that action difficult. \n \n That said, if the tea baggers can actually force the republicans to keep their campaign promises when it comes to spending cuts, more power to them. \n \n One thing I do disagree with is their cutting of infrastructure improvement. I am no Obama fan, but I do agree with him 100% when he says \"We cannot build the economy of tomorrow using yesterdays infrastructure\". We need high speed rail. We need an improved electrical grid. We need increased broadband rollout....though his plan to basically sell more bandwidth to ATT and Verizon as a way to accomplish this is completely retarded. We are falling so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to infrastructure that it is pathetic. Expecting the US to compete in the digital age using the best of 1950s tech is ridiculous.",

Sad. \n \n \nThis is where I think the Biggest problem will be.

It will only cause more delays in the end, I just wish they could all work together for a change and come to some agreement on something solid. \n\n \n Unfortunately the old RINOS cant really do anything about it as long as those tea baggers just set their feet like an old mule and refuse to move. There are enough of them that they can really force the older guys hands. That is the good thing about showing up en masse. \n \n Frankly I think a lot of the old time \"business as usual\" guys are looking at this the wrong way. There are a lot of pundits out there, and a lot of sitting congressmen, who keep saying that the tea baggers will have to come around and give in on the spending issue or they will not get anything passed. \n \n Frankly, they are misidentifying where the power is there. The tea baggers dont have a deadline and frankly a lot of them really dislike the federal government. I have no trouble believing that some of those guys would LOVE to see a federal shutdown. It also seems like to the majority of them (and their supporters) bucking the political establishment is a primary goal. shutting down the federal government because the political establishment is not willing to follow the will of the people and make substantial budget cuts is, frankly speaking, campaign gold for these guys. \n \n I have been thinking about this both in terms of the current budget vote joke and the upcoming debt ceiling extension vote. I am still not sure they have it in them to just vote for the debt ceiling increase, and I am not sure they have it in them to accept any of the pathetic budget cuts we have seen thus far. What is more, I am not sure that they will have problems come election time if they take a serious stand on both issues. I also think that if the democrats cross to help the republicans pass these issues in defiance of the tea baggers, there will be hell to pay next time they have to stand for election. I have been looking at a lot of polls, and in virtually all of them a huge majority of democrats place deficit/debt reduction as their top concern. \n \n IMO the most likely outcome will be that the tea baggers will force the republicans to keep their $100 billion reduction campaign promise. The democrats will essentially be forced to allow it to pass. I think the tea baggers will get additional substantial concessions in return for not blocking the debt ceiling increase though what those concessions will be I have no idea yet. \n \n Of course I also believe that they will essentially spend all their time sparring over discretionary spending while failing to actually make any changes or cuts to the big 3 line items that we MUST cut in order to bring our house into order (military, SS, medicare). So, the whole thing will essentially be a big political circle jerk, and we are still going to be screwed in the end.",

Having that check delayed, or not show up at all, is not going to cause them any real discomfort. \n \n Essentially what you have been arguing is that the new guys will have to fall in line so we can continue business as usual. The whole point of the tea baggers being there is to END business as usual. The American people want to see the end of business as usual. \n \n \n\n And as far as the Tea Baggers setting in like an old Mule.. they might do it for a little, but just like last week on the vote to extend the Patriot Act.. 23 GOP congressman stepped across party lines and voted with the Democrats. Like it or Not the GOP is still in charge of the Conservative side, and the Younguns will be forced to fall in line and do what they're told. \n\n \n But that has not been what is happening. The republicans recent budget meetings are a good example:\n \n After hard week, GOP has 'group hug' - Jake Sherman - POLITICO.com\n \n \nHouse Republicans emerged from an emergency meeting about the budget Thursday night sounding unified around a newfangled stop-gap spending measure that would achieve cuts of $100 billion.\n \n Freshmen, once again, were the driving force that sent the GOP leadership to head back to the drawing board for deeper slashes to spending just a month into their majority.\n\n \n If you look deeper into that, they actually had a bunch of freshmen in the meetings. Freshmen are typically not even invited to budgetary meetings. \n \n \n \nRight now we have the Democrats wanting one thing.. the Rhino's wanting another, and the Teabaggers wanting something completely different. They can't agree, like you said to even find Cuts to reach 100 billion. 100 B isn't going to do much good so if that's all they are aiming for they will miss the target by a mile.. \n\n \n I disagree with this to some degree. Right now they all seem to want one thing, which is budget cuts and deficit reduction. The disagreement comes in where to make those cuts and how steep they can be. You have the republicans wanting to cut everything but the military, the democrats wanting to cut the military while leaving most of their social programs intact, and you have the tea baggers who pretty much just want to cut everything. \n \n There is a fourth seat at the table, and that is the American people and what THEY want. Granted that has not really been a priority for congress in recent years, but one thing that the tea party HAS done is shown the current crop of congressmen that they probably need to make it a priority, because the American people are actually mad enough now to kick them out and replace them. \n \n Frankly, I would just as soon see them NOT pass a budget and have to fund everything for the next several years with emergency appropriations. Make every program a line item and they can fight it out over every single one of them. \n \n I dont really CARE if the federal government shuts down. Google provides me with more services than the federal government does. They could shut down primary government operations tomorrow and I would probably not even notice. I think most americans are the same. You know what the personal benefit of foreign aid to israel is to me? Not a damn thing. Most of the federal governments operations do not impact me at all, and the ones that do mostly load on massive compliance costs. \n \n The people who are going to be most impacted by a federal government shutdown are the ones pulling federal benefits...the poor and the seniors. The poor are pretty powerless, BUT, I think that we can probably come up with a solution that keeps food stamps funded. 99 weeks of unemployment has to go. As far as the seniors are concerned, SS reform is a must and frankly enough of the rest of the country has come to that realization that we can outvote the seniors. \n \n Long term is different of course. The federal government does have a number of programs (interstate highways, etc..) that actually DO impact most Americans, but a short term shutdown...6 months or less...is just going to leave most Americans wondering exactly what all those federal workers actually DO with their time. \n \n Politicians do not make tough decisions unless they have no choice. Bad news for them.....we have finally reached the point where they have no choice. The tea baggers are pushing the issue and the people are pushing the issue. Our bond investors are pushing the issue. \n \n Personally I doubt there is any possibility that we will make it through this without several government shutdowns. The process is going to be long and it is going to be painful. There are going to be impasses. \n \n This is not so terribly different from a corporate restructuring, something I am intimately acquainted with. When you first start there are always several different factions with different ideas about what the end result should look like. A production shutdown or furlough is seen as the nuclear option. It takes about 3 really heated argument before a shutdown or furlough goes from being a nuclear option to being just a really effective negotiating tool. This is also similar to a corporate restructuring because you sit down to hash things out and you pretty much always start with a bunch of old, rich white guys sitting around glaring at each others, pointing fingers, and insisting that nothing under their control can possibly be cut. \n \n This is not as unreasonable position as it may seem since essentially efficiency cuts in their chain of command is seen (usually only by that individual) as an indicator that they were not doing a good job. Now, that is not actually what it means, what it means is that \"none of us are as good as all of us\" (a phrase I use incessantly in those situations). Eventually SOMEBODY will get the ball rolling with a suggestion of a cut that can be made in their own department (I usually track somebody down who seems friendly and we set this up ahead of time...that is what they pay me the big bucks for). \n \n That kind of gets the ball rolling. You get some more tentative suggestions on the table...usually penny ante stuff that comes nowhere close to solving the problem. \n \n Then you say something like \"Lets look at some of these departmental interactions because a lot of times somebody who is on the outside, but still working closely with, a department can see inefficiencies that are clouded by the close proximity of people actually in the department. Now, Frank, you are in charge of purchasing, and Bill, production is your baby. We are going to do this both ways, but I want to start with Bill because B comes before F in the alphabet. Bill, can you think of anything you have observed or that your people have told you in dealing with Franks people that would suggest that some efficiency gains can be made?\"\n \n You continue in that vein until you have gone through the entire company. Once you get people to realize that every penny in savings or efficiency gains is NOT a marker of personal failure, it almost becomes like a game. I have literally seen the executive board of a fortune 500 company cheer and slap each other on the back because we had just figured out that going from JIT to bulk OHS on some parts would save them money. \n \n What we are seeing now is akin to those first tentative steps. Everybody is afraid to see their own pet programs cut into because they see it as an admission that those programs are poorly run and inefficient. The tea baggers are kind of the guys putting forth those first tentative suggestions that get the ball rolling. \n \n Unlike a corporate setting where you can drag all the executives into a room, lock the door, and say \"we are not leaving until this company is profitable....and I have only arranged food deliveries for 2 days so we had better quit screwing around and get it done\", there is going to be some lag time in dealing with congress because they essentially have to wait for constituent feedback before they realize that every penny cut is not a mark of personal failure.",

Postal service will cease, unemployment will double, homelessness and hunger will rise, businesses will be forced to shut down, Our Military will suffer greatly, Chaos will ensue, and eventually the U.S. as we know it will collapse in a heap to be swept up by neighboring countries collecting on the debt we cannot pay them. \n \n Yeah, this sounds a bit over the top but it's not far from what will really happen with a prolonged Government shut down.. and Google won't be able to save us.\n \n \n \n\n The people who are going to be most impacted by a federal government shutdown are the ones pulling federal benefits...the poor and the seniors.

The States for the most part would not be able to sustain any kind of program, and many state Government would shut down as well..\n \n And Outvoting The Seniors?.. you're kidding right?..\n \n There may be a smaller number of seniors voting, but if the teabagger force this shut down they will not have to worry about the seniors. You say the Poor are Powerless, I say they have more power than you give them credit for. One thing we all have is a VOTE.. and the one thing About poor people that is true is that they by far out number the middle class and upper class. Imagine a Tea Party congressman running in 2012 just after he voted to shut down the very life blood of every poor American in this country. \n \n Long story short.. If they force a shut down they can pretty much kiss their careers goodbye. The Liberals will most definitely point fingers come 2012 and when the People flip the Government back to the Liberal side we're all going to regret it.

Every president and every congress for the last 50 years has been getting ready to make carefully considered spending cuts to bring federal spending under control. How has that worked out for us so far? So far we have 50 years of thinking, no acting, and the hole has just kept getting deeper. \n \n \n\n If Obama was half the President he was made out to be he would come up with a budget plan that incorporates all of the suggestions without actually taking the U.S. back 100 years.

Steeeve is right, if we want to actually get our fiscal house and keep the US from becoming a failed state, we need $600 billion in spending cuts THIS YEAR.

They can essentially keep the government going on a piecemeal appropriations basis forever. That is the way our government has been running for the last year (they never did pass a budget for this fiscal year, which is why they are having current year budget discussions in January. Now we need to go one step further and start making them approve programs on a per item basis as opposed to allowing omnibus spending bills. \n \n \n \nAnd Outvoting The Seniors?.. you're kidding right?..\n \n There may be a smaller number of seniors voting, but if the teabagger force this shut down they will not have to worry about the seniors. You say the Poor are Powerless, I say they have more power than you give them credit for. One thing we all have is a VOTE.. and the one thing About poor people that is true is that they by far out number the middle class and upper class. Imagine a Tea Party congressman running in 2012 just after he voted to shut down the very life blood of every poor American in this country. \n\n \n Poor people do not outnumber the middle and upper class in this country. Not even CLOSE. 12% of americans receive food assistance (food stamps). That 12% is not going to be the base for a political upheaval. \n \n The tea party is already EXTREMELY unpopular among the poor (the poor vote democrat). I dont think any of those tea party guys care AT ALL what the poor will think the next time they run. The poor were not going to vote for them anyway. \n \n \nLong story short.. If they force a shut down they can pretty much kiss their careers goodbye. The Liberals will most definitely point fingers come 2012 and when the People flip the Government back to the Liberal side we're all going to regret it. I guess what I'm saying in the end is that it doesn't really matter what they do now. Your thread title pretty much sums it up....\n\n \n The numbers simply do not support this position. You can not get 71% of americans to agree on what color the sky is, and yet they can agree that we need to make major cuts to our government spending. Those who stand in the way of making those cuts are FAR, FAR more likely to be the ones with fingers pointing at them come 2012. With as much popular support as cutting spending has, the guy who can stand up and say \"we could not come up with a budget because the other side was not willing to cut spending\" is golden.",

You take a bunch of people, tell them they have an unlimited amount of money to spend, but you would appreciate it if they did not go too crazy, and you are going to be disappointed every time. Fail to pass the debt limit increase and suddenly they HAVE TO be responsible. \n \n \n \nNevertheless, the truth is if they aren't willing to make the hard choice to make the cuts they certainly aren't going to make the hard choice and not raise the debt ceiling so the argument is a mere brain exercise. \n\n \n Yes and no. Failing to raise the debt limit is a lot easier choice when over 70% of Americans are standing behind you. Then you can just blame all the heartache that comes after on the other party. \n \n There is another dynamic at work here as well. I am speaking of rank stoopidity. Most of the tea partiers, and most of the republicans, are mind numbingly dumb. They keep saying that by lowering federal spending jobs will be created...even without tax reductions. That is ridiculous....but many of them believe it. They see the government as the enemy of free enterprise, therefore to them, cutting the government = increased free enterprise and prosperity. How jobs are created by cutting NPR and cutting the department of education has yet to be explained, but they DO honestly believe it. \n \n \nAs for our economy growing, perhaps we should be worried about that.

I just worry that what little economic hope we have is misplaced in the mistakes of the past.\n\n \n It is all that is left. You are seeing the destruction of a nation. Our entire economy is just another bubble waiting to burst. There is nothing solid underpinning it. This is the problem with a \"service\" economy and why they inevitably fail. Without something of real value (production of tangible goods) underlying your economy, we may as well declare monopoly money to be legal currency. Half of us can sit around building hotels on boardwalk. The other half can just keep doing whatever they have been doing and nothing would change except we could all get smaller wallets.",

The history buff and wonderer of distant future in me is curious, how do you see economics changing over the next centuries? I mean, we are a long way from hunter/gatherer and barter (or are we???). What next?\n\n \n Jitobear! I am glad you are still around!!!\n \n I will tell you a secret. A lot of the complexity when it comes to economics is invented and a lot of the \"debate\" is either foolish or dishonest. At the same time you see a lot of people in power (of late it is mostly the treasury secretary and the head of the federal reserve) going out of their way to make things more complex than they are so the rest of us will shut up, sit down, and let them make the decisions for us. \n \n The economy is like any other complex system. Break it down into its constituent parts and anybody can understand it. Once they understand how some of the parts work, it makes it easier to understand how the entire system works. \n \n As far as the \"what comes next\" question, that is interesting enough that I almost started a new thread for it. To some degree I am a techno cornucopia. I have an incredible amount of respect and admiration for human ingenuity and discovery. We are capable of creating a world where technical innovation breaks down pretty much every barrier to prosperity that has ever existed. There is no reason for anybody on this planet to go to bed hungry or to be homeless. The technology driven productivity gains we have ALREADY made in the last century could have created a world that is a virtual utopia. Instead it concentrated even more wealth, a virtually unimaginable amount of wealth, into the hands of a relatively few people. \n \n That is why I am not a capitalist. Capitalism has failed. In capitalist theory, those productivity gains and that innovation should have led to a period of incredible prosperity for consumers. They should have led to ever decreasing prices as producers found new and better ways to create goods and provide services with the savings being passed on to the consumer as producers compete for our business. Instead they have just led to increased corporate profits while prices continue to increase for consumers. The promise of capitalism has turned out to be false. \n \n That said, I am now going to disappoint my detractors here and say I am also not a socialist. Socialism has also failed miserably. \n \n In the long term there are a lot of possibilities, human greed will be the deciding factor.\n \n In the short term, we are completely and utterly screwed. We have a major energy problem and the world economy is pretty much based on several completely unrealistic ideals.",

Then you can just blame all the heartache that comes after on the other party. \n\n \n I question those numbers to a certain extent. The poll that showed 71% of Americans in Favor of not raising the Debt limit was based on a poll of just over 1000 people, and those were not really aware of the consequences of not raising the debt limit. If people really knew how they would be affected those Polls would undoubtedly change .\n \n It's kind of pointless to worry about it anyway In My opinion. In the end the Government will either Raise the Debt Ceiling like they ALWAYS have, or they will cast a quick vote for a temporary budget to keep the Government borrowing Money until they can agree on something. Obama is releasing his Budget proposal today so the Real Fight is about to begin. Until all of them agree to Extended Cuts in not only Entitlement programs and Defense nothing will be accomplished. I think the Repubs cuts are now up to around 65 billion, far short of what they Promised and farther short of what is needed, so We're not going anywhere for a while. I imagine they will still be debating this when we elect a new President in 2012.. They need something like this to make more False Promises for the future.",
