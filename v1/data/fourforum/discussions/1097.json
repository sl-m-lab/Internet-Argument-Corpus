This does not mean horror movie, I find them to be just silly and void of anything other than fake blood and bad acting, I mean real movies about real events. By the way, has anyone seen On the Beech? And if yes, what did you think about it?",

I think the movie was meant to discourage war and therefore sounds like it exaggerates how bad nuclear war is. To have everyone dead from a nuclear war is pretty hard to believe although I guess it is theoretically possible.\n \n My favorite nuclear war movies are Sum of All Fears and Deterrence (US vs Iraq).\n \n This thread sparked my memory. I can't believe I found this website back but I think you will really enjoy this little movie review of a movie titled Threads. I've never seen the movie but simply reading the summary of the movie makes for a great read!\n \n http://www.ibp-intl.demon.co.uk/nuke/threads.html",
