   "The Democratic Party has decided to wait until after the elections to vote upon the tax cuts.\n \n I fully support Obama's position that we cannot afford to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers. I'd prefer that the discounted tax rates for long term capital gains incomes be eliminated and replaced with more populist tax cuts.\n \n I have voted in every general election and have missed very few primary elections since I became a registered voter after leaving the military service in 1959. I will wait until the tax bill is brought to the floors of both U.S. Congressional houses and is brought to a floor vote in the House of Representatives before I vote in a general election. \n \n This is my 74th year. Finally in 2008 I stopped voting for the least evil and determined that I require a candidate at minimum substantially concur with my opinion upon at least one issue and methods to achieve our perceived goal. I won't absolutely always vote for a candidate that simply only meets my minimum standard. \n \n Obama's speaks well on the issues but lacks explicit explanation of how he prefers the laws should be drafted to achieve specific goals. His campaign office has written, (but I've never actually found a direct quote from Obama), that he was a proponent of the federal minimum wage tied to a cost of living adjustment, (i.e. COLA). Based upon that minimal but substantial agreement I voted for Obama. I fear that true to his normal behavior, Obama and the Democrats will acquiesce to Republicans. If the minimum is increased, The Democrats will not press for it being thereafter COLA'd. \n \n A COLA'd minimum wage rate will not substantially improve USA's economy but it is certainly an improvement of a non-COLA'd minimum wage. Any significant federal minimum wage is preferable to an ineffective minimum wage. I suppose it is feasible for a minimum wage rate to be excessive and detrimental to an economy. The greater harm occurs within jurisdictions adjoining others having inadequate wage scales and goods and persons have unrestricted passage over their borders. I have never encountered a historical reference to a nation's economy being harmed by an excessively great minimum wage. I don't believe there's ever been an excessive minimum wage within any nation.\n \n Obama is the titular head of the Democratic Party. Obama and our nation was lucky he achieved anything. It was due to chance rather than political competence that gave our nation comparatively less superior health insurance legislation. I am not angry because of what he and his party failed to achieve. I'm furious of what positions he surrendered without fully negotiating for anything better. Politics is not a dirty word and negotiation is respectable. Acquiescence and submission are despicable words and are generally cowardly and despicable acts.\n \n It is my patriotic duty not to vote for a party that leads in the wrong direction or a second party that lacks leadership and has no definite direction. The Republicans will lead us until we recognize that it's the wrong direction. Having no direction, there's no hope of that Democrats will correct our nation's course.\n \n I will not vote for any Democrats until Obama and his party finds and retain some courage. Thus far it appears that I will not vote for Obama in 2012.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

Of course, it's your own choice if you stay home, and I would agree that there isn't any national benefit to some individuals' votes - Easyrider and his pals, for example - but still, I would defend his right to vote (assuming he's over eighteen) just as I would any American's. And even though I realize that his right wing ilk would not do the same for people like myself who have a a radically different view of the world than theirs. After all, they have a infamous history of derailing voting rights. Usually for poorer people or minorities, under a variety of devious guises, and because they have been able to get away with it, and because they lack scruples, and because they don't anticipate an outcome favorable to their side, if people with interests and opinions different than their own, get a say in government.\n \n Our election system is very discouraging right now for more liberal and progressive interests because big money controls the winning candidates. Campaign finance reform, which is sorely needed, seems to also be a losing cause, and for the same reasons. A lot of those people are giving up, or supporting election boycotts, since it all seems like such a farce. It's virtually impossible for a decent candidate to \"get there,\" without being corrupted and tarnished on the journey up the ladder.\n \n I feel very discouraged with our political process, too, but I still think people should vote. If they want to protest, do it in the form of a ballot. Write someone in (at the very least to protect your ballot from fraudulent use, which could be the case if it's blank). But let them know what you think. If you stay home, no one knows, really, what's going on. It just looks like voter apathy, and your opinion could be anywhere. Don't you want to be heard?\n \n I'll add, here, that I think they should extend voting rights to sixteen year olds, and allow imprisoned citizens to vote. Sixteen year olds are no less informed than many adult Americans - and many are more informed - and I don't see any reason to deny voting rights to the incarcerated. If anything, voting is rehabilitative. I suspect most people who wind up in prison never voted, to begin with, and that is part of the problem.\n \n I also think they should legalize the 12-20 million people living in the shadows, so that they, too, can vote. It is not healthy for a society or a democracy to have these huge underclasses denied the fundamental democratic right to participate in a government Of the People, For the People, and By the People.\n \n If we do this, we're no longer living in a democracy.",

Mostly because they support run-off elections, which I'm fine with, but which they don't think is a viable position (in the U.S.A.) without supporting computerized voting. So they have this lame, IMO, argument, that computerized voting is viable.\n \n It isn't. Anyone who understands the basic nature of software knows it's not. Anywho who is honest with themselve about companies like Diebold and why George Bush passed the bogus H.A.V.A.\n \n Still, some of their individual candidates are much better, and on a number of other issues pressing the nation.
