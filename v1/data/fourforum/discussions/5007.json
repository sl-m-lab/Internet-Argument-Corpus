   "40 Christians Arrested in Saudi Arabia for Religious Activity By Saudi Religious Police: 'For Trying to Spread the Poison and their Beliefs' \n \n On April 23, 2005, Saudi newspapers reported that 40 Pakistanis were arrested by the Saudi religious police in a Riyadh apartment for conducting Christian religious activity. The following are excerpts from the reports: \n \n \n The Saudi daily Al-Jazirah reported that 40 men, women, and children with Pakistani citizenship were arrested on April 21, 2005 after performing Christian religious rites in an apartment in the Thaharat Al-Badi'a neighborhood in western Riyadh. The arrest was part of a sweeping police operation by the Riyadh District Police, at the order of Riyadh Governor Prince Salman bin Abd Al-'Aziz. \n \n The paper reported that the operation came after Saudi religious police - known as the Authority for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice [1] - followed and collected information on the activity of the 40, who listened to a proselytizing lecture by a Pakistani minister. \n \n The paper also noted that during the police operation, which lasted nearly 10 hours, a cross and a large number of proselytizing books and cassettes were found [in the apartment]. The detainees themselves stated that they had come to listen to lectures by the minister. One of the detainees was a Muslim Pakistani, who acknowledged that he had been influenced by the Christian ideology. [2] \n \n \n http://www.memri.org/bin/opener_latest.cgi?ID=SD90105\n \n \n And to think, if not for US support all these years, these wankers would not be running things right now. \n \n Some here are probably drooling at this article and thinking \"Man, if we could just do something like that with muslims in the US........",

   "interesting\n \n \n are you expecting that all nations we support should conform to our cultural/moral expectations? this is a new concept you know. international politics has always been about making alliances against your enemies, ala \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\". Ask our French rescuer during the revolutionary war. \n now should we start inserting morality into our foreign policy? \n \n \n and yet, we tolerate much worse in our own society if you ask me. we tolerate fetal murders for instance because its the law. and when those who firmly believe these things are wrong, respect of the law should matter more. what were the laws of saudi arabia regarding these other religions?\n other countries may also view us with distaste for things like capital punishment. should they no longer support and continue to build ties with us? work with us? not to start an abortion/capital punishment hijacking but in many ways these are worse than being arrested for your religious belief; being killed for your religious belief is another matter.\n \n \n so should we have a morally driven international agenda, even if it make the US seem to be a high and mighty moral crusader trying to impose our way on the world, perhaps even a sort of \"you are with us or against us\"?\n or befriend only those who are similar to us? \n a League of Liberal Democracies?\n a League of Western Democracies?\n what criteria should we then use?",

It isn't as though a liberal democratic Arabian society is just waiting to spring into existance as soon as the President waves his magic wand and says it can be so.\n \n Look at Africa. Almost every one of the countries there got its independence and promptly slid into dictatorship. They did this because they had no experience of democracy and the West was told to butt out.\n \n Some did better than others, but for most of the post-colonial world, democracy meant \"one man, one vote, one time.\" And if you made a stink about it, you were tagged a \"neocolonialist\" trying to intervene in a sovereign nation's affairs.\n \n That is why of all the critiques of American foreign policy, this is the weakest.\n \n No, we haven't remade the international state system as Eden Reborn - and we never said we would. In fact, we couldn't if we tried.\n \n As much as people want to blame us for dictatorship, the fact remains that oppression is more common in human existance than liberty.\n \n That didn't start with the creation of the US.\n \n What did start is a reversal of the trend.\n \n Iraq and Afghanistan are doing better. Lebanon has been freed of occupation without a shot being fired.\n \n Pretty good progress so far.\n \n Saudi Arabia is another domino that needs to fall, but it may take a while.\n \n At least now the movement is in the right direction.\n \n I'd like the pace to be faster, but we only have so many resources. If Europeans want to spread liberty, they've got the industrial base and military know-how to help out.

   "There are two problems with this line of argument.\n\n \n That's funny. Considering how problematic your refuation is, as well as how you didn't read carefully what Daewoo said. \n \n \n\n In the first case, the Constitution never applied to any other country. How could it? When it was written, monarchy and despotism were the almost universal form of government.\n\n \n He never said it did. He said that consitutional principal did not apply to foreign policy. Meaning, that the consitution was ignored in our decisions in our polices overseas. \n \n \n\n So in order to even have foreign affairs, the US had to deal with countries that had far more oppressive governments.\n\n \n That doesn't mean we abandon the very foundation of our country. \n \n \n\n Secondly, the US cannot remake the world at whim. To say \"we climbed into bed\" ignores reality.\n\n \n hardly. We could have spent the time to develop countries in Latin America or Africa instead of hopping into bed with Saudi Arabia and then refusing to leave when it obviously became detreimental to the US. \n \n \n\n The world is what it is. You can either work with it or live in denial.\n\n \n The world can be changed. Slowly yes, but changed nevertheless. \n \n \n\n I don't care much for the House of Saud, but I'm pragmatic enough to know that there aren't a large number of alternatives. It isn't as though a liberal democratic Arabian society is just waiting to spring into existance as soon as the President waves his magic wand and says it can be so.\n\n \n Yes there are. Russia for one, parts of latin america, Indonesia, parts of Africa. \n \n \n\n Look at Africa. Almost every one of the countries there got its independence and promptly slid into dictatorship. They did this because they had no experience of democracy and the West was told to butt out.\n\n \n Um, no. When the west gave Africa its independence, they left rapidly without any concern for the country they were ditching. Do you expect democracy to arise from chaos? \n \n \n\n That didn't start with the creation of the US.\n \n What did start is a reversal of the trend.\n\n \n what? You do know that the US installed a number of dictators in the ME as well as in Latin America, often as the expense of the democraticlaly elected goverment right? \n \n \n\n Iraq and Afghanistan are doing better. Lebanon has been freed of occupation without a shot being fired.\n\n \n Lebanon was out of our control. \n \n \nI'd like the pace to be faster, but we only have so many resources. If Europeans want to spread liberty, they've got the industrial base and military know-how to help out. If France and Germany care to send a couple hundred thousand troops, we can probably take care of that Saudi problem in a year or two.\n\n \n That is a bad idea. First of all, Europe is not geared towards invasion. Europe's miltiary is primarily a peacekeeping organization. Their number of MBTs are low. Their troops are trained primarily to keep the peace. There hasn't been a development of a real combat aircraft in years, the Eurofighter is a joke. Even the Tiger helio isn't a comparable attack platform like the Apache. Not to mention Saudi arabia actually has a military. Big problem.",

It isn't as though a liberal democratic Arabian society is just waiting to spring into existance as soon as the President waves his magic wand and says it can be so.\n\n \n And yet you ignore the fact that Syria, Iran, and Turkey have all agreed to clean up their acts when it comes to human rights in order to do business witht he EU. The EU has been very good about saying \"if you want to play ball with us, you have to meet these minimum standards\". Nationa have been willing to do that. Saudi Arabia has felt no need, since we are apparently willing to provide them with everything from cruise missile to cash without requiring anything in return.\n \n \nWhat did start is a reversal of the trend.\n\n \n This HAS to be a joke. The US has installed and supproted far more tyrants than it has removed.\n \n \nIraq and Afghanistan are doing better. Lebanon has been freed of occupation without a shot being fired.\n\n \n We had nothign to do with the changes in Lebanon. That was 100% internal. We ar just trying to step innow and take the credit. Afghanistan does nto seem to be doing much better, since the governmetn we installe dthere only controls about 10% of the country, and they are tossing people in prison without trial and confiscating property wihout any type of due process. Now they have taken to assinging the warlords the title of \"governer\" in an attempt to legitimize their government. Pathetic.\n \n \nI'd like the pace to be faster, but we only have so many resources. If Europeans want to spread liberty, they've got the industrial base and military know-how to help out. If France and Germany care to send a couple hundred thousand troops, we can probably take care of that Saudi problem in a year or two.\n\n \n \n But why would they? In the last 2 years, they have gained MAJOR concessions from Syria, Iran, Turkey, and even Libya, becuase they want in on EU trade. The Europeans have not fired a shot, and have improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Prior to that, the egyptians and Jordanians made reforms in order to be able to meet unofficial requiremetns for european trade. Again, hundreds of millions of lives improved without a shot fired. Even mexico during the early 20th century was willing to make some changes for increased cross border traffic. \n \n The US currently, lacking any kind of trade restraint in such things, has resorted to use of our military to force changes. Besides being incredibly expensive, it has never worked int he past (vietnam, korea, even cuba). Our other strategy seems to be to give the dictators, totalitarians, and lunatics, billions of dollars and then occasionally ask that they not murder people for saying \"this government sucks\". So far, out of all the billions we have sent to Saudi Arabia, we have not even gotten that far. \n \n I am not even talking turning the whole world into a democracy. In fact, I think it is awfully arrogant for us to assume that our system of governemtn is necessarily the best. Part of self determination is giving people the power to decide what kind of governemtn they want, and the tools to put it in place. Those tools are not necessarily bazookas and rifles. Free speach is a good start, though, and countries ARE willing to tolerate free speech in return for trade, if the alternative is no trade. They are not willing to tolerate free speech in exchange for trade if you are giving them billions of dollars, and arming them to the teeth with the latest US military equipment anyway.",

Are you saying we should embrace Saudi civil war?

It's human nature.\n \n Democracy has to be learned. We in the West can take it for granted since we grew up with it. But everywhere else, it is a novelty, a foreign concept and something that takes a great deal of education to get right. Even Europe still has problem with it. In theory, the Europeans should have had this democracy thing down, but in the 1930s, they ****** it away.\n \n What you are saying is that countries with far less historical, territorial and ethnic integrity ought to be better at open, clean elections and human rights than places like Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Portugal etc.\n \n Sorry, that's not very realistic.\n \n \nAnd yet you ignore the fact that Syria, Iran, and Turkey have all agreed to clean up their acts when it comes to human rights in order to do business witht he EU. \n\n \n Now it's my turn to call \"Bull.\"\n \n So when Iran publicly hanged a 16-year-old girl last year  for \"acts against chastity\", how was that also a \"cleansing\" act?\n \n \n The EU has been very good about saying \"if you want to play ball with us, you have to meet these minimum standards\". \n\n \n Nice to know slaughtering little girls is within the bounds of acceptable behavior.\n \n \nNationa have been willing to do that. Saudi Arabia has felt no need, since we are apparently willing to provide them with everything from cruise missile to cash without requiring anything in return.\n\n \n Obviously you missed Saudia Arabia's first-ever municipal elections.\n \n They aren't perfect, but they are a start.\n \n A couple of other points for you to chew on:\n \n Bashar Assad owes his rulership to his dad. Outside of pulling out of Lebanon - which had more to do with 200,000 Coalition troops on his eastern border than diplomacy - what else has Bashar done to improve his act?\n \n And you of course are aware the the Turks were hardly model citizens in the past. It was a gradual process, one aided by large amounts of American foreign aid during the Cold War.\n \n \nThis HAS to be a joke. The US has installed and supproted far more tyrants than it has removed.\n\n \n Yawn. Prove it.\n \n Once again, whenever a tyrant takes power, you assume he must be an American puppet.\n \n It's not so. People are pretty wicked and they like power. Without the rare creature called democracy, coups are pretty much the norm.\n \n If you want to keep a tally, the clear winner would be the Soviets, who made a major industry out of supporting coups and rebellions around the world.\n \n They dominated eastern Europe, much of Africa and of course huge swathes of the Far East.\n \n Now I understand that when a communist dictator takes control, that's \"the will of the people\" and okay. I mean Pol Pot was just misunderstood, but Augusto Pinochet was pure evil.\n \n Still, the double standard gets old and it's no way to debate the facts.\n \n \nWe had nothign to do with the changes in Lebanon. That was 100% internal. \n\n \n Good to know you know better than the Lebanese people. They think Iraq had a huge amount to do with it.\n \n So do the Syrians. Obviously they're wrong because you say so. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n We ar just trying to step innow and take the credit. Afghanistan does nto seem to be doing much better, since the governmetn we installe dthere only controls about 10% of the country, and they are tossing people in prison without trial and confiscating property wihout any type of due process. Now they have taken to assinging the warlords the title of \"governer\" in an attempt to legitimize their government. Pathetic.\n\n \n This is why I can't take anything you say seriously. Should the US support despotisms or not?\n \n In Afghanistan, we took one down, but since Kabul doesn't look like Beverly Hills, it's a total failure.\n \n This is why your complaints about Saudi Arabia are completely hollow.\n \n You don't give a rip about the Saudis, it's just a club to beat up the US. \n \n Let us say that we did go in. You'd then whine about how it wasn't going perfectly, things are worse, our troops are getting killed, the democratic transition hasn't been smooth, etc.\n \n So which is it? Should we be tireless champions of democracy or not?\n \n You seem to say \"yes,\" but only if it doesn't involve any complications or heavy lifting.\n \n Which is how we end up supporting dictatorships: it's easier. \n \n \nBut why would they? In the last 2 years, they have gained MAJOR concessions from Syria, Iran, Turkey, and even Libya, becuase they want in on EU trade.

So far, out of all the billions we have sent to Saudi Arabia, we have not even gotten that far. \n\n \n Ah, so when the Europeans wave checks in front of dictators, that's different.\n \n And when the dictators kill people, it's okay because minimum standards are now in place. Like they use a metric rope to hang children and stuff. \n \n \nI am not even talking turning the whole world into a democracy. In fact, I think it is awfully arrogant for us to assume that our system of governemtn is necessarily the best. \n\n \n Whoops, you just scuttled your whole argument.

I'm pretty sure the ones in Saudi Arabia would have a huge problem with church services in Mecca.\n \n In that case, you would be using trade and embargoes to force people to do what you want.\n \n Self-determination, it seems, only goes so far. :p",

I would not advocate such a foolish thing. I personally do nto think that we should push democracy at all, not in Iraq, not in afghanistan, not anywhere. There is a difference between the right of self determination and having a democracy. A big difference. \n \n You do not have to have a democracy in order for your people to have rights. Look at Jordan. Jordan is one nation in the ME where the people are lucky enough to have a governement ehat he US has never seen any need to give any special attention to. Jordanians have rights. They have more rigths than any of the naitons in th eME that we are heavily involved in. We did not have to \"liberate\" them, nor do we teach their governemtn how to torture people and run effective death squads.\n \n \nWhat you are saying is that countries with far less historical, territorial and ethnic integrity ought to be better at open, clean elections and human rights than places like Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Portugal etc.\n\n \n Man, you are just spewing this out of your butt, aren't you? I have not even suggested there should be elections in most of these places. Merely that the Us should refuse to do business with them unless they recognise certain basic human rights.\n \n \n \nSo when Iran publicly hanged a 16-year-old girl last year  for \"acts against chastity\", how was that also a \"cleansing\" act?\n \n Nice to know slaughtering little girls is within the bounds of acceptable behavior.\n\n \n So you start out with a little nonsensicla rant about \"moral perfection\", then when iut is pointed out that naitons have been willing to play bakll with the EU in the human rights area in return for trade, you pull this? So, the fact that a 16 yr old girl was executed somehow means that there are no hiuman rights at all int hat country, and they are unwilling to even consider the idea? In the US, we execute people all the time. Does that mean we have no rights, and will never have any?\n \n Your own article confirms that this hanging was an abberation:\n \n \nThe shock of Atefeh's execution has gone far beyond this town. Even in a country that has the highest number of executions in the world and routinely executes minors, Iranians across the nation have been bewildered by accounts of the hanging of a 16-year-old girl. The fact that the religious judge himself put the rope around her neck and the letters of \"congratulations\" from the town's governor to the judge, commending him for his \"firm approach\" have only added to the torment and pain many say they have felt.\n\n \n \n \nObviously you missed Saudia Arabia's first-ever municipal elections.\n \n They aren't perfect, but they are a start.\n \n A couple of other points for you to chew on:\n \n Bashar Assad owes his rulership to his dad. Outside of pulling out of Lebanon - which had more to do with 200,000 Coalition troops on his eastern border than diplomacy - what else has Bashar done to improve his act?\n \n And you of course are aware the the Turks were hardly model citizens in the past. It was a gradual process, one aided by large amounts of American foreign aid during the Cold War.\n\n \n Again, you berate me about moral perfection, which I never expected, then argue that since the nations I mention are not pinnacles of freedom that somehow a failure has occured. Wrong answer. Little steps. \n \n The EU has gotten humanitarian concessions formthe nations I mentioned without a shot fired. The two states in the ME that enjoy the most freedom, Egypt and Jordan, are both results of European policy. \n \n What have we accomplished in saudi arabia? After several decades, and hundreds of billions of dollars in military equipment and aid in tracking down and killoign anyboyd who opposes the ruling tyrants, we finally see local elections. Elections for a board with no power, and half the board is appointed by the house of saud. AND, they can still toss you in prison and forget about you, or even execute you, for a mis spoken word. Wow. There is some real progress. \n \n \n \nOnce again, whenever a tyrant takes power, you assume he must be an American puppet.\n\n \n It hardly seems you know me well enough to assign such a statement to me. I do not assume that veery tyrant is a US puppet, only those hwo are us puppets, like Noriega, Pinochet, Saddam Hussein, the list could fill a page.\n \n You are going to have to refresh my memory. Besides Noriega, who we installed, and Saddam, who we supported for years, including helping him stiop internal rebelion, what eveil dictators have we removed?\n \n \nIt's not so. People are pretty wicked and they like power. Without the rare creature called democracy, coups are pretty much the norm.\n \n If you want to keep a tally, the clear winner would be the Soviets, who made a major industry out of supporting coups and rebellions around the world.\n\n \n So, since ted bundy killed a lot of people, I can murdfer just one and it is OK?\n \n \nThey dominated eastern Europe, much of Africa and of course huge swathes of the Far East.\n \n Now I understand that when a communist dictator takes control, that's \"the will of the people\" and okay. I mean Pol Pot was just misunderstood, but Augusto Pinochet was [b]pure evil.\n \n Still, the double standard gets old and it's no way to debate the facts.\n\n \n There is no \"double standard\" here. Pol Pot was evil. Pinochet was equally evil. No way toi debate the facts? You have not debated a fact yet, just put forth a rather poor argument based almost entirely on your own emotional luggage. your argument essentially seems to be that is OK for the Us to supprot tyrants and lunatics, because the soviets idid it 20 years ago???\n \n In the words of my father \"I don't care what the hell little jimmy at school does, how he behaves, or what a little **** he is. I care about what YOU do and how YOU behave and by god you WILL NOT BE a little **** to me buddy.\"\n \n this is the message we need to send our government. By your logic, since stalin killed millions of his own people, it is OK if our governemtn decides to do the same.",

   "Moral perfection? Who said anything about moral perfection? All I ask is that we not actively support totalitarian regimes. \n\n \n That's exactly what you are talking about.\n \n Sometimes you don't get to choose between angels and devils. Sometimes its Dictator A or Dictator B.\n \n If you fail to decide, others will make the choice for you - and they will want the one person most harmful to your interests.\n \n \nAnd yet for almost 10 years we refused trade with mexico because of their policies re: imprisoning people without trial. They changed it. \n\n \n When was this?\n \n \n How much trade do you imagine we did with the russians under the czars, or the Japanese under th emporer, keeping in mind that we were a massive exporter, and until the 1940s over 90% of our overseas trade was with europe.\n\n \n Russia is part of Europe.\n \n As for Japan, it was our leading purchaser of scrap metal prior to WW II.\n \n \nLast year in saudi arabia, an estimated 4000 people were killed for being openly critical of the house of saud. Have you ever been to Saudi arabia? If you ever go, I would suggest you watch your Ps and Qs. All it takes to be tossed into prison is to rub the wrong person the wrong way. They will stick you in there, and you have effectively vanished off the planet. Tehy will nto even report to the US embassy that you are there. If and when whoever you ****** off is done being ******, you get out. No trial, no rights, no phone call. \n\n \n Yep. Prett lousy.\n \n But once again I direct you to the reason those people were arrested: They were practicing an unpopular religion.\n \n \nI am saying that if tomorrow we said \"No more military equipment unless you recognise a right to free speech for your people\", they would do it by the end of the week.\n\n \n Bull. They'd embargo the US and Europe and buy their equipment from China.\n \n \nThat is all it would take. We do not do it, though, becuase free speech is a dnagerous thing, and we cannot stand the thought that our tyrants might be remove from power. Surem, they are petty, totalitarian peckerheads, but they are OUR petty, totalitarian peckerheads. We like them. they are easy to deal with.\n\n \n Spare me your high school political theory.\n \n There ARE no democrats in Saudi Arabia - not enough to take power. The House of Saud has about 10,000 members and if you think they're going to morph into Westminster by next Thursday if we say the magic words, you are seriously deluded.\n \n \nWho suggested that the goal was worldwide democracy? Not I. I would not advocate such a foolish thing. I personally do nto think that we should push democracy at all, not in Iraq, not in afghanistan, not anywhere. There is a difference between the right of self determination and having a democracy. A big difference. \n\n \n But wait, you are demanding the right of free speech. You think the US should forcefully intervene in Saudi domestic affairs.\n \n I'm here to tell you that an arms embargo won't do jack. Iran's been embargoed in 1979. I haven't noticed them changing their tune.\n \n Castro's been embargoed even longer. Gosh, he's still shooting journalists.\n \n \nYou do not have to have a democracy in order for your people to have rights. Look at Jordan. Jordan is one nation in the ME where the people are lucky enough to have a governement ehat he US has never seen any need to give any special attention to. Jordanians have rights.\n\n \n Like the right to kill women who offend their \"honor.\"\n \n \n They have more rigths than any of the naitons in th eME that we are heavily involved in. We did not have to \"liberate\" them, nor do we teach their governemtn how to torture people and run effective death squads.\n\n \n You think people need to be taught to be cruel? What, the happy black Sambos of the world lived in a state of bliss until Uncle Sam explained how torture works? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n What an insulting, racist and ignorant remark.\n \n \nMan, you are just spewing this out of your butt, aren't you? I have not even suggested there should be elections in most of these places. Merely that the Us should refuse to do business with them unless they recognise certain basic human rights.\n\n \n Or, in other words, we should use our economic power to make them embrace our customs.\n \n As I noted before, most Muslims probably don't want Christians practicing their religion in Saudi Arabia. Are you saying they are wrong? That the US can tell Muslims that we will defile their holy places where and when we choose?\n \n Just curious.\n \n \nSo you start out with a little nonsensicla rant about \"moral perfection\", then when iut is pointed out that naitons have been willing to play bakll with the EU in the human rights area in return for trade, you pull this? So, the fact that a 16 yr old girl was executed somehow means that there are no hiuman rights at all int hat country, and they are unwilling to even consider the idea? In the US, we execute people all the time. Does that mean we have no rights, and will never have any?\n\n \n Nice bit of moral equivalence you've got there. They US executes rapists and murders - given them due process and a taking years to examine questions of guilt or innocence.\n \n This in your mind is equivalent to Iran executing a 16-year old girl for \"immoral behavior.\"\n \n Nice.\n \n \nYour own article confirms that this hanging was an abberation:\n\n \n What was an aberration was that it was reported. Iran is a police state, one which regularly uses brute force to put down dissent.\n \n You call that \"straightening out their act.\"\n \n \nAgain, you berate me about moral perfection, which I never expected, then argue that since the nations I mention are not pinnacles of freedom that somehow a failure has occured. Wrong answer. Little steps. \n\n \n So it's \"little steps\" with Iran, but giant, immediate big ones with Saudi Arabia?\n \n \nThe EU has gotten humanitarian concessions formthe nations I mentioned without a shot fired. The two states in the ME that enjoy the most freedom, Egypt and Jordan, are both results of European policy. \n\n \n Speaking of stealing credit...\n \n So the EU is the one providing billions of aid to Egypt each year? Funny, I thought the US was providing more than a billion a year.\n \n And what have we got for our money?\n \n Not much.\n \n \nWhat have we accomplished in saudi arabia? After several decades, and hundreds of billions of dollars in military equipment and aid in tracking down and killoign anyboyd who opposes the ruling tyrants, we finally see local elections. Elections for a board with no power, and half the board is appointed by the house of saud. AND, they can still toss you in prison and forget about you, or even execute you, for a mis spoken word. Wow. There is some real progress. \n\n \n What elections has Egypt held?\n \n \nIt hardly seems you know me well enough to assign such a statement to me. I do not assume that veery tyrant is a US puppet, only those hwo are us puppets, like Noriega, Pinochet, Saddam Hussein, the list could fill a page.\n\n \n Saddam Hussein was never a US puppet. Go do some research.\n \n \nYou are going to have to refresh my memory. Besides Noriega, who we installed, and Saddam, who we supported for years, including helping him stiop internal rebelion, what eveil dictators have we removed?\n\n \n Maybe you missed the fall of the Soviet Union? \n \n You're also forgetting about Slobodan Milosovic - a fellow the EU did jack to remove.\n \n But you really don't care about that, do you? I mean we took down Noreiga, forced Pinochet into retirement, removed Ferdinand Marcos, allowed both Taiwan and South Korea to develop democracy - all of that doesn't amount to **** for you because all you want to see are America's sins.\n \n Given a glass of water, you don't debate whether it is half-full or half-empty - no to you it is a CIA water torture device.\n \n Your worldview is completely skewed - partly wilfully, partly because of bad information.\n \n You want to believe that the US just wanders around bankrolling despots because its fun and profitable. It's neither.\n \n We are often given crappy choices. If you'd like to discuss the long-standing reasons why those choices came about, fine.\n \n But never, nowhere has the US been able to simply throw the \"freedom switch\" and avoid dictatorship.\n \n \nSo, since ted bundy killed a lot of people, I can murdfer just one and it is OK?\n\n \n Yes, especially if it is Ted Bundy.\n \n \nThere is no \"double standard\" here. Pol Pot was evil. Pinochet was equally evil.\n\n \n See, you're wrong. Pol Pot killed ten percent of his country before being driven out of power by force of arms.\n \n Augusto Pinochet killed several thousand people because he feared a communist dictatorship. Having secured the Chilean economy and prepared the body politic, he retired from public life, leaving a growing, stable democracy.\n \n Other than \"both killed people,\" there really isn't any comparison between the two.\n \n \n No way toi debate the facts? You have not debated a fact yet, just put forth a rather poor argument based almost entirely on your own emotional luggage. your argument essentially seems to be that is OK for the Us to supprot tyrants and lunatics, because the soviets idid it 20 years ago???\n\n \n Nope. I am pointing out that often you don't get to chose the ideal outcome.\n \n All of the dictators you keep bringing up were an effort to prevent a Soviet one from taking power.\n \n Pinochet was a bastard, but he wasn't even close to Pol Pot in terms of what he did to his country.\n \n So given the choice, we took Dictator A.\n \n For some reason, that really bothers you.\n \n \nIn the words of my father \"I don't care what the hell little jimmy at school does, how he behaves, or what a little **** he is. I care about what YOU do and how YOU behave and by god you WILL NOT BE a little **** to me buddy.\"\n \n this is the message we need to send our government. By your logic, since stalin killed millions of his own people, it is OK if our governemtn decides to do the same.\n\n \n Of course, the real world isn't a schoolyard is it? I tell my kids to do the right thing even if no one else is looking, but you can be damn sure I will kill in cold blood if that is what is necessary to protect them from harm.\n \n Saudi Arabia isn't a playground, it's a medieval state rife with ethnic and religious tensions. You want to pretend that if the US embargoed spare parts for their F-16s they'd immediately morph into Vermont.\n \n Not gonna happen.\n \n It isn't going to happen because there is no consensus about how the place is to be run and there are plenty of people who want to do it.\n \n Not all of them can be graduates of the CIA School of Evil - indeed I bet most are self-taught as far as ambition.\n \n Once you accept and understand this, we can talk.",
