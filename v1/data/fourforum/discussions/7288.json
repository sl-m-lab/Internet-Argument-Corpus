You disagree with interpreting this, but you do agree with some interpretation.\n I think that the word \"interpreting\" has been skewed to mean something it doesn't. I don't want to speak for JP but I feel me means what I do. When I say \"a judge interprets the law\" I dont mean he/she decides the meaning of a certain amendment or amendments in the constitution. I believe it means stating how the set law applies to a certain case. For example, in a murder trial, you have a set law that says, for example, \"you can't murder someone\". A case comes up where someone hit someone else with their car but not on purpose...they are charged with murder. The judges reads the law and says \"well murder means you gotta actually mean to kill the person\". So he interprets the law as it relates to this case. Now you have an abortion case come up. The courts thought that if you take certain amendments and see the relation with them that you get a common meaning of privacy. Now what is wrong with this? Well, that would be like having my murder law for example and another law saying \"accidently killing while meaning to do harm is manslaughter and against the law\" and then saying well a common theme here is that killing someone is against the law...so in my car case the person would be guilty for killing someone.

There is no authority that can remove them, and they cannot be controlled by the laws of the legislature. In short, they are independent of the people, of the legislature, and of every power under heaven.\n\n \n This next quote actually came true is a funny way...\n \nMen placed in this situation will generally soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself.\n\n \n \nThree years ago, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services four Members of this Court appeared poised to \"cas[t] into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country\" who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproductive choice. All that remained between the promise of Roe and the darkness of the plurality was a single, flickering flame. Decisions since Webster gave little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light. But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright. \n \n I do not underestimate the significance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protection afforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the light. \n Good to know he thinks that the judges are the only ones keeping us in the light.\n \n \n Finally the Anti Federalists predicted...\n \nI have showed, in a former paper, that this court will be authorised\n to decide upon the meaning of the constitution; and that, not only according\n to the natural and obvious meaning of the words, but also according to the spirit and intention of it. In the exercise of this power they will not be subordinate to, but above the legislature. \n The federalists actually denied this yet this is exactly how the courts decided to \"interpret\".\n \n \n In short, while the courts can certainly decide what \"speech\" (for example) means in the constitution, it is overstepping when combining laws as this can create a judge to \"exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT\".",

   "I didn't say they were. I only mentioned the 9th to show that the people have more rights than the Constitution enumerates.\n\n True, people do have more rights than the Constitution enumerates. Two things about this. First, though more rights may exist, I find it a bad idea to send judges on an excursion to \"discover\" what these rights are/ought to be. Such a reading of the Ninth Amendment invites judges to exercise legislative power, a power I'm sure you'll agree that judges should not wield.\n \n Second, supposing that there are in fact other rights not explicitly in the Constitution that nevertheless garner the same protection as those specifically enumerated, I still think it is clear that abortion cannot be thought to be included within the Ninth Amendment. Two reasons I argue this: First, abortion was permissively regulated/outlawed in many states for over 100 years. Second, the Supreme Court virtually rejected the view that the right to an abortion is protected by the Ninth Amendment. And remember, this was a Supreme Court that was searching for any legal justification for forcing the state's to allow abortion they could muster up. Best they could come up with was the right to privacy in Griswold.\n \n \nPrivacy is not in the Constitution. Did I say it was somewhere? This fact is the reason that the decision in Griswold v Connecticutt was a bad one. I agree with the dissenters in that case.\n\n Glad to see somebody other than Robert Bork admit that Griswold was XXXX. And, contrary to what many people may believe, I meant that as a compliment and not as a critique. I, too, think Griswold was a load of XXXX. I must also say that I appreciate discussing the Constitution with someone who knows what they are talking about.\n \n \nI didn't say it was and I certainly didn't say it would be protected by the 9th. I said that I wondered if it could be argued that is is one of a woman's liberties under the 14th Amendment? Can you prove that it's excluded from those protected liberties?\n ------------------------------\n\n Couple of things. First, as I said earlier, the argument about the Ninth Amendment in Roe was rejected. Given the fact that that court was searching for any legal justification they could for the result in Roe, if they couldn't find it in the Ninth Amendment, it must not have been there. Second, as I pointed out in the first part, abortion was permissively regulated/outlawed by the States for over 100 years. In light of this, it seems to me a safe assumption that abortion is not protected by the Ninth Amendment.\n \n \nSo the people could vote in any oppression they please? Could the people just vote to make it illegal for anyone to cut their hair? Do individuals not retain any liberties?\n\n The Constitution does not prohibit a State from regulating the cutting of one's hair. It is the same for many liberties. Take my right to drive as fast as I choose, for instance. I may have the right, but nothing in the Constitution prohibits that right from being restricted or removed altogether.\n \n \n...I think it better if Congress would just do it's job.\n\n Here Here!

If there is no Constitutional right to an abortion, then there is no criteria necessary for a state to meet in order to make a law regarding abortion. The State's are ultimately free to make even the most stupid, pointless, and ignorant laws they want to so long as those laws do not infringe on a Constitutitonal right.

We may ultimately disagree on this point, but I'm pretty sure you understand this position.\n\n Perhaps I should clarify my meaning. It should be perfectly OK for a woman challenging the State to use the argument that a State's oppressive law over the individual does not harbor a State interest. It should not necessarily be OK for the court to use such reasoning to side with the State or government over the rights of the individual. The most recent horrendous example of this is Kelo v New London.\n \n \nThough, ultimately, the States do have an important interest should they need one in the end. The protection of life is legitimate enough.\n\n While you and I may agree on this as a reason we must remember that life is still technically defined as beginning at birth. The State's case is weak in claiming they are protecting life when that same life has no Constitutional rights of it's own. Such a law and such a case is asking the court to decide when life begins and that is not a job for judges. I think such a decision is answered more correctly by today's scientists and the Congress should seek their input.\n \n \nIn the end, I think that my original statment on abortion is unable to be invalidated.

I think there may be enough gray area in the Constitution for the individual to challenge a State's restriction on abortion. I am generally against any living document interpretations but realize that the era in which the Bill of Rights was penned does not represent the science of today.

In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\n\n Congress does have the authority to limit the jurisdiction of the court by statute alone.

I don't think any of us are denying this fact. With Alito, Scalia, Thomas, and Roberts some of us think this tread will stop. And it isn't that I just disagree with it. There is no where in the constitution that says there are FUNDAMENTAL right outside the constitution that are protected by the constitution to the point where you have to convince a judge it is a good idea before you can do it. The 9th amendment doesn't say this. It just says you can't manipulate the constitution to mean more than it does; the 14th and 4th amendment don't say this...they just say you can't take away life, liberty and property without due process of law...due process is just making a court ruling or making a law and no reason to think otherwise. People that claim substantive due process say there are liberties that are sooooo fundametal that they require an extra explanation....so is there life and property that require this too? Who said the courts get to determine these fundamental liberties? The courts are the defenders of the constitution, not the writers.\n \n \nThis begs the question, \"At what point are we now in the development of man's knowledge?\" Do we want the court to decide this or our representatives?
