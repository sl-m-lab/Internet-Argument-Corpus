   "(Washington) Legislation to allow faith-based groups which receive federal money to circumvent local and state human rights laws protecting LGBT workers has passed the House of Representatives.\n \n The Workforce Investment Act passed by a 224 - 200 vote after Republicans defended the hiring language.\n \n President Bush praised the move and called on Congress to expand the hiring language to other federal programs.\n \n The Workforce Investment Act would repeal workplace protections in job training programs signed into law by President Reagan and written by then-Senator Dan Quayle. Specifically, it would allow religious organizations, which receive federal funding to operate job training programs, to discriminate in employment based on religious grounds - including objections to an individual's sexual orientation.\n \n House Democrats argued that the bill amounts to government-sanctioned discrimination.\n \n \"This provision is offensive, ugly, wrong,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat. \"It is a slippery slope from here on out and I fear this is just the beginning.\"\n \n LGBT civil rights also decried the legislation which still needs Senate approval.\n \n \"Republicans are attempting to force taxpayers to pay for their own discrimination,\" said Eric Stern, Executive Director of National Stonewall Democrats. \n \n \"No American should have to pass a religious test in order to receive a federally funded job. The valuable work of our religious institutions should not be corrupted by discriminatory policies advanced by Republicans.\"\n \n The vote followed an \"action alert\" Tuesday by the conservative Family Research Council urging its members to contact their representatives to vote for the measure.\n \n \"Organizations that oppose homosexuality and abortion often need extra protection when receiving federal aid or using federal facilities,\" said Tony Perkins, FRC President.\n \n Among the Republicans who voted for passage of the legislation were Charlie Bass (NH), Judy Biggert (IL), Mary Bono (CA), Mark Foley (FL), Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ), Nancy Johnson (CT), Jim Kolbe (AZ), Jim Leach (AZ), Deborah Price (OH), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL), Joe Schwarz (MI) and John Sweeney (NY), all of whom received endorsements and financial support from national LGBT organizations last November.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005 Bill Allows Faith Based Groups To Discriminate Against Gay Workers \n by Paul Johnson 365Gay.com Washington Bureau Chief\n \n Posted: March 3, 2005 2:03 pm. ET \n ________________________________________________________________\n So If you are at the water cooler, at a faith based funded program, maybe at the homelss shelter and you declare that you are in favor of stem cell researh, or gays, or abortion....you could be fired for those beliefs and it is legal?\n \n Granted this need to pass the senate but still, this is insane. Doesn't this violate some part of the constitution?",

   "Knowing that my tax money could be spent to encourage discrimination against ME makes me sick. The backsliding this country is going through in the area of human rights is downright scary. The religious right has a choke hold on our government and it's getting out of control. And, this, in a country that isn't afraid to tell other countries how to treat their citizens. A serious case of do as I say and not as I do. I shudder to think of how far into the toilet we go before fairness prevails. It seems some people are never happy unless there is a subgroup to hate and a twisted form of religion gives them the perfect excuse to treat people this way. I don't see it stopping with gays either. The only way I see this changing is when more and more people start to feel the pinch of their own freedoms being taken away and I hope it happens soon.",

I mean, my partner works for a \"Christian\" organization which does not support gays/lesbians but her imediate supervisors know she's gay and have always supported her individually...simply because she does her job, does it well and her love life does NOT interfer with how she does her job. \n But we are always aware that if found out by the \"corperate higher-ups\" that she very well could be fired simply for who she is...without any review of her actual work history. Even in our state, which just passed an anti-descrimination law, her employer is exempt from this law because it's a religious organization.",
