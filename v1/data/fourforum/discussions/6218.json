   "One of the ambitious proposals put forth by former Vice-President Al Gore was the \"re-invention\" of government. While the Clinton Administration may have made some progress towards promoting greater efficiency, the result was that government actually grew in size mainly because of bureaucratic self-perpetuation. No one in the United States would disagree that the reduction of government waste should be given top priority. However, before tackling such a problem, one must examine the root causes and not merely treat the symptoms.\n \n When our founding fathers wrote the Constitution, they deliberately left out the \"structural path\" of elective office but were very clear on names of offices, branches of government, duties of elected officials etcetera. However, what they failed to foresee was the need for elective offices to follow a required path. For example, take the leader of the executive branch; if a person wants to be elected president of the United States, they must first serve as mayor of a city, commissioner of a county and then governor of a state. The two-term limit (eight years) should also be extended to include these lower chief executives as well. \n \n The legislative branch should have a similar path. If one wants to be elected United States senator, they must first serve as a U.S. congressperson from that state. Before serving as a congressperson, they must serve as a councilperson of a city, representative of a state and then as a state senator. The two-term limit should apply here as well. \n \n As for the judicial branch, a United States supreme court justice must serve as a municipal court judge of a city, common pleas court judge of a county, circuit court or district court judge of a state, appeals court judge and state supreme court judge. The two-term limit would apply here also.\n \n Furthermore, the education of these candidates to-be should entail the equivalent of earning a bachelors degree, masters degree and a doctorate in philosophy degree. These degrees must be earned prior to running for elective office. Besides providing a focused academic training it will promote a greater maturity in our candidates before they experience the rigors of their first elective office. \n \n Few could doubt that this path would provide good practical training for those seeking higher office while at the same time establishing a track record that voters could more easily analyze and understand. The two-term limit would allow greater participation because the office would be wide open every eight years. This would force the elected official to properly execute his/her duties and not be as influenced by the various special interest groups.\n \n Government today is often seen as part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem. Perhaps if the United States would consider a path of development for its \"philosopher kings\" public trust would return and something may actually get done.",

That's 24 years of political service before you qualify to run as president. Wouldn't this proposal restrict the top elected offices to career politicians, thus isolating voters?\n \n Shouldn't all political offices be open to any person who has the desire to run? That's the reason for the lack of significant Constitutional requirements for any political office.\n \n As for the enforcement of term limits on a lower scale, this should be an issue addressed solely by individual states on the basis of their own Constitutions. States are given the sole power to elect and control their elected officers, free from federal intrusion. This helps preserve the balance between the states and the federal government. Such a significant reduction in state power would require a Constitutional Amendment, and I find it hard to believe that the states would be willing to cede their current rights to the whims of Congress.\n \n \nFurthermore, the education of these candidates to-be should entail the equivalent of earning a bachelors degree, masters degree and a doctorate in philosophy degree. These degrees must be earned prior to running for elective office. Besides providing a focused academic training it will promote a greater maturity in our candidates before they experience the rigors of their first elective office.\n\n Again, you're suggesting imposing very strict limits to elected officers, further seperating them from the common man. The constitutionality of this again rises, why would states cede this power to Congress? (or give it up)\n \n Second, why a philosophy degree? Wouldn't a civil engineer be better suited to running a city or county? Wouldn't social science degrees better serve those who work in national government?\n \n The requirement of a certain type of degree would lead to stagnation. When every politician has the same background and training, there would be little incentive or inducement to enact change in government. There is an even more dangerous problem: who determines the curriculum?\n \n What if the curriculum is designed to focus on the works of Marx and Lenin, and ignores philosophers such as Plato and Descartes? The requirement of a \"philosophy degree\" is too subjective and open to (eventual) abuse.\n \n \nFew could doubt that this path would provide good practical training for those seeking higher office while at the same time establishing a track record that voters could more easily analyze and understand.\n\n I disagree, the doctorate requirement essentially guarantees that a city mayor would have little to no practical experience before becoming eligible for office. Further, mayors and governors make significantly different decisions than Presidents and Senators, and therefore may lead to a faulty view of an individuals qualifications.\n \n Besides, how many voters seriously look at the records of candidates before voting? I think you'd be surprised at the extent of voter apathy.\n \n \nThe two-term limit would allow greater participation because the office would be wide open every eight years. This would force the elected official to properly execute his/her duties and not be as influenced by the various special interest groups.\n\n I don't think that length of service is at all related to influence by special interest groups. A politician that is required to run for office every few years has to make sure that they keep up their image with the public. Look at the criticisms laid on second-term presidents and a lame duck congress. They don't have to follow polls, and therefore can ignore the will of the people much easier.\n \n \nGovernment today is often seen as part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem. Perhaps if the United States would consider a path of development for its \"philosopher kings\" public trust would return and something may actually get done.\n\n I don't believe that we should have an established political class in this country, and I think that this is the first step on the way to an oligarchy in the guise of democracy.\n \n The lure of the current system is that anyone can run for any office, whatever their qualifications. They have no guarantee that they'll win, but they are guaranteed a fair run for office. This leads to more diversity of thought and a more representative cross section of the political landscape.",
