So the red headed people in my example would be suject to \"the red headed people killing act\", that I used as a example, and the majority of people and congress support the act. According to Bassman the red headed people should not have any recourse to turn to the courts. Since he, and other conservatives, believe that the courts, including the supreme court have no rights, under the constitution , to strike down any act of congress or the will of the people.\n \n \n Amendment XIV\n \n Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n No, you just don't want to play by the rules. \n \n Conservates and religious groups do not want to \"play by the rules\" on issues that concern them also. Such as the 2000 election, abortion, the right to die ect....\n \n The people or Oregon voted for assisted suicide put it their constitution. Conservates sued to have the law overturned. The people of California voted to make marijauna legal for medical purposes. Guess what the conservates used the courts in both cases to over turn the will of the people. So don't give me this ativist judge, or \"play by the rules\" XXXX. Conservates can not have it both ways.\n \n \n \n\n And controlling lives is the job of the government. You can't steal, murder, etc however you need to use the legislative branches to do this...not the judicial. As for gay marriage, I don't think there should be marriage in government anyway and to say marriage is not a religious term is crazy because it clearly is. I guess to say this country was not founded on Christian principles is crazy too but people claim that :p.\n\n \n \n Ahhh but that is the problem marriage is in government as as long as it is it sould be equal marriage regardless of sex or marriage for no one.",
