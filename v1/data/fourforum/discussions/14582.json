   "Such operations cost trillions of dollars, of course, over time.\n \n One may begin with the internal costs to the invading and occupying nation, the damage done to that nation's infrastructure by siphoning off national resources to feed a starving and constantly hungry war. Schools suffer, roads suffer, it is necessary to cut public service employees such as firefighters, police officers, teachers, as well as to allow public buildings to decay, roads and bridges to fall apart, limited access to public parks and wilderness.\n \n Warfare is quite costly, after all, and constantly whines to be fed more.\n \n I'm afraid little concern is given to the damages suffered by the invaded and occupied nation. Look at the sad case of Iraq, still without the water, sewage, electrical and other public services that that nation had under the jurisdiction of Saddam Hussein. Hospitals have been destroyed and not rebuilt. The same with schools.\n \n And, with every war, there is always the same problem: in Iraq \"the thousands of Iraqis who worked on behalf of the American government - and who fear their lives and families are threatened by insurgents as a result.\"\n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/opinion/31sanghvi.html\n \n \nIn 2008 Congress significantly expanded a program that provided these Iraqis with visas to immigrate to the United States. But in the intervening years, the program has proven to be a bureaucratic failure. Unless we improve the resettlement process for our Iraqi allies, their lives will continue to be in danger long after the last American soldier has returned home.\n \n The basic problem with the program, called the special immigrant visa, is that it treats applicants - many of whom are on the run and often facing death threats - as if they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n Of course, we must welcome these people into our nation. We have placed them in great danger and we owe it to them.\n \n We also must learn to tolerate the presence of many more mosques so that these people can enjoy the American tradition of freedom of belief.\n \n And, if we choose to invade Iran or any other Islamic nation, we must be prepared to welcome even more refugees and allow the construction of even more mosques. \n \n After all, warfare does have its ongoing costs.",

   "Many things in this post are disagreeable.\n \n \n\n I'm afraid little concern is given to the damages suffered by the invaded and occupied nation. Look at the sad case of Iraq, still without the water, sewage, electrical and other public services that that nation had under the jurisdiction of Saddam Hussein.\n\n \n Eh? Time for a history lesson.\n \n \n&#8220;Your efforts have not been limited to developing physical infrastructures, but also have included partnerships with the ministries of electricity, housing, construction, municipalities, public works, water resources and oil,&#8221; Odierno said. &#8220;You have vigorously shared your expertise and have helped Iraq make tremendous progress in developing human capital and the technical skills necessary to continue to move forward and build a more vibrant and modern state.&#8221;\n \n ...\n \n As of Oct. 1, GRD [US Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division] had completed nearly 5,300 projects valued at more than $9 billion. In fiscal 2009, GRD&#8217;s personnel had completed 325 projects valued at nearly $1 billion including:\n \n * 41 school projects\n * 20 village road projects\n * 25 water distribution projects\n * 21 electric distribution projects\n * 12 police stations\n * Seven court projects\n * Two military command centers\n \n History-making division inactivated in Iraq\n\n \n Also, I don't know what makes you think Saddam Hussein was such a benevolent leader. We're talking about a guy who used mustard gas on his own people, invaded Kuwait because of a debt he owed them, killed thousands of Southern Iraqis for having religious views that differed from his own, tortured 1,500 innocent people (many of whom were children) because they were in the wrong town at the wrong time, forced untrained civilians into the Iraqi military, and was referred to by the New York Times as \"one of the most brutal tyrants in recent history.\"\n \n Let's also take a look at Uday Hussein...\n \n \n\n Allegedly kidnapping young Iraqi women from the streets in order to rape them.[2] Uday was known to intrude on parties and otherwise \"discover\" women whom he would later rape. Time published an article in 2003 detailing his sexual brutality.[2][10] In one such instance, he accosted a young woman who was walking with her husband, where Uday said her husband was a nobody, despite him wearing a uniform showing him to be a captain in the Iraqi Army. Uday then ordered his men to grab the girl, to which her husband struck Uday in defense of his wife, and was apprehended by Uday's bodyguards. The wife was raped and later murdered, and the husband was sentenced to death for \"high treason against Saddam\".\n \n Uday Hussein - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n \n He certainly sounds like a pleasant guy, doesn't he?\n \n \nAnd, with every war, there is always the same problem: in Iraq \"the thousands of Iraqis who worked on behalf of the American government &#8212; and who fear their lives and families are threatened by insurgents as a result.\"\n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/opinion/31sanghvi.html\n\n \n Do you think they don't accept that risk when they volunteer to work for the US?\n \n \n\n Of course, we must welcome these people into our nation. We have placed them in great danger and we owe it to them.\n\n \n I think we'll be responsible for housing people in Iraq when Jihadist movements rebuild the world trade centers. I'm not holding my breath.\n \n \nAnd, if we choose to invade Iran or any other Islamic nation, we must be prepared to welcome even more refugees and allow the construction of even more mosques. \n \n\n \n Why? Once again, why should we compensate for the damages we've caused when Jihadists aren't responsible for compensating for the damages they've caused?",

   "I think it is better to do what everyone else does.\n \n Pack up our bags, missiles and guns, and leave.\n \n No more money, public works, schools or anything. They got a chance at their own government, and so the people will get what we leave them, or make for themselves.\n \n We keep one base open and operational to launch the occasional attack if needed, and get out.\n \n Next year, lets cut our military spending by 30% and keep one base in Iraq and one in Afghanistan - each one with 10,000 people.\n \n Let's save lives and money.\n \n That way we can focus on our $14 billion debt to our friend China.",
