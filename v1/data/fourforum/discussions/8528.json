   "No, say its not true. Who could have imagined? Dishonesty must be one of those values they keep talking about. \n \n http://www.9news.com/acm_news.aspx?OSGNAME=KUSA&IKOBJECTID=7ebd94d6-0abe-421a-009d-8d582a6aa449&TEMPLATEID=0c76dce6-ac1f-02d8-0047-c589c01ca7bf\n \n \nDENVER (AP) - A group on Monday accused the founder of Focus on the Family of manipulating research data to say gays and lesbians are not good parents. \n \n \n Additional Resources... \n A gay rights group plans to march on the Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs. 9NEWS at 4 p.m. July 17, 2006. \n \n \n \n \n Focus on the Family officials denied the allegation. \n \n The Virginia-based group called Soulforce began a 65-mile march to Focus on the Family founder James Dobson's Colorado Springs headquarters to confront him. \n \n Soulforce Executive Director Jeff Lutes said Dobson's statements have brought rejection and ridicule on gay and lesbian parents, and the group wants him to stop. \n \n \"That misinformation has real tragic results. It makes living for families like ours much more difficult. We are rejected sometimes by loved ones, we are shunned by churches and we are discriminated against in every state in this country,\" Lutes said at a rally at the state Capitol before the march got under way. \n \n Judith Stacey, a sociologist at New York University, said her work was manipulated in an attempt to show gays and lesbians do not make good parents. \n \n \"This is a direct misrepresentation of the research,\" she said at the rally. \n \n Stacey said Dobson twisted her research showing that the quality of parenting has the most impact on children in an effort to show that children need a mother and a father to thrive. \n \n She said part of her research compared the impact of two biological parents with single parents and she said it was wrong to try to extend that to apply to couples. \n \n \"That is a direct misrepresentation of the research,\" she said. \n \n Focus on the Family spokesman Glenn Stanton cited other research -- including an article co-authored by Mary Parke, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which shows that children need a mother and a father, regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. \n \n \"We haven't said anything about sexual orientation,\" he said. \n \n Focus on the Family spokesman Gary Schneeberger said his organization refused to meet privately with members of Soulforce last year but offered to hold a public debate, which Soulforce refused. He said he did not know if Dobson would meet with the group this year, but he doubted. \n \n \"This is a public issue. We should have a public debate,\" he said.\n",

They are nice guys, though some are still feminine and that is why the were gay in the past. The were feminine as a child and made fun of and started to believe they were gay. Now that they have learned to accept themselves they know they aren't gay, they're just not tough manly men. Gotta go do some work.

   "To sum it up, I think being gay isn't natural and you people think it is. Since there is no way to bring hard evidence proving it one way or the other, everyone just believes what they want.\n\n I always have to chuckle whenever I read a statement like this because it's usually an effort to ignore the fact that there are BIGGER ISSUES that are being ignored and that the other poster can't address.\n \n Here, the big issue wallninja is not addressing is that homosexuality is observed in THOUSANDS of species across the animal kingdom spectrum.\n \n Ergo, his belief that it is \"unnatural\" is still unsubstantiated, while he ignores the fact that proof of the \"naturalness\" of nature's homosexuality has been proven.\n \n \n \nAnd as opposed to popular belief, not all psychologists think gay is normal.\n\n 1) Nobody is saying ALL psychologists think gay is normal.\n 2) But the vast majority DO SAY that it is NOT a mental illness.\n 3) Another boring misrepresentation from the anti-gay side is to talk about psychology and psychiatry with respect to homosexuality being \"normal\".\n \"Normal\" isn't a classification in the psych world. The point of psychology is not to make one \"normal\", but rather to maintain mental health.\n \"Normal\" is something wallninja is preoccupied with, and as such, he shouldn't mix his own fixations with the scientific / medical community.\n \n \n \nThe APA does, but they are part of the pro-gay agenda.\n\n And wallninja's metal tin-foil hat can help keep those bad pro-gay agenda mind beams out of his head.\n Conspiracy theory? Who said that! Was that you wall?\n Or did those pro-gay agendists sneak another probe into my nose???\n < end sarcasm <\n \n \n \nEvery psychologist I've talked to says differently.\n\n And let me tell you, wallninja has had to see a LLOOOOTTTTT of psychologists!!!\n < end sarcasm <\n I always get a kick out of anonymous psychologists who posters here have supposedly \"talked to\" about homosexuality.\n If you actually get a chance to quiz them about what the \"psychologist\" supposedly said, you'll typically find that the \"psychologist\" statements reveal absolutely no knowledge of what psychology is. Note, I'm not talking about DISAGREEING on homosexuality, but rather statements like a doctor not knowing that a thermometer is not something you use to hear a heart-beat...\n \n And since wallninja has conveniently come up with excuses why he won't be available to expound on his claims, I guess he's clear on that one...\n \n \n \nHe has dealt with over 100 patients that were gay and not one of them is gay anymore. He never once mentioned the fact that they were gay nor did he address the issue in any way. He went straight to helping them with their primary disorder and the stopped being gay of their own free will.\n\n And this is precisely the type of lying bullsp!t I'm talking about...\n Claims that psychologists have \"dealt with over 100 patients that were gay\", and the foolish assumption that psychologists routinely conver them so \"not one of them is gay anymore\".\n Pure bullsh!t if you actually read the papers on the issue of \"reparative therapy\". This type of sh!t just DOES NOT happen.\n \n \n \nI've talked with a few of the men he helped.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n So let me get this \"straight\". (pun intended)\n Wallninja is just TOOOOOOO busy to be posting on these message forums, but he obviously has plenty of time to talk to the PATIENTS of a psychologist acquaintance of his....\n \n Do I need to spell out why this is SOOOOO obviously a lie that it isn't funny?",

   "[QUOTE=wallninja]..............................As some of you might have noticed, I haven't been on here in a while. My internet has been cut off and I've been real busy lately. This just isn't a top priority for me. I am no longer going to be getting on this site because it takes too much time and that is something I don't have enough of. If you want to translate this as me cowering out then think what you will, but this is a waste of time for me seeing as I'm obviously not going to change your minds and neither shall you change mine.\n \n \n \n Changing peoples minds is not the main reason that people debate, you're confusing debating with evangelising.\n \n \n \n To sum it up, I think being gay isn't natural and you people think it is. Since there is no way to bring hard evidence proving it one way or the other, everyone just believes what they want.\n \n \n The hard evidence lies in the fact that homosexuals do exist and homosexuality is completely natural for them. \n \n \n \n \n And as opposed to popular belief, not all psychologists think gay is normal. The APA does, but they are part of the pro-gay agenda. Every psychologist I've talked to says differently.\n \n \n That's what Dr. Dobson says too. You are both misinformed. \n \n \n \n According to one psychologist, being gay is a secondary disorder that developes from something else. Many times the primary disorder is self pity and a victimized mentallity.\n \n \n I have never heard of anyone being diagnosed with a case of \"self pity.\"\n \n \n \n He has dealt with over 100 patients that were gay and not one of them is gay anymore.\n \n \n What is his name and who are these 100 patients? When you say not gay anymore, do you mean that they are now heterosexual? Or are they celebate? Or are they make believe? \n \n \n He never once mentioned the fact that they were gay nor did he address the issue in any way. He went straight to helping them with their primary disorder and the stopped being gay of their own free will.\n \n \n That is astounding.\n \n \n \n I've talked with a few of the men he helped.\n \n \n How did he help them? \n \n \n \n They are nice guys, though some are still feminine and that is why the were gay in the past.\n \n \n Feminine behavior is not why they were gay in the past. They were gay in the past because they were homosexuals. And they are still homosexuals and they know it. You and your psychiatrist friend are the only two people that don't\n \n \n \n The were feminine as a child and made fun of and started to believe they were gay. \n \n \n A feminine boy may start to believe he is a \"sissy\", but unless he is a homosexual, he is not going to believe he is gay.\n \n \n \n Now that they have learned to accept themselves they know they aren't gay, they're just not tough manly men.\n \n \n Interesting,,,,,,,,,,,how do you account for the homosexuals that are tough manly men? There are more manly gay men, then feminine gay men. You just are not aware of them because they don't fit your perception of what you think a gay person is.\n \n \n \n Gotta go do some work. I probably won't be back on for a long time so there's no real point in responding, but go ahead if you want. I just won't be on to read it. If I get more time later, like probably next year, then we can continue this.\n \n \n What you write has no real bearing on homosexuality itself. You do not approve of it, nor can you accept it, so you invent these scenarios where it simply vanishes. Like in the cases of these 100 formerly gay patients. If that is what you need to do to deal with homosexuality in regards to your own life, let us just say that \"ignorance is bliss.\" But do your best not to address the issue of homosexuality as it really is in your current state of \"bliss.\"",
