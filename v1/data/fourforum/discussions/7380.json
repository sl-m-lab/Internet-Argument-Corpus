   "How the Ayatollah Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini got Reagan elected:\n \n \nReagan Takes Oath As 40th President; Promises An 'Era Of National Renewal' \n By Steven R. Weisman \n Special to The New York Times \n Washington, Jan. 20 -- Ronald Wilson Reagan of California, promising \"an era of national renewal,\" became the 40th President of the United States today as 52 Americans held hostage in Iran were heading toward freedom.\n \n The hostages, whose 14 months of captivity had been a central focus of the Presidential contest last year took off from Teheran in two Boeing 727 airplanes at 12:25 P.M., Eastern standard time, the very moment that Mr. Reagan was concluding his solemn Inaugural Address at the United States Capitol. . . .\nNote: Captives released on the moment of Reagan's inaugural address. And, of course, the Iran-Contra weapons trading that went on thereafter--the scandal when it was discovered--one might also wish to investigate the matter of the October Surprise:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise",
