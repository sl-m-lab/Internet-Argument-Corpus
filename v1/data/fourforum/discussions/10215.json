   "10 reasons why gay marriage should be illegal\n \n \n 10 Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong \n \n \n 01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning. \n \n 02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. \n \n 03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. \n \n 04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. \n \n 05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed. \n \n 06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children. \n \n 07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. \n \n 08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. \n \n 09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children. \n \n 10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans. \n\n \n I did not write this but I thought it was brilliant. Here is the link incase anybody would like to see the original post on Craigslist\n \n http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/pdx/102351114.html",

   "Sometimes things should be mocked or ridiculed to put them into perspective. \n \n Re-read some of those things and really think about them. Some of them are actual reasons that you claim gays should not get married. Read those from another person's perspective and think of how silly they sound.\n \n 03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. \n \n You have actually made this claim. I know that you realize deep down it is ridiculous. It does not matter if people will request to marry their dog, it can't happen and you know why. \n \n 04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. \n \n Are you okay with women being equals, blacks marrying whites and divorce being legal? Why can't you accept that the people that make up this country are changing whether you want to change with them or not. Just because you want to stay behind in the stone age does not mean that others should have to. We pay taxes and work our asses off, what gives you the power to refuse us our rights!?\n \n 08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. \n \n We are supposed to have freedoms in this country; freedom of speech, freedom of religion etc. Why is it okay to take away another persons freedom to do what they please as long as it harms no other person. I'm going to use your same \"dog marriage\" argument against you, ready? \n \n If the Christian right is allowed to prevent gay marriage than what is to stop you from taking away the civil rights of others? Why is it moral or ethical to take away the civil rights of your fellow countrymen? Please explain.\n \n 09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children. \n \n This one speaks for itself. \n \n I don't think this persons post is \"shallow as a puddle\" as you so eloquently put it. Merits? What are the merits of this issue if not civil rights and freedom? C'mon Arch...Your religion is clouding your mind and preventing you from listening to another person's pain.",
