   "Anti-homosexual activists arrested when they disobeyed police orders to move during Philadelphia's 2004 OutFest celebration had a right to demonstrate but not disrupt the coming-out festival, a federal appeals court ruled today.\n \n The decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit came in a lawsuit brought by 11 protesters affiliated with Repent America, a Lansdowne-based group whose members preach the belief that homosexuality is sinful.\n \n The activists were arrested at the 2004 festival after disobeying police orders to move as they proclaimed their anti-gay message, with one member of the group chastising a transgendered person as a \"she-man.\"\n \n All charges were dropped, and the activists filed suit, contending that police and the city violated their First Amendment rights and that police silenced them because of the content of their message.\n \n But the Third Circuit said Philadelphia police \"had ample justification\" in directing the protesters to move when they \"interfered\" with event activities.\n \n \"The police action was not based on the content of [the activists'] message but on their conduct,\" wrote Judge Dolores K. Sloviter, who said a video of the event showed the Repent America group tried to \"drown out\" platform speakers and congregated in the middle of the walkway.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20080715_3d_Circuit__Anti-gay_activists_can_demonstrate__not_disrupt.html\n \n This case has been bandied about by the anti-gay side, typically misrepresenting it like the big mean gays had an event these guys happened to go to, and when they said something contrary, the gays had them arrested.\n \n The charges were initially dropped, inappropriately so, since the \"problem\" had been contained.\n But the 11 disruptors pushed the case anyways, and they just got the message that the police WERE RIGHT in doing what they did.\n \n So you can thank \"Repent America\" because there is now PRECEDENT for maintaining the charges against people who want to disrupt gay events with their prejudice.\n Freedom of speech doesn't mean you can come to our event and try to drown us out. emoticon_xdonno",

   "I think it would be quibbling over semantics, but \"respect\" wouldn't be the word I would use for the reason / justification.\n Some occasions are such that a \"demonstration\" is grotesquely harassing, like a \"demonstration\" at a funeral.\n \n There have been laws passed in a variety of states, prompted by protests at MILITARY funerals, which prevent demonstrations like Fred Phelps is renowned for.\n \n And on another level, it is \"customary\" to have \"free speech zones\" set aside at a significant distance away from visiting politicians, like for presidential visits or the recent primaries. If that is legal when it's political reasons, I can't help but think that something similar for a funeral would obviously be allowable as law.",
