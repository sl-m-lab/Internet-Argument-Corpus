You can get more light from a 13 watt CFL as opposed to a 150 watt incandescent light. Personally, for security lighting I prefer High Intensity Discharge (HID) light sources such as High Pressure Sodium or Metal Halide.",

   "Instead of using motion detectors, which tent to have itchy trigger fingers, try HID light sources such as phosphor coated mercury or HPS luminaires fitted with photocontrols.\nThe only problem with HID security lighting (that I can think of right now) is that when shaken hard enough, they will lose the arc and be out until they cool down enough to restrike. That is, unless you had sense enough to buy dual arc tube or instant restrike lamps. When we were a lot younger, we'd simply hit the base of a light pole with a sledge hammer, making the light go out, giving us time to smooch in the dark.)\n \n I like the CF lamps. As a night light in the den I have a 13w lamp in a simple soup-bowl reflector, mounted close to the wall and pointed at a framed mirror which is angled about 15deg back at the top. (It actually sits on a shelf and leans against the wall.) This arrangement lights up the wall, the ceiling and provides enough diffuse light to move around anywhere in the relatively large room without having to look directly at the light source.\n \n As a security/visitor light, I have a single CF lamp mounted on a post about ten feet away from the door, illuminating the door and the wall on both sides of the door. Miniature photosensors mounted in the wall at 4 feet above grade are activated when the light is interrupted, setting off silent alarms and triggering the CCTV recorder to run continuously for 10 minutes (normally it takes one frame every 10sec)",
