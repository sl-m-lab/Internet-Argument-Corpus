   "It appears that old men can only beget women for it takes a bit more oomph to make sons.\n \n \nWhat the researchers did not correct for was the father's age. And previous studies have shown that older fathers are relatively more likely to beget daughters. So part of the effect Dr Pollet has discovered might be caused by the fact that, obviously, a man is older when he takes a second or subsequent wife than when he marries for the first time. This age effect, too, could be ascribed to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis if, say, sperm quality falls with age.\n\n Sex ratios and maternal environment: Sons and mothers | The Economist",

   "If the fertility rate of the USA is about 2.1 then the Blacks will become soon extinct because\n \n \n&#8220;Babies born to black mothers died at two and a half times the rate of those born to white mothers, according to the CDC figures.\n \n The United States ranks near the bottom for infant survival rates among modernized nations. A Save the Children report last year placed the United States ahead of only Latvia, and tied with Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.\n \n \n The same report noted the United States had more neonatologists and newborn intensive care beds per person than Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom &#8212; but still had a higher rate of infant mortality than any of those nations\n \n One of the most pervasive myths floating around the United States is that modern medicine has saved women and children from almost certain death during childbirth. Even if a woman or her baby was not sure to die then modern medicine most certainly saved her from an agonizing ordeal that would make her want to kill herself if the childbirth itself did not do the job.\n \n People that look beyond the myths quickly discover that medical interventions in childbirth do not save as many lives as they would like you to think, as so clearly indicated by the United States&#8217; dismal maternal and infant mortality rates when compared to the rest of the world. The United States intervenes in childbirth as much as, if not more so than any other industrialized nation, so theoretically we should lose virtually no women or babies, correct?\n \n The fact of the matter is that interventions such as cesareans, labor inductions, immediate cord clamping can actually kill women and children in some cases. Many other babies are permanently damaged or even die due to lack of breastfeeding which is also brought on by the very same interventions designed to &#8220;save them&#8221;.\n\n \n http://childbirth.amuchbetterway.com/us-infant-death-rates-among-worst-in/",
