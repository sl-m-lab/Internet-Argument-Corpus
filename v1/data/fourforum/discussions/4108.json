   "Do you think there is a plan by the Jewish establishment to reduce america to a third world nation? And was Martin Luther King part of this plan?\n\n \n I doubt there was an organized plan devised by Jewish groups to achieve this goal, but Jews are on the record as being the primary \"movers and shakers\" behind very many changes that have ocurred in America during the last several decades - changes that have not been at all beneficial for Whites. For example, have a look at the documentary record of the Jewish involvement in the so-called \"civil rights\" movement of the 1960s:\n \n http://www.martinlutherking.org/ma-chapter18.html\n \n \n This book explains in detail how Jews have been at the forefront of every \"liberal\" cause during the last century:\n \n http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0275961133/002-4858857-6024844\n \n \n \nAll of your sources here appear tro be a white supremist website. Do you have any non-biased evidence of your claims....Especially the orgies with white women thing?\n\n \n \"That night King retired to his room at the Willard Hotel. There FBI bugs reportedly picked up 14 hours of party chatter, the clinking of glasses and the sounds of illicit sex--including King's cries of \"I'm f--ing for God\" and \"I'm not a Negro tonight!\"\n \n Note: What is not mentioned in this article is that Martin Luther King was having sex with three White women, one of whom he brutally beat while screaming the above mentioned quotes. Much of the public information on King's use of church money to hire prostitutes and his beating them came from King's close personal friend, Rev. Ralph Abernathy (pictured above), in his 1989 book, \"And the walls came tumbling down.\"\n \n Sources:\n \n Newsweek Magazine 1-19-1998, page 62\n \n \"And the walls came tumbling down,\" by Rev. Ralph Abernathy (1989)\n \n Source:\n \n http://www.mlking.org/dream.html \n \n The Myths of Martin Luther King\n \n The Destruction of an \"American\" Icon\n \n There is probably no greater sacred cow in America than Martin Luther King Jr. The slightest criticism of him or even suggesting that he isn't deserving of a national holiday leads to the usual accusations of racist, fascism, and the rest of the usual left-wing epithets not only from liberals, but also from many ostensible conservatives and libertarians.\n \n This is amazing because during the 50s and 60s, the Right almost unanimously opposed the civil rights movement. Contrary to the claims of many neocons, the opposition was not limited to the John Birch Society and southern conservatives. It was made by politicians like Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, and in the pages of Modern Age, Human Events, National Review, and the Freeman.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/epstein9.html\n \n \n \n .",

The influx of many neoconservative intellectuals, many of whom were involved in the civil rights movement, into the conservative movement also contributes to the King phenomenon.\"\n \n \n .\n\n \n Siegy, \"For a racial reality check\" - the USA was NEVER the exclusive indigenous domain of the anglo-saxon breed. It was vicously stolen from American Indians (lots of 'white pride' here). If this genocidal savagery wasnt enough, the platform of the US [anglo] economy was then erected by black slavery, a trade managed by the very white british. Suggest you come to terms with these historical facts first, in order for your demands for racial purefication to be taken seriously. If anything the rest of the world's tribes need to be isolated from the historically brutal and putrefying anglo-saxon tribe.\n \n You're fond of knocking the \"predatory\" Jew, but in truth your 'precious' anglo or teutonic breed share many traits with your supposedly zionist 'arch-enemy'. Ironic is it not? Perhaps its a case of predator vs alien.",
