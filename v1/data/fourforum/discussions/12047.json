   "Yes they do. Modern Coelocanth: Modern Coelocanth\n \n \n No they don't. Fossil Coelocanth: Fossil Coelocanth\n \n \n No, it was based upon the fact we hadn't seen one, yet there were fossils of them. Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed.\n\n \n First of all, let's compare the \"B\" specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me. Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years.\n One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.\n \n Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.\n \n The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.\n \n Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.\n \n Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.\n \n Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: \"LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.\"\n \n They go on to report: \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.\"(30)\n \n Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species.\n \n Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land.\n \n This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: \"Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.\"(31)\n \n It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil Record\n \n Here's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer.\n \n Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story. The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY'S THIS:\n I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth.\n So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist, even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth, but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence, was a complete myth. Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution.",

   "Your comparative link didn't work. But here is your diagram and photo together. Note the B specimen in the fossil diagram and imagine it with flesh.\n\n Strange, let's see if I can post it here in the form of a picture.\n \n imageschack must hate me, I can't get it to work, if you've got a different free picture uploader, I'll give it a try there.\n \n Until then, I'll describe what I did.\n \n Using paint, I put both fish underneath each other, and flipped the modern one around, so they were both facing the same way. I encircled everything that was different from the other with a red circle, and the same part on the other to show that they were indeed different. These were the parts I encircled:\n \n The tail, as it is clear the fossil one has a very different shape there.\n The fin next to the head, that in the modern variety is pointing up, and clearly different form the fossil one where it is pointing backwards\n The \"scales\" on the head, as they have a very different pattern.\n I also encircled the fin on the top of the body that is closest to the head (don't know it's name, English not being my native language) Though I am now doubting this one, as they do seem similar, i think what confused me is the \"bony\" part underneath it, which would be covered by flesh if it weren't a fossil, so I'll retract that one.\n And, as I pointed out, the overall body shape of the modern one is \"fatter\" it's not as streamlined as the fossil one.\n \n So, there you have it, I pointed out the superficial differences that I could find from these two drawings. Bear in mind that there are probably many more that can only be found by studying the fish up close and personal.\n \n \nMore obfuscation and denials of the facts. Especially since I did post the account from Fricke which the article was based upon, here: The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta Notice at the top of the page it say's this: In a 1988 National Geographic article, Fricke reported what they saw.\n\n So, that piece of text you put in your post wasn't from the Nat Geo, as I had thought. I did misread your post though, and for that I apologize. You did provide the article.\n \n \nAnd Nat Geo reports on the reported facts as considered by the source, so they are assuming nothing which hasn't been reported within the community. To disregard their version is to reject what the original purveyors of the info believed. And it is obvious that Fricke considered his ability to view the living coelacanth to be the same as looking at a hundreds of million year old living fossil.\n\n I disagree here, what he was excited about was studying a fish from a family that was hitherto thought to be extinct. And it even says so right in the article that it's not the same fish as the fossil ones, here's the quote:\n \nSmith identified it as a coelacanth, but of an entirely new genus and species from any recorded as fossils.\n\n So, although Fricke was excited about this (who wouldn't be, you're finding the habitat of a long forgotten fish) it is clear he KNEW the fish was different. He says he's sad they didn't see it walk because that would have undoubtedly confirmed that the fish from the fossils could do this too. However, not seeing an entirely different fish do entirely different things is no reason to claim your previous findings are incorrect.\n \n \nAsk yourself this simple question huntard; why would Fricke have made this statement regarding the fish he was viewing live, compared to the ancient specimen if they weren't the same fish as far as he was concerned?\n\n See above.\n \n \nNO, it isn't different. Nor was it considered to be different when the original discovery was made. That is my point. Evos are now trying to claim a difference where none was seen or claimed originally.\n\n Unfortunately, the article YOU quoted disagree with you, here's the entire paragraph concerning this:\n \n Legendary naturalist Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer spotted the first coelacanth in a trawler's catch at the South African port of East London in December 1938. The fish, later mounted, is displayed in the East London Museum.\n \n Realizing that she had seen no ordinary fish, the young museum curator sent a sketch to Professor J.L.B. Smith, a noted chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa. Smith identified it as a coelacanth, but of an entirely new genus and species from any recorded as fossils. He named it Latimeria chalumnae for its discoverer and the mouth of the Chalumna River, where it was captured.\n\n So, immediately after it was found, it was already classified as an entirely different fish.\n \n \nWrong again. Fricke was specifically comparing the new fish to the alleged habits and capabilities of the fossilized assumptions because that was what he wanted to confirm.\n\n Yes, as I pointed out above. He didn't confirm it, which made him sad, but that is in no way evidence that the fish from the fossils didn't do that.\n \n \nThat it had intermediary traits as claimed by Professor Smith himself who nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers.\n\n Actually, that was all about the modern fish, not about the fossil one.\n \n \nBut I have posted evidence. And even your evidence which I reposted proves I am right. \n\n No it doesn't, there are differences in the fish. But the most important part is this:Even if the fish were to look EXACTLY like the fossil one, it's genetic make up is still ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.\n \n \nAnd if you can read the link from Encarta, or this link: The Fossil Record and not see the obvious belief and understanding \"at the time\" by the involved scientists then it is you who is denying the facts.\n\n I read the links, they don't confirm your assertions, sorry.\n \n I think I'll refute a bit of the article you posted.\n [quote]The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.[quote]\n Even the fish in the fossil pictures of coelacanth don't look like the other, so this claim is clearly false.\n \n \nJust how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth?

So I'm sorry, produce a real scientific study which says this, and I'll concede, until then, I'll keep saying what I've been doing for this entire thread: \"The modern day Coelacanth and the fossil ones are completely different.\" Oh, and even if you can come up with a fossil that looks identical, that still leaves you with the genetic evidence, which makes it very clear they're different species.\n \n That's it for now. :)",

That certainly makes it clear to all that the modern fish are only vaguely similar to even the most similar fossil species. The one that you point out is Rhabdoderma elegans, a fossil from the Middle Pennsylvanian Epoch (Late Carboniferous Period).

That is why taxonomists have placed the modern species from the Family Latimeriidae and the genus Latimeria in a completely separate Family, the Rhabdodermatidae, with two genera, Caridosuctor, and Rhabdoderma. There are three species in the genus Rhabdoderma that I know about.\n \n Just because I know you'll want to see them, here's some pictures of actual fossils of R. elegans. Please apply your vast expertise and tell us what you observe here.\n \n But of course, it is clear from your posts that you are suggesting that the R. elegans is the ancestor of the modern species of coelacanth. I guess that it would be possible for those evolutionary changes to have taken place over 310 million years. Personally I doubt it.",

   "Thank's Archy, for adding that picture. That certainly makes it clear to all that the modern fish are only vaguely similar to even the most similar fossil species. The one that you point out is Rhabdoderma elegans, a fossil from the Middle Pennsylvanian Epoch (Late Carboniferous Period). That makes it about 310 million years old.\n \n But rather than try to imagine what the fossil would look like with flesh, why not show what the modern species would look like without it.\n http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2007/03/latimeria.jpg\n This image makes the differences in the jaw, skull, body, fins and tail quite evident. That is why taxonomists have placed the modern species from the Family Latimeriidae and the genus Latimeria in a completely separate Family, the Rhabdodermatidae, with two genera, Caridosuctor, and Rhabdoderma. There are three species in the genus Rhabdoderma that I know about.\n \n Just because I know you'll want to see them, here's some pictures of actual fossils of R. elegans. Please apply your vast expertise and tell us what you observe here.\n \n But of course, it is clear from your posts that you are suggesting that the R. elegans is the ancestor of the modern species of coelacanth. I guess that it would be possible for those evolutionary changes to have taken place over 310 million years. Personally I doubt it.\n\n \n Are you kidding me? You are making absolute claims about key differences based on evidence like this? http://www.fossilmall.com/EDCOPE_Enterprises/fish/fishfossils86/AW05D.jpg \n I can't distinguish fins or any fine detail at all from those photos. Coelacanth Fossil At least Huntards diagrams are clear and they show exact similarities. Although if his fossil sketch is based on the photo evidence you posted, then the question I have is how did Smith identify Latimeras sketch as a coelacanth at all?",

Are you saying that you didn't actually study any of the specimens or fossils? Are you also saying that you don't even have the expertise to examine fossils and discern its anatomy?

Please don't tell us that you weren't aware of the obvious differences between the two species, even when we look at simple line drawing representations.\n \n Oh, yeah. And as has been pointed out, Rhabdoderma elegans was about 95 mm. (3.7 in) long and was a shallow water fish. Examples of the modern species are up to 2 m. (78.7 in.) long and are only found in very deep water. So do you still cling to your claim that Rhabdoderma elegans is somehow ancestral to Latimeria chalumnae and L. menadoensis? Please support your assertion of that ancestry with actual evidence.",

Peeling said the original was around 15 inches long, and how do you explain that \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany.

   "What I'm telling you is that the sketches I posted were quotes from huntards link as evidence of how different they are.\nThen I misunderstood. Then we all agree that modern species are not identical to fossil species.\n \nI simply used his evidence to point out that the B) specimen is pretty much identical to the drawing of the living fish.\nBut it's not. What are you talking about? Just a little knowledge makes that quite clear. Huntards link was to P.Z. Myers' blog. P.Z. is an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota. He used that particular illustration to point out how different fossil coelacanths were from modern species. And yet, you think that they are identical if we only imagine image B) with flesh.\n \n The image actually comes from a book by Jenny Clack, and her point is the same as that of P.Z. Myers. Fossil coelacanths are significantly different from modern species. I would recommend Jenny Clack's book (Clack, Jennifer A. 2002. Gaining Ground: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods. Indiana University Press, Bloomington. 369 p.) except that it is quite technical. It requires an in depth knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of fish and early tetrapods, as well as knowledge of vertebrate anatomy and physiology, genetics, paleontology, and geology. I must admit that it was a difficult read for me (bones, bones, so many bones), and I am an evolutionary biologist (genetics, ecology, and wild life biology). I suspect that it may be a bit over your head, since you lack the education to understand.\n \nIf you have issues with Huntards evidence then take it up with him.\nI don't. His point was that fossil species were not identical to modern species. You disagree. I don't.\n \nAnd how great is that. Now you say the original was only 3.7 in long. Peeling said the original was around 15 inches long, and how do you explain that\nShould that have been a question? Was Peeling specifically referring to Rhabdoderma elegans? I gave you the link that specified the length of R. elegans as 3.7 inches long. Did I screw up the arithmetic? I can't find where Peeling said that the \"original\" was 15 inches long. What original? Was he discussing an average coelacanth rather than Rhabdoderma elegans?\n \n\"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany.

That is just more latter day evolutionary apologetics designed to allow deniability to cover all of the conclusions they made about it being an intermediary fish. It's called CYA when you've been caught passing imaginings off as facts.\nActually, only creationists claim that it was \"almost identical\" to any fossil species. The intent of that quote is to dupe the ignorant. Only creationists would equate \"so little change\" with \"identical.\" There are obvious and significant differences between any example of a fossil species of coelacanth and either of the two extant species. That is not to say that the modern species are not recognizable as coelacanths. But, in spite of the fact that J.L.B. Smith didn't mention size, modern species are much larger than any fossil species. They are also deep water fish. All fossil coelacanths (without exception) were shallow water fish.\n \n So please explain what you point is. Why is it so important to you that fossil coelacanths are the distant offspring of much larger offspring? How is it meaningful? How does your argument that modern coelacanths evolved from much smaller and significantly different ancestors somehow an argument against evolution and actually an argument in favor of the magical version proffered by muslim and christian creationists?",

   "Here's an interesting news story Yahoo is reporting on today. What's Old Is New: 12 Living Fossils | Wired Science from Wired.com Here is how the article describes these creatures. \"Known as living fossils, they lasted for millions of years with barely a change, even as their relatives went extinct or took different paths across the tree of life.\" \n \n And further down it refers to the coelacanth which is describes this way: \"Coelacanth vanished from the fossil record 410 million years ago &#8212; and then one was caught in 1938 off the coast of South Africa. A second species was discovered in Indonesian waters in 1999.\" Now notice that according to ACTUAL SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS, they clarify, after referring to the it vanishing from the fossil record 410 million years ago, that ONE WAS FOUND, AND THEN A SECOND SPECIES ALSO WAS DISCOVERED IN 1999. \n \n Unlike you, they make no attempt to separate the modern coelacanth from the fossil, which is kind of obvious I guess since they are referring to it and the others as living fossils. I will accept the opinions of scientists over apologists. \n \n Here's a video of it: YouTube - Indonesian coelacanth\n \n And just 2 questions for Pandion, how can you prove that the 400 million year old coelacanths were shallow water fish? And are they born fully grown, or come in one size only? If not, then why do you assume that the fossil record is of a fully grown mature fish and not of a newly born fish? Do you see the massive unprovable assumptions you are making based on its size by inferring that that is the maximum size they must have been? Probably you don't; but it had to be pointed out to you anyway.",

This is a principle I learned in the first grade. That the outcome of any problem is only as good as the info it is based upon.\n \n Yet you allegedly intelligent evo mooks just merrily go along never asking truly valid questions or question the contradictions as you blindly follow this pseudo science like a religion.

I mean, the lunacy of you and pandion calling me too ignorant to understand your answers when I obviously have a sufficient grasp of the subject to see the holes and ask the questions which you are unable to answer. Yet in your small mind, it is I who am ignorant.\n \n Here's the bottom line tq; these two belief systems are at total and complete odds with each other. They can't both be partially right. So one of us is being completely snowed in having faith in what we believe. My faith is in the Creator of all that is, and your faith lies in the creature, that his humanist interpretation is right which means that we came about randomly through various mutations which occurred by chance with no intelligent design at all. Those are the only two possible outcomes when all is said and done. \n \n So speak of arrogance and willful ignorance, it is you who is when you, as just a matter of fact, declare the other side wrong without ever seeing through our eyes as we have surely seen through yours before deciding that evolution is not only seriously flawed science, but false at every assumption and conclusion it is based upon. As I said above, if you must preface each and every conclusion with excuses and justifications in order to explain why the info you input to come to those conclusions doesn't quite add up as you intended them to, then your so called science is nothing more than junk science, and you are the ignorant one for believing it based on such flawed outcomes. \n \n Here's why you are as willfully ignorant as you accuse me of being. You insist that the fossil layers found within thousands of feet of diverse strata were laid gradually over hundreds of millions of years. All of your evo conclusions are based on that premise. But if as I say, the great deluge of Noah's flood happened as the bible states, then that accounts for the world wide layers of strata in which fish, mammals, birds and every other type of creatures are found side by side and on top of each other in only a 40 DAY period. You ignore that little fact as you attempt to categorize these deposits by time since one creature was found 6 inches or a foot below or above the one preceding it. \n \n It is beyond you to consider that IF THE FLOOD OCCURRED, due to the massive event which was taking place, that the bottom creature died just days before the one we found above it. That possibility would never enter your mind since you consider that possibility a myth. And what do you base that on??? You assume Radiometric Dating methods rely on assuming the rates of Decay has been a constant, that they start with no, or known daughter components, or was it an Isolated system with no external loss/addition of parent or daughter components? This is very unlikely over millions of years. Yet geologists use a standardized formula's for dating in which it is impossible to treat each rock or fossil as an individual based on its actual time, depth and location it was found in. \n \n Do you think it's smart to have a one size fits all formula for each element as they apply to different objects from different times, depths and conditions they are found at and within? Really tq? And you're calling me too ignorant to comprehend the issues for asking these questions? I submit that it is you arm chair scientists who are the ignorant ones for not asking them. So my friend,(figuratively speaking of course) it appears we are at a stand off in how we interpret the same available evidence. \n \n And since you know pandion so well, tell me his bio and qualifications in which scientific study that qualifies him to debate or understand this issue so well that he can't appreciate these inequities? Do you see now why I'm not impressed with any of you evos since none of you have the where with all to even question the problems within your so called science/religion?",

First of all, his is not faith, as it is based on evidence, faith being a believe in spite of evidence.

You ignore that little fact as you attempt to categorize these deposits by time since one creature was found 6 inches or a foot below or above the one preceding it.\n\n The fact it is ignored is because there is so much evidence suggesting the flood never happened, it would be foolish to include it in any theory. Here are 100 categories of evidence against the flood: EvC Forum: 100 Categories of Evidence Against Noah?s Flood\n All of these need to be accounted for to be able to allow the flood to have happened. And just to address the point ou made here, if the flood caused the fossils, they are absolutely sorted wrong, they would have to be mixed in with eachother, instead they are sorted exactly as evolutionary theory predicted, simpler life forms at the bottom, more complex life forms at the top.\n \n \nIt is beyond you to consider that IF THE FLOOD OCCURRED, due to the massive event which was taking place, that the bottom creature died just days before the one we found above it.\n\n That's because there is so much evidencde against the flood, it would be foolish to consider it.\n \n \nThat possibility would never enter your mind since you consider that possibility a myth. And what do you base that on???\n\n On the massive amount of evidencde that points to it never having happened.\n \n \nYou assume Radiometric Dating methods rely on assuming the rates of Decay has been a constant, that they start with no, or known daughter components, or was it an Isolated system with no external loss/addition of parent or daughter components?\n\n In fact, all radiometric dating methods agree with eachother with such accuracy, that they can't be anything but right.\n \n \nThis is very unlikely over millions of years. Yet geologists use a standardized formula's for dating in which it is impossible to treat each rock or fossil as an individual based on its actual time, depth and location it was found in.\n\n Here's an article on radiometric dating, I suggest you read it and learn from it.\n Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale\n \n \nDo you think it's smart to have a one size fits all formula for each element as they apply to different objects from different times, depths and conditions they are found at and within? Really tq?\n\n No. which is why that isn't done.\n \n \nAnd you're calling me too ignorant to comprehend the issues for asking these questions?\n\n Well, since you are wrong about that formula thingy, I'd say yes, you are ignorant of it.\n \n \nI submit that it is you arm chair scientists who are the ignorant ones for not asking them.\n\n We did ask them, and it turns out our questions were based on false assumptions, so we now know, and don't ask them anymore.\n \n \nSo my friend,(figuratively speaking of course) it appears we are at a stand off in how we interpret the same available evidence.\n\n No. you fit the evidence to your conclusion, we fit the conclusion to the evidence.\n \n \nDo you see now why I'm not impressed with any of you evos since none of you have the where with all to even question the problems within your so called science/religion?\n\n We allready asked, them, they were based on false assumptions, we learned from our mistakes, and now understand why they were false.

And this is the definition of irrational and delusional. \n \n So read from her original post http://www.4forums.com/political/report.php?p=339187 where she makes these accusations about me, then scroll down to the links and click on those links, and the posts which come up are her evidence against me, here's the accusation post: http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/12047-theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth-2.html#post339240 . I realize there is a huge disconnect regarding what she said and the evidence of what she posted regarding what I said, but don't think that's a problem seeing the correct post. It just reveals absolutely how twisted and disturbed little childs perspective is in her accusations against me. So don't feel guilty for missing the evidence she posted. Because you're seeing the evidence she posted. Thus, her disconnect with reality which she has proven with her own evidence, which I have been saying is obvious for a long time now.

Only people who have no concept of what the science is refers to it as radioactive dating. That's point# 1. \n \n #2, to reject sciences ability to interpret the results of radiometric dating methods in no way reflects on ones ability to trust or rely on the quality of the science which makes Nuclear power a safe and efficient form of energy. I have debated in favor of Nuclear energy on this forum as fervently as I have debated against the reliability of radiometric dating like millions of others do, and I've posted numerous links to evidence which opposes it. So to make this disagreement just about me as if I alone reject this unreliable process for dating objects is to once again show how dishonest you both are to use tunnel vision in categorizing me as a sole arbiter of these opinions.\n \n \nRead above. Those links deal with radioactivity and nuclear power. Either you accept the foundations for radiometric dating which entirely rely upon radioactivity or you reject both.\n \n \n Not at all. I reject the interpretations made based on rates of decay which are impossible to absolutely verify regarding the actual conditions of whatever is being tested which may very well vary due to when and in what conditions they were originally deposited. No absolute variables have been determined by science which can verify. Even the proponents use that fact as an explanation when they get unrealistic results. \n \n They also have preconceived notions before any testing is ever done as to what the outcome should be and they continue to run tests until they reflect the desired outcome. This doesn't describe science so much as attempting to create a scenario to confirm their preconceived notions, no matter how shoddy the science is.\n \n \nYOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE THE LIAR AND YOU JUST PROVED IT. THESE LINKS ARE ALL TO DEBATES WHERE I ARGUED AGAINST RADIOMETRIC AND CARBON 14 DATING METHODS WITH SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IN ALL OF THEM, I BELIEVE.

AND YOU POSTED THE LINKS SO NOW EVERYONE CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE DELUSIONAL SINCE NONE OF YOUR ACCUSATIONS ARE BASED IN REALITY AT ALL. THANKYOU FOR PROVING MY POINT SO CLEARLY AND CONCISELY.\n\n \n This statement perfectly defines the irrationality of your attempts to equate a widely held rejection of radiometric dating with not appreciating the value of and safety which Nuclear Energy represents today, or the principles upon which it is based.\n \n \nlol. That's largely due to your inability to understand the relationships between them. Like you said earlier, you asked how nuclear power is relevant to radiometric dating. As both rely upon the study of radioactivity and radiometric dating makes very few assumptions that fall outside of radioactivity, you are rejecting radioactivity. As you reject that, you reject atomic power which entirely relies upon the same assumptions.\n \n \n The bolded statement reflects you ignorance because the application of the two processes seek totally different results for the same radioactive material. One uses fissionable material to create energy while the other attempts to apply rates of decay in order to date objects. For you to claim they are comparable processes just reveals your ignorance, not mine.\n \n \nGood luck proving any of them are lies.

   "Here is day two of the class on exposing the twisted dishonesty of how the little child debates as a SOP for her. \n\n \n Wow. You are dense. You called me a girl. I then called you dense. You still call me a girl. You wonder why we think you're an #####? \n \n \n In the first post you showed that your representations of what I represent is delusional, and now you want to affirm it with additional evidence. That is the definition of being dense. Here is what her original slanderous accusation against me was yesterday: \n\n \n And it is in fact proven today by your numerous insults to people who disagree with you. \n \n \nPoint made!\n\n \n Thank you. You do in fact call everyone who disagrees with you soulless, lost, atheist who you implicitly threaten will burn in hell.\n \n \nYou even admit that I never directly condemn anyone, yet you insist on accusing me of condemning people.\n\n \n Incorrect. You never explicit do so. You have many examples however of threats of implicit hell. \n \n \"You'll learn how wrong you are at the end and you'll regret it\" is a threat of Hell whether you want to admit it or not. \n \n in fact I'm just one of the few people who have pointed out that you rely or used to rely heavily upon threats. One of the quotes I provided has you futily trying to argue that you weren't making a threat but a promise (as if you understand the difference). \n \n \nTo a rational mind it will explain my position perfectly and will also show why I'm condemned for sharing my faith by this hypocrite.\n\n \n You mean us, who think you use threats like you change underwear? \n \n You are not rational. \n \n \nAnd I invite all observers to follow the thread to see how I am attacked and excoriated by multiple posters even though I did the only right thing and admitted my error. And even now, almost a year later this philosophical coward continues to use this against me as a weapon to attack me rather than to have graciously accepted my confession of making a mistake by misinterpreting what type of creatures we were discussing.\n\n \n See T.Q's post for why you are, as always wrong. \n \n You never retracted your statement. Never. Which proves your statement about me being a liar to be false, which would make you wrong. But your constantly wrongness is not news to anyone. \n \n \nActually, it's you and tq who are still lying about me in order to condemn what I represent. To imply that anything I said equates math to equaling atheism is just so infantile and irrational as to belie reason which once again confirms that you are truly delusional in your hatred for anything I say which opposes your shallow world view.\n\n \n Let's see. I gave a through logical explanation for why you argued that math = atheism [b]and all you can respond to is with flaming. No response to the logic. No response to what you actually said. You just flame. Sad. Personal attacks are all you have. \n \n You responded to a post criticizing you for your inability to do math. You then attack back by citing an atheist world view. Like I said, you won't respond, you can't respond and you don't have the brains to respond. \n \n We're lying, but you can't refute anything we say?\n \n lol. \n \n \nNothing here deserves a response as I proved you wrong above. You can repeat your drivel for ever but that wont change the fact that even the USSR never denied that the Communist Party was the ruling party for 70 years, and that according to every Country and pundit on Earth the USSR was a Communist Country.\n\n \n Care to cite these pundits explaining what Communism is? \n \n You really have no idea who Marx was do you?\n \n And your entire argument is appeal to authority. Fallacies and lies. All you have. \n \n Explain to me how a class society run by dictators with capitalism is Communism. \n \n \nI have debated in favor of Nuclear energy on this forum as fervently as I have debated against the reliability of radiometric dating like millions of others do, and I've posted numerous links to evidence which opposes it. So to make this disagreement just about me as if I alone reject this unreliable process for dating objects is to once again show how dishonest you both are to use tunnel vision in categorizing me as a sole arbiter of these opinions.\n\n \n lol. That's again due to your massive ignorance in understanding how radioactivity actually works. You reject the dating based on the same principles yet use the power based on the same principles. It makes no sense, but no one ever said your belief systems were consistent or even sensical.\n \n You don't understand the most basics of relationships. \n \n \nNot at all. I reject the interpretations made based on rates of decay which are impossible to absolutely verify regarding the actual conditions of whatever is being tested which may very well vary due to when and in what conditions they were originally deposited.\n\n \n The same principles that underly nuclear power.\n \n Oh wait. You're not going to deal with that because 1) you don't understand the principles and 2) you have no idea what you are talking about. \n \n \nThey also have preconceived notions before any testing is ever done as to what the outcome should be and they continue to run tests until they reflect the desired outcome. This doesn't describe science so much as attempting to create a scenario to confirm their preconceived notions, no matter how shoddy the science is\n\n \n If only you had proof of this. And your arguments against dating are often reliant upon non-cogentic samples, more proof you have absolutely no understanding of the topics.\n \n \nThis statement perfectly defines the irrationality of your attempts to equate a widely held rejection of radiometric dating with not appreciating the value of and safety which Nuclear Energy represents today, or the principles upon which it is based.\n\n \n Lol. HOW? \n \n \nI did, with your help by showing how you misrepresent everything I say in the very quotes you posted.\n\n \n Except that you did no such thing, cited no such quotes and essentially reinforced to everyone that you are a fundamental joke.",

   "Blah, blah, blah... swallow some evidence and choke on your lies and bogus interpretation ot actual real world history.\n The Collapse of Communism\n Editor: Lee Edwards \n ISBN: 978-0-8179-9812-7 \n Pub Date: November 10, 1999 \n Product Format: Paper \n Availability: In stock. \n Price: $18.95\n Qty: \n Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth century&#8212;why did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism.\n \n Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was right&#8212;and wrong&#8212;about Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forces&#8212;political, economic, strategic, and religious&#8212;along with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism.The Collapse of Communism\n I \n INTRODUCTION\n Printer-friendly version of section\n Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991.\n \n II \n CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM\n Printer-friendly version of section\n The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule.\n \n By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more.\n \n There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).Communism, Collapse of - MSN Encarta\n Former Communist Countries\n \n Albania\n Bulgaria\n Czechoslovakia\n East Germany\n Hungary\n Mongolia\n Poland\n Romania\n U.S.S.R\n Yugoslavia\n \n Former Communist Countries\n \n Museum of Communism\"Never again.\" The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention.\n It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery.\n \n The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement.Museum of Communism\n \n Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you. In other words, spew your garbage to the world at large and stop preaching your historical lies to me.",

So wallow in your denial. Don't you get it that I don't care how wrong you choose to be?\n\n \n LOL. The problem with historical 'reality' is that has no meaning. In trying to argue that the so called Communist nations practiced Communism, Communism comes to mean Capitalism, Dictatorships and Class Society with collectivization, atheism yet Christanity (and Buddhism) at the same time, wishy washy free trade yet adamantly hateful to the free trade world, and unequal application of resources while praising egalitarianism. The historical application has virtually no meaning as those who claimed themselves to be Communists have tried a great many methods and ideas. The historical \"reality\" is a contradictions of nonsense. If we use what is historical we have Communism representing two sides of the spectrum. Hence why it is fundamentally useless as a term for anything more then what Jo Bennet described: a villianization of the West's enemies. \n \n Since the historical reality of Communism has included full scale democracy, capitalism and unequal application of resources as well as class societies, by your own definition, the West is Communist.\n \n There is a reason all of us have been hitting you on this asinine argument. You are attempting to use a term that has effectively no meaning. If you do not look at it through Marx, Communism can mean whatever you want it to mean.\n \n \nJust stop claiming that this is something only I believe because I have posted links to hundreds of thousands of links, all which confirm that history has recorded that the USSR was a Communist regime which was based on the principles of Marx's communist manifesto.\n\n \n Incorrect. You have refused to state otherwise. You have refused over 20 times to simply admit that the USSR failed Marx's basic criteria. Therefore since you are so damn adamant about simply NOT answering, there's not much to conclude other then you do believe the true insane. And all you have posted is that people use the villanization term of Communism. Nothing you've posted actually shows that the USSR was Communist. \n \n \nI never said it was based on all of them, nor did I say that it was a perfect reflection of the manifesto. But it was based on it and the USSR was a communist political system according to every historical reference available.\n\n \n Clearly, you have ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what Communism is. How could the USSR have reflected the Manifesto when it failed virtually everything outside of collectivization that Marx wrote about in the Manifesto? How could the USSR be even a passable reflection when it had classes, communism, trade with the West, elites, unequal allocation of resources and no power in the hands of the worker? \n \n The USSR FAILED HORRIBLY to even come close to what Marx wrote. Your massive, unending ignorance to even understand the most basic parts of Communism is why you keep trying to argue the idiotic argument that a class society, run by dictators, trading with the west and practicing capitalism is Communist. \n \n You wonder why we all think you're stupid? It ain't hard to figure out. \n \n \nI'm through defending a long accepted and proven historical point which you're obviously too thick to comprehend.\n\n \n By whom? Everyone here agrees with me.

In fact, the teachings were greatly distorted by later followers like Calvin, who concentrated on wealth rather than sacrifice and good work.\n\n \n I actually agree with you that the policy of the 1st century church in Jerusalem to pool all their money, land and other earthly holdings into a common fund to be distributed to those in need, which was operated in a Godly and honest method without the leaders enriching themselves personally with the perceived excess funds, which has been the great flaw in every other attempt to institute true communism through out history. \n \n But here's the rub pandion, it failed miserably in practical application. If you do a study of the early church, specifically in the book of Acts, you will find that the churches around the region which didn't follow the practices of the church in Jerusalem, (and were never excoriated or criticized for that, mind you,) but they took regular offerings and sent the proceeds to support the Jerusalem church which was bankrupt and in great need of support just to keep it alive. \n \n This is why the practice was ended. It never lasted past the first 20 years of the first century apostolic church, much less having been affected or impacted by the teachings of Calvin, a 16th century lawyer/protestant reformer. But if you want to be technical regarding Calvin, one of his great desires was to get the church back to living according to the original apostolic church which was closest to Jesus prior to His crucifixion. So to imply that Calvin would have opposed early church practices and traditions isn't fair to what he represented at all.",
