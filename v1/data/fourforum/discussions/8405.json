Whether you want to call it a child, adult, unborn, it, blob...doesn't really matter because it is still a human.\n \n Since when did you go pro-choice on us?\nI don't know that I have. Here's what I currently believe about conception and killing the concieved:\n \n Life begins at conception. I think to argue otherwise is impossible if the definition of life extends to amoeba (which is does). The mass of cells that develops shortly after the sperm enters the egg is definitely alive. The cells continue to reproduce until a complicated arrangement of different type of cells shapes the living blob into successive forms of recognizable stages, eventually becoming a human baby. At various stages along the way, the essential working parts are developed within this little animal mass. It develops a nervous system, a brain, a heart, two lungs, two kidneys, a pancreas, a liver, a set or two of lips, two eyes, a bunch of fingers and toes, a nose, a hank of hair and some pieces bone to make a walkin', talkin' honeycomb!\n \n If that mass of cells was the product of rape or incest or if the health of the mother is severely threatened by the presence of the mass, I say it is not only okay but it is preferrable that the mass be removed from the mother's body and laid to rest in a charcoal fire. This should happen only during the first trimester of the pregnancy.\n \n If the mass was a result of stupidity on the part of a young receptacle, the same option should be available.\n \n If the mass was a result of an accident on the part of an older stupid receptacle or a slick-willy-lying sperm donor causing the developing mass to be subject to being unwanted as a parasite in an otherwise perfect womb, then the receptacle should have the choice of termination as in the above.\n \n If the pregnacy has progressed into the second trimester, there should be no abortion aside from a newly developed medical threat to the mother's life or a verified discovery that the child will be so severely misformed that meaningful life on earth will not occur. This should be the choice of the vessel.\n \n Late term abortion just because the expectant mother changes her mind is murder.

I've said many times that sex is NOT JUST for procreation. Either you are being dishonest or have not retained this information. \n\n \n No, I believe I received the correct message when I read your post. I've made reading mistakes before, but I don't think I did this time.\n \n \nI said, \"You have alot to learn about sex, young man!\" and this was in response to your comment that women \"release\" their bodies over to their boyfriends for their boyfriends sexual satisfaction. Indeed, if this is your sentiment, then you do have a lot to learn about sex. Wouldn't you agree? \n\n \n You're doing it again. I am referring to YOUR PARTICULAR SCENARIO that you said I either misread or read it in a way I wanted. I know girls don't normally just hand themselves over to their boyfriends whenever.\n \n And now I'm signing off for the night.",

   "And you weren't talking about money or food, you were speaking in regard to sexual satisfaction. Correct me if I missed your point, but you could have made that 10X clearer in your previous post.\n\n \n Consider yourself corrected. I popped in with a single statement a few posts back that in the mother/fetus relationship the mother is more important - AND SHE IS. I was not talking about sex at all until my last post.\n \n \n \nAt least the baby will have a chance.\n\n \n No it won't. The mother needs to be well for the pregnancy to succeed.\n \n \n \nIf you think otherwise, then good for you. I was speaking to Bell there, so if you don't think that way, then you don't need to complain.\n\n \n I am not complaining - just refuting your assumption.",
