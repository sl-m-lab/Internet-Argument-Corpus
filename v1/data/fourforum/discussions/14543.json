   "Gun laws can&rsquo;t disarm negligent parenting - BostonHerald.com\n \n \nMayor Menino, who are you going to blame now?\n \n When 8-year-old Liquarry Jefferson was shot and killed by his 7-year-old cousin, Mayor Tom Menino went to their Dorchester home and \"offered support to both families,\" as he told the press.\n \n And why wouldn't he? He certainly didn't think it was the mother's fault that the two boys and Liquarry's 2-year-old half-sister were upstairs playing with a pistol - unattended - at 11 p.m.\n \n Instead, Menino claimed the National Rifle Association was partially to blame. \"Why is that gun in the house?\" Menino asked. Because the NRA opposed tougher gun control laws, that's why, he concluded.\n \n Fast forward three years after that terrible accident. Liquarry's mom, Lakeisha Gadson, was on trial for violating some of the gun control laws that the NRA somehow let slip through the legislative process. Gadson was charged with unlawful possession of a gun and the improper storage of same, as well as the charges of child endangerment and involuntary manslaughter.\n \n Charged - and acquitted. The jury exonerated Gadson of any responsibility for the death of her son. (She was convicted only of misleading the police after the fact, by lying about the circumstances of the shooting).\n \n So now what?\n \n You wanted gun laws, Mayor Menino? You got 'em. An illegal gun was in the house. The gun was brought there by a teenager already busted for illegal gun possession. A gun was left out for little kids to play with. A mom was in the house with no idea what the kids are up to. One kid ends up dead.\n \n You hardly need the cast of CSI-Dorchester to find the crimes here.\n \n And to the Suffolk district attorney's credit, they brought the case to trial. Yes, it's true that Gadson suffered a tragic loss in the death of her son. It's also true that his death would never have happened without her negligent - in my opinion, criminally negligent - behavior. Justice demands that she be held accountable.\n \n Unfortunately, the job of holding her accountable was left to \"a jury of her peers.\" And now Gadson will go unpunished.\n \n I've heard a lot of apologists for Gadson in the past 24 hours defending her by claiming the prosecutor never proved she knew her gun-toting teen brought the pistol into the house. But imagine your son had been busted for gun possession. Would he be able to get away with casually leaving another illegal gun in his underwear drawer at your house? Or would you be digging through his stuff every day to keep him in line?\n \n It's not the NRA's fault that Lakeisha Gadson refused to do her most basic duties as a mom. No amount of gun control laws can change the child-endangering circumstances inside that crime scene of a home, with a mom with a record and five kids from four different fathers, all of whom were in prison at the time.\n \n And if Suffolk County juries let defendants like Gadson walk, what possible difference can new laws make?\n",
