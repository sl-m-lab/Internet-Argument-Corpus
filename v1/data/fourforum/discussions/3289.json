The problem was it was followed with a \"but\". But  they have to ride in the back of the bus, and they can only go the \"Negro\" school. That was not equality. People used the same argument you are using now, you have the same rights, BUT..... No honey, We don't and we will fight till we do! \n \n It is not just a document that gays are looking for, there are 1049 rights most heterosexuals take for granted if they are even aware of all of them. Everything from taxes to social security to visitation rights in hospitals and nursing homes. Next of kinship is the big one. As I said before..how can you tell a couple who have lived together as a couple for 20 years they are strangers in the eyes of the law? When married couples are considered next of kin. In many cases there are children invovled in these families. Isn't it sad that a kid has to ask his parents why they are married and the reply is we are not allowed. that is wrong!",
