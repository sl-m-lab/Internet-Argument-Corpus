   "\"The concept of a '\"Personal God\" interfering with natural events, or being \"an independent cause of natural events,\" makes God a natural object besides others, an object among others, a being among beings, maybe the highest, but nevertheless a being. This indeed is not only the destruction of the physical system but even more the destruction of any meaningful idea of God . . . . The concept of a \"Personal God\" is a symbol, not an object, and it never should be interpreted as an object. And it is one symbol beside others indicating that our personal center is grasped by the manifestation of the inaccessible ground and abyss of being.\" -- Paul Tillich\n \n \"We must ask where the inherent strength of religious doctrines lies and the circumstances that give rise to them, apart from all reason. Religious doctrines are not the residue of experience or the final result of reflection. They are illusions, fulfillments of the oldest, strongest and most insistent wishes of mankind. The secret of their strength is the strength of these wishes.\" -- Sigmund Freud\n \n Religion is based mainly upon fear. Science can teach us, and I think our own hearts can teach, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a fit place to live in. -- Bertrand Russell\n \n \"There is something nearer to us than Scriptures, the Word in the heart from which all Scriptures come.\" -- William Penn\n \n \"The essence of Christianity is not sterile doctrine, but the application of Biblical principles into a caring relationship with all those with whom we come in contact with on a daily basis.\" -- Norman Vincent Peale\n \n \"The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reasons and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms- It is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\" -- Albert Einstein\n \n I love you, my brother, whoever you are. I love you as you pray in your mosque, as you practice your devotions in church, or worship in your temple.. For you and I are the children of one single religion: Faith.\" -- Kahlil Gibran\n \n \"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters, compared to what lies within us.\" -- Ralph Waldo Emerson\n \n \"In Choosing your God, you choose your way of looking at the universe. There are plenty of Gods. Choose yours. The god you worship is the god you deserve. . . . God is not an illusion, but a symbol pointing beyond itself to the realization of the mystery of at-one-ment.\" -- Joseph Campbell\n \n \"One day the Gestapo hanged a child. Even the SS were disturbed by the prospect of hanging a young boy in front of thousands of spectators. the child who, Wiesel recalled had the face of a 'sad-eyed angel,\" was silent, lividly pale and almost calm as he ascended the gallows. Behind Wiesel, one of the other prisoners asked: \"Where is God? Where is He?\" It took the child half an hour to die, while the prisoners were forced to look him in the face. The same man asked again: :\"Where is God now?\" And Wiesel heard a voice within him make this answer: \"Where is He? Here He is - He is hanging here on the gallows.\" \n \n Black Elk, Shaman of the Oglala Sioux, often fell to all fours to play with toddlers. \"We have much in common,\" he said. \"They have just come from the Great Mysterious and I am about to return to it.\"\n \n \"The politics of those whose goal is beyond time, beyond scripture, (beyond theism) are always those who reject the use of force; it is the idolaters of past and future, idolaters of words, concepts and scripture, of conservative memory and Utopian dream, who do the persecuting and make the wars.\" -- Aldous Huxley\n \n \"Oh yes, I went to the white man's schools. I learned to read from school books, newspapers, and the Bible. But in time I found that these were not enough. Civilized people depend too much on man-made printed pages. I turn to the Great Spirit's book which is the whole of creation. You can read a big part of that book if you study nature. You know, if you take all your books, lay them out under the sun, and let the snow and rain and insects work on them for a while, there will be nothing left. But the Great Spirit has provided you and me with an opportunity to study in nature's university - the forests, the rivers, the mountains and the animals which include us.\" -- Walking Buffalo\n \n \"Man cannot conceive the meaning of thunder, hurricane, storm, the order of the universe, his very own nature, how then can he boast of being able to understand God and confine Him in the thoughts, concepts and words of men.\" -- Mishna\n \n \"I am He whom I love, and He whom I love is I: We are two spirits dwelling in one body. If you see me, you see Him. And if you see Him, then you see both. I have seen my Lord with the eye of my heart, and I said: \"Who are You?\" He said: \"You.\" -- Al-Hallah\n \n \"What is to be said of the healing miracles in the Gospels? It must be the fact that they are not eyewitness reports, not scientifically tested documentation, not historical, medical or psychological records. They are simply unsophisticated popular narratives which are meant to call forth admiring belief. As such they are wholly at the service of the proclamation of Christ. . . There is no need at all either to accept all miracle stories in an uncritical, fundamentalist spirit as historical facts, and, regardless of contradictions, to \"believe\" in them, or on the other hand, in a spirit of narrow-minded rationalism to refuse to take any miracle stories seriously.\" -- Hans Kung\n \n \"I have learned that the Gospels are neither divine documents nor straightforward historical records. They are not divine products inspired directly from God. . . Nor are they eyewitness accounts . . Rather, the gospels represent the developing tradition of the early Christian movement . . . Written in the last third of the first century, they contain the accumulated traditions of early Christian communities and were put into their present forms by second (or even third) generation authors.\" -- Marcus Borg\n \n \"Those that say, we must 'Like it or lump it' - to the doctrines of the virgin birth, the Trinity, or anything else - that we must swallow all these teachings as part of the whole of Christianity, or accept nothing at all, is simply not biblical, as there are degrees of knowledge and significance.\" -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n \n \"My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness. We can live without religion, but we cannot survive without human affection. Whether one believes in a religion or not, and whether one believes in rebirth or not, there isn't anyone who doesn't know the supreme value of kindness and compassion.\" -- Dalai Lama\n \n \"I subscribe to the belief or the philosophy that all life in its essence is one, and that humans are working consciously or unconsciously towards the realization of that identity. . . God is that indefinable something which we all feel but which we do not know. To me God is Truth and Love. God is ethics and morality. God is fearlessness. God is the source of light and life and yet He is above and beyond all these. God is conscience. He is even the atheism of the atheist. He transcends speech and reason.\" -- Mohandas K. Gandhi\n \n Belief, in the end, creates formulas and fixed patterns for living. It provides us with ready responses to whatever situation may arise. Thus we are never free to act in the fullness of any moment. Life is infinite and its unfolding; it cannot be met with formulas and scripts. Belief is a tether that keeps us forever in the tiny circle of our vanities. -- John McAfee\n \n \"Religion is like a raft, once you get across the river, moor the raft and go on. Don't lug it with you if you don't need it anymore. It's part of all the great religions that we become most fully ourselves when we give ourselves away. But not many of us really want to do that. However much the self makes us miserable, it is the self we know, and we're not quite so ready to go out of it. Unlike the East, intolerance is more a failing of monotheists. There's an endless temptation to use religion to back our own prejudices, especially with a personalized God. The Crusaders who went into battle crying, \"God wills it!\" when they killed Jews and Muslims were simply projecting their own loathing and fear onto an imaginary being, giving their horrible notions a sacred endorsement. To distinguish good religions from the bad, compassion is the key. That's the test, always. All of them say that. Think of Hillel and the Golden Rule, Jesus and his version of the Golden Rule.\" -- Karen Armstrong\n \n \"Christianity begins with revelation. It would be misleading to classify this revelation simply as a \"doctrine\" and \"explanation\" for it is far more than that - the revelation of God Himself is in the mystery of Christ. It is nevertheless communicated in words, in statements, creating the problem of everything depending on the believer's accepting the truth of these statements, profoundly concerned with the accuracy of their transmission from the original sources and precise understanding of their exact meaning with condemnation of false interpretations to almost the point of a obsession and fanatical insistence on hairsplitting distinctions. This obsession with doctrinal formulas, juridical order and ritual exactitude has removed the heart of Christianity, the living experience of which far transcends all conceptual formulations.\" -- Thomas Merton\n \n \"I don't think of all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains. This is one of the things that Mummy and I are so entirely different about. Her counsel when one feels melancholy is: 'Think of all the misery in the world and be thankful you are not sharing in it!' My advise is: 'Go outside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out and try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beauty that's still left in and around you and be happy!' I don't see how Mummy's idea can be right, because then how are you supposed to behave if you go through the misery yourself? Then you are lost. On the contrary, I've found that there is always some beauty in life - in nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself: these can all help you. Look at these things, then you find yourself again, and God, and then you regain your balance.\" -- Anne Frank",
