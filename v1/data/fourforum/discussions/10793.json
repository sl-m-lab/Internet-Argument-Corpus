I am incapable of believing that 2+2=5 if I already believe that 2+2=4 unless I have reason to believe that this is true. \"Reason to believe\" does not include arguments from consequence: Nobody will believe that they have the ability to fly merely because the consequence of the ability to fly has the potential for great fun.\n Unfortunately, it is true that people really do delude themselves into believing what they want to believe instead of what they should believe based on evidence.\n \n A very closely related flaw is that PW makes truth immaterial to determining belief.\n \n PW does not apply proper probabilities to the possibilities.\n \n PW does not explore the aspect of which god. Even Homer Simpson found this flaw. It works for Ahuramazda of Zoroastrianism just as well as it works for YHWH/Jehovah.\n \n The assumption that nothing is lost when a nonexistent God is believed to exist is false. It saddens me that smart, kind people sometimes spend so much time, effort, and money on what amounts to superstition and has little effect, when those resources could be put toward something that has a much greater impact.\n \n If God really exists and knows who truly believes in Him, He will know who believes in him based on their genuine beliefs and who \"believes\" in him based on some ridiculously erroneous application of game theory.",

   "There are countless problems with Pascal's Wager.\n \n The one I always strive to point out is that one cannot change a belief based merely on a desire to change belief. I am incapable of believing that 2+2=5 if I already believe that 2+2=4 unless I have reason to believe that this is true. \"Reason to believe\" does not include arguments from consequence: Nobody will believe that they have the ability to fly merely because the consequence of the ability to fly has the potential for great fun.\n Unfortunately, it is true that people really do delude themselves into believing what they want to believe instead of what they should believe based on evidence.\n \n A very closely related flaw is that PW makes truth immaterial to determining belief.\n \n PW does not apply proper probabilities to the possibilities.\n \n PW does not explore the aspect of which god. Even Homer Simpson found this flaw. It works for Ahuramazda of Zoroastrianism just as well as it works for YHWH/Jehovah.\n \n The assumption that nothing is lost when a nonexistent God is believed to exist is false. It saddens me that smart, kind people sometimes spend so much time, effort, and money on what amounts to superstition and has little effect, when those resources could be put toward something that has a much greater impact.\n \n If God really exists and knows who truly believes in Him, He will know who believes in him based on their genuine beliefs and who \"believes\" in him based on some ridiculously erroneous application of game theory.\n\n \n I believe this is the true flaw in Pascal's argument. One cannot will oneself to believe something because the consequences of doing so seem like a better deal. \n \n Like electrolyte, Sam Harris is more articultate on this topic than me:\n \nReason is a compulsion, not a choice. Just as one cannot intentionally startle oneself, one cannot knowingly believe a proposition on bad evidence. If you doubt this, imagine hearing the following account of a failed New Year's resolution: \n \n \"This year, I vowed to be more rational, but by the end of January, I found that I had fallen back into my old ways, believing things for bad reasons. Currently, I believe that smoking is harmless, that my dead brother will return to life in the near future, and that I am destined to marry Angelina Jolie, just because these beliefs make me feel good and give my life meaning.\"\n \n This is not how our minds work. To believe a proposition, we must also believe that we believe it because it is true. While lapses in rationality can often be detected in retrospect, they always occur in the dark, outside of consciousness. In every present moment, a belief entails the concurrent conviction that we are not just fooling ourselves.\n \n",

   " As you stated, they believe they are correct, that they have made the correct choice looking at the evidence before them.\n\n No, that's not what I said at all. They didn't make their decision based on evidence, they made their decision based on faith. Faith is what you use to decide when you have no evidence, get it?\n \n \n\n But what they have failed to account for are the unknown Gods. Their ignorance of these Gods is apparent in their belief they have made the absolute correct choice. They ignorant of their own ignorance. \n\n That's an invalid assumption. And, in fact, almost certainly wrong in many cases. As I said before, almost any religious person today knows about other religions, they know that many of them say that if you don't choose their religion you'll end up in hell. They're not ignorant at all, they simply choose to make a choice despite the fact that there are no clear guidelines. Again, it's that faith thing.",

I was a good looking 22 year old guy with a girl friend; I worked in a multi-million dollar family business. I drove a company paid car, that was insured by the company, with a corporate credit card and money in the bank. The week before I met my girlfriend at Jesus 75 in Pa, I vacationed in Atlantic City just because I felt like I wanted a break to get a tan, before then hitting the 4 day outdoor concert with 30,000+ people where I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior after seeing miracles first hand and experiencing Gods presence within me first hand. I had no stress in my life, no upheaval, no mental break with reality, no desire to escape my life as it was at all. In fact if I judge it objectively, my life became a lot more complicated after accepting the Lord as it didn't go over very well with my moslem father whom I also worked for. \n \n Only 30,000 people in the same place worshiping the same God and experiencing the same unconditional love that weekend. Oh yeah, and I personally watched it stop raining as we held hands and prayed for it to stop after raining constantly for 2 days straight. Before the prayer ended, the rain stopped and the sky cleared, and the sun came out. Maybe you, who weren't even there can explain that, but I witnessed it first hand, and if it was by coincidence, it was split second planning on someone's part. So I can only find one explanation for it. Goddidit as you atheists like to say. So please don't categorize born again believers as if we are so many mental patients who somehow evaded commitment in a mental hospital because we just got lucky.",

How can someone make an good choice with no clear guidelines?\n\n \n Well, given that we have established Gods with contradictory instructions for getting into heaven the possible existence of other Gods doesn't really change the situation much. Likewise, since we have serveral religions that say you must follow them or be damned making a choice is no riskier than making no choice. In all of these scenarios you're faced with making a choice, including choosing not to choose, knowing that the wrong choice could have consequences but having no means to determine which is the right choice.\n \n Theologicaly what your argument suggests to me is that if God exists and is good, then he doesn't care about how or even if he is worshipped. No just being would damn people for eterenity without giving clear and explicit instructions on how to avoid such a fate. Those that would claim that God has given clear instructions, but that everyone but them are too dense to understand them, are clearly missing the point.",
