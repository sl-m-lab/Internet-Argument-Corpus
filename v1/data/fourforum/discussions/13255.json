Also, very close ties to the bin Laden family of notable terrorist Osama bin Laden.\n\n \n Wow!emoticon_wow Keep drinking the LSD-laced Kool-aid there, Simone. \n \n\n Prescott Bush's Alleged Nazi \"Ties\" \n Posted: December 16, 2003\n Rumors about the alleged Nazi \"ties\" of the late Prescott Bush, the grandfather of President George W. Bush, have circulated widely through the Internet in recent years. These charges are untenable and politically motivated. \n \n Despite some early financial dealings between Prescott Bush and a Nazi industrialist named Fritz Thyssen (who was arrested by the Nazi regime in 1938 and imprisoned during the war), Prescott Bush was neither a Nazi nor a Nazi sympathizer. \n Prescott Bush's Alleged Nazi \"Ties\"\n\n \n If there was ever a more jaundiced/anti-Nazi organization than ADL, I'm not aware of it. If they say there was no link, I believe them. \n \n As for the bin laden claim:\n \n\n Craig Unger has been a fierce critic of Bush's Saudi connections, and has probably done more research into this area than anyone, but here's what he wrote on the supposed bin Laden links in \"House of Bush, House of Saud\": \n \n \n \"Closely tied as they were to both the royal family and the United States, at this point the bin Ladens had only indirect connections to the Bush family and its allies. James Bath, the American business representative of Salem bin Laden, knew both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. Khalid bin Mahfouz, who was close to both the bin Ladens and the royal family, had helped finance the Houston skyscraper for the Texas Commerce Bank, in which James Baker had a significant stake. He also had ties to Bath. \n But these Bush-bin Laden \"relationships\" were indirect - two degrees of separation, perhaps - and at times have been overstated. Critics have asserted that money may have gone from Khalid bin Mahfouz and Salem bin Laden through James Bath into Arbusto Energy, the oil company started by George W. Bush, but no evidence has ever been found to back up that charge, which appears to be unfounded. \n \n [A footnote adds] Bath had fronted for Saudi billionaires Salem bin Laden and Khaled bin Mahfouz on other deals, but in this case he says \"One hundred percent of those funds were mine. It was a purely personal investment.\" Bin Laden and bin Mahfouz, he insists, had nothing to do with either the elder George Bush or his son. \"They never met Bush,\" Bath says. \"Ever. And there was no reason to. At that point Bush was a young guy just out of Yale, a struggling entrepreneur trying to get a drilling fund.\"\n Bush-bin Laden family links - 911myths \n",
