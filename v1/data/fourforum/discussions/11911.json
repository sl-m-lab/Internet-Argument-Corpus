   "Interviews with numerous legal experts suggest that Colorado US Attorney Troy Eid misled reporters and diverged from state law when declining to prosecute any of the three men arrested in Denver for threatening to assassinate Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.\n \n Eid, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006, declined to prosecute the three men on charges of threatening to assassinate Barack Obama during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, saying that the suspects were \"just a bunch of meth heads\" and their words failed to meet the legal standard for \"true threat.\"\n \n \"When you talk about threatening presidential candidates, there's a legal standard you got to meet,\" Eid told reporters. \"It's got to be a credible threat as defined by the law. And that means that someone has a way to carry it out. And at this time we don't have sufficient evidence that there was a true threat.\"\n \n He added, \"They didn't reveal a plan\" and characterized the alleged threats and assassination plot as merely \"the racist rantings of drug users\" and \"one meth head talking to another about life.\"\n \n But multiple legal experts interviewed by RAW STORY -- including criminal and constitutional law scholars, former Assistant US Attorneys and Denver-area defense lawyers also familiar with Colorado state law -- agreed that voluntary intoxication is not exculpatory and that such a claim, especially for a prosecutor, is unorthodox. While it may be presented in an effort to reduce a sentence after a conviction, experts say it is normally the domain of defense counsel.\n \n \"It's very unusual,\" says Scott Horton, a Columbia Law School professor who also writes for Harper's Magazine. \"Basically, you have a US Attorney trotting out the sort of arguments that defense counsel makes on a plea for reduced sentencing.\"\n \n Legal experts say that Eid's definition of true threat directly conflicts with the statute covering threats to presidential candidates, 18 U.S.C. 879, which defines the threat as \"whoever knowingly and willfully threatens to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon a major candidate for the office of President or Vice President, or a member of the immediate family of such candidate.\"\n \n While noting the statute must be weighed against First Amendment rights, they argued that because voluntary intoxication is not a viable defense the First Amendment does not protect a speaker's threatening speech.\n \n George Fisher, Stanford Law Professor and one of the nation's top scholars of criminal law and evidence, explained, \"Certainly when there's a state of mind requirement in a crime, 'knowingly,' for example, you could say as a logical matter that somebody can't do something knowingly while under the influence. But there are these other laws, sometimes in the form of statutes and sometimes in the form of case law, that will say, 'But voluntary intoxication is no defense.' And the Supreme Court many years ago upheld those laws as not being a violation of due process.\"\n \n Colorado defense attorneys agreed. They said Colorado state law does not differ from the Supreme Court's ruling on voluntary intoxication.\n \n Thus, legal experts agreed that a verbal threat alone, intended by the speaker to be taken seriously, and said willfully and knowingly, is all that is necessary to satisfy the legal requirement for true threat. Contrary to what Eid told the press, a prosecutor in this case would not have to prove a plan existed or the viability of any such plan, only that a threat was made and understood by the speaker and receiver of the words to be said in earnest.\n \n ....\n Prosecutorial Discretion or Different Standards?\n \n A recent North Carolina case suggests Eid employed a double standard when opting not to prosecute any of the three men.\n \n On Aug. 1, North Carolina resident Jerry Blanchard was arrested and eventually charged with \"threatening to kill, kidnap, and inflict bodily harm upon U.S. Senator Barack Obama, a major candidate for the office of President of the United States.\" He was indicted Aug. 28, four days before the suspected plotters in Denver were arrested. His criminal complaint alleges only verbal threats. According to the indictment, Blanchard suggested he might purchase a firearm but owned none and never expressed a specific plan or date on which he would to carry out the alleged threat.\n \n Blanchard's lawyer, Lawrence Hewitt, said he was \"mystified\" as to why his client was charged and the Colorado men were not.\n \n \"True threat is simply the offense of making the threat,\" Hewitt said. \"It's a bit mystifying to me that the men in Denver who made threats against Senator Obama and allegedly had body armor and weapons were not charged, but my client who is alleged to have merely made verbal threats is charged.\"\n \n Assistant Colorado US Attorney Jim Hearty downplayed Eid's statements from his press conference and dismissed claims that any of the men should have been prosecuted on threat charges.\n \n \"It's not important what was said in the heat of a press conference,\" Hearty said. \"We're only supposed to prosecute cases that we're certain we can gain a conviction.\" He also told RAW STORY that if it wanted to question the US Attorney's motives, \"Then knock yourself out.\"\n \n Eid and US Attorney spokesman Jeffrey Dorschner repeatedly maintained that there was never a credible threat due to the men's drug use and the lack of a viable plot. National media outlets printed the Colorado US Attorney office's claims without question.\n \n Legal experts interviewed by RAW STORY agreed that, in general, a prosecutor reserves the right to \"prosecutorial discretion.\" But some, particularly those more familiar with this case as well as Eid's history as US Attorney (Eid was appointed by President Bush during the height of Monica Goodling's tenure as Justice Department liaison to the White House), thought he might be hiding behind such discretion.\n \n Horton, who has also written extensively about the US Attorneys scandal for Harper's Magazine and is very familiar with Eid's background and record as Colorado US Attorney, pointed out, \"Pretty much any law professor is going to tell you that a prosecutor is entitled to discretion in making decisions. But that's not an absolute rule. The rule is they have to apply consistent standards across the board. And I think this is a clear-cut case where there's one standard [for Republicans] and another standard for Barack Obama. Do you think for a second if these people had uttered threats against President Bush that Eid would be doing this?\" Horton added, \"And by applying the standard in a way that's not equal across the board, they damage their own reputation.\"The Raw Story | Legal experts question US Attorney's decision not to prosecute Obama 'assassination plot'\n THIS is one of the reasons we CANNOT have \"four more years\" of a Bush Republican.\n \n That's one thing that sounded stupid to me about the Attorney General's excuse for not prosecuting.\n He was giving the argument that the DEFENSE ATTORNEY would make to try to make people believe they weren't a threat...\n \n The courts should have decided this.\n \n It's interesting also to note that the OTHER recent arrest regarding a threat to Obama would NOT have been made if the people involved had utilized the Colorado Attorney General standard...\n \n I can't help but think some Republicans are looking at this and want to excuse it. Sweep it under the rug.\n Other Republicans look at this and are repulsed by it.\n And it is that dichotomy that is self-destructing the Republican party.\n It's not something you can blame on the \"liberal elite media\". :rolls",

Yes, it is unorthodox for a prosecutor to note faults in their case, but shouldn't that tell us something about the terrible state of our criminal justice system in the United States? A prosecutor's job is not to put every suspect behind bars; it's to serve the people of their jurisdiction, and they are not doing that when they carelessly prosecute someone who could very likely be innocent of the charges.",
