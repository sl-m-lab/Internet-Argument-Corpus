You can neither type nor count properly (21-2=19).\n \n Anyway, I love drinking but I, like most people (I know) drink to get intoxicated. So in a perfect world it would be banned as it damages your health and causes you to act stupid (and possible dangerous).

America do have a lot more cars per capita than any other nation, but I would argue that it is because of your very high standard of living, and the fact that the US has a very car friendly culture (probably deriving from the low population/square kilometres). The intensity of car ownership might be a factor, but I would wager it has more to do with the history of the influence of religion and free-churches (is that a word).\n \n And we have the same prohibition laws as you do (age 21) but we also have a state-monopoly on alcohol, and extreamly high taxes on alcohol to diminish the negative effects of our drinking culture (binge drinking). Before we enacted these polycies we had an estimated 30% alcoholics of the population. This was roughly a hundred years ago. Today we have the lowest consumtion rate of alcohol in europe.",

But still almost all bars close at 11, or 10.30 on a Sunday (incidentally this law was made during WWI, when it was deemed that late licensing was detrimental to the war effort, at has not been seen to be out of date since!). The Police and NHS both agree that the early closing is still a major factor of binge drinking, but quite to what extent cannot really be seen until the law is properly repealed.\n \n That said I do agree that increased drinking is very much in our culture, and the level of drinking will always depend on a countries culture.\n \n I find the age of 21 absurd, to be an adult and not be able to enjoy a nice pint after work?
