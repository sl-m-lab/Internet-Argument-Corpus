   "Given the situation on the ground for the Palestinian people you can't be surprised by the out come of the recent election in Palestine. The elections giving the Hamas leaders much more responsibility for the way things are going to be in the future for the Palestinian people. Hamas will be held accountable to the Palestinian people as well as to the Quartet. The newly elected leaders of Hamas will have to choose in the manner they are going to bring about change in Palestine.\n \n The State of Israel as we known it today was established with the help of terrorists, some of who turn into political leaders of Israeli. Many people in their support of the State of Israel will deny there ever were acts of terrorists on behalf of Israel. Saying they were freedom fighters that were defending the Jewish homeland.\n \n With in political parties there are many different fractions that make up the party. This is true in the United State, State of Israel, and Palestine as well as in any other nation major political party. Defending the philosophy of any of the extremist's fractions within a major party is a difficult to near impossible with any degree of logic. \n \n The actions and reactions of the people and governments of Palestine and Israel are being closely watch by the international community of nations. Only by the Quartet applying equal presser to both sides for reform can peace come about. The position of the governments on both side need to be more transparent for the people and government of the world to see. This could be done by creating an official website for the government of Palestine and Israel to post their positions and responses concerning the Peace Process. This would create a platform of equal footing for both sides. Giving the people of the world a window into the Peace Process. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",

   "The Hamas Charter of 1988 is very frightening when you read it, so is the Likud Platform of 1977, 1996. Statements made by the Likud leader Mr. Binyamin Netanyahu or the leaders of Hamas are very divisive and are undermining the peace process. Hamas has helped raise more money for Israel as well as helping the Likud party get elected into power. The Hamas Charter sounds like a fundamentalist Islamic cleric wrote it. The Likud Platforms sound like a Zionist Lawyer wrote them that graduated from an Ivy League University. \n \n It is time for the Arab League to help resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Crisis. The role of Arab League should include the following. \n \n 1. Provide financial resources for the re-construction of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.\n 2. Help the Palestinian government in moderating and communicating their official position with the Israeli government to the world. \n 3. Help to defuse the tension between the Arab nations and the State of Israel. \n 4. Become an active member in the Peace negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis. \n \n Only with the United States government putting more pressure on the Israeli government and the Arab League putting more pressure on the Palestinian government to come to agreeable terms. Making the position of the governments on both sides more transparent for the world to see. This could be done with an official government website dedicated to the Palestinian-Israel Peace Process. The website would create a level forum that everything could be put on the table by both nations for the people of the world to see. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",

   "A massive infusion of international capital and humanitarian aid being invested into the new State of Palestine creating a strong and viable economy and job opportunities for the Palestinian people. Unemployment has been running between 40% and 70% in the Palestinian Territories for many years. Democracy without job opportunities for the people will not work. By creating job opportunities and an independent State for the Palestinian people the dignity of the Palestinian people will begin to be restored. \n \n The Israeli government agreeing to turn over in good shape the Israeli settlements in the West Bank to the State of Palestine. Some of the Israeli Settlements surrounding East Jerusalem will become an International Green Zone with final terms to be worked out. Israel will gain a great deal of international legitimacy among the international community of nations. With a temporary moratorium on new immigrates or the return of people to Palestine and Israel the problem of those there today can be workout. The Israelis agreeing to down size their military industrial complex that is mostly government owned and Palestine agreeing not to create one. A twenty-year master plan must be developed and implemented with the tourism industry being the economic cornerstone of the region. \n \n By creating a peaceful and civil way for the people of the region to settle their grievances and differences civil order will develop. Only by building the confidence of the people on both sides will trust of one and another develop. For this term of time the international community will have play a major role with operations being based in the International Green Zone. There are many considerations that have be considered in the twenty-year master plan from the preservation of the religious Holy sites to security and the development of a commercial tourism industry. Only if both sides profit from the tourism generated dollars will peace prosper in the Holy Land. \n For the Government of Israel to agree to compromising terms for peace the United States Government and the European Union guarantee the national security of the State of Israel from military attacks from foreign governments. All regional and national government will have to work in cooperation against the acts of terrorisms by disgruntled individuals and fringe groups that remain out side the peace process. The slate of pass actions will be wiped clean on both sides regarding individuals and groups being tried for War Crimes, only the future actions of possible war crimes could be tried. An Authority of Property and Personal Disputed will have to be established to help settle old grievances between the Palestinian people and the Israelis. The Israeli government will handle the financial reimbursement of the Jewish Settlers for relocating backed by a financial package from the United States Government. The Authority of Property and Personal Disputed will handle the financial reimbursement to the Palestinian people by a financial package from the Arab nations and European Union. \n \n As conditions improve in the Palestinian community so too will the relationship between the people opening the door for new opportunities. With the up coming Palestinian elections there is a chance for major changes for the better for the people on both sides if an international commitment is made as well as the governments on both sides. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",
