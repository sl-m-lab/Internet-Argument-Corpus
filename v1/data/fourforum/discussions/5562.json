But it thrives on abducting children to serve as soldiers and sex slaves, and mutilates civilians. The group's conflict with government forces has received relatively little international attention even though an estimated 30,000 children have been kidnapped and as many as 1.6 million civilians have been displaced. A rebel commander surrendered early this year; the government announced a temporary cease-fire; and the end of a civil war in neighboring Sudan could undercut rebel support. But peace talks have stalled in recent months. The fighting and misery continue. \n \n *\n \n As dusk falls across northern Uganda, scores of children begin their nightly trek into the centers of remote provincial towns. They sleep in doorways, on verandas and at drafty bus stations, hospitals and schools. They are known as \"night commuters,\" and they make the hike from their desolate rural homes because they are afraid.\n \n For almost two decades, a notorious rebel group that calls itself the Lord's Resistance Army, or LRA, has been terrorizing villagers. It kidnaps adults to haul heavy loads over long distances. But it also steals children, some as young as 8. The LRA forces the boys to become soldiers; the girls become sex slaves.\n \n snip\n \n Villages across northern Uganda have been uprooted. The former residents languish in camps, which are cramped and unsanitary. Food, clean water and medical care are scarce. Malnutrition and diseases such as malaria, scabies and tuberculosis afflict many. Those who leave camp to look for work, firewood or edible plants risk being attacked by the rebels, captured in shootouts or blown up by mines that litter the landscape. The rebels often storm the camps to loot supplies and kidnap more victims. \n \n \n\n \n Christianity is a cancer on the world and needs to be excised, slavery, rape, mass murder all have been practiced by christians and is ample proof of its corrupting influence on the world. Stop the insantiy force a christain to convert to Buddism.",

   "Am I to guess theres a little bit of irony in your post? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I'm not sure if this can be compared to the riots in Afghanistan(if thats your aim)though as the LRA has literally no understanding of the commandments of god or the bible while the clerics in Afghanistan that created so much trouble because of the Koran have a thorough understanding of Islam.Nor is the situation in Uganda typical of a christian country whereas Afghanistan is typcal of an Islamic country.If people started rioting in Italy in the name of christianity would be one thing but a massacre in Uganda by a group that doesn't understand what i thinks it fights for???The comparisent doesn't work i think.\n \n In the end,even if the attacks on Newsweek were unwarranted ad the anti-Muslim nature of many on this board over the top,the rioting in Afghanistan was wrong and proof of the moral crisis Islam and the wider Muslim society are goin through.",

   "Am I to guess theres a little bit of irony in your post? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n\n \n \n More then a little. Meant to show that the socio economic conditions that the average person lives under is more indicative of any extremism then any particular ideology. Christians under severe conditions have been murderous in their behaviour, Secularists under severe conditions have been murderous in their behavious, and the list would and could go one.\n \n If you want to change any country from having a large number of extremists, improving the living conditions should be the first goal. Giving the people something to live for and the expectation of having a longer life will help prevent them from purposely ending it early. This is why you see so few Americans willing to join the military, for the war on terror. They can expect to live another 60 years if they dont fight, an Afghan at 18 will probably have only another 25 years to live and in poor conditions, not much to lose.",
