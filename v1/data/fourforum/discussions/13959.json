Board of Education: Caste, Culture and the Constitution (University Press of Kansas, 2003).X He is currently working on a comparative legal history contrasting the role of law in constructing systems of slavery and racial hierarchy in the Americas.\n \n   Thwarting the First Civil Rights Revolution - The Court's late-nineteenth-century decisions on race \n ....\n That narrative is true as far as it goes.XX And yet Brown and the undoubted boost that it gave to the cause of racial justice in postwar America have served to obscure an unpleasant truth.X If the Supreme Court played an important role in energizing the civil rights movement that has wonderfully transformed modern America, it also did much to thwart and ultimately doom an earlier civil rights revolution that came in the wake of the Civil War.X Two cases, United States v. Cruikshank (1876) and the Civil Rights Cases (1883) would largely curtail Congressional efforts to protect the newly emancipated black population through civil rights legislation.X The consequences would be severe.X The federal government would largely abandon civil rights protection for black people and other minorities for the better part of the twentieth century in no small part due to the Court's decisions in both cases.X The system of Jim Crow that defined much of American race relations in the twentieth century can be traced, in no small measure, to these two nineteenth-century Supreme Court decisions.\n \n Cruikshank, the earlier case, probably had the more far-reaching consequences.X It began with the massacre of over 100 black men by an armed white mob in Louisiana.X The black men were going to the polls.X They were armed in anticipation of an attack.X Three members of the white mob were convicted of violating the civil rights of the black men under the Enforcement Act of 1870.XX The members of the white mob had been charged, among other counts, with violating the First Amendment rights of the black men to peaceable assembly and with violating their Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n The Court's opinion, authored by Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite, cut the legs out from under Congress's ability to protect the newly freed black population from the rising tide of white violence designed to intimidate black voters and drive them from the polls.X Cruikshank and the other defendants, the Waite opinion explained, were private citizens.X Under the federal system citizens were obliged to look to state government for protection from private parties, including private parties seeking to deprive them of constitutional rights.X The Waite opinion was a harkening back to the federalism of the antebellum era, one in which the federal government had little role in protecting the citizen.X The opinion largely overlooked the revolution in federalism that the Civil War Amendments were meant to bring about.X It also ignored considerable evidence, found in the text of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, that Congress was meant to have strong, perhaps primary powers in enforcing the new amendments in fulfilling their purpose of eradicating the system of slavery and racial domination that hadX brought the nation close to ruin.\n \n Cruikshank's consequences would be far reaching.X Emboldened by the Court's dictate that the federal government could play only a limited role at best in curbing private violence against black citizens, white supremacists led by the Ku Klux Klan would use extra-legal violence to eliminate black voters as a significant force in southern politics.X That pattern would not begin to be reversed until after the Second World War.X And the Cruikshank decision would have far-reaching consequences beyond the ballot box.X The American South would become a place of open and notorious lawlessness.X Lynching was widespread in the region in the early part of the twentieth century.X The federal government provided little protection.X Chief Justice Waite's notions of the limits of federal power would be followed to an extreme. ..... \n\n Now maybe we can see the reason why some confusing decisions have come from the court that still haunt the Bill of Rights even today. \n Also see.
