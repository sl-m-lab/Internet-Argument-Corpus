   "I was filing an LLC registration and big red letters told me if the LLC was involved with food/beverage processing, manufacturing or distribution (it isn't) it must register with the FDA's bioterrorism department. Wow. I wonder how big that department is and if the budget is listed as a defense cost. \n \n http://www.fda.gov/oc/bioterrorism/bioact.html\n \n Maybe I'm naive, but why would any self-respecting terrorist be stupid enough to register with a federal bureaucracy having a name like that? Now I better understand why our government is growing at record rates with reduced public services.",

Which will provide an even larger and more expensive bureacracy performing tasks of questionable value without being encumbered with formal requests for expansion. All under the guise of defense, but evading accountabilty under the defense act.",
