This is where you&#8217;ve probably heard this. In reality no one really knows the age of the earth, but speculate that it could be billions of years old. Archeologist Dr. Berhane Asfaw, stated that the oldest human remains found in Ethiopia could be 160,000 years old, hailing from &#8220;the Garden of Eden&#8221; as he calls it.\n I have no idea how old the earth is, but I believe it has been here a very long time, although it may have looked totally different than it does today.\n \n So, to answer your question: Don&#8217;t fret. The most honored scientists and archeologists have no real answers about the age of the earth either and it&#8217;s their job to find out. Maybe someday we&#8217;ll know for sure.",

   "Greetings to Ladywolf, Ron, Kronus, Unkerpaulie and All:\n \n \nLadywolf << Confused about universal timeline . . . I'm really confused about earth's/the universe's timeline. Now the bible says that G*d created the heavens and the earth. Since the first humans were Jewish and the Jewish religion is not yet 6,000 years old, how come people keep discovering things that are much older than that...like as in billions of years? What's up with this anyway? \n \n \n Terral's reply << Some of your confusion has to do with the way men before you have interpreted the first two chapters of your Bible. Please allow me to provide an answer to your questions, while also giving comment to others on this thread. Your Timeline looks something like this from Scripture:\n \n Perfect Creation (Gen.1:1; billions of years ago) - - - - Satanic Rebellion / Reconstitution of Universe, Animals, Mankind (Gen. 1:2-2:3; millions of years ago) - - - - Lord God formed Adam / Garden (Gen. 2:7 ; thousands of years ago) - - - - Eve, seed taken out of Adam (Gen. 2:21; about 6,000 years ago). \n \n The seven Hebrew words that make up Genesis 1:1 work together to describe a completed, perfect (mature), unified creation of a single expression. Creation was then made up from the love, light and life of God Almighty. There was no such thing as stars and planets, death and destruction, male or female, darkness or suffering of any kind. All the created beings of God were perfect, and were formed with the knowledge of all things. This was the very reason for God to create Lucifer in the first place. Look again at his name, which is \"the anointed Cherub that covers.\" Scripture says, \"You were the anointed cherub who covers, and I placed you {there.} You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked in the midst of the stones of fire.\" Ezek. 28:14. \n \n Many forget that Satan was a good guy for a very long time during the Perfect Period of Genesis 1:1. \". . . You had the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering.\" Eze. 28:12+13. Note that precious stones are rewards for good works (1Cor. 3:12-14), and Satan had plenty of time to receive all of them. However, those days would come to an abrupt end. \"You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you.\" Ezek. 28:15. That stared the Satanic rebellion that caused the 'darkness' of Genesis 1:2.\n \n A very large gap appears between these first two verses of your Bible. Evidence for the gap is found here, \"For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is the God who formed the earth and made it, He established it {and} did not create it a waste place, {but} formed it to be inhabited), \"I am the LORD, and there is none else.\" Isaiah 45:18. And Peter's words here, \"For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God {the} heavens existed long ago and {the} earth was formed out of water and by water.\" 2Pet. 3:5. So the original creation was not created in the 'void' condition of Genesis 1:2, but our universe became broken as the result of the Satanic rebellion.\n \n It is through the mutiny of God's highest ranking cherub that death and darkness entered into the universe, which affected the very fabric and physical make up of everything. Instead of a universe filled with perfect beings of a single expression, creation became filled with angels and men. After all, instead of being one thing the heavens and earth became totally divided , and an empty gulf came to exist between the two. The agency through which these two realms would again become one was called into being in Genesis 1:8. \"God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.\" Heaven became the place where the two seas of spirit (heavens) and water (earth) overlapped.\n \n Then God had to make provisions for creatures of a physical nature. Instead of God illuminating creation (and us), He had to create the stars for our eyes, and planets for our feet. Note at the very end, what Scripture says, \"And there will no longer be {any} night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.\" Rev. 22:5. If you wish to see how things were before the Satanic rebellion, then look how things come to be after the devil and death are thrown into the lake of fire. \n \n Back to our timeline, we see a series of days (periods) where God created the principal components of this reconstituted universe and our specific world. Scripture is telling the story of how God used evolution to call these things into being. Science says that life began in the water, and so does Scripture. \"Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures . . .\" Gen. 1:20. Life on earth went through many stages of development from lower life forms to higher. That is why we find amphibian footprints in lower layers of stone strata, and reptilian tracks in layers above them, and so on. Then, on the sixth day (still millions of years ago), God created the male and female of Genesis 1. Dr. Leakey's \"Lucy\" is dated back to about 1million years by some, and up to 3 million years by others. The right answer is most likely somewhere between the two. http://www.evol.net/evol/australo.htm \n \n Adam was formed by the Lord God on this seventh day. Gen. 2:7. Many believe that this event dates back to about six thousand years. I place the forming of Adam back much farther in earth history, but it is difficult to tell just how far back to go. Adam was not formed in the same image as men today, and Eden was a place where the heavens and earth overlapped. It was the 'heaven' of our specific earth. The tree in the center of Eden was the same 'anointed cherub that covers.' Adam was the first, but was not to be the last. This created realm would house all of the newly created beings, who were to be fashioned according to the Genesis 1:1 blueprint. Those special beings would be created knowing everything; perfect knowledge. Therefore, when the Lord God (or Adam) had a secret to keep, then this tree was the means of covering that knowledge. Time passed . . . how much time? Again, it is hard to tell. But, Adam had time to name all the animals, to sit down, and become bored. And thus . . . \"but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.\" Gen. 2:20. \n \n So along comes Eve, \"The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.\" Gen. 2:23. These two are a perfect pair for this heaven realm on earth. Events transpire, until Adam and Eve fall in the likeness of what occurred during the Satanic Rebellion. With the curses of Genesis 3:14-19, Adam and Eve were also cast down into this present earthly environment. And this marks the time that the clock starts ticking, and we can trace that back on our timeline to just about six thousand years ago. Just place the gap between Gen. 5:1 and 5:2. So Adam lived in his fallen condition \"930\" years. Gen. 5:5.\n \n Note, again, that he is NOT a sixth day creation, and is NOT the 'male' created in Genesis 1:26-28. Sixth day people are native inhabitants of the land. Note that when Cain left the presence of the Lord, he found a wife and had children. Gen. 4:16+17. He found his wife from among the sixth day people. \n \n \nBigOrn writes << Creationists are a group of people that believe the earth was created about 10 to 12 thousand years ago. \n \n \n Terra's reply << There are different kinds of Creationists. If we rightly separate the sixth day people (Gen. 1) and seventh day Adam (Gen. 2), then there is room for evolution of the first, and creation of Adam. I believe we have God's Word as a record, and creation itself as a testament. And they both tell the same story. It is just that men wish to interpret Scripture, as if one day to God is the same as one day to men. Then they blind themselves into not seeing the physical evidence in creation. But, remember again that 'the anointed cherub that covers' is loose in the world, and \"has blinded the minds of the unbelieving . . .\" 2Cor. 4:4. He is the 'deluding influence' of 2Thes. 2:11, and, accurate 'knowledge' about these things is difficult to come by, when the god of this world has it covered. \n \n \nBigOrn << This is where you've probably heard this. In reality no one really knows the age of the earth, but speculate that it could be billions of years old. Archeologist Dr. Berhane Asfaw, stated that the oldest human remains found in Ethiopia could be 160,000 years old, hailing from \"the Garden of Eden\" as he calls it.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Others believe that human life has been here for a much longer time (as given above).\n \n \nKronus << Orn, Apathy wasn't really being nit-picky. Your statement that scientists \" have no real answers about the age of the earth\" is incorrect. 4.54 billion years, +- 1% is a very precise answer. People may not agree with it, but it's a real answer.\n\n \n Terral's reply << I am a creationist who believes 100 percent that the Lord God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and blew life into his nostrils. Gen. 2:7. I also believe that this estimate from Kronus is just about right. We can calculate that the universe has been around in its present form for much longer periods, by examining the light reflected from distant galaxies. Remember that we are not seeing distant stars, as they appear today, but as they appeared tens of billions of years ago. And, every time we build a bigger telescope, this place just gets bigger. \n \n As a side note (my two cents here): We should come to realize that God is up to something with creation, when we take the 'red shift' affect into account. That means that the objects farther away from us, in all directions, are traveling at increased speeds. This seems to indicate to me that the Creator placed things in our universe, so that they would be viewed from a particular perspective, i.e., from a vantage point very near our Milky Way Galaxy. Otherwise, if everything in the universe occurs according to random physics, then the red shift phenomena should appear to be random also. And, this characteristic of the universe points toward it being finite. After all, it is physically impossible for an infinite universe to expand without also contracting someplace else.\n \n \nUnkerpaulie << ok, first off, the bible said that \"in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" which means that the earth, as well as everything above it (stars and what not that make up the \"heavens\") were around before man came on the scene\n\n \n Terral's reply << Yes. That is evidence that 'gaps' appear between the verses. We can use the geological record to fill in the gaps. \n \n \nUnkerpaulie << second, the first humans werent jewish. jews came along after the birth of judah, the son of jacob, the son of isaac, the son of abraham. there were lots of humans around before jewish people\n\n \n Terral's reply << Actually, this is just how the descendants of Jacob (Israel) came to be named. The first humans existed millions of years ago, according to the geological record. The descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob have been around only for about four thousand years. The Arabs and Jews are cousins in that Esau and Jacob were twin brothers. Here are the verses: \n \n \"The LORD said to her, \"Two nations are in your womb; and two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; and the older shall serve the younger.\" When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.\" Gen. 25:23-26.\n \n \nUnkerpaulie << the jewish religion has nothing to do with the universal timeline, except that the jews \"got the inspiration of creation from God\" other than that, the jews are just another \"race\" of people like everybody else\n\n \n Terral's reply << This statement needs some clarification. It is not that Israel is any better than the rest of us in the eyes of God. It is that He is using Israel as His Chosen Instrument or tool through which all of mankind shall be redeemed. Elijah shall return to Israel of the flesh, \"and will restore all things.\" Matt. 17:11. That means \"All things,\" and points right back to Eden. He will posses the powers of the cultivator of the land (Adam), which includes the power over making it rain, calling the fire of the Lord down from heaven, dividing rivers, etc.. Scripture says, \"And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.' Acts 3:23. But, the end result will be, \". . . AND I WILL RESTORE IT, SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES . . .\" Acts 15:16+17 (CAPS because they are OT quotes). So God has the salvation of everyone in mind, when He uses Israel as His tool.\n \n Scripture says of Israel, \". . . who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the {temple} service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.\" Rom. 9:4+5. Peter writes, \"But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR {God's} OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" 1Pet. 2:9. Our Bible describes two kinds of people. Everything is that is not a Jew is a Gentile. That being said, Scripture also identifies Israel according to the flesh (Jacob; Rom. 9:1-5) and Israel according to the promise. \n \n \"But {it is} not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are {descended} from Israel; nor are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but: \"THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.\" That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.\" Rom. 9:6-8. So all those obedient to our gospel are also sons of God through Isaac, and grafted in the same tree.\n \n \nLady << Still confused...what were Adam and Eve? Wern't they Jewish? If not, what were they?\n\n \n Terral's reply << No. Adam was a Gentile, as was Noah and everyone right down to Abraham. The switch occurs during Abraham's lifetime, and the sign of circumcision. Gen. 17:10 - 23. This became part of Mosaic Law and is still practiced by Israel of the flesh (on the eighth day) to this day, as a sign of their participation in their covenant with God. Gentiles today are being called to God through the gospel (1Cor. 15:1-5), that Christ came, died, was buried in a tomb to be raised on the third day, and is now at the right hand of God. \"AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, 'YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,' THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.\" Rom. 9:26 (Again, CAPS because this is an Old Testament quote).\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "\n As a side note (my two cents here): We should come to realize that God is up to something with creation, when we take the 'red shift' affect into account. That means that the objects farther away from us, in all directions, are traveling at increased speeds. This seems to indicate to me that the Creator placed things in our universe, so that they would be viewed from a particular perspective, i.e., from a vantage point very near our Milky Way Galaxy. Otherwise, if everything in the universe occurs according to random physics, then the red shift phenomena should appear to be random also. And, this characteristic of the universe points toward it being finite. After all, it is physically impossible for an infinite universe to expand without also contracting someplace else.\n \n\n \n Just a brief comment on the cosmology. I'm afraid I don't have the math to prove it off the top of my head, but you would observe the same red shift phenomena anywhere in the universe.

The universe is expanding in the same way as the rising loaf. Now pick any raisin, and imagine it's our own Milky Way galaxy. No matter how you look at it, as the bread rises, all the other raisins are moving away from our raisin. The farther away another raisin is from our raisin, the faster it is moving away. In the same way, all the other galaxies are moving away from ours as the universe expands. And because the universe is uniformly expanding, the farther a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is receding from us.\"\n\n \n Terral continues << Please allow me to ask a few questions, and use this opportunity to forward a thought: \n \n Suppose we choose a spot beyond the physical universe and observe these things from the outside. Whether we use your balloon example, or the rising loaf of raisin bread illustration, would we still see red shift values for all the galaxies? \n \n Or, would we only see longer wavelengths values from those galaxies on the far side of the universe, and those on either side? \n \n After all, the galaxies on the near side of the expanding universe should be coming closer to us. And, those galaxies very near us should be approaching at the greatest speeds. In this case, the galaxies near the middle of the expanding universe would have very low red shift values (the very center being zero), with those on the left and right outside edges having higher values. But still, those galaxies in our direct line of vision (straight across the center of the universe) would show extremely high blue shift values (near us), and the highest red shift values farther away along our perspective line. So the blue shift values would be the highest for the galaxy cluster nearest to us, and the very highest red shift value would come from that cluster farthest away. \n \n If my thinking on this is correct, then there should be a way to find the center of your expanding balloon by mapping the variations in red shift values from any inside point of perspective. Let us try to visualize this by drawing a circle on a piece of paper. Then divide the circle into quadrants, by drawing an X inside; like dividing a pie into four equal parts. Number the quadrants 1, 2, 3 (opposite 1), and 4. Put our Milky Way Galaxy in the first quadrant. As you said, since our universe is expanding, then all of the galaxies have positive red shift values. But, the 'average' red shift value for all galaxy chains in quadrants 2 and 4 should be identical (assuming our perspective line is in the very center of quad 1, and the rate of expansion is constant). By contrast, the red shift values for the galaxy chains that share space in our quadrant 1 should be much lower, than those in quadrant 3. \n \n If we find that magical 'average' red shift value for all the galaxy chains in quads 2 and 4 (to our left and right sides), and subtract that number from the value from each of our four quad values, then we should see a definite pattern. If the center of the X inside our pie represents the center of your expanding balloon, then the red shift value for quads 2 and 4 would be zero, because x - x = 0. However, the value for those chains in quad 1 would now be negative. The average red shift number for quad 3 galaxies should now be the only positive values on our map with lesser values near us, and higher values as for those farther away. Also, those galaxies between us and the center of the universe should display the lowest red shift values of all.\n \n By drawing perspective lines in every direction, and mapping the corresponding red shift values from the created quadrants, we should see a spectrum of varying positive values for quad 3, IF and only, if your balloon illustration accurately depicts our universe. In that case, the three dimensional mapping of our varying quad 3 values should act as a divining rod that would lead us to the center of the universe. Our perspective lines that actually point away from the center would present us with positive values for quad 3, but the decimal number following the 1 would always be lower than the lines drawn near the center of the universe. The perspective line that points directly away from the center of the universe should give us the lowest average red shift value for distant galaxies. \n \n Suppose we find that the average quad 3 values are identical for every possible direction? One possibility is that God Almighty chose a point in the center of the universe to perform His work of redemption. That being said, today I am inclined to stand with you and assume that we are not in the middle of anything. However, if the average quad 3 red shift number actually turns out to be a constant value for every given point in the universe, then I believe the Big Bang (balloon/raisin bread) theory goes right out the window. That would 'appear' [my disclaimer : 0 ) ] to indicate that our universe is expanding from the center of every given point. If that turned out to the case, then I feel it would be time for each and every one of us to accept the fact that there is no possibility that creation came into being through random means. \n \n Either way, I believe the day shall come when men come to realize that creation has a Creator. Scripture says, \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\" Rom. 1:20. He says, \"It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands And I ordained all their hosts.\" Isa. 45:12. And, \"For My hand made all these things, Thus all these things came into being,\" declares the LORD.\" Isa. 66:2. \n \n Thank you again for pointing out the weakness of my original view. Please look my theory over and show where I appear to be off. Thanks again,\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "I've always enjoyed cosmology, but I'm not a pro. Some of this will be things I've learned, and some will be guesses. I'll try to keep it clear which is which.\n \n First off, just the idea of trying to look at the universe from the outside makes my brain hurt. Certainly you wouldn't be able to see anything in our universe from the outside, because light from anything in our universe has to travel through space (not outer space space, but space-time space) and since space as we know it ends at the edge of the universe (if there is such a thing) then light certainly couldn't \"get out.\" Or, to look at it another way, the edge of the universe is expanding outward at the speed of light, so light from the inside of the universe could never catch up in order to get out and be seen. I suppose that whatever passes for light could travel through whatever passes for space outside our universe, bounce off the advancing edge of our universe, and be observed, but I really can't wrap my brain around that too well.\n \n So, let's stay inside the universe. Your idea with the quadrants is a good one, but it has one flaw. Quadrants 2 and 4 will always have the same average red shift, which will be greater than 1's and less than 3's, regardless of whether the X is at the center of the universe or not. The red shift value is dependent solely on how far away something is, so if we're in the middle of quad 1, quad 3 will always have a higher red shift than quads 2 and 4, regarless of how we orient the map.\n \n However, you did give me an idea. Here comes the guesses. ;) \n Take a well nigh infinitely powerful telescope. So powerful that we could see the radiation generated at the edge of the universe as it advances away from us. By measuring the red shift on that it may, in theory, be possible to find out how far away the edge is in that direction. Repeat in every direction until you have the shape of the universe and our relative position in it. This all assumes, of course, that concepts like \"shape of the universe\" and \"edge of the universe\" have any useful meaning, which I'm not entirely sure of.",

   "Greetings to Waxy, Montalban (mentioned) and All:\n \n I am not very good at writing the personal kinds of posts, but would like to use this opportunity to offer some ideas that may help you in the future.\n \n \nWaxy << I'm a geologist by training and trade, so is my wife. Do you have any formal training? If not, I assume you consider it a hobby and have obviously done some pretty serious reading on the subject. You seem pretty knowledgeable.\n\n \n Terral's reply << No sir, not at all. Actually I am a bricklayer by trade. My youth was filled with reading tons of books on various subjects. Many of my uncles and cousins are ministers, so a religious vein kind of runs in the family. Although, they are predominately denominational Christians and I am not. That is why you may have read my words to Montalban, saying that the \"Protestants would not have me.\" I spent six years in the Roman Catholic denomination, and that is the reason you might read my opposing views to their dogma. It is not that I have harsh feelings for either crowd, but I am well aware of the trappings associated with those particular groups. We are, after all, products of the sum of our experiences.\n \n \nWaxy << Check out the Creation vs. Evolution forum, there's lots to read and debate on the subject in there. Although, recently there haven't been too many YEC'ers around. It's a little hot in that kitchen for them. \n \n \n Terral's reply << I cannot find a shred of evidence in the Bible or creation to support a young earth theory. The concepts of parent and daughter elements could not exist in a ten thousand year old universe. Light would not have time to get to earth from our nearest solar system in that amount of time, not to mention light from distant galaxies. Then the Young Earth folks have to force square pegs into round holes to forward their positions, like, \"God created the traveling light radiating in every direction, along with the distant stars/galaxies.\" The geological evidence says that dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years go. The Young Earth people certainly have some heavy hammers for their square pegs. One of my favorite proofs for an old earth is in the physical evidence stored in the ice cap core drilling samples, which mirror tree ring circles. The deeper into the glaciers we drill, the father back we go in time. And that is where we find the pollens and other DNA evidence for extinct plants and animals. You probably do not require my assistance on in those threads.\n \n \nWaxy << As a geologist, I find it impossible to understand the literal YEC viewpoint of creation, it really is beyond my comprehension. I mean, I can understand having religious beliefs. What I can't understand is trying to defend them in the realm of science and natural facts when they are essentially indefensible.\n\n \n Terral's reply << Your statement here was the reason I wanted to give this reply. Hopefully this explanation will give you better tools for future encounters with professing Christians in these kinds of discussions. What I need you to do is cast off your preconceived notions about Christians in general, for just a few moments. Start building a fresh perspective by accepting the fact that not everyone calling himself a Christian is actually 'saved,' and functioning with a regenerated spirit. Vast herds of humanity are walking in the delusion of believing they have been called to Christ, when actually they have been baptized into someone else. \n \n True Christians have been baptized into the Body of Christ on the cross at Calvary some 2000 years ago, and have participated in His death, burial and resurrection through the gospel. See gospel #2 in this post: http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509 and our 'one baptism' here: http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506 . I present these precepts of doctrine in the form of a contradiction so that the opposing views can also be addressed, and differences noted. \n \n Here is where we get to the problem I want to bring to your attention. While there is a 'mystery of Christ' (Eph. 3:4) currently at work, and the 'body of Christ' (Eph. 4:12, 5:30, etc) is now under construction, there is also a 'mystery of iniquity/lawlessness.' 2Thes. 2:7-12 (7). Most people fail to realize that this aspect of Scripture even exists. There is a body of Christ and a body of the antichrist, and the two are being fashioned simultaneously. The number of members in the latter body is far greater than the actual members of the body of Christ. Scripture says, \n \n \"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.\" 2Cor. 11:13-15.\n \n Here are a few examples: We are taught to call our RC priests 'father.' Christ says, \n \n \n\"Do not call {anyone} on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.\" Matt. 23:9. \n \n \n The Vatican says that priests are not to marry. What does Scripture say? \n \n \n\"But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, {men} who FORBID MARRIAGE {and advocate} abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.\" 1Tim. 4:1-3.\n\n \n Satan has given the world a series of perfect counterfeits to replace the things of the Spirit of God with the works and rituals of men. He has sold the denominations different versions of 'a different gospel' (Gospel #3 here: http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509 ). All of those souls have become part of the 'mystery if iniquity' (2Thes. 2:7), and have become bound by the chains of delusion. This is the reason that you will find no shortage of people to offer you illogical reasons to support their deluded views, under the guise of Christianity. Again, they only believe themselves to be saved, when actually they are not even close. \n \n Someone like you, with a more secular view, has a far greater chance of seeing the gospel than those who have been deluded already. Paul writes, \"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4. Those 'professing' Christians have already believed the \"deluding influence so that they will believe what is false\" (2Thes. 2:11). The 'anointed cherub who covers' (Eze. 28:14) has them under his spell, and thinking they are 'in Christ.' They are not even aware of the fact that they should be seeking escape. \n \n Breaking this spell is the major stimulus for all of my writings, and, again, my reason for writing to you today. Our enemy (from Eph. 6:12) resides within the being of those we are seeking to help the most. They believe that internal entity within them to be Christ, when it is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing. Since I was once beguiled into that same situation, and now know the difference and have become free, my goal is to help as many as possible see deliverance from that terrible condition. And this is why you find me taking this stuff so seriously.\n \n Please take careful notice here, Waxy. This is where God can use you as a witness. They can pretend to be 'in Christ,' by showing up at weekly services, giving money to the poor, etc.. The deluded and deceived folks can mimic the traits and qualities of truly saved members of the body of Christ in a thousand ways. However, they are not capable of using the Word of God to support their errant views in the forum of debate. \n \n This is the inconsistency you are witnessing in what you perceive to be Christians. That is why Paul asks, \"Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?\" 1Cor. 1:20. Yes, He has made them appear as fools, and He shall continue to do so. This bricklayer is nothing special at all, but He 'in me' (See Romans 8:11) wrote the Book. So I hope you will continue to check in and take notes on others found running from the kitchen, and see who is standing 'firm' (Eph. 6:11,13+14). That is the only true way of knowing the difference. When you threaten Satan with Scripture he runs away. James 4:7. When you corner a man of God with His Word, then he thanks you. \n \n \nWaxy << I admittedly have a rather narrow scope when it comes to interaction with \"Christians\". Western Canada is dominated by Roman Catholics, but there are some other denominations present.

Keep in mind that Christ taught that the road to life is but a path, and the road to destruction is a twelve lane super highway. If nothing else, that should tell you something about the world's largest denominations. \n \n \"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
