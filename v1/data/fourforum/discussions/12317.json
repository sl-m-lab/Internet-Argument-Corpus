   "It turns out that YES, they ARE that stupid:\n \n Magna to shut New York plant, 1,400 jobs to be cut | Reuters\n \n \nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Magna International (MGa.TO) will close its gear assembly plant in Syracuse, New York, the Canadian auto parts maker said on Wednesday, after workers rejected a contract the company said was necessary to keep the factory competitive.\n \n The shutdown of the New Process Gear facility will ultimately eliminate 1,400 jobs.\n \n A company statement said a tentative agreement negotiated by the company and United Auto Workers union would have given the facility a future, and that it was disappointed that the employees had rejected it.\n \n \"Going forward, NPG will not be able to be competitive without the operational advantages and cost savings proposed in the agreement, and as a result, Magna Powertrain will initiate a wind-down plan for the site,\" it said.\n\n \n What have been going on at that plant has been watched pretty closely as an indicator of what is likely to happen in the wider auto industry. Those workers were warned that if they did not approve the new contract the plant would be going under. UAW leadership supported the contract. The rank and file, though, chose to vote themselves out of a job rather than take a pay cut. \n \n I hope those XXXXXX starve in the streets.",

Once you feel the bar can't get any lower someone will come by and blow away the record. \n \n I recently got six all new appliances for the foreclosed house I bought (apparently the guy who had it before foreclosing was too poor to afford anything but a refrigerator and stove and those got sold at auction). When the delivery guy came I was telling him I just bought the house and some ##### who had this brand new house for six months already foreclosed. The delivery guy then said \"yeah, they are tying to foreclose on my house that I just got because I didn't want to work for a few months so I didn't pay my mortgage\". He went on to say that there was \"no way in hell\" they were going to take his house (that he is not paying for) away from him. He then scrapped my hardwood floors with the dryer feet. \n \n So yes, you have to wonder sometimes what people are thinking. Here is some free advice, if you feel you are not that smart than know someone who is smart and ask them whenever a question of great magnitude comes up...such as \"should I agree to this contract and keep my job or get laid off\". Not everyone can be smart but everyone can get a smart answer.",
