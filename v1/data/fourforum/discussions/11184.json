   "A Day of Silence inside Mount Si High School meant to show support for gay and lesbian students erupted in noisy protests outside.\n \n More than one-third of students didn't show up for classes Friday. Principal Randy Taylor said 495 out of 1,410 students weren't at school, including 85 athletes whose parents had asked that they be excused for their personal beliefs.\n \n About 100 people joined the Rev. Ken Hutcherson, a prominent anti-gay-rights activist, in prayer and song that questioned the dedication of a school day to what they said was a controversial political cause.\n \n Snoqualmie police placed yellow crime-scene tape between Hutcherson's supporters and about 40 counterdemonstrators, including some former students, who tried to drown out the pastor by beating drums and chanting, \"Go home.\"\n \n Earlier, about 80 parents and supporters of the event, sponsored by the school's Gay Straight Alliance (GSA), stood quietly outside the school as students arrived in the morning. Some wore tie-dye scarves, and a former student waved a rainbow flag.\n http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/eastsidenews/2004374870_dayofsilence26e.htmlChristians ask for school lead prayer.\n Perhaps non-Christians can respond with similar behavior to the above? Insist that their kids be allowed to skip school on that day, and come out with bull-horns?\n \n But I'm sure some would see this as a \"religious belief\" response, and not actual prejudice or bigotry, right?\n \n It matters not.\n It doesn't go unnoticed.\n Things like the above are why religion is diminishing in popularity with our youths, who are having growing condescending views on the issue.\n And of course, \"Christianity\" itself does little to silence their zealots...\n \n Some of my favorite signs...\n \n \"I believe in separation of church and hate.\"\n \n \"It's our school, not your church.\"",
