It's not respect of gay people that's the issue, but of the arguments toward gay marriage. You should have asked if we have learned to respect the \"opposing view\" of pro-gay people, just like you did of those on your side.\n \n You are asking the two sides about two different things. Either ask your side if they have learned to respect those they oppose, or ask the \"antis\" if they respect the arguments of the other side. This survey needs to be accurate and equally ask both side the same issue.\n \n And for that matter, it's not \"anti-gay\" anyway, for those of us who are trying to protect the institution of marriage.\n \n I can't even take your survey, because the questions don't apply.",

   "Actually, no I don't think all of you do.\n\n \n Surely we all understand that religion is a factor for opponents of same-sex marriage, even if it is not a factor for us. This may not mean that everyone treats it with the same respect.\n \n \nNo one has said that. No one is taking away anything you have ever had.\n\n \n But you are certainly taking away a right that we never had. If you would prefer the term \"denying\" then replace \"taking away\" with \"denying\" each time I use it, and it will read just as correctly.\n \n \nIn fact some of us are willing to and do concede that you need the benefits that married people get. The context here is compromise, and your unwillingness to do so as a movement is holding you back. I think Duo is right: both sides do need to learn the value of compromise--it's not a dirty word. Compromise is a positive thing. But between you and I, you're the one being stubborn and unwilling to give an inch.\n\n \n Compromise is difficult to do when you don't view the compromise as anything but a perpetuation of the problem, and although I do not have a problem with government officials compromising to help homosexuals, and I would appreciate that, the activists compromising would be a very disasterous move. I tried to explain this, but compromise tends to be supported by people who don't understand the points on either side and want to try to come to a happy medium to please everyone. But those compromises rarely please everyone and rarely stop the debates. Sometimes people who compromise view those who refuse to as being stubborn and unreasonable, but a compromise is really unreasonable, it is an arbitrary drawing on the line between the two sides. It thus stands to reason that in order to grant equality, gay rights activists should instead have been arguing for the removal of heterosexual marriage and institution of homosexual marriage so that a compromise could then have been arbitrary drawn between the two sides of the debate. The fact that many people would be willing to accept a compromise tells me not that I should be agreeing with that compromise, but that I should be asking for more so that a compromise can be drawn in the right place instead of the wrong one.\n \n If I agreed with the compromise and thought that it fixed the problems that I see, then this situation would be different; I would be willing to accept such a compromise. But the proposed compromise does not grant real equality, and I as much as I let up insisting that this is the case, that is as much as people will not understand why it is not real equality.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I would love to institute civil unions over nothing, for that is certainly a step forward, but is that really a compromise if I'm going to continue to argue for same-sex marriage?\n \n \nWhy not at least put something out on the table?\n\n \n Well, I did try for a compromise that I can actually agree with: I tried for changing the name of the legal institution of marriage to \"civil unions\" then allowing it for everyone. But this compromise was refused just as I refuse your creating a new institution compromise.\n \n \nMy suggestion would be a greater effort (on your movement's part) to show understanding and respect toward religious people and their beliefs. I think that if religious people didn't perceive so much of a threat, but rather that you simply need the benefits of marriage, you'd find that more would support you. The reason religious people oppose your movement is that they feel threatened, and they feel that what they hold sacred is threatened. The best way to alleviate that is to make it clear that you don't pose a threat by showing respect and understanding instead a constant theme of \"it doesn't matter what you say or think, I deserve my rights!\" That may be true in an ideal situation, but saying it over and over as if you have no respect whatsoever toward what is sacred to a lot of people is only going to get them more incensed at your movement.\n\n \n But I do not say that over and over, I offer long, detailed explanations in which I try to show respect for my opponent's belief and in which I try to show why they are wrong. I respond to their questions, and I try to treat them as I would treat myself. I ask other people in the movement to do the same. What more is there that I could do?\n \n \nDo you have any idea how much better it would make you movement look in the eyes of religious people if your organizations simply released a statement saying \"we respect and honor the beliefs that millions of people hold sacred and dear\"? Instead your people call their views things like \"getting up religious dander\" as Justine did in another post. That \"religious dander\" is a sacred belief to a lot of people. (And for that matter, I've heard religious people called a LOT worse by people of your movement as well.)\n\n \n Then let me issue that statement right now. I do respect and honor your beliefs, just as I respect and honor everyone's beliefs. Although some people might use the term \"religious dander\", you would never see any gay rights organization use such a term; and each one would agree that they respect your religion.\n \n \nThe very fact that you are portraying religious people as out to take away your rights is still indicative of a lack of respect and understanding. I dare say most religious people do not have the intention to \"take away your rights,\" but rather to protect what they view as sacred because they see it threatened. What are you willing to do to make it clear you aren't trying to threaten anything?\n\n \n I don't mean to portray them as being out to take away people's rights, I mean to show you the side of your religion that I see, the side that gay rights activists see. I believe that you are out to promote the morality of your religion, not to take away my rights. But I don't consider what your religion preeches to be morality, and because of that, I am faced just with a group of people who want to deny me rights. That's what most gay activists see, and that is why many appear to be hostile.\n \n \nWhy is it so much to ask that people not be called things like \"fragile\" or \"die-hard, every-waking-hour homophobes\" just because they hold marriage sacred enough to protect it from a perceived threat?\n\n \n Well, what if I don't want Christians to marry because I am afraid Christianity threatens marriage? Is that not an irrational fear of Christianity? Would I not be a Christianophobe? That is likely the way that most people who call you a homophobe see you. I don't think of you that way, and I respect you and your religion as much as I can. You are person with beliefs, and that isn't a bad thing. Certainly not all gay rights activists say bad things about you. Some do, but some gay rights opponents say bad things about me. I could also ask, why must gays be referred to by any of the countless derogatory terms used against them. I assure you that it sounds like those terms are being used against me as much as it sounds to you like negative terms are being used against you.\n \n \nIt's true that we're talking about something that you consider sacred--marriage. Why is it that it can't be acknowledged or respected that religious people who do feel threatened by gay marriage also view it as sacred?\n\n \n Umm, well it can be acknowledged, and I do acknowledge that. I think we all do, as our point is that we should not be choosing one person's version of sacred over a different person's. We should make the institution open to everyone we can, and we should let religions tell us whether that relationship is really \"marriage\" or really \"sacred\".",

There can be no success through compromise; compromise is for people who claim to be reasonable by taking a middle ground on an issue, when it is more likely that one of the two sides is wrong.\n\n \n But the support of the majority of the people is currently for the party aganist you. There will be success in compromise. Granted, one side IS wrong, but until people willfully acknowledge it, constantly pushing by your side is not going to go anywhere productive. One side may be wrong, but until you can convince the public without creating undue hostility, compromise is the only solution. As I see it, the gay civil push is creating more hostility aganist it then any other recent push in the past decade.\n \n \nIf gay rights activists tried for a compromise, the debate would continue and people who claimed themselves reasonable would recompromise, granting even less gay rights.\n\n \n Why do you say that? Let's say you dropped the push for the word marriage but asked for the full benefits. Compromise there gains you a 1,000+ rights. Then in 5 or 10 years, push for the word. You have compromised once to get one step further. Do you believe you can get everything you want in one swift motion in a country very hostile to the very notion of gay marriage? \n \n \n\n The gay rights movement is no more shoving their beliefs down the throats of others than supporters of anyone else in any other issue in discussion today.\n \n\n \n Any other issue? Blanket statement. \n \n \n\n Refer to people on either side of this issue as \"crazies\" if you like, but you are using the term to describe some people who have large amounts of reason supporting their arguments and their actions, and the term simply is inaccurate.\n\n \n I didn't refer to the entire pro as crazies.

   "Compromise from your movement's side doesn't have to take to form of giving up or laxing the expectation of full marriage recognition, IMO (though it might indeed help speed things along to do so, and then let that evolve into eventual full marriage recognition). Again, I think it would help greatly if your movement simply went out of its way in the overall national-level debate to exhibit much more respect and understanding toward religious people.\n\n \n Well, you're probably right, but the anti-gay rights movement isn't showing respect or understanding towards us either. I don't think it is that no one who opposes gay rights holds respect toward us; I think it is that it is tough to get your voice heard if you aren't really controversial. The people whose opinions we hear tend to be Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity or Al Franken. Or maybe we hear the words of the most extreme guy at the rally or maybe the news shows the most extreme rally signs. Or maybe we hear from the politicians. But the comments of HRC or the ACLU get condensed to one sentence at the end of a news article with the label \"A representative from HRC said...\".\n \n It's just tough to get that kind of message out, not just for gay rights activists but for any political group.\n \n \nFor me, that would not be unreasonable.\n\n \n I know, but it always sounds to me like that is your last resort, not something you'd be willing to fight for or work toward. Hmm, maybe you would, but I sure don't know how to campaign for this compromise. Even if I could convince the movement to focus on this compromise, I don't think it would be accepted by anyone.\n \n \nWell, I do appreciate your gestures and I believe they are genuine. But with all due respect I think you are the exception and not the rule among the more vocal of your movement. And I understand that people in your movement are sometimes angry, yet at the same time for religious people this is a deep and sacred issue--it is not their intention to hurt gay people.\n\n \n Well, as I was saying, I think the most vocal of any movement are those who hold the most disdain for his opponents, not the common supporter of that movement. But people on both can be angry. I understand that most people do not have the intention to hurt gay people; I don't doubt that. But good intentions aren't enough to stop that harm in this case. It is my goal to expose that harm and ask that it be removed.\n \n \nMaybe not that term. But let's be honest, gay rights organzations haven't exactly gone out of their way one bit to entend a compelling olive branch to religious people on the other side of the aisle from them. And there's an awful lot of disdain toward those religious people sometimes. And regarding the people here who make such comments, don't you think it would go a long ways toward backing up your claims of respect and desire to see religion respected if you called them on it when they do it?\n\n \n Well, organizations opposing gay rights haven't extended any olive branches themselves. There is an awful lot of disdain toward people of your religion sometimes, but there is far more disdain toward peope of mine. When religious views conflict, it is difficult to stop the hatred that results unless we can keep that religion out of our laws, unless we can try to treat both groups the same.\n \n I don't always call people on these forums out when they say something I don't agree with. There are a number of reasons for it; I don't always read posts unless they are directed at me, and I feel like I write too many posts on these forums as it is. But I also find it difficult to talk to people about insults. The last thing I want to do is single someone out on the forums, to shame or hurt someone's reputation to further my own political belief. I'm sure the fact that I agree with their political viewpoint doesn't make it any easier. But I do try to speak out against those sorts of insults sometimes, in a more general fashion.",

   "True they did not. But the major advance they gained were because of people in high places. That is something the gay civil push currently lacks. My advice, if you will not compromise, find someone to champion your cause that has power.\n\n \n Well, the only way to get someone like that in a high place is to keep pushing for it. If we start pushing for compromise, all we will get is a compromiser in a high place.\n \n \nBut the support of the majority of the people is currently for the party aganist you.

As I see it, the gay civil push is creating more hostility aganist it then any other recent push in the past decade.\n\n \n It is going somewhere productive, I consider the push for same-sex marriage incredibly, amazingly productive. How many peope supported this cause ten years ago? Twenty? Look at the numbers now; look at the polls conducted among young people. The push for gay rights has been more productive than I would ever have imagined.\n \n \nWhy do you say that? Let's say you dropped the push for the word marriage but asked for the full benefits. Compromise there gains you a 1,000+ rights. Then in 5 or 10 years, push for the word. You have compromised once to get one step further. Do you believe you can get everything you want in one swift motion in a country very hostile to the very notion of gay marriage?\n\n \n Well, first I should say that I do not think that the compromise you speak of will come for a very long time, if we did decide to compromise. It isn't the instant benefit that you may be thinking. I will admit that it might come sooner than going directly to marriage would, but not too much sooner. It would almost be like starting anew; we'd get new compromisers, similar resistance, etc. And once that law is passed, it would be an incredibly long time before real equality is achieved. Allow me to explain: first, people who agreed to civil unions would be able to use the arugment: \"See! They asked for civil unions, we give them that and now they want marriage! What will they want next?\" Beyond that, the movement would lose much support among its base members because the people who support marriage will be disenheartened by the change of focus of the debate, and once civil unions are achieved, the people who care more about the benefits will lose motivation. Futhermore, we would have raised a generation which has learned that civil unions are an acceptable way of treating gay people, that only straight people still deserve marriage, and no one will have mentioned a word different. It would be like starting all over when we bring up marriage again.\n \n \nAny other issue? Blanket statement.\n\n \n Well, take abortion for example. That's a rather common issue. What are people on both sides doing? They are aruging that they are right, they are using the courts to support them, they are pushing for new laws, they are having rallys and protests... It is really the same actions, it is just that people don't care as much about preventing or supporting abortion as they do about stopping recognition of gay people's relationships or trying to make sure that their own relationships are protected. That is why there is more animosity.\n \n \nI didn't refer to the entire pro as crazies. I see one side starts to resemble the other the longer they stay in contact. You must admit that your side just like the antis has its share of crazies.\n\n \n But when you said that people need to listen to compromisers, not the crazies, you by implication referred to the non-compromisers, the people who support one side or the other, as crazies.

   "It would not be unreasonable to assume that if gay rights were never an issue, the gay vote would have been split in the same fashion as the rest of the nation (51% Bush, 48% Kerry). But even if we assume that it would be split 50/50, we see a 54% increase in Kerry supporters simply because of this one issue. To put that in perspective, you have to imagine some issue that is so big that it caused over half of all Bush supporters to change their votes to Kerry. That is one incredible issue.\n\n \n The most you can claim is speculation when it comes to your interpretation. What you've put forth is a hypothetical (that support for Bush would be much higher among gays if it weren't for his stance on gay marriage). It may indeed be true, but there's no way to prove it.\n \n However it is NOT speculation to surmise that for a sizable portion of gay people, other issues trumped gay marriage. There's no other way around it. The only other possibility is that they voted for some other reason than the issues at hand in the election (political allegiance, for instance)--unlikely as polarized as that election was and the way both parties \"got out the vote.\"\n \n I think (and most pundits seem to agree) that it was a matter of national security and anti-terrorism trumping other issues. So for a significant and sizable number of gay people, gay marriage takes a back seat to other issues. I don't think it indicates a weakness for you to admit to such--it should be complimentary that gay people are multi-faceted when it comes to issues, and it is. \n \n \nSo yes, it's true that gay people don't vote based only on gay rights, but the issue is incredibly important to most of them; even the 23% that voted Bush had a really tough time doing it.

It's a political issue, and those who work in favor of same-sex marriage are no more militant than you working against it now. \n \n Those working in favor of same-sex marriage are no more radical than you are when you work against it. Same-sex couples are not being denied peace and harmony because of the gay rights movement, nor are their sex lives being dragged out into public.\n \n So really, I think that every word of your second paragraph implies something that isn't true. You can imply that gay rights activists to be \"radical and militant\", and you can imply that they are destroying peace and harmony or dragging people's sex lives into the open, but these things are again nothing but completely untrue. Because none of these are true, there is no support for the idea that most gay people do not support the gay rights movement.

It may indeed be true, but there's no way to prove it.\n\n \n I'm not proving anything, I'm using evidence and reasoning to come up with the only theory that has evidence supporting it. There is indeed no reason to believe that sexual orientation affects one's position on any issue except for same-sex marriage, and because of this, the only explanation supported by reasoning is the one I have provided; though it may certainly not be true.\n \n \nHowever it is NOT speculation to surmise that for a sizable portion of gay people, other issues trumped gay marriage. There's no other way around it. The only other possibility is that they voted for some other reason than the issues at hand in the election (political allegiance, for instance)--unlikely as polarized as that election was and the way both parties \"got out the vote.\"\n\n \n I don't think this is under debate. It is also NOT speculation to notice that the overwhelming majority of gay people voted in favor of the candidate who supports gay rights, suggesting that the issue is very important to them, which is indeed my point.\n \n \nI think (and most pundits seem to agree) that it was a matter of national security and anti-terrorism trumping other issues.

I don't think it indicates a weakness for you to admit to such--it should be complimentary that gay people are multi-faceted when it comes to issues, and it is.\n\n \n I surely do admit it to be such; I know gay people who voted for Bush because of his stance on national security and terrorism as well as the economy and taxation. I argued that Bush was wrong in his handling of these issues to them, but no one ever seems to change their mind once it's made up.\n \n \nMaybe, maybe not. There's no way to know or measure how \"tough\" it was for any given amount of that percentage.\n\n \n Again, I'm not scientifically proving anything, but I'm offering my stance on the issue, as well as reasoning and evidence to support my theory. I can also say that of those gay people I know who supported Bush, they were very conflicted. This can also be seen when looking at the Log Cabin Republicans (Republicans who support gay rights) who refused to endorse Bush because he did not support gay rights. They made no endorsement, having their members vote for whomever they deemed best. Their lack of endorsement indicates a strong conflict.\n \n I don't mean to argue that gay people only value gay rights, but I do mean that their rights are very important to them, which is in complete contradiction to what Voice of Reason is trying to state.",

That doesn't mean they didn't care about gay marriage or were aginst it. You are using some groos genralizations and you pull out this 23& number out of you a**.

You make these errounous claims all the time and never back them up. \n\n \n I'd say that's pretty damning. jyoshu stated that \"apparently a sizeable portion of gay people at least don't consider it as important as other issues\" and you attacked his 23% number.",

He said some erronous number and I asked him to back it up, surprisingly he did, but he is not known for doing such.\n \n Secondly, How is that damning, the majority of gays are in favor of same sex marriage, that fact thedy voted for bush knowing his stance doesn't mean they are with him on the same sex marriage issue, it means they didn't like Kerry. Did ya ever hear of the log cabin republicans? He hasn't made some amazing point. In fact I think he has made no point at all.\n \n The fact the a group of people voted for a cadidate doesn't mean a thing, the could have been voting against the other cadidtate. I voted for kerry, not because I liked him, but I hate Bush. What has jyoshu really said...nothing. And you my friend are making a mountain outta a mo hill",
