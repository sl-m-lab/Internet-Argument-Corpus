   "Democratic frontrunner Howard Dean pledged monday night to 'break up' Fox News Channel along with other conservative news outlets owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.\n \n Chris Matthews to Howard Dean: \"Would you break up Fox.\" Dean shot back, \"On ideological grounds, absolutely yes.\"\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2003/12/2/110210.shtml\n \n Dean did not comment on breaking up other media giants like CBS, ABC, or NBC. Hmmm....How fair of him to single out Fox!\n \n Dean said what he said. He's played his hand....\n \n Just file this under 'Liberals: My speech or no speech.'",
