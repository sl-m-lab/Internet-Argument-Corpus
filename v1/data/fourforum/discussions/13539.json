   "Unlike our sheeple neighbors across the pond, Americans aren't embracing automated traffic cameras. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n\n Shudder speed\n Rise of the stealthy traffic camera fuels drivers' disgust\n \n By Neely Tucker\n Washington Post Staff Writer \n Thursday, November 5, 2009 \n You rip open the envelope and there it is: Another darned photo-enforcement traffic ticket. \n The photograph, the zoom-in on the tag, it's you, baby. Your car. Two weeks ago. Forty-one in a 30-mph zone. \n It's from your favorite municipality. You can pay $40 now or $80 later. You can also contest it, the infraction letter says, and that's a laugh. You remember seeing that the folks who went down to fight their automated tickets in Montgomery County got convicted 99.7 percent of the time. Like a Soviet election, you think, a sham, a joke, and you, the chump in the parade. \n There's something that doesn't smell right about these tickets, but you're not quite sure what. \n Is it the huge profits the government and their cohorts, the camera manufacturers, make on them? The District doubling the number of tickets it issued just two years ago, raking in $36 million last fiscal year? The fact that Redflex, one of the big manufacturers of these cameras, posted a 48 percent jump in revenue last year while the rest of the economy tanked? \n People get worked up. Put these cyborgs on a ballot, and the voters beat them to the pavement. \n Three cities Tuesday -- two in Ohio, one in Texas -- voted to rip the things down. In College Station, Tex., the camera manufacturer and their subcontractors reportedly spent $60,000 campaigning to keep them in place, more than five times the amount raised by the opposition, and lost anyway. Voters in Chillicothe, Ohio, went against the cameras at a rate of 72 percent. In Heath, Ohio, the mayor got caught removing anti-camera campaign signs from an intersection. He, and the cameras, got sent packing. \n washingtonpost.com \n",
