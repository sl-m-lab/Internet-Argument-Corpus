   "Across California, hotels, event planners and tourism professionals are rolling out the red carpet for gay couples, hoping to lure lucrative new business from their wedding celebrations, once the state begins issuing same-sex marriage licenses on June 17. \n \n \"They're saying 'the gays are going to save our business,'\" said Cindy Sproul, co-owner of the Rainbow Wedding Network, about her wedding vendor clients. Since the May 15 ruling, which cleared the way for legalizing gay marriage in California this month, Sproul says visitors to her site, which specializes in gay weddings, have doubled, and so have the amount of advertisers. \n \n While most Americans are cutting back on travel in a souring economy, the anticipated boom is a hotly sought-after growth sector for the travel industry. \n \n \"Spending by resident same-sex couples on their weddings, and by out-of-state couples on tourism and their weddings, will boost California's economy by over $683.6 million in direct spending,\" over the next three years, according to a new study from the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law, based on the experience of Massachusetts and Vermont, after they extended marriage or civil unions to same-sex couples. \n \n \"Vermont was the first destination that allowed civil unions and -- 'boom' -- right away, there was a demonstrable increase, a big uptick, in travel to Vermont, by couples going there to have a civil union. ... You'll see the same thing with California. ... It's kind of a no-brainer,\" said Ed Salvato, editor in chief of The Out Traveler. \n \n The study estimates that more than approximately 67,000 gay couples will flock from out-of-state to get hitched in California, bringing with them more than $200 million in tourism and hospitality revenue. \n \n Unlike in Massachusetts, where out-of-state residents cannot officially wed, California law welcomes visitors who want to get married in the state. \n http://www.abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=5038636&page=1\n \n And I think once California sees that uptick, it's going to be even harder for the religious anti-gay machinery to persuade people that it's the government's business to tell gays they can't marry...",

   "It's a positive thing for everyone. Gay couples are finally able to have equal rights for their spouse and can now begin to live their lives knowing that the state does recognize their status as a married couple and have the same rights as hetro couples. \n \n The state also wins and so does buisness's as pointed out and it may be the one thing that could save the third largest states economy and bring a bit of stability or at least inject some form of economic growth.

   "Interesting, thanks. I guess \"marriage shall be contracted\" doesn't mean what I think it means. :)\n\n \n I think it ends up meaning what the state officials in Massachusetts decide it means, or what justices ruling on cases decide it means. \n \n Mitt Romney is no longer governor of Massachusetts, and the current governor there, Deval Patrick, supports equal marriage rights. That will make the state more inclined to recognize marriages, I suspect. But I am no legal expert on this by any means. \n \n I just met a man this morning who used to be a woman and who transitioned in the 1980s. His former state of Minnesota recognizes sex changes, and he legally married in that state. Under Minnesota law, his was a legal, opposite-sex marriage. He and his wife later moved because of a job change to Ohio, which does not recognize sex changes. Under Ohio law, he is still a woman. Under Minnesota law he is a man. Ohio also does not recognize same-sex marriages. Is he legally married still in Ohio? I asked him that, and he said that he has never encountered a situation in which his marriage has been challenged in Ohio, and so the question has not been tested. Anyone seeing him would not recognize him as a transgender person; he looks like a man. His employer gives him family benefits as a married person. \n \n This man's legal marriage situation is unclear in Ohio. But so long as no one challenges the legality of his marriage, or he does not seek a divorce in Ohio, he is in effect married. He does receive federal benefits of marriage, because he is recognized as a man, apparently, by the federal government. His passport says that he is male. \n \n The refusal of some states to honor and recognize all marriages performed in other states has resulted in legal ambiguity when it comes to marriages.",
