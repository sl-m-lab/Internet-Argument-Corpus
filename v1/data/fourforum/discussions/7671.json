Going through life, the person feels like (in this case anyway) that they are a woman trapped in a man's body. Yet, while they feel this way, they are not gay. At some point they may go to the doctor and say \"make me a __________\" or what ever and then they end up spending (1-3, I don't really remember the exact number) years as a member of the opposite gender. They also take hormonal therapy. If a man is going to become a woman, he takes estrogen hormones. A woman takes Testosterone hormones.

Parents are going to want to be the one to educate their kids on sensitive or taboo issues. And society (probably psychologists) still view people with transsexual issues as having something wrong.
