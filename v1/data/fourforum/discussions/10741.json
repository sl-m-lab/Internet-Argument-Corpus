   "Hypothetical situation. There's a guy who looks to be about 30 years old, but you suspect that he's really 10,000 years old. A routine doctor's appointment finds nothing odd about him.\n \n What tests might you run to check if someone were really 10,000 years old? Two restirictions: you can't lock him up for 50 years and see if he ages, and you can't do anything that would kill an ordinary person.\n \n An odd question, I know, but I started thinking about it, and it seemed like an interesting scientific puzzle. I would check for bioaccumulating substances, like heavy metals, to see if he had way more than a 30 year old could have. A positive result would be evidence of advanced age, but a negative result wouldn't necessarily mean anything. That which keeps him alive could also get rid of heavy metals. Can anyone else come up with anything?",

As long as you are taking in carbon, either through eating for animals or via the atmosphere for plants, then your carbon ratios will match those of the atmosphere. It's only after death that radioactive decay becomes a factor, since at that point the C14 is no longer being replenished.\n \n \n\n But what makes you think a 30 year old looking guy is really 10,000 years old?
