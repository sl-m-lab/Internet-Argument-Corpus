   "Lot offered up his own daughters to be raped. So why was Lot singled out by God as being worth saving?\n \n Open Letter To 'Dr.' Laura\n Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses sex advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance. The following is an open letter to 'Dr.' Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet:\n \n Dear Dr. Laura:\n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your radio show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n \n I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific Bible laws and how to follow them. \n a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? She's 18 and starting University. Will the slave buyer continue to pay for her education by law? \n c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. I'm sure you have found a way to do this and can share it with me.\n d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should this be a neighborhood improvement project?\n f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? Would contact lenses help?\n h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?\n i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear hemp gloves?\n j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,\n J. Kent Ashcroft (author of the original version)",

And it seems to me to be unfair to only pick and choose those that support your claim and ignore the rest. I think that if you want to take a strict interpretation of the bible, than you have to acknowledge everything it says, and say that it is all correct.

For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 2If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. 3But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, 4because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. \n 5Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: \n \"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, \n but a body you prepared for me; \n 6with burnt offerings and sin offerings \n you were not pleased. \n 7Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll-- \n I have come to do your will, O God.' \"[1] 8First he said, \"Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them\" (although the law required them to be made). 9Then he said, \"Here I am, I have come to do your will.\" He sets aside the first to establish the second. 10And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Hebrews 10:1-10 \n \n \n This quote shows there is no longer any need for sacrifice with Christ as he was the ultimate sacrifice ending the requirement for the repetative sacrifices of the law. The law just fortold of his coming and gave direction to humans untill Christ came, and now that he has come the law is no longer required.",

The very words of Jesus Himself and the very words of God Himself. There is an Almighty God in heaven who had these things written down, and many things also, so that people could read of them and repent of sin.\n \n I believe You know exactly what I said when I stated that the Bible recorded that God condemn homosexuality as a \"grevious sin\". God spoke the words, it was written down by man who was inspired by God to do so, and it is faithfully recorded so that people who practice vile sins like lesbianism, homosexuality can read the Bible, or be preached to about it and repent of their wicked ways.\n \n Listen....The men who wrote the Bible were given those words to write by God Himself. You obviously reject them. People looking at your posts can see your sarcasm and mocking of the Bible IMPLIED by what you post. You by doing this are only helping me out tremendously. All I Want is for those who believe in the Bible, yet don't really follow it, or read it enough to understand all that it says to not be deceived by those like yourself who would say that lesbianism, homosexuality, and other sinful, deviant lifestyles are 'ok' in the eyes of the God who had men write down everything that is written in the Bible.\n \n What it comes down to is this..If you are a lesbian, homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual who fornicates, an adulterer, liar, thief, etc...

Why should god forgive you why are you so special? \n \n Now try and understand this, if you can. Do you dislike gays because its written in the bible or do you dislike gays for any other reason?\n Because if you dislike gays because of the bible, that would make you a sinner, you will be going against gods instructions, it does say in the bible love your fellow man, and the bible states you should be forgiving, so that means god created everybody, which also includes gays, so you dislike gods creation, therefore you have hate and you are a sinner.\n on the hand if you dislike gays for any other reason, it simply means you are a homophobe.",

   "Darkest Shadow....I'm not telling you what to do, but there are individuals who, no matter what Biblical evidence you show, will NEVER change their mind on the sin of homosexuality. To argue with them is an exercise in futility. They have no desire to know the truth, at least 95-99% of them.\n \n I have come across scores of people who have siad ...\"Well the sin of sodom was attempted rape, or inhospitibleness, and when I showed them that the Bible records God's intention to destroy the place long before the angels even stepped foot in Sodom, they then change the reason they believe God destroyed Sodom to something else. When you show them scriptures that in 2 Peter chapter 2 giving the reason for God rescuing Lot from Sodom was the homosexuals lust for one another they will STILL try and say the verses mean something else.They WILL NOT accept the fact that God destroyed Sodom for the sin of homosexuality. Amazing.... there are scores of verses that show that adultery and drunkenness are sins just like homosexuality is, yet I see no drunkards, adulterers saying that what they are doing isn't sin, like I see homosexuals doing...\n \n I wonder why that is.....\n \n I have went 'round and round' with some who finally said that they didn't believe in the Bible anyway, yet I ask them why they were arguing with me over what the scriptures said when they didn't believe that the Bible was given by God to man in the first place....\n \n They doth protest too much over something that they claim they don't even believe in...The Bible....Kinda like the atheist fighting the God he/she claims doesn't exist.\n \n I have heard gays say, \"If you don't like gay sex, don't practice it\"...Well if they dont like Bible preaching/posts/threads that show from the Bible the sin of homosexuality, then don't believe it, yet don't try and deceive others who may want to know the truth about God's Word...\n \n My goal now is to educate those who generally believe in the Bible yet don't read/follow it much...\n \n See you around...\n \n God bless....",

So many who say that they don't believe in the Bible yet fight against it so much.\n \n \nMaybe you dont like arguing because YOU know what your saying is distorted religious rantings and that intellegent people will see through your brainwashed homophobic agenda.\n \n \n I just said I don't mind debating..um arguing, whatever you want to call it DUH! emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nTraveller, i would bet you had a strict religious upringing and that you are also gay, and i bet you hate yourself for who you are and cant accept who you are because of your religious brainwashing. Or youve been raped and hate gays for that too. Am i right, or partly right? I think i might be.\n\n \n No, wrong...I know it is hard for you to understand, but there are people,lots and lots who actually believe that the Bible is the Word of God. Most Americans do in fact, sorry! Brainwashing? Actually what you have going on is those who for some reason want to 'brainwash' people into thinking that the Bible doesn't call homosexuality a sin. Those who don't even believe in it...Ammazing...They clearly have an agenda...Anyway, you can say what you want to...I have heard that \"you must be a closet homo\", and all that, but the raped by gays one is a first. I feel sorry for the men who were raped by homos. Go to my gay gang thread. There you will see men who were raped by gays. Its in the first forum. All that you accuse me of though is quite untrue, though. Maybe you are gay and are having feelings of being ashamed of being gay. Maybe you know that God loves the sinner but hates sin like homosexuality\n \n \nPlease correct me if im wrong, there has to be a reason for your hate, i just cant believe that someone who is able to use a computer and read and write can have such beliefs, assuming you are actually writing and not dictating.\n \n \n Your smartalecky remarks against me show me that it is you who are full of hate. No, me quoting from the Bible can never be hate. It is a book of love. Gods love toward all sinners. In it, though, He commands all sinners to repent of sin, even the sin of homosexuality.\n \n \nI would love to see your psychiatric report.\n \n \n The AMA once said that homosexuality was a mental disorder until they were tyranizzed into changing their position on it. My mental state is quite fine, thank you. Your psychiatric report though might show that you for some reason seem to want to debate/argue with someone who quotes the Bible, a book you don't believe in, a book you call a fantasy...It would at least show that you tend to not be too smart for doing so. \n \n \nPlease dont think im being personal, but i cant belive someone can actually have views and beliefs like yours.\n\n \n Actually, I find it amazing that YOU have such views that you do...views that run counter to the majority of what society believes...You evidently are the one who needs to get professional help.\n \n emoticon_smile",

What greater love can there be than that? If I stood on the side of the road, knowing that the bridge down the road had collapsed and didn't tell drivers that it was collapsed, that would be the greatest form of hate.

By your reckoning they are, and so are all the people that support the war. so why go to war? Do 2 bads make a good, i dont think so. \n \n \n I've said it before, everyone is a sinner. And I'm not just argueing against gays, I'm in a lot of other forums as well! \n \n \n \n \nI would like to say that it seems that either you dont know what your talking about or you have been so brainwashed into believing what youve been told. Or your simply a homophobe who hides behing religion to spread his homophobic views\n \n \n \n I know what I am talking about. And no, I'm not a homofob, and calling me one is slander.\n \n \n \n \n Did I miss anything Plotter? Talk back soon.......",

   "Actually' those whom you wrongly call 'homophobes' aren't lacking in love for their gay neighbors. Those who love them them(gays) the most are the ones who show them God's love by showing them that they are sinning, and going to hell by not repenting of homosexuality...\n\n \n Your definition of love leaves a whole lot to be desired. \n \n Let's just say for example that you have a gay child. You tell him that his feelings of who he is attracted to are sinful that will send him to hell. Now lets suppose he acts on those feelings when he gets older. Are you going to push him out of your life by saying...\"God has condemned you to hell. Because God has condemned you, I will also sit with the same judgement. You are an abomination. Get out of my house.\"\n \n Do you call this love for your child?\n \n \nLook, I don't have to take the Christian bashing that I do on here...I tell of Christs love for all, including the homosexual, adulterer, thief, etc...I do it because the Bible says that Christians are to \"Go ye into ALL the world and preach the Gospel.\" \n \n \n I don't believe you are being bashed as much for being a Christian as you are your interpretation of Christianity. I have met many people that calls their self a Christian, Catholic, etc., that do not judge their brothers. That treat them with the same love they give their self. They understand the meaning of Jesus's two most important commandments...Love God and love your neighbor as you do yourself. But it is quite clear that you have no understanding of this or the true meaning of love. That is what you are being bashed for. You are backwards. What you see as love is actually a judgement. Judge and ye shall be judged. You bring it on yourself. You choose it.\n \n \nI show God's love by telling the gay person that God loves them, gave His Son to die for them and that they must repent of the gay lifestyle in order to go to heaven. What greater love can there be than that? \n\n \n Your \"show of God's love\" is what drove me away from the Christian church. I did not want to know the god you speak of. In one breath he says he loves you, but in the next breath, you say he will send his children to hell should they act on the feelings that God created them with. And you call it love? \n \n When I was a young girl going to the Christian church, I always wonder why my Mother was not God. She loved her 15 different kids unconditionally. Her love for her children far outweighed this false god's love for his children. \n \n \n \nIf I stood on the side of the road, knowing that the bridge down the road had collapsed and didn't tell drivers that it was collapsed, that would be the greatest form of hate. Well, I must tell gays that they will die and go to hell if they don't repent. Simple as that...\n\n \n That is simply your duty as a human to warn people of a bridge out. When you tell gays they are going to hell if they don't repent ,to get to your version of God, you are in judgment. You are appointing yourself as God...capable of deciding who goes to this hell that you fear. \n \n \n \n Should those who see drunkards staggering down the street and show them Gods love by telling them that Christ can deliver them from their drunkenness be labelled Wine-o-phobes? According to you they should be. LOL. ROTFL....\n\n \n I have noticed in many of your post you have this insane laughter at the end of something that is not funny. You may want to look into that. \n \n I consider a phobia as a fear. It is quite clear that you fear gays. People fear what they don't understand...just as you obviously don't understand the \"wino\" by your description above.\n \n You really should remove the plank out of your own eyes before you try and remove someone elses. I see that your plank has distorted your vision.\n \n Lilac Angel",

   "God doesn't dislike gays! He loves everyone!! He simply says that they are sinning and need to change. And I go with him. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n Treating your gay brothers as less worthy of their unalienable rights that our Creator gave to us is a sin (lacking love). But you seem to ignore the plank in your own eyes. What does your bible (your god) say about that?\n \n \n \nI slam gays? What? I dissagree with their morals, and believe they are sinning.....nowhere did I EVER say I hate or slam gays.\n\n \n Considering words are only 7 percent of communications, your words don't have to speak it for it to be true. Your concepts speak loudly. You slam gays, even if you are not capable of seeing that within your own self. Just because you can't see something, does not mean it does not exist.\n \n \n WHAT? God says homosexuality is wrong. And guess what: We're ALL sinners!!! You me, EVERYONE!!! I do love them as fellow human beings! I simply dissagree with their morals, and believe they are sinning! What's so hard about this? \n\n \n God has never said homosexuality is wrong. That is simply your interpretation of an ancient man's interpretations. Beings you consider yourself a sinner also, why not remove the plank out of your eyes before you remove someone else's. Oh, I get it...you ignore the verses that don't pertain to your belief.\n \n \n \n \n \nWe are naturally flawed beings thanks to Adam's and Eve's sin. You can't always trust common sense.\n\n \n Maybe it is because you are not using common sense. Maybe that is because you don't know what common sense is. You show no common sense when it comes to rationalizing your interpretations of the bible, so how can you know it cannot be trusted? How can you trust something you do not know?\n \n \n \nI know what I am talking about. And no, I'm not a homofob, and calling me one is slander.\n\n \n Deny that you are all you want. Phobia's are created out of fear. People fear what they don't understand. You clearly do not understand the gay person (just as you clearly do not understand God's unconditional love.) Therefore, you have a phobia when it comes to gays. If you feel it is slanderous for many of us to see the facts about your phobia, feel free to sue us. I won't fear it, okay.\n \n Lilac Angel\n \n p.s. I thought I would let you know that I find your user name quite appropriate for you. You are coming from the darkest shadows.

   "Treating your gay brothers as less worthy of their unalienable rights that our Creator gave to us is a sin (lacking love). But you seem to ignore the plank in your own eyes. What does your bible (your god) say about that?\n \n \n \n \n Considering words are only 7 percent of communications, your words don't have to speak it for it to be true. Your concepts speak loudly. You slam gays, even if you are not capable of seeing that within your own self.

   "I think fundamentally unless people are willing to take responsibility for their opinions and argue that homosexuality is morally wrong on some grounds other than religious doctrine, they can't expect their arguments to be respected. If people believe things simply because they are told it is so, there is no use arguing about it with them. \n \n \n I guess it just bothers me that some christians feel a religious elitism over any other religion, sometimes even over other sects of chrisitianity.

Again, unless they can argue on some basis other than doctrine that homosexual activity or identity is harmful, this is moot.\n So, although I agree with you whole-heartedly, it is important to differenciate between a sort of moral \"laissez-faire\", and true diversity. Homosexuality is disputed on either the grounds of religious doctrine (\"we love gays, we just want them to not be gay!\") or prejudice (\"fags are disgusting\"). This isn't at all the same thing as attempting to prevent someone from harming others.\n \n BTW, both the \"neutral\" religious doctrine and the blatant prejudice standpoints are homophobic. Homophobia is not about intolerance towards harmful behaviour, as the religious homophobic claim. It is a skewed perspective which problematizes a neutral form of sexual expression.",
