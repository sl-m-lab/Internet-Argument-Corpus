In the case of organisms with rapid generation times, you can get several generations worth of evolutionary change in a matter of years or months. Heck, some bacteria reproduce multiple generations every day. That's why Richard Lenski's laboratory experiment on bacterial evolution, which has been going since the 1980's, has been able to watch evolution happening, right up close: there have been tens of thousands of generations.\n \n So to give a full answer to your question: I think that evolution requires a number of generations to work, with precise amounts of time depending on the generation times of specific organisms; but this process has been going on for millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, even billions of years.\n \n \nA potential one, that&#8217;s the word I used.\n\n \n So, in answer to the OP's question, you should have said, \"No.\"\n \n \nThe conclusion of Darwinism was reached by Darwin, then Huxley, Spencer, and countless others who started with the conclusion without worrying themselves about details of what led up to their conclusion.

The fact that his ideas are now called \"social Darwinism\" is the product of not only a misunderstanding about what the implications of Darwinism actually are, but also of a distortion of history.\n \n And as for Huxley and other biologists, I have yet to see a single one who fails to grasp the basis for the Darwinian conclusion. I have, however, seen plenty of creationists who understand neither the conclusion nor its support.\n \n \nIt only fails when looked at through the atheistic lens.\n\n \n No, it fails when looked at through the lens of methodological naturalism, which demands that conclusions about how nature works be based on observable evidence concerning natural mechanisms. There is not one jot of evidence for creationist claims about notions like \"the fountains of the deep\" or the earth being 10,000 years old or less.

Tides being generated by the Moon's gravitational field.\n And then there's the Isotopes of Moon rock collected by the Apollo missions which show how old the moon is.",

   "It depends on what the definition of evolution is in any given discussion, it constantly changes. If it means new resistance to diseases, changes within species, the types of things we can see and work with today, then what you say is true. If it means single celled life formed billions of years ago, evolving into all life on earth today (Darwinism) then we can't compare that to the certainty of the characteristics of gravity. \n \n I never made that claim, I simply explained in one paragraph that if Darwinism (a millions of years process) is held up to a certainty that the earth has only gone around the sun 15,000 times, the millions of years process can't possibly have happened. \n \n We could probably multiply how many times you've said it with how many times all militant atheists have said it on all forums since Al Gore invented the internet, but it still wouldn't change what the truth is. I realize that it remains politically correct to maintain that science isn't controlled by atheists, but political correctness and truth don't necessarily maintain a prefect correlation with each other as changes in either happen. The truth is that science has been evolving, it has been increasingly controlled by atheists for 150 years, and that has greatly increased in only the past few decades, as big political and financial interests have become involved. \n \n Scientists and atheism - FreeThoughtPedia\n \n This link shows the \"evolution\" of the erosion of religion in the scientific community. As the final sentence says;\n \n There are many in science like Bruce, or Nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg, who do everything they can to use science to \"weaken the hold of religion\", (Weinberg's words) then, when asked a few simple questions, do a complete 180 and claim that the Pope and 99% of all Christians on the planet are primordial soup lovers, and agree with the science found In all the following books; \n \n Darwin's Dangerous Idea / Daniel Dennett - 1995\n The End of Faith/ Sam Harris - 2004\n The God Delusion/ Richard Dawkins - 2006\n Letter to a Christian Nation/ Sam Harris - 2006\n The Atheist Universe / David Mills - 2006\n Breaking the Spell/ Daniel Dennett - 2006\n Everything you know about God is wrong/ Russ Kick - 2007\n The Quotable Atheist / Jack Huberman - 2007\n The Atheist Bible / Joan Konner - 2007\n Nothing - Something to Believe / Lalli Nica - 2007\n The Portable Atheist / Christopher Hitchens - 2007\n God is Not Great / Christopher Hitchens - 2007\n God - the failed hypothesis - How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist / Victor Stenger - 2007\n 50 Reasons People Give For Believing in God/ Guy Harrison - 2008\n Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists / Barker/Dawkins - 2008\n \n Notice the dates on them, they're very recent. They wouldn't have been bestsellers in the 1960's. The scientific community is making progress in atheist indoctrination. Amazon reviews show at least some mention of science in every one of those books. I normally wouldn't waste my money on them, but I did decide to pick up Victor Stenger's, the one with the LIE in the subtitle, \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\". When pressed, most atheists will admit that science can't do that. But only when pressed. If not pressed, then that subtitle is winked and nodded at. \n \n That's another politically correct statement. Surveys like the one above, and detailed looks at their theism and the scientific community's need for them, and the truth becomes much more clear.\n\n \n evolution is observable in our lifetime as immunity changes, microevolution etc, but there is a massive amount of evidence to support macroevolution; so much in fact that we can conclude that it did happen; so much evidence to support macroevolution that we can compare the certainty of evolution to the certainty of gravity. its surprising how evolution is given so little educational time, everyone who sees the evidence always says 'wow, why wasnt i taught this in school?' i wish not to waste my time outlining all of the evidence for you - ill name one or two if you wish, but the resources are easily available and you can find them everywhere if you just look. oh, and abiogenesis has nothing to do with evolution.\n \n the earth has gone around the sun 4.6 billion years ago. if evolution from one species to another takea 1 million years, then it could have happened 4600 different, independent times in the history of the world. scientists speculate that life started around 3.5 billion years ago, but thats still evolution happening 3500 times! to say the earth is 15 000 years old is a disgrace to ignorance.\n \n science is all about opening up new doors and discovering new things, searching for evidence and using reason and logic to decipher them, and thus most scientists are atheists, yes. but in no way does that mean science as a whole is atheist. to anthopomorphize science, it knows nothing unless its discovered, and since a God or anything supernatural has not been discovered, science does not know about it. so what if leading scientists reject God? scientists do not make up science.\n \n \nAny more atheists, who just automatically agree with other atheists, no matter what they say? What do you think of Matthew's total disregarding of the Cambrian explosion, and the time involved? What do you think of Pandion's line by line cut up of what I said, without understanding it?\n\n \n very few atheists agree in a lot of points - Matthew, pandion and i have disagreed before, and im sure we disagree with a million other things. however, i do agree with Matthew because evolution does not need millions of years to operate. tests of evolution have turned out successful after 1 year. look it up if you need. the cambrian explosion is an example of evolution happening very rapidly.",

You have said absurd things like over thinking evolution while trying to argue against it, claiming that it is not proper to identify rules in biology, resisting the idea of any further isolation and differentiation of evolutionary mechanisms beyond 'benefit is selected, advancement is benefit'.\n \n \nnow say you find some cockroach droppings - thats evidence that there has been cockroaches in your house, and someone can look at the poo and tell you that isnt cockroach poo, its moth poo and that would be a perfectly valid argument.

   "Fallacy: Burden of Proof \n...In many situations, one side has the burden of proof resting on it. This side is obligated to provide evidence for its position. The claim of the other side, the one that does not bear the burden of proof, is assumed to be true unless proven otherwise. The difficulty in such cases is determining which side, if any, the burden of proof rests on. In many cases, settling this issue can be a matter of significant debate. In some cases the burden of proof is set by the situation. For example, in American law a person is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty (hence the burden of proof is on the prosecution). As another example, in debate the burden of proof is placed on the affirmative team. As a final example, in most cases the burden of proof rests on those who claim something exists (such as Bigfoot, psychic powers, universals, and sense data).\n \n Examples of Burden of Proof\n Bill: \"I think that we should invest more money in expanding the interstate system.\"\n Jill: \"I think that would be a bad idea, considering the state of the treasury.\"\n Bill: \"How can anyone be against highway improvements?\"\n \n Bill: \"I think that some people have psychic powers.\"\n Jill: \"What is your proof?\"\n Bill: \"No one has been able to prove that people do not have psychic powers.\"\n \n \"You cannot prove that God does not exist, so He does.\"\n",

   "There is ample empirical evidence for the Theory of Evolution. If you think you can disprove it, you've got your work cut out for you. At least you have plenty of material to work with... after all, it's been accumulating for over a hundred years. If you succeed--scrupulously adhering, of course, to the same Scientific Method that those who produced it used--you'll make history. No one's been able to do it till now, but don't let that discourage you. I'm sure Fox News would fork over a small fortune to interview the person who put the entire scientific community to shame.\n \n There is no empirical evidence for the existence of God, however, so nothing to disprove as far as that goes. No one can disprove something for which there is no concrete evidence in the first place. (And no, 2000-year-old, contradictory, mistranslated, Bronze Age oral histories that weren't even written down for hundreds of years do NOT qualify as \"empirical evidence\"... in law, they call it \"hearsay\"... any more than the fact that millions, even billions of people have believed them to be true means they must be.

   "This may also prove useful. (It's a bit elementary, but apparently some people need to have things spelled out for them.) \n \n Evolution: Fact and Theory (ActionBioscience)\nEvidence for Evolution, and its Significance in our Lives\n \n It is impossible to review all the evidence for evolution in a short article such as this. However, the following offers a sample of the kinds of evidence that have been discovered and confirmed repeatedly by scientists. These examples also illustrate the importance of this evidence for science and society more generally.\n [*]Evidence from fossils. Based on myriad similarities and differences between living species, evolutionary biology makes predictions about the features of ancestral forms. For example, numerous features indicate that birds are derived from reptilian ancestors. By contrast, these data reject the possibility that birds were derived from other groups, such as flying insects. Scientists have discovered fossil birds with feathers and legs like modern birds, but which also have teeth, clawed digits on their forelimbs, and a tailbone like their reptilian ancestors. Fossils are especially important evidence for evolution because, with little effort, each of us can use our eyes and minds to observe and interpret the dinosaur and other ancient fossils in public museums.\n \n [*]Evidence from genetics. The genomes of all organisms contain overwhelming evidence for evolution. All living species share the same basic mechanism of heredity using DNA (or RNA in some viruses) to encode genes that are passed from parent to offspring, and which are transcribed and translated into proteins during each organism&#8217;s life. Using DNA sequences, biologists quantify the genetic similarities and differences among species, in order to determine which species are more closely related to one another and which are more distantly related. In doing so, biologists use essentially the same evidence and logic used to determine paternity in lawsuits. The pattern of genetic relatedness between all species indicates a branching tree that implies divergence from a common ancestor. Within this tree of life, there are also occasional reticulations where two branches fuse, rather than separate. (For example, mitochondria are organelles found in the cells of plants and animals. Mitochondria have their own genes, which are more similar to genes in bacteria than to genes on the chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Thus, one of our distant ancestors arose from a symbiosis of two different cell types.) The genetic similarity between species, which exists by virtue of evolution from the same ancestral form, is an essential fact that underlies biomedical research. This similarity allows us to begin to understand the effects of our own genes by conducting research on genes from other species. For example, genes that control the process of DNA repair in bacteria, flies, and mice have been discovered to influence certain cancers in humans. These findings also suggest strategies for intervention that can be explored in other species before testing on humans.\n \n [*]Evolution in action. Evolutionary change continues to this day, and it will proceed so long as life itself exists. In recent years, many bacterial pathogens have evolved resistance to antibiotics used to cure infections, thereby requiring the development of new and more costly treatments. In some frightening cases, bacteria have evolved resistance to every available antibiotic, so there is no longer any effective treatment. In the case of HIV, which causes AIDS, significant viral evolution occurs within the course of infection of a single patient, and this rapid evolution enables the virus to evade the immune system. Many agricultural pests have evolved resistance to chemicals that farmers have used for only a few decades. As we work to control diseases and pests, the responsible organisms have been evolving to escape our controls. Moreover, scientists can perform experiments to study evolution in real time, just as experiments are used to observe dynamic processes in physics, chemistry, and other branches of biology. To study evolution in action, scientists use organisms like bacteria and fruitflies that reproduce quickly, so they can see changes that require many generations.\n Conclusions\n \n Evolutionary biology is a strong and vigorous field of science. A theoretical framework that encompasses several basic mechanisms is consistent with the patterns seen in nature; and there is abundant evidence demonstrating the action of these mechanisms as well as their contributions to nature. Hence, evolution is both a theory and a set of established facts that the theory explains.\n \n Like every other science, there is scientific debate about some aspects of evolution, but none of these debates appear likely to shake the foundations of this field. There exists no other scientific explanation that can account for all the patterns in nature, only non-scientific explanations that require a miraculous force, like a creator. Such super-natural explanations lie outside of science, which can neither prove nor disprove miracles. Science provides us with a compelling account and explanation of the changing life on Earth. It should also remind us of our good fortune to have come into being and our great responsibility to ensure the continuity of life.\n",

   "the two should not be treated the same for two reasons. first, creationists are always saying evolution is wrong and they have proof (usually this proof is the bible). never once has anyone on these forums said that they can disprove God, that i know of. empty claims are being made towards disproving evolution, whereas no claims are being made towards disproving God.\n \n second, evidence can be refuted. since evolution has evidence, feel free to try and refute it's connection to ToE. on the other hand, God has no evidence whatsoever, which is mainly the reason (for me at least) we atheists dont try to disprove God on these forums - disproving God would be impossible at this point.\n \n let me go back to the cockroaches - to respond to your other post seriously, the illustration is meant to be somewhat rhetoric. trying to disprove God is very much like scrounging every square inch of your house for a cockroach on your hands and knees. you could say that if we kill God, then we have disproven that God exists. i suppose in order to satisfy you, i would say \"prove to me that cockroaches have never existed in your house.\"\n \n now say you find some cockroach droppings - thats evidence that there has been cockroaches in your house, and someone can look at the poo and tell you that isnt cockroach poo, its moth poo and that would be a perfectly valid argument.
