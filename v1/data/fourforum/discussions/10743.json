I heard no indication that the attackers claimed to be Christian. Why do you attach that to the attackers without any knowledge of it? I know you might logically think that anyone who was miffed that someone else killed Jesus might be calling themselves Christian but you have no cause to assume it just for the sake of argument.\n \n They could have been non-believers wanting a reason to beat on the Jews. Afterall, Hitler wasn't religious was he? He just hated jews. You just have a problem with religion and it's easy to pick on hypocrits such as people who might claim to be Christian as they beat on Jews just for being Jews.\n \n And the phrase \"true Christian\" is a real descriptor of people who practice Christ-like behavior. A true Christian would not have done what those goons did.",
