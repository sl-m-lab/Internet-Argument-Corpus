In the hands off most responsible gun owners, it is safe. In the hands of some, they are deadly. Comparing an inanimate object vs. an animate human really falls towards the side of dumb. A physician is a fallable person who practices something which is both an art and a science. A gun, just lays on the shelf until someone picks it up.

   "This whole doctors kill more people than guns thing is really one of the most asinine arguments I have seen used on 4forums since I have been here. I thought it was a cute joke when I read the first post, but after reading further, I realized that you really believe this to be a legitimate argument. That's actually kinda sad. \n \n Think about this for a minute. What actually consititutes an \"accidental\" death by a physician? That should be clearly defined before your \"statistics\" could really take on a true meaning. And yes, owning a gun is not inherently dangerous, no more than owning a physician would be. \n \n A gun is simply a tool, incapable of harming anyone, until it is used. In the hands off most responsible gun owners, it is safe. In the hands of some, they are deadly. Comparing an inanimate object vs. an animate human really falls towards the side of dumb. A physician is a fallable person who practices something which is both an art and a science. A gun, just lays on the shelf until someone picks it up. In the hands of 95% of people, guns are perfectly safe. In the other 5%, they can be more deadly in minutes than a doctor could be in his entire career. I'm not even sure how you could possibly relate guns and doctors in a fair and logical comparison.\n\n \n \n Chill. It was a cute joke. Wow.",

   "Well, before I start on, I'll just give a little context and mention that im roughly libertarian. Im not sure if there is an equivalent in the UK for this, but a real rough generalization of it would be someone who places great importance in personal freedom and individual responsibility over almost all else (of course, this isnt an exactly correct description, but it's the best I can do right now in one line).\n \n My gun stance in a nutshell: A gun is like a parachute, when you really need one, nothing else will do.\n \n As a libertarian, I'd still argue for gun ownership even if it turned out that gun ownership resulted in increased crime levels (which it doesnt). This all goes back to individual responsibility and freedom. I want the freedom to be able to defend myself, and I hate the attempt governments make at forming a monopoly on force. The only protection I want from the government is that from foreign powers (of course, a generalization, so dont nitpick me with hypothetical situations...you get my point here). If someone says to me \"a gun is designed only to kill and maim\", my response would be \"and your point is...\"?\n \n Anyways, I really dont think you can compare firearms to anything like pools, cars, alchohol, etc...except in the case of accidents. I never like the argument for gun control over the issue of accidental gun deaths. Everyone knows guns are dangerous. Accidents with dangerous things happen, and that's a risk the owner takes responsibility for when he/she buys a dangerous object. Here is the only place I can feel good drawing a comparison to cars. Cars are large fast moving objects, and as such are dangerous. When you buy a car you take responsibility for your actions using the car, so accidents are your own fault.\n \n Where i dont really think comparisons should be drawn, however, is between nations. Different places, different cultures, different people.\n \n With gun control, I have no problem with registration (unlike most libertarians), because I know that any attempt to completely confiscate legally owned guns across the country would result in armed resistance that the government would not be able to combat (especially because many military personnel are pro-gun).\n \n I dont even mind restrictions against explosive devices and class 3 weapons(fully-automatics, sawed-off's, and suppressed weapons). If the government went all crazy on us, you could easily storm a national guard armory with a militia (or even just a large armed mob) using semi-automatic rifles (normally you fire at a target in semi-auto anyways) and obtain such weaponry, not to mention the many national guardsmen that would be sympathetic to your cause.\n \n The biggest thing that really ###### me off though are the carry laws where I live (california). Essentially, you can't get a concealed carry permit in California (I say essentially because technically they are allowed to issue them, but it's essentially only for celebrities and political figures). \n \n so...let me get this straight...I can own my handgun for self-defense, but it's illegal for me to carry it to defend against a threat. But then again, the muggers wont have concealed weapons also, right? Of course not, because it is illegal to carry it with you, and muggers and other criminals have a high amount of respect for the law.\n \n Right now the closest thing I have to a quickly accessible firearm when I head away from home is a shotgun in the trunk of my car (But it can't be loaded =/). \n \n The great thing about concealed carry is that it doesnt just benefit the person carrying. Criminals will constantly be unsure whether a location will have one or more armed people, and will think twice about their actions. Also, on the rare occassion that there is a nutjob that goes crazy and isnt thinking about risks/dangers, there are a few people around who can stop them before a deathcount rises.\n \n I also get annoyed with high capacity magazine bans, but Ive written enough.",

That same year in the state of Victoria, there was a 300 percent increase in homicides committed with firearms. The following year, robberies increased almost 60 percent in South Australia. By 1999, assaults had increased in New South Wales by almost 20 percent.\n \n Two years after the ban, there have been further increases in crime: armed robberies by 73 percent; unarmed robberies by 28 percent; kidnappings by 38 percent; assaults by 17 percent; manslaughter by 29 percent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n \n And consider the fact that over the previous 25-year period, Australia had shown a steady decrease both in homicide with firearms and armed robbery - until the ban.\n \n \n\n \n Reference= -Dr. Miguel Faria",

   "....\n \n They aren't armed to a higher degree than the US and most households don't have a machine gun in them. Soldiers in the Swiss Army are required to store their firearm under lock and key and to keep it unloaded at home.\n\n \n \n\n \n The Swiss army has long been a militia trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression. Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training and a mandatory period of service in the Rekrutenschule (the \"recruits-school\"), the initial boot camp, after which Swiss men still remain part of the militia either in a home guard or reserve capacity until age 30 (age 34 for officers). Each such individual keeps his army-issued personal weapon (the Sig 550 5.56x45 mm assault rifle for enlisted personnel, and/or the SIG-Sauer P220 9 mm semi-automatic pistol for officers, medical and postal personnel) at home with a specified quantity of government-issued ammunition (50 rounds 5.6 mm / 48 rounds 9mm), sealed and inspected regularly to ensure that no unlawful use takes place. The emergency ammunition is the only ammunition that requires accounting for during inspections.[1]\n \n A \"shooting society\" somewhere in Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training with service arms, or to shoot for fun. \n When relieved of duty, militiamen have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment. The government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents.\n .....\n Number of guns in circulation\n In some 2001 statistics,[3] it is noted that there are about 420,000 assault rifles stored at private homes, mostly SIG 550 types. Additionally, there are some 320,000 assault rifles and military pistols exempted from military service in private possession, all selective-fire weapons having been converted to semi-automatic operation only. In addition, there are several hundred thousand other semi-automatic small arms classified as carbines. The total number of firearms in private homes is estimated minimally at 1.2 million; more liberal estimates put the number at 3 million.\n ......\n Recreational Shooting\n Recreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland. Practice with weapons is a popular recreation, and is encouraged by the government, particularly for the members of the militia.[5] Swiss firearms-related rights are supported by the organization ProTell.\n \n 200,000 people attend the annual Feldschiessen weekend, which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world.[1][6] Hunting rifles have special exemptions under Swiss law. Purchases from dealers of hunting long guns and of small bore rifles are not even recorded by the dealer. In other words, the dealer would not record the sale of a .30-06 hunting rifle, but would record the sale of a .30-06 Garand.[1] According to chapter 2 article 10 of Swiss law, people over the age of 18 do not need a permit to purchase a rifle for use in hunting, off-duty shooting and sport-shooting events.[4]\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland\n \n\n \n It sure sounds like Switzerland has quite a strong gun culture and has 750,000 automatic and/or assault weapons in private homes. I venture a guess that burglaries aren't a big problem in Switzerland. What do you think?emoticon_xkill",

This incident has caused me to get my carriers permit reinstated since I let it lapse some years ago. After all, I rarely carried it anyway. Only if responsible citizens are armed can we insure that massacres like this wont run on until the killer is down to his last bullet which he uses on himself anyway.",

   "Actually, violent crime ROSE.\n \n http://www.idahoexaminer.com/dailymail/2806/gun-control-statistics\n \n\n \n There are some very serious flaws in information portrayed in this article with regards to Australia and I am afraid I would have to suggest that the above website is not a credible source with regards to this particular article. \n \n At no stage were gun owners \"forced\" to hand in their weapons. They were given a grace period to register the weapons and ensure their shooters licences were up to date. Many individuals chose to hand in their guns and collect the money, but many others chose to register and keep their weapons. \n \n Furthermore, it should be clarified that guns have not been banned from the Australian public. Any adult member of the public can still own and operate a registered legal weapon assuming they hold a current shooters licence.\n \n The statistics quoted in Idaho Examiner are highly questionable. I think you would at least need to quote the actual figures, rather than imagined percentages, if you want a more accurate picture. The Australian Institute of Criminology site is certainly a good start as a more unbiased information source, though even it is only basing data on a sample survey.",

Oh wait, that might explain a few things !\n \n When your government is chasing weapons of mass destruction around the world, they needn't look further than their own backyard to see how much destruction lax gun laws have caused !!!\n\n \n First, if you're going to quote someone, please read the quote before commenting on it. He had said that there was an increase in \"overall crime\". You then proceeded to say he was wrong because there was a drop in \"gun crime\". Overall crime and gun crime are two completely different statistics.\n \n As for the fear thing...there are many driving forces other than fear that lead to someone being prudent (in my case, logic is the driving force). Even though I feel safe in the assumption that I will most likely never need to rely on my guns for protection, I still consider it prudent to be prepared for such an occurance. If I never end up needing it, the worst thing that happens is that I wasted some money (although, I do enjoy target shooting, so I wouldnt really call it a waste). If I need it and dont have it though, then I, or another innocent person(s), may end up dead.\n \n Also, I find it odd that you claim that we are made afraid of everything and everyone, yet you seem afraid of an armed populace. If that isn't fearing everyone, then I'm not sure what is.",
