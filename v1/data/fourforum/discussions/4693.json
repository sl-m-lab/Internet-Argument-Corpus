But I assume that the rest of the family(i.e. her side of the family) presented eveidence to the court as well, and a judge had to rule between the two views ?\n\n Yes and no. This was a very curious case almost from the beginning. At first, the husband and her parents went through extraordinary measures to get help for Terri. That lasted until just after Terri was awarded over $1Million in a malpractice lawsuit and her husband was awarded $600k for his loss of consortium. After that, things deteriorated quickly. Michael stopped all attempts at therapy and issued a \"do not resusitate\" order for his wife. he forbid his in-laws from seeing Terri's medical records or allowing any doctors in that he didn't first approve. From there things snowballed downhill until it became public in 1998.\n \n\n If this is the case and it has went through multiple courts don't you think it was right decisions under \"law\" ?\n\n I really can't answer that truthfully because I don't think that we have ever heard all of the facts. With the husband forbidding any medical assessments of his wife after 1992, we really don't know her condition with any degree of certainty. And much has been made of the numerous court cases and their same conclusion, but few people took the time to look at the issues that were being contested. The bulk of the court cases involved procedural matters and not Terri's condition. For example, early in the proceedings one judge ruled that the only the husband had rights regarding Terri's treatment. He, essentially slammed the door on any chance of Terri having her own advocate. Numerous trials after that never revisited that decision; it was always taken as fact in subsequent court cases. Congress finally stepped in and wrote a law granting the Federal District Court jurisdiction over the case and instructed the District Court to do a de novo investigation of the facts surrounding Terri Schiavo' case. In other words, Congress told the court to start fresh and not use prior decisions as the basis for their determination. They instructed the court to investigate all potential violations of Terri's rights regardless of prior court decisions. The District Court failed to carry out that duty. \n \n\n Does that not worry you guys ? you guys broke away from the Mother Country :D to get away from interference from Government in personal lives.\n\n And we also created a government that had \"fairness\" as one of its major precepts. In this instance, the idea of \"fairness\" was being trampled and it brought with it the ire of the nation. Congress felt compelled to act and it did.\n In the final analysis, maybe Terri should have been allowed to die, not by starvation though, but there was just too much deception and manipulation on the part of Michael Schiavo's part for me to feel comfortable with the outcome. Had he truly been an advocate for her, open to specialist visits, therapy, testing, etc., and the experts come to a consesus that there was no quality of life, the decision to end her life would have been an unquestioned one done in private. What should have been a joint decision to either hold on or allow her to die, based on facts, became a human tug-of-war based on emotions and that's the saddest epitaph that I can think of. :(",

I cannot speak for the situation between Mike and Terris family, but as one speaking from experience, I know family feuds can get very bad . But, when it comes to the end of a family members life, and I am not talking family by marriage, I am talking family by blood, it is time to bury the feud and show some decency, at least until the event is over with. Terri was that mothers child, born of her womb, raised with all the love, trials and tribulations it takes to raise a child. ... \n \n \n Mike S. was just another male prowling the streets looking for a receptacle for his manhood. A total stranger to Terri, and to anyone else that mattered in her life. Then, one day this stranger met Terri, and by having a courtship with her, getting a license, and having a legal ceremony of joining the two as one, Terri became the sole poccession of the husband and her blood family became nothing . Sad fact of life. Yes , that is the way the law stands, even in our state. ...\n \n But that is NOT the way it should end up for family to have to part with their child. All of the years of anguish of having to see their brain damaged child should have been punishment enough for Terris parents. Now, after death, they have to watch their daughter be cremated ( wasnt Terri catholic ?) and ashes hidden. All they asked for was a grave for their daughter Terri, so they could visit her site, but instead her ashes are going to a hidden place. The sad part is supposed to be over for her family now, but not so, this ending will burn in their hearts until they quit beating. I believe in the old adage of \" What goes around ,comes around\" .
