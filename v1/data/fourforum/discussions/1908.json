   "I'm having some trouble with girls at school, can anyone give me some tips on what they like and don't like, etc.?\n\n \n You need to sneak into the girls restroom at school. No, I'm not suggesting voyeurism, if that's what you were thinking. ;) You need to find the book. The book is a manual contained in all womens bathrooms, it is entitled \"How to Make Men's Lives Difficult\". \n \n Although no documented proof of this book has ever been presented by men, we are sure that it exists. Look at some of the facts. \n \n 1. Girls and boys seem to get along until about the time when we learn how to read. Before this, we are all buddies. After this, it seems that boys and girls take rather different paths. This is about the time that girls start to look at boys differently, giggling at them, and constantly whispering. It is theorized that they are laughing and whispering about things that they have read in the book, and coming to the realization that the book is correct. \n \n 2. Girls usually go to the bathroom in pairs. Simple. They are reading and quizing each other on the book. It is important for women to maintain good working knowledge of the book, and quizing one another keeps their knowledge sharp. It is also suggested that there is some roleplaying type exercises at the end of each chapter, where girls can take turns playing the roles of men. This allows the other girl to practice talking to boys / men and learn how to make any man feel like an idiot. I'm sure all men at one point or another have been humiliated by a girl / woman...it is universal.\n \n 3. How many bald women do you see? Bald men are a staple crop in American culture. Bald women are rare. It must be that women have the cure to hair loss in the book. Those who are follicaly challenged have an especially great interest in getting this information.\n \n 4. Controlling men / getting their way with tears. How many women do you know that have gotten out of speeding tickets simply by whiping up a few tears? Or how many times do men give in to a womans desires simply out of frustration after she turns the tear factory on? It is vital that men become educated on this subject.\n \n Other subjects covered in the book include: PMS (how to use it to your advantage), the art of makeup (this is why so many girls leave the house in the morning without makeup on, and miraculously have it on by second period at school), the art of hairstyling, memory tricks for remembering insignificant details (anniversaries, birthdays, first kisses, etc...), selective hearing, why women should watch romantic comedies and shows like Little House on the Prairie etc..., and lastly how to print and write neatly. \n \n There is much more in the book, and it is vital that we as men take a stand, and demand to be given access to this book. Until this happens, it is clear that men will never have a good understanding of women. emoticon_xclown",

What exactly are you having a problem talking to them about? Remember one thing, and it will carry you farther than any other advice you will ever hear about women. They are people, just like you. Talk to them and treat them as such, the rest will fall into place in due time. You should have no problem talking to girls the same as you talk to other boys. Now of course, you can't tell jokes like you would in the locker room with the guys, that might be innapropriate. Just talk to them and treat them like everyone else. And remember, being shy or timid around girls is normal for adolescent boys, but by just simply being yourself, you can overcome this easily.

I find it usually helps to not take things too seriously when it comes to girls. Too much analyzing makes you go nuts.

   "All girls want is to be treated specially and loved for who they are. Honestly, by being romantic (write her a song or a poem, etc.) you can win her.\n\n \n That's all well and good, if you already have a relationship going on with a girl. I don't think going up to a girl you're meeting for the first time and telling her you saw her across the room and wrote a sonnet about her is going to do a whole lot. My advice is:\n 1) Don't fear rejection. You're a guy. Guys like girls (if all turns out right), so what's the worse that could happen, someone making fun of you for being normal? \"Loser, you like chicks! What a freak!\" Uhh, don't see that happening. And if you are rejected, the sun is still going to rise tomorrow and it'll be a new day.\n 2) Be yourself. You mentioned wanting to know about being funny and what to talk about. Well if you have any skills in making friends, you know how to. It's that simple. Don't walk up to a girl with the intent of sweeping her off her feet. Approach her like a friend and go from there.\n 3) Don't put on a show. DO NOT OVERDO IT! I can't say that enough. Be yourself and don't worry about who you're trying to impress. Just play it cool playa...\n \n That's about it. I'm all out of my little pearls of wisdom. I wish you the best in overcoming your inhibitions and take charge. Remember this if anything.

Easier said than done, I know. --Do NOT try to change vocabulary... please! I know it sounds funny, but don't all of a sudden start inserting or leaving out words you'd normally (not) use.

You talk to your family, neigbors, friends, teachers ect.. Seems to me that talking to girls is really no different. I saw this book on Amazon.com some time ago title \"How to Talk to Women\" and it occured to me, here are a couple of authors claiming expertise in communication with the opposite sex and they needed around 300 pages. Now I don't why anybody needs 300 pages to teach the art of communication when anyone reading that book has been communicating to so many people in their lives since about the age of 2. Sometimes the best thing you can do is ask questions. You want to know something about the girl, ask her. The thing to keep in mind is you don't want to ask about anything personal or private. That should be off limits. But say you are interested in music. Ask her what kind of music she likes and tell her what you enjoy. That gets a conversation going and will lead to other conversation topics of interest to the both of you. Does this help?",

To avoid being nervous, focus on the moment. Be positive! Look for things in her you like, not things you MIGHT not like. \n \n 2) Don't let on that you doubt yourself (we all do). When speaking about yourself, talk about what you enjoy. Stay away from what you have accomplished. There is a fine line between confident and cocky. Find the line and try not to cross it.\n \n 3) Don't dominate the conversation. Let her create a topic, if she isn't too nervous. Think of things you want to know about her and ask.\n \n 4) When you get old enough to get serious (I was 19 and in college), don't think the girls are innocent. Like it or not (I miss old-time values) women today are as sexually active (or more) than the men. \n \n 5) Get to know the girls first! Rewarding relationships begin as friendships and move on to different levels. IMO, rewarding relationships don't begin with sex. \n \n 6) Get to like yourself.
